MILAN/SYDNEY (Reuters) - World stocks hit a record high on Monday and the dollar stayed weak as expectations of better global trade ties and more monetary stimulus under U.S. President-elect Joe Biden supported risk appetite.
Markets started to trade on the prospect of a Biden presidency and a Republican-controlled U.S. Senate last week, but the Democratic candidate's projected victory on Saturday gave more fuel to the move.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, rose 0.5% to a record high in early European hours. On Friday, it posted its biggest one-week gain in nearly seven months.
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 jumped more than 1.4% on Monday. Nasdaq futures rallied more than 2% to just under a record high, signalling a positive start for U.S. markets.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside of Japan jumped 1.3% after hitting its highest since January 2018. The pan-Europe STOXX 600 climbed 1.5% to one-month highs by 0846 GMT.
""Why the excitement? Hopes of less diplomatic and trade angst, a lower dollar helps global rebalancing,"" Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James in London said in a note. ""A lot of hope... but over two months until inauguration day!""
Equities rallied last week, with the S&P 500 up 7.3%, clocking the best gain in an election week since 1932, according to National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) analyst Tapas Strickland.
Investors expect Republicans to maintain control of the Senate, making it harder for a Biden administration to push through major policy changes, from a planned tax hike to a big fiscal stimulus package. 
That would mean better earnings prospects for companies exposed to the world's largest economy but also that the U.S. Federal Reserve might have to step in to further ease monetary conditions and support a pandemic-hit economy. 
The United States saw a record number of new coronavirus infections last week, with the total number of cases nearing 10 million. 
Matt Sherwood of Australian fund manager Perpetual, however, said Biden's win did not necessarily warrant a tweaking of his portfolio.
""In the end, we think the U.S. economy is still fairly fragile and growth's slowing down,"" Sherwood said.
""You could potentially gravitate your portfolio more towards higher-beta type markets, such as emerging markets, and there is potential for better prospects in the energy space than would have been the case with a Democrat clean sweep.""
Oil prices jumped on Monday as investors greeted the prospect of a Biden victory, shrugging off worries about lacklustre demand amid rising global coronavirus cases. Brent crude added nearly $1 to $40.35.
Analysts said the outlook might get tougher from here as investors focus on Biden's ability to expand fiscal stimulus and measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. 
U.S.-based wealth manager Jim Wilding at Confluence Financial Partners in Pennsylvania added a word of caution considering the S&P 500 is not far from record highs and equity valuations are generally at heady levels.
""While we remain positive over the intermediate-term outlook and believe divided government reduces the chances of a bear case scenario playing out, we would refrain from unbridled enthusiasm at current levels,"" he said. 
Expectations that monetary policy in the U.S. will remain easy and global trade relations improve has weakened the dollar in recent days. It posted its biggest weekly loss in more than seven months on Friday.
The dollar index was just above its lowest in around 10 weeks, up 0.1%, while growth and trade proxies such as the Australian dollar and the Chinese yuan remained in demand. The Aussie reached a seven-week high, up 0.4%, and China's yuan struck a 28-month high.

The euro, which climbed 1.9% last week, was unchanged. Sterling was also flat as the focus turned to Brexit trade negotiations coming to a head with the EU summit on Nov. 15.

SYDNEY/LONDON (Reuters) - Investors expecting an imminent COVID-19 vaccine are beginning to buy bank stocks and industrials in anticipation of a roaring return in consumer confidence, though many remain wary of risks in sectors ravaged by the pandemic.
The development of some kind of preventative medicine is seen as the best chance of halting the coronavirus, which has killed 1.2 million people and is the top issue for money managers eyeing the next major shift in financial markets.
As the market hype around the U.S. election ebbs, investors are now preparing for good vaccine news, which they believe is a matter of when, not if.
""It's going to be absolutely massive,"" said Stuart Oakley, head of cash currency trading at Nomura in London. ""If we get a vaccine, we're going to see all that pent up demand coming out.""
Of the roughly 45 vaccines undergoing human trials, those from  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and  Moderna  (O:MRNA) are seen as possibly winning regulatory approval this year, with AstraZeneca (L:AZN) not far behind.
Investors are looking beyond an expected ""excitement rally"" and at longer-term beneficiaries and short-selling opportunities.
""What we've done is given ourselves some optionality for a recovery trade, or a vaccine trade, by having some exposure to financials,"" said Binay Chandgothia, a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager at Principal Global Investors.
Banks benefit from increased economic activity and would be helped if bond yields rose, he said, adding he had increased exposure to growth-sensitive small companies and would buy stocks in Singapore and Hong Kong if trade and travel pick up.
Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management in Wisconsin, said industrials offered broad exposure to a rebound in confidence in areas from building products to aviation.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) manages a ""vaccine basket"" of Singapore dollars and Thai baht, seen benefitting from increased trade and tourism, against the Philippine peso, which is weighed by rising imports.
Financials <.dMIWO0FN00PUS> and industrials (MIWO0IN00PUS) have gained with the broader market this month, but badly lag a roughly 5% gain in world stocks (MIWO00000PUS) this year. The baht has also surged recently against the peso (PHPTHB=R).
THREAD THE NEEDLE
Investors are also setting up short positions.
Shinji Naito at Japan's SPARX Asset Management, which has $12 billion under management, hopes a vaccine could trigger a payoff from shorts in stocks pumped up by the pandemic, such as some technology firms, while helping long investments such as realtor Tokyo Tatemono (T:8804).
Dave Wang, a portfolio manager at Nuvest Capital in Singapore, said long-short pairs could wring gains from what is likely to be an uneven recovery.
For example, airports, which charge per aircraft regardless of their loads, could perform better than airlines hit by low patronage and rising fuel costs.
Of course, not everyone is scrambling for a piece of the action amid questions about the timing, efficacy and distribution of any vaccine still remaining.
""You're better off being a bit too late than too early,"" said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Funds Management in Sydney, noting delays would leave under-pressure companies needing to raise more money quickly.
Others, however, feel it is now safe to bet on a global rebound, which a vaccine would boost.

""I think there's two different trades,"" said Sean Taylor, chief investment officer in Asia for German fund manager DWS. ""A vaccine trade and a cyclical trade. I'm more positioning in cyclicals,"" he said. ""If we got much more credible data for vaccines, then I'd add services.""

Investing.com - European stock markets posted strong gains Monday, after Joe Biden claimed victory in the U.S. presidential election over the weekend, ending months of uncertainty that has roiled financial markets.
At 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.9% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.6%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 1.4%.
Democrat candidate Joe Biden took the 270 electoral college votes required for victory in the U.S. presidential race on Saturday by winning the battleground state of Pennsylvania, seemingly putting to an end a tight and highly-charged election.
President Donald Trump, the first incumbent to lose a re-election bid in 28 years, has not conceded so far, but will find it difficult to overturn the results with allegations of voting fraud that have so far not gained traction in any court.
Republicans appear to have retained control of the Senate, though the final makeup may not be clear until runoff votes in Georgia in January.
Biden is “promising major spending increases, notably in healthcare, education and infrastructure projects. We also could be looking at major tax and regulatory changes. However, if Congress remains in Republican hands, we could see many of these policies watered down,” said ING’s James Knightley, in a research note.
In corporate news, Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) stock rose 3.4% after the German chipmaker offered up strong guidance, forecasting that revenue would grow by nearly 23% in the year ahead. This has overshadowed a cut in its dividend.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) stock rose 2.6% after the French bank announced plans to cut costs, including cutting 640 jobs in France, mainly at its investment-banking operations.
On the flip side, Norwegian Air (OL:NORR) stock slumped over 20% after the Norwegian government said it will not provide additional financial support for the cash-strapped airline, leaving it again on the verge of bankruptcy.
The coronavirus, and the associated travel restrictions, is the main reason the airline is in difficulty, and its sudden growth remains a major market headwind, both in Europe and America. 
Europe also has Brexit to deal with, as the Nov. 15 deadline for a trade deal between Britain and the European Union draws ever closer. Major differences over the so-called level playing field rules for business and access to British fishing waters still exist.
Oil prices surged Monday, with Biden’s victory in the U.S. presidential race buoying risk appetites as traders look for a larger coronavirus relief package, offsetting worries about the impact on demand from a worsening pandemic.
U.S. crude futures traded 2.3% higher at $37.99 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.9% to $40.20, recovering after losing 4% on Friday.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,958.10/oz, but remained on course for its biggest weekly gain since July, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1867.

The bank has taken a provision of $79.7 million to cover expected fines after agreeing in principal to a three-year deferred prosecution agreement. Julius Baer said it expects a final resolution of the matter ""shortly.""
Switzerland's third largest private bank said it had been cooperating with the DOJ since 2015 in the agency's investigation of alleged money laundering and corruption involving officials and affiliates of FIFA and associated sports media and marketing companies. 
The affair is a holdover from the era of former Chief Executive Boris Collardi, who is now at Geneva private bank and asset manager Pictet.
Julius Baer was heavily criticised earlier this year by Switzerland’s financial supervisor FINMA for ignoring money laundering risks of FIFA-linked payments.
An ex-banker was convicted in 2017 in U.S. District Court of conspiracy charges for arranging payments from a sports marketing executive to the Argentine soccer association’s president.

Since 2016, the bank said it has addressed the shortcomings identified in its operations, including by redocumenting each of its client relationships and ending its dealings with some customers.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Monday morning in Asia, continuing their gains as Democrat Joe Biden cinched victory in the state of Pennsylvania on Sunday, winning the U.S. presidential election against incumbent president Donald Trump.
Biden now has the 270 electoral votes with the Pennsylvania victory, Trump is refusing to concede and continuing with legal actions to contest the election results. However, stocks rose in Asia heading towards their best week since April, with increased investor risk appetite leading to gains of more than 7%.
“Markets will probably judge this as no longer a contested election, that a delay even of the election result is not there either … the first order of business Monday morning will really be about reassessing what the policy will be under a Biden presidency in terms of domestic and foreign policy,” Ben Emons, managing director of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors, told Bloomberg.
Some investors struck a more cautious note, including Perpetual’s Matt Sherwood who said Biden’s victory would not necessarily warrant a tweaking of his portfolio.
“In the end, we think the U.S. economy is still fairly fragile and growth’s slowing down. You could potentially gravitate your portfolio more towards higher-beta type markets, such as emerging markets, and there is potential for better prospects in the energy space than would have been the case with a Democrat clean sweep,” he added.
The incessant rise of COVID-19 cases also dampened the mood. The number of cases in the U.S. is close to topping 10 million, with over 50 million cases reported worldwide as of Nov. 9, according to Johns Hopkins University data. With over 126,000 daily new cases reported for a third consecutive day in the U.S., investors’ focus will remain on the global economic recovery.
Biden is currently preparing a plan to curb the number of cases as part of the transition effort and will announce his COVID-19 task force later in the day.
Also on investors’ minds is whether the U.S. will pass the latest stimulus measures, and in what form, with four races for the Senate yet to be called and uncertainty over which party has the majority.
“While we remain positive over the intermediate term outlook and believe divided government reduces the chances of a bear case scenario playing out, we would refrain from unbridled enthusiasm at current levels,” Confluence Financial Partners wealth manager Jim Wilding told Reuters.
Should a divided Senate emerge, it would create more work for the Federal Reserve as the Democrat agenda on taxes or regulations is thwarted.
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan is also due to speak later in the day, with the central bank announcing the continuation of a soft monetary policy during the previous week. Across the Atlantic, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and chief economist Andy Haldane are due to speak later in the day, with the speeches expected to be monitored closely over the prospect of negative rates.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) said on Monday it had opened three more logistics centers in Brazil to take advantage of the boost the COVID-19 pandemic has given to e-commerce in South America's largest economy.
The new units are already operating in the states of Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul and the capital city of Brasilia. They increase the number of Amazon logistics centers in Brazil to eight, expanding its reach to all corners of the vast country.
The expansion, which adds 75,000 square meters (807,000 square feet) of distribution space, is Amazon's biggest since it began operating in Brazil in 2012. It will create 1,500 direct jobs, the company said in a statement.
Alex Szapiro, Amazon's chief executive in Brazil, said the new centers will allow the company to immediately raise the number of cities where Amazon Prime customers can receive deliveries within two business days to over 500 from 400.
""Brazil is the country with the fastest growth in Amazon Prime subscriptions,"" Szapiro told Reuters, referring to the company's loyalty program, which was launched in Brazil in September last year.
In recent months, thousands of Brazilian businesses have migrated to e-commerce platforms as a result of social distancing measures and lockdown measures.
Despite the gradual easing of the measures, the migration to digital sales has continued.
Last week,  MercadoLibre  (NASDAQ:MELI) Inc, Latin America's e-commerce leader, announced that its net revenue in the region soared nearly 150% in the third quarter, measured in local currencies.
MercadoLibre's operation in Brazil, which accounts for more than half of its total business, more than doubled.

Other companies in Brazil, including Via Varejo, GPA and Magazine Luiza, are buying up logistics startups to ride the same e-commerce wave.

14,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 08, 2020 07:45PM ET</span>",S&P 500 Futures Jump in First Trading Since Biden Captured Vote,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. equities resumed last week’s upward march, advancing at the open of futures trading in New York Sunday night, as traders pressed bets that President-Elect Joe Biden will bring steadier stewardship of the American economy.
Bulls picked up where they left off in the best week for U.S. share indexes since April, undaunted by some of the highest equity valuations in two decades and the resurgent coronavirus. Up four of the last five days, the S&P 500 sits 2% away from the record it set at the start of September.
Risk markets consistently found something to celebrate throughout a chaotic final week of the election process, as odds shifted from a blue wave sweep to Donald Trump’s favor and then to Biden, who declared himself victorious amid signs his party will fail to take the Senate. Resilience in the S&P 500 is all the more impressive considering the gauge sits at more than 27 times annual earnings, a valuation with virtually no precedent since the dot-come bubble.
“More fiscal support is likely forthcoming. While it may not be the outsize fiscal package that the Democrats had envisioned, it will likely be large enough to provide an additional boost to the economic recovery,” Invesco strategists including Brian Levitt wrote in a note. “Paradoxically, a more modest fiscal bill may serve to extend the market and business cycles, as it would be unlikely to bring forward the inflationary pressures that presage Fed tightening and the end of cycles.”
Contracts on the S&P 500 rose 0.9% as of 6:33 p.m. in New York. The underlying index rallied 7.3% last week in the biggest advance since April. Nasdaq 100 futures jumped 1.2%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average contracts gained 0.7%.
With odds pointing to a divided government, investors saw hopes dashed that Congress would pass a multitrillion-dollar spending package to boost the economy. But bulls turned to the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell, looking for continued support that’s been critical to the rebound from the pandemic-fueled slowdown.
Powell reassured markets during last week’s political drama that the central bank remains at the ready should Washington fail to deliver the aid package many agree is needed. And that buttressed markets that, given the choice between a broad package of economic aid and targeted Fed liquidity support, would always choose the latter due to its benefits for asset prices.
At the same time, the rising threat to the economy from the rapidly spreading coronavirus remains a market headwind. The pandemic outlook continued to worsen over the weekend, with the accelerating surge in U.S. cases helping to take the global total past 50 million. In the U.S., cases neared 10 million. While Biden’s election victory is likely to lead to more aggressive steps to contain the virus from Washington policy makers, any changes will take time to have a noticeable effect on transmission levels after he is sworn in as president in January.
“Covid has replaced election uncertainty as the major source of investor worries about equity markets,” Dennis DeBusschere at Evercore ISI wrote in a note. “Further positive vaccine development news would help offset some of the increase in hospitalizations and deaths.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Sunday after President-elect Joe Biden was declared the winner on in a highly contentious election.
Biden's victory in Pennsylvania on Saturday put him above the 270 Electoral College votes needed to secure the presidency, four days after Election Day, although President Donald Trump does not plan to concede anytime soon.
S&P 500 e-mini futures were up 34.5 points, or 0.99%, Dow e-minis <1YMcv1> were up 277 points, or 0.98%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 147.25 points, or 1.22%.
Shares in Asia were modestly higher, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside of Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) up 0.36% after a 6.2% gain in the prior week, its best weekly performance in 5 months.
U.S. stocks closed Friday's session little changed, but each of the three major indexes still managed to notch their biggest weekly percentage gains since April, in part due to the belief Congress will remain divided even as control of the Senate is still undecided.
""Although the President has not conceded and there was concern regarding legal challenges, prominent Republicans, including former President (George W.) Bush in essence publicly called the election and the market has embraced the election results too,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
""The market is up and it looks as if we're going go continue.""
With the S&P 500 (SPX) sitting just 2% from its Sept. 2 closing record, headwinds remain for equities, including a surge in coronavirus cases that could lead to fresh government lockdowns, with total U.S. cases approaching 10 million.
A fiscal stimulus package to combat the economic damage done by the coronavirus is also less likely to be broad. While U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell last week indicated he desired a bill by the end of the year, he said on Friday that economic statistics show Congress should enact a smaller plan.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is ready to start talks with major airlines this week about financial assistance to the hard-hit sector that could come in the form of loans or other support, Transport Minister Marc Garneau said on Sunday.
The government is drafting a package of measures for Canadian airlines, airports and the aerospace sector, Garneau said in a statement, confirming an exclusive story last week by Reuters. 
""As part of this package, we are ready to establish a process with major airlines regarding financial assistance which could include loans and potentially other support to secure important results for Canadians,"" Garneau said. 
He said it would ensure that regional communities would retain their connections to the rest of Canada, the world's second-largest country by area, and added that ""strict conditions"" would come with any aid. 
Garneau also said Canada would not spend ""one penny of taxpayer money on airlines"" until Canadians received refunds for flights that were canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.
While several countries, including the United States and Australia, have offered billions in direct emergency support to their airlines, Canada has not. 
 Air Canada  (TO:AC) and WestJet, the two main carriers, and transport unions have been pleading for help for months as passenger demand cratered.
Air Canada has already laid off around 20,000 workers, about half its workforce. According to the Canadian Airports Council, Canadian passenger traffic from April through August was down 92% from the same period in 2019.

""The air sector cannot respond to these challenges on its own, given the unprecedented impacts on its operations,"" Garneau said.

17,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2020 04:12PM ET</span>",Homebound workers inject life into suburban malls after downtowns empty out,"By Nichola Saminather and Victoria Waldersee
TORONTO/LISBON (Reuters) - As the coronavirus pandemic rages and most downtown office employees in many cities work from home at least through year-end, urban retailers' loss is turning out to be suburban shopping centres' gain. 
For many years, downtown malls have been more profitable, attracting office-goers and tourists congregating in city centres, while suburban malls have been relegated to the role of poor relations.
The coronavirus pandemic is turning that on its head.
""A lot of people who used to commute to downtowns on a daily basis are not anymore,"" said Tim Sanderson, head of Canadian retail at real estate services firm JLL in Toronto. ""Where are they getting dry cleaning done, picking up dinner? ... They're doing it in their suburban shopping centre.""
Traffic in Canadian suburban malls owned by Cadillac Fairview, the property unit of Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, is now at more than 70% of pre-pandemic levels, while less than half of shoppers have returned to its downtown malls, Executive Vice President of Operations Sal Ianoco told Reuters. 
The same story reverberates around the globe.
In the UK, foot traffic was down 40% and 34.6%, respectively, in high streets and shopping centres in mid-October compared with a year earlier, while retail parks saw a decline of only 13.2% from last year, data from analytics firm Springboard showed.
While mall owners with both urban and suburban locations are expected to weather the hit from the pandemic, already-beleaguered retailers in downtown shopping centres face much bleaker prospects. 
With the crucial year-end holiday shopping season looming and few shoppers expected to turn up at downtown malls, the surge in permanent store closures and bankruptcies already seen this year is likely to worsen. 
Jaap Tonckens, chief financial officer of Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, Europe's largest property owner, told Reuters the group is ""absolutely"" seeing local malls do better than downtown counterparts. 
German mall operator ECE, which runs nearly 200 shopping centres across Europe, said that while footfall has returned to around 90% of last year's levels in neighbourhood locations, city centre malls remain at around two-thirds. 
""The coronavirus crisis is acting like a fire accelerator to the problems of downtown areas,"" including falling rents and rising prices and labour costs, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said last month.
EERILY QUIET 
The return of office staff has been ""much slower than we thought,"" Toronto Mayor John Tory told Reuters, flagging the continued risk to downtown retail businesses as workers and tourists stay away as the holidays approach.
""Obviously public health has to come first, but anything they can be doing to have people return to work will help the viability of those businesses,"" Tory said.
At lunchtime on a Friday before a long weekend, Cadillac Fairview's landmark  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Centre in downtown Toronto, North America's busiest mall before the pandemic, remained eerily quiet.
A few shoppers wandered through, but at most stores, staff outnumbered customers despite large discounts. Its eateries, which had had lines spilling out their doors before the outbreak, were deserted. 
At Fairview and Yorkdale Shopping Centres in the northern Toronto suburb of North York, it was a different story. Despite limited store capacities, weekday shoppers converged on stores from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Zara to Louis Vuitton. 
""Because we're not working in the (downtown Toronto) office ... we just stick around the area that's closer to us,"" Tamara, who declined to provide her last name, told Reuters as she shopped in Yorkdale with her husband.
Within suburbs, outlet malls and unenclosed shopping centers - the former luring cost-conscious shoppers in uncertain economic times, and the latter seen as safer amid the coronavirus outbreak - have fared better than enclosed ones. 
""Traditionally, open-air malls, especially strip malls but even outlet malls, were the poor cousins of big flagship enclosed malls,"" said Karl Littler, senior vice president for public affairs at the Retail Council of Canada. 
""But now, open-air malls are doing better than enclosed malls,"" he said. 
Ed Sonshine, chief executive of  Riocan REIT  (TO:REI_u), Canada's second-largest property trust, said the company's suburban shopping centres - all unenclosed and most anchored by essential businesses like grocery stores - are, in many cases, doing even better than before the pandemic. 
Yorkdale shoppers Tamara and her husband Jason will visit the mall at least once to ""see what the mayhem is,"" they said. 

""But if I see a line up and have to wait to get into the store, I'll turn around and go back and buy online,"" she said.

18,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2020 04:11PM ET</span>",Nissan plots digital course for car sales in a post-pandemic world,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - As COVID-19 threw a wrench into the cogs of car retailing, a senior Nissan (OTC:NSANY) board member challenged the chief operating officer to explain what the automaker was doing to adapt to a new era where customers may be reluctant to roam showrooms.
The operating chief, Ashwani Gupta, told the board meeting in late July that Nissan was racing to create a ""complete, end-to-end digital journey"", according to three people familiar with the discussions.
He said this would allow consumers to research cars online, have models delivered to their homes for test drives and make purchase plans without ever having to visit a dealership, if they chose not to do so, the sources told Reuters.
The meeting offers an insight into how the pandemic is pressuring automakers in all major markets to revamp their strategies to handle more vehicle sales online, veering away from the traditional showroom approach.
The change is being driven by a shift in consumer behaviour.
The number of cars sold via Nissan's websites in China, Europe and North America combined accounted for 11% of the company's overall sales in those markets in the first half of this year, according to the sources, who declined to be named because they are not authorized to speak to reporters.
That compared with 4-5% in the same period last year, although digital volumes were not as closely monitored then, said one of the three people, a senior Nissan executive.
""I would say these new buying behaviours, which have come up during the COVID era, are going to stick and become permanent,"" the executive added. ""The pandemic is changing the way we work, the way we communicate. The same is also true with buying cars."" 
Some of the details and data are expected to be shared during a news conference on Nov. 12 when Nissan announces results for its fiscal second quarter ended Sept 30. Japan's second-largest carmaker has warned of a record 470-billion-yen ($4.5 billion)loss this fiscal year ending March 2021.
A Nissan spokesman in Yokohama said there was strong demand for online shopping, which had become ""irreversible with COVID-19"" and the firm was addressing this in partnership with dealers.
""Nissan's 'Shop at Home' experience puts customers in control at every step of the journey: to choose to shop both online and at physical dealerships,"" he added.
The company's drive is initially focused on North America and China, its biggest markets where digital sales are more advanced than elsewhere, according to the sources. 
In the United States, online customers can search for a specific car from the inventories of all Nissan stores in a given area, not just one store's stock. 
In China, consumers can't do the same, but they are open to buying cars online; in the first nine months of this year, 17% of the roughly 758,000 new Nissan cars sold there were bought online, the sources said. 
They are what Nissan defines as digitally-acquired buyers, who visit the company's main e-commerce sites — Chebaba in China and NissanUSA.com — and leave their contact information, and then complete purchases either completely or partially online.
AKATSUKI COPPER, ANYONE?
Shifting more sales online is, however, a big challenge for the industry because it deviates markedly from the familiar showroom strategy, and could face resistance from franchise dealers, who have a symbiotic relationship with carmakers. 
The stakes are especially high for Nissan, because it was struggling even before the pandemic struck and hammered auto sales. It was grappling with a host of financial woes that resulted from an aggressive expansion pursued by ousted leader Carlos Ghosn, and a consequent lack of new car models.  
The digital drive is viewed by senior executives as being beneficial from a profitability angle because online sales allow the company to reduce operational waste in distributing and marketing cars, and improve data-gathering, two sources said.
For example, this summer Nissan opened a dedicated website for the new Ariya electric sport-utility vehicle, due to be launched globally next year. 
In the first four days, 1.2 million people visited and Nissan learned, as customers gave their preferences, that the most popular features globally were a lounge-like interior and connected services, according to the senior Nissan executive.
In Europe the most favoured colour was a two-tone black and Akatsuki copper option, the person said. 
According to the source, 56% of European visitors preferred the four-wheel-drive version and 18% the two-wheel-drive, while the rest were undecided or did not leave preferences. U.S. customers were more evenly split between the two drive options.
That data allowed Nissan to be more precise in ordering parts and systems for different regions to match demand, said the executive. 
""Marketing for us is increasingly not dictated by gut feeling,"" the person added. ""It's more data-driven and precise.""
'IT'S THE WAY WE LIVE'
Chee-Kiang Lim, China managing director of Detroit-based consultancy Urban Science, said legacy carmakers were lagging pure electric vehicle companies in terms of online sales, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), NIO, XPeng and WM the leading digital players. 
Among traditional automakers, mass-market players like Nissan, Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) are most advanced in China, with concrete initiatives to push online sales, he added. 
""Volkswagen for example has trained their dealers to do live-streaming and they would even do a live-streaming of a test drive. A sales person would be driving a car and live-stream directly to you.""
Another of the Nissan sources, who is close to the board, said the main purpose of the e-sales drive was to reduce the number of dealer visits an average customer makes to buy a car - to one or two, from several. 
Zhang Weichen, a Beijing primary school physical education consultant, bought his first car this summer, a Nissan Sylphy sedan, without visiting a dealer until deep into the process. 
By the time he visited the dealer, to view the actual model he chose and negotiate a final price, the 32-year-old had studied the car by test-driving a friend's Sylphy and using virtual-reality walkarounds available on Nissan's Chebaba, and picked up a purchase rebate coupon for the car on the site. 
""We already buy all sorts of things online. It's the way we live,"" Zhang said. 'If I buy a car again to replace my Sylphy I would do so mostly online again.""
DEALERS DEALT DILEMMA
One big question looms, though: Will dealers who have invested millions of dollars in their showrooms see Nissan's drive as a threat? 
A board member put that to Gupta during the late July meeting, according to two of the people familiar with the discussions. 
In response, Gupta said the new sales model was a hybrid closely coupled to physical dealers and was not an effort to cut franchise stores out or reduce their margins, the people said.
Gupta told the board Nissan needed dealers to deliver cars and provide maintenance and repair services – and that they represented a competitive edge over Tesla and other newcomers who were trying to sell cars directly to consumers without franchise stores, the sources added.
Several franchise store operators in China said in interviews with Reuters that most Nissan dealers were going along with the company's online drive.
""Under the pandemic, customers are very dependent on online channels, and so are dealers,"" said Yin Yufen, general manager of a big Nissan store in the southern city of Guangzhou. 
She said about 30% of people who bought cars from her store came via online in recent months, versus 20% a year before. 
""That's not a problem because we have a final say on price, so it doesn't really affect our profit margins and bonuses.""
Another dealership executive, the head of a large chain, said selling new Nissan cars was such a tough proposition under current conditions that many dealers were happy to hand over more control of the process. 
""Dealers don't want to unnecessarily take on more inventories from Nissan, because we're not making money,"" said the boss, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject. 
""We don't care if Nissan takes more control of the selling process, as long as they give us kind of a fixed margin for service,"" he added. 

""You do whatever you like, Nissan.""

The offer will remain open for acceptance until Nov. 28, GardaWorld said in a statement.
""We are extending our offer for G4S because, despite its past problems and uncertain future, we believe we can turn the business around,"" GardaWorld's Chief Executive Stephan Cretier said.
G4S, one of the world's largest private security firms, had rejected GardaWorld's 190 pence per share offer valuing the company at 2.97 billion pounds ($3.91 billion), calling it ""unattractive and opportunistic"".
GardaWorld said it currently holds about 1.55% of G4S's issued share capital and received acceptances of about 0.16%.
""An acceptance level of 0.16% is consistent with the derisory level of GardaWorld's offer,"" the London-listed company said in response to the offer extension. ""It is not surprising that GardaWorld have therefore been forced to extend their offer period.""

Earlier this month, G4S also rejected a takeover proposal from U.S. rival Allied Universal Security Services, saying that the highly conditional offer of 210 pence per share significantly undervalues the company.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Small caps join market rally but pandemic could derail them,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. small caps joined in the broad market rally in the days after Election Day as investors priced in the likelihood of a divided Washington with Democrat Joe Biden president and Republicans maintaining their Senate majority.
Yet some investors and analysts warned that smaller companies may lose steam as the coronavirus pandemic shows no signs of slowing down. Chief among their concerns: that small-caps will bear the brunt of aggressive measures Biden could adopt to combat the pandemic, without benefiting from a large stimulus bill if Senate Republicans block his efforts there.
Major networks on Saturday declared Biden the winner of the presidential election, offering some certainty after days of conflicting reports about who might run the White House next term.
Democrats could win more sway over the Senate if Georgia's two contested seats go to a January runoff as is now expected. That might lead some investors to price back in the possibility of spending bills that would benefit small-caps.
However, smaller companies remain likely to bear the brunt of the pandemic, which is reaching record levels in the United States.
""A more aggressive response from a President Biden could be a risk for small caps,"" said Sylvia Jablonski, managing director at Direxion. 
""The best scenario for small caps is a full reopening of the economy with manageable levels of COVID before a vaccine comes out and some form of stimulus with a supportive Fed. The worst case is a lot less stimulus than we hoped for with a full shutdown or something close to it,"" she said.
The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks is up 4.8% since Nov. 3, compared with a 6% gain in the large cap S&P 500 index over the same time. Over the last five years, the Russell is up 37.1%, compared with a 67.2% jump in the S&P 500.
U.S. coronavirus cases surged by at least 129,606 on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, the third consecutive record daily increase as the virus sweeps the United States. Twenty of the 50 states reported record increases on Friday, the same as Thursday.
Spiking case counts in Europe have led to reinstatement of economic lockdowns and other restrictions there. France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands have announced new curbs, while U.K. lawmakers voted for a monthlong lockdown.
""The implications of the ongoing second COVID-19 wave in Europe and the third wave in the U.S. remains uncertain and the results of the vaccine trials by the end of this month remain an important catalyst,"" analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) wrote in a note Thursday, recommending that investors remain hedged against a steep decline in U.S. small-caps. 
Small caps may remain volatile in the week ahead as Congress resumes negotiations on a stimulus bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has balked at passing a $2.2 trillion bill supported by House Democrats, but said Nov. 4 that he was open to some support for state and local governments supported by Democrats and that there was a ""need to do it by the end of the year.""
Progression in stimulus talks and the number of coronavirus case counts will likely dictate the path of small cap stocks in the weeks ahead because Biden would not take office for another two months, said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. 
Biden is not going to want to ""spend political capital trying to lock down the country or try to get people to follow a national mask mandate which would be extremely difficult to implement,"" she said, making the risk of broad economic lockdowns ""minimal.""
Small-caps may begin to outperform again in 2021 as new case counts decline and vaccines and other treatments become available, she said. 

""We're going to start to think about this reopening trade again and start to move past the virus,"" she said.

24,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>",Analysis: Dealmakers see divided U.S. government favoring mergers and acquisitions,"By Joshua Franklin, Pamela Barbaglia and Krystal Hu
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Joe Biden's projected win of the U.S. presidency and the Republican Party potentially retaining control of the U.S. Senate could drive a pickup in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) that took a hit amid the COVID-19 pandemic, dealmakers said.
Bankers and lawyers who advise companies on M&A said the outcome, if confirmed, was the best possible for providing the stable economic and regulatory environment that dealmaking needs. They expect that Biden, the Democratic Party candidate, would be more predictable in governing than Republican President Donald Trump, and that a Republican-controlled U.S. Senate would restrain Biden's most interventionist policies.
""This dynamic can be quite conducive to doing deals, because it provides stability,"" said Peter Orszag, who served in the White House under President Barack Obama and now heads the financial advisory arm of investment bank  Lazard Ltd  (N:LAZ). 
""The only caveat is that there is less chance of another big round of stimulus, which would help the macroeconomic outlook, than if Democrats had taken the Senate,"" Orszag added.
All major U.S. TV networks projected Biden would win the presidency on Saturday, though Trump vowed to continue to challenge the outcome in the courts. Two runoff U.S. Senate races in Georgia, which will decide which party will control the upper chamber of Congress, will take place on Jan. 5, with Republicans favored to retain control based on this week's tally. 
Republicans holding a slim majority in the Senate could block large swaths of Biden's legislative and spending agenda, as well as key appointments for his Cabinet and government agencies. 
""Corporate leaders and markets like stability. Gridlock, in its own way, can be seen as a stabilizer, as we saw during the Obama administration,"" said Cary Kochman, co-head of global M&A at  Citigroup  Inc (N:C).
While M&A activity jumped in the third quarter as executives rushed to revisit deals put on hold at the height of the coronavirus outbreak, deal volume globally is down 12% year-to-date to $2.84 trillion, according to data provider Refinitiv. Deal volume involving U.S. companies being acquired is down 32% year-to-date to $1.07 trillion.
Dealmakers said certainty over financial and regulatory policy will be crucial in the coming months to keep M&A going, as a new wave of coronavirus infections spreads across the United States and most of the world. 
""I would venture to say some M&A has been held up under the Trump administration, because Trump could sometimes be unpredictable with his Twitter account,"" said Bill Curtin, global head of M&A at Hogan Lovells.
Had Democrats taken control of Congress, dealmakers said the most disruptive aspects of Biden's agenda would have been tax hikes. Biden has proposed raising the capital gains tax rate from 20% to 39.6% for those making over $1 million. This would have made it more expensive for corporate owners to cash out on their holdings.
""Deals won't be so much tax-driven, as Biden is not expected to immediately be able to carry out huge reforms in the U.S. corporate tax or healthcare systems,"" said Patrick Sarch, a partner at law firm White & Case LLP.
BARRIERS TO CHINESE ACQUISITIONS TO STAY
Scrutiny of Chinese takeovers of U.S. companies, which intensified under Trump, is expected to continue, dealmakers said. In the last four years, the United States blocked many Chinese acquisitions, especially of U.S. technology firms, on national security grounds, and even ordered some Chinese firms, such as the owners of social media apps TikTok and Grindr, to divest them.
Deep U.S. suspicion of China's economic power, technological advances and accounting standards will likely result in many of the hurdles to cross-border investments remaining in place under Biden, dealmakers said.
""The nationalistic focus and the high degree of scrutiny on sensitive deals that has emerged in recent years will not disappear anytime soon,"" said Nestor Paz-Galindo, global co-head of M&A at UBS Group AG (S:UBSG).
One corporate sector that could be a major beneficiary of the election outcome is the oil and gas industry, dealmakers said. Low energy prices have fueled a wave of consolidation in the oil patch in recent weeks, and this could continue unhindered as Republicans curtail Biden's clean energy agenda.

""You are going to see some pop in valuations in the energy sector. The market will feel that a Republican Senate will hold back Biden from regulating the U.S. energy sector as much as he might have,"" said Vito Sperduto, global M&A co-head at Royal Bank of Canada (TO:RY).

Flynn told Congress last month he expects Amtrak's revenue to fall by more than 70% from pre-coronavirus levels in 2021, as it considers new sweeping cuts and says it needs up to $2.9 billion in additional U.S. support.
Flynn said Amtrak looks forward to working with Biden, a regular Amtrak rider for decades who has a train station named after him in Wilmington in his home state of Delaware.
U.S. transit and airline demand has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic. Congress had considered but did not provide another $25 billion to airlines in October that would have kept at least 32,000 workers on payrolls.
Major airlines are considered making a new push for assistance when Congress takes up the issue again, but declined to comment on Saturday after U.S. television networks declared Democrat Biden the winner of the presidential election over Republican incumbent Donald Trump.
Mass transit systems want $32 billion in federal assistance. Biden has vowed to provide U.S. cities with 100,000 or more residents ""high-quality, zero-emissions public transportation options"" by 2030.
U.S. automakers also promised to work with Biden, who has pledged to spend billions of dollars to add 500,000 electric charging stations, fund battery research and to restore the full $7,500 EV tax credit for buyers of Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and General Motors Co (N:GM) vehicles that has expired.
Automakers may clash with Biden over the fate of fuel efficiency requirements through 2025 and penalties for not meeting mandates.
GM said on Saturday it looks forward to working with his administration and Congress to ""advance our vision of an all-electric, zero-emissions future.""
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) said it looks forward to working with Biden and the new Congress ""to strengthen the automotive industry and build a more secure future for our employees, customers and society.""
Biden wants to help cities invest in ""e-scooters and other micro-mobility vehicles and integrate technologies like machine-learning optimized traffic lights,"" and wants Congress to approve a big infrastructure package next year.

Biden also backs providing incentives for consumers to trade less efficient vehicles for U.S.-built electric vehicles and tax breaks for automakers and parts manufacturers to build or retool factories for EVs.

26,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2020 09:15PM ET</span>",Investors celebrate Biden winning U.S. presidency,"By Lewis Krauskopf, Koh Gui Qing and Lawrence Delevingne
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors and financial executives took a big sigh of relief on Saturday after major networks declared Democrat Joe Biden winner of the U.S. presidential election, offering some certainty after days of conflicting reports about who might run the White House next term.
Although current President Donald Trump said he would fight the results in court, Wall Streeters who offered comments felt there was little doubt Biden would ultimately succeed. Election predictors including the Associated Press, NBC, Fox News and Edison Research, upon which Reuters relies, called the presidency for Biden.
""Biden is good news for the markets,"" Christopher Stanton, chief investment officer at Sunrise Capital Partners, said on Saturday. ""We're all so tired of the whipsaw that came with the Trump tweets.""
Major U.S. stock indexes registered their biggest weekly gains since April this week, as investors bet Biden would win and Republicans would hold onto the Senate. That scenario would create a steadier hand in the Oval Office and a Congress that would check left-leaning impulses on taxes or regulations that pinch companies, investors said.
However, there are lingering risks to asset prices in the days and weeks ahead.
Republicans have already filed several lawsuits over ballot counting and Trump said his campaign will file more. The litigation could drag out election proceedings.
Investor focus also now turns to the Senate, which remains undecided ahead of two runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5. The significance of those races, which could potentially end up with the Democrats controlling all three of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives, means January is ""the new November"" in terms of election volatility risk, Michael Purves, founder and CEO of Tallbacken Capital, said in a note to clients. Purves said that was evident when looking at contracts for the stockmarket's fear gauge, the VIX (VIX), stretching out into the months ahead.
Beyond those battles, investors have been worried about the people Biden might appoint to his Cabinet. Some of those officials would be negotiating with Congress about a relief package and have extensive powers to craft Wall Street rules.
Current U.S. Federal Reserve governor and former McKinsey consultant Lael Brainard's name has been floated as a potential Treasury Secretary, while Biden has already tapped former derivatives market regulator and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) banker Gary Gensler for advice on financial regulation.
For the moment, investors and prominent Wall Street figures said they were happy with the election finally being called after what seemed like unending tension as ballots were counted through the week.
""Now is a time for unity,"" JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement. ""We must respect the results of the U.S. presidential election and, as we have with every election, honor the decision of the voters and support a peaceful transition of power.""
Leon Cooperman, a billionaire former hedge fund manager who had previously criticized Democrats said he was pleased with the results.
""It's a signal to the world that America has not changed its values,"" said Cooperman, of Omega Family Office. ""That's a good thing in my view.""
Robert Wolf, a major Democratic donor and former UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) executive who now runs 32 Advisors, was enthusiastic: ""I am ecstatic, relieved and deeply hopeful for the future of this country,"" he said in a text message.
Billionaire investor Bill Ackman wrote on Twitter: ""There comes a time in the battle when one should fold the tent,"" and urged: ""Concede graciously and call for unity."" 
The financial industry was not reacting in a bubble: major cities from New York to San Francisco erupted in celebration on Saturday. Though Trump undoubtedly has significant support throughout the country, including on Wall Street, 2020 has been a difficult year for the United States.
The coronavirus pandemic has taken a huge toll on the country, killing some 236,250 people so far, while social unrest over the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, has only hardened divisions that already existed.
Many voters were hoping for a decisive election that would offer some calm, whichever candidate they cast ballots for.
Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz (DE:ALVG) Group's chief economic adviser, said he hoped a Biden administration could work with Congress to get a handle on the pandemic and pass an economic stimulus package for struggling Americans.

""The country needs to come together to deal better with a surge in Covid infections that risks the loss of more lives, greater disruptions to livelihoods, and long-term economic, institutional and social scarring,"" he said.

Finalisation of the deal comes after Traton said on Oct. 16 it had agreed to raise its bid for Navistar to $44.50 per share, up from $43, as it closed in on an acquisition that would create a global manufacturer.
The agreement which brings Navistar together with the MAN, Scania and Volkswagen trucks brands is in tune with trends in the truck industry which has been seeking ways to share the costs of developing low emissions technology.
Traton already holds a 16.7% stake in Navistar and at the increased offer price Traton would be paying about $3.7 billion for the shares in Navistar it doesn't already own, valuing the U.S. business as a whole at around $4.4 billion.
Major shareholders in Navistar including Icahn Capital LP and MHR Fund Management LLC have agreed to vote in favor of the deal, the U.S. truck maker said in a separate statement https:// 

The Volkswagen group will give Traton a loan of 3.3 billion euros, repayable over 12-18 months, to fund the deal.

28,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2020 12:10PM ET</span>",Buffett's Berkshire suffers in pandemic even as Apple boosts profit,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc reported lower quarterly operating results on Saturday and said the coronavirus pandemic may cause further damage, even as gains in stocks such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) fueled a more than $30 billion overall profit.
Some Berkshire operating businesses have rebounded from their spring depths, and analysts were encouraged that revenue fell just 3% from a year earlier.
But COVID-19, hurricanes and low interest rates hurt profit from insurance businesses, which include the Geico auto insurer, and the Precision Castparts aircraft parts unit projected thousands of additional job losses.
Berkshire also repurchased a record $9.3 billion of its underperforming stock in the third quarter, as Buffett remained unable to find the huge acquisitions the 90-year-old billionaire wants to spur growth.
Buybacks totaled $16 billion from January to September, and appeared to total at least $2.3 billion in October because Berkshire's share count dropped.
""The market will be encouraged by the buybacks,"" said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research with a ""hold"" rating on Berkshire. ""Many companies halted buybacks to preserve resources during the pandemic, though because Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend the amount it is returning to shareholders pales bit.""
Third-quarter operating profit fell 32% to $5.48 billion, or about $3,488 per Class A share, from $8.07 billion a year earlier.
Net income rose 82% to $30.1 billion, or $18,994 per Class A share, from $16.5 billion, or $10,119 per share. Revenue totaled $63 billion.
NEW USES FOR CASH
Berkshire reported $24.8 billion of gains from investments such as Apple, whose stock rose 27% in the quarter and at $111.7 billion is by far Berkshire's biggest stock holding, comprising 46% of its portfolio.
Nevertheless, it appears Berkshire may have sold some Apple stock because the stake should have been a few billion dollars higher, based on previously disclosed stakes, if none was sold.
Net results are volatile because an accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized gains and losses on its stocks. The company posted a $26.3 billion second-quarter profit, but lost nearly $50 billion in the first quarter.
Despite the buybacks, Berkshire ended the quarter with $145.7 billion of cash and equivalents.
The Omaha, Nebraska-based company has also found new ways to spend cash, investing $6 billion in five Japanese trading houses and backing the initial public offering of data storage company Snowflake Inc.
""It's a good quarter, and I'm pleased by the level of cash deployment,"" said Jim Shanahan, an Edward Jones analyst with a ""buy"" rating on Berkshire. ""If we have a second wave of the pandemic, Buffett is still positioned to take advantage.""
JOB LOSSES
Precision, which Berkshire bought in 2016 for $32.1 billion in its largest-ever acquisition, has been hit hard by the downturn in the aerospace industry, including in the second quarter when Berkshire took a $9.8 billion writedown.
Third-quarter pretax profit fell 80%, and Berkshire expects the unit will by year end have shed 40% of its workforce from the end of 2019.
That equates to roughly 13,400 jobs, or 3,400 more than Berkshire previously disclosed had been lost.
While Berkshire took no major third-quarter writedowns, it said the pandemic could force additional writedowns.
Insurance profit fell 58% to $802 million, reflecting lower premiums at Geico, COVID-19, Hurricanes Laura and Sally, and lower income from investments as interest rates tumble.
Geico awarded drivers $2.5 billion of credits on policy renewals this year, and Berkshire said its accounting for those credits should hurt underwriting results through March 2021.
Profit fell just 8% at the BNSF railroad, as cost-cutting helped offset lower shipping volumes. ""That positions it well for when revenue and volumes recover,"" Shanahan said.

Results improved in Berkshire's energy businesses, and profit at its real-estate brokerage more than doubled as low interest rates drove more people to buy homes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volvo Cars is recalling 54,000 U.S. vehicles for an air bag defect after one crash death tied to the issue, according to a filing with U.S. regulators.
The unit of Geely Automotive (HK:0175) is recalling 2001-2003 model S80 and S60 vehicles sold or registered in high humidity U.S. states because the driver side frontal air bag inflator may rupture, sending metal fragments flying, when the air bag is deployed. 
According to the Volvo filing with the government, Volvo will replace the inflators with a modern propellant and inflator. Parts are expected to be available by March.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Saturday it confirmed one person in the United States was killed when a ZF/TRW FG2 twin driver air bag inflator containing the propellant 5AT-148N exploded.
The issue has been the subject of NHTSA and Volvo meetings since August 2019.
The agency said the fatal incident was the only known rupture incident for this type of inflator around the world. NHTSA and Volvo are gathering and reviewing data about other vehicles with this inflator to determine if additional actions are needed, the U.S. agency said.
Volvo did not immediately comment on Saturday.
ZF Group said Saturday it was first notified by Volvo in August 2019 of the incident and it ""promptly informed NHTSA and, together with Volvo, began investigating the incident.""
ZF added it ""will continue to work closely with NHTSA and Volvo on this issue.""
NHTSA has investigated for years other air bag inflator ruptures. 

The largest automotive recall in history involves about 100 million inflators produced by another parts maker Takata that have been recalled by 19 major automakers worldwide and linked to 26 deaths.

30,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Small caps join market rally but pandemic could derail them,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. small caps joined in the broad market rally in the days after Election Day as investors priced in the likelihood of a divided Washington with Democrat Joe Biden president and Republicans maintaining their Senate majority.
Yet some investors and analysts warned that smaller companies may lose steam as the coronavirus pandemic shows no signs of slowing down. Chief among their concerns: that small-caps will bear the brunt of aggressive measures Biden could adopt to combat the pandemic, without benefiting from a large stimulus bill if Senate Republicans block his efforts there.
Democrats could still take over the Senate if Georgia's two contested seats go to a January runoff as is now expected. That might lead some investors to price back in the possibility of spending bills that would benefit small-caps.
However, smaller companies remain likely to bear the brunt of the pandemic, which is reaching record levels in the United States.
""A more aggressive response from a President Biden could be a risk for small caps,"" said Sylvia Jablonski, managing director at Direxion. 
""The best scenario for small caps is a full reopening of the economy with manageable levels of Covid before a vaccine comes out and some form of stimulus with a supportive Fed. The worst case is a lot less stimulus than we hoped for with a full shutdown or something close to it,"" she said.
Those worries are reflected in small-caps underperformance since Election Day. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks is up 2.6% since Nov. 3, a little more than half of the 4.2% gain in the large cap S&P 500 index over the same time. The underperformance mirrors that of the last five years, in which the Russell is up 38.2% compared with a 67% jump in the S&P 500. 
U.S. coronavirus cases surged by more than 120,000 on Thursday, according to a Reuters tally, the second consecutive record daily increase as the virus spreads throughout every region of the country. Twenty of the 50 states reported record increases Thursday.
Spiking case counts in Europe have led to reinstatement of economic lockdowns and other restrictions there. France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands have announced new curbs, while U.K. lawmakers voted for a month-long lockdown.
""The implications of the ongoing second COVID-19 wave in Europe and the third wave in the U.S. remains uncertain and the results of the vaccine trials by the end of this month remain an important catalyst,"" analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) wrote in a note Thursday, recommending that investors remain hedged against a steep decline in U.S. small-caps. 
Small caps may remain volatile in the week ahead as Congress resumes negotiations on a stimulus bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has balked at passing a $2.2 trillion bill supported by House Democrats, but said Nov. 4 that he was open to some support for state and local governments supported by Democrats and that there was a ""need to do it by the end of the year."" 
Progression in stimulus talks and the number of coronavirus case counts will likely dictate the path of small cap stocks in the weeks ahead because Biden would not take office for another two months, said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. 
Biden is not going to want to ""spend political capital trying to lock down the country or try to get people to follow a national mask mandate which would be extremely difficult to implement,"" she said, making the risk of broad economic lockdowns ""minimal"". 
Small-caps may begin to outperform again in 2021 as new case counts decline and vaccines and other treatments become available, she said. 

""We're going to start to think about this reopening trade again and start to move past the virus,"" she said.

31,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2020 08:35PM ET</span>",Biden taps Gensler to work on Wall Street oversight review - source,"By Trevor Hunnicutt and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who appeared to be closing in on an election victory, has tapped former derivatives market regulator Gary Gensler to work on a transition plan for financial industry oversight, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
Gensler, who served as chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) from 2009 to 2014, will work with a team of policy experts focused on banking and markets regulators, such as the CFTC, Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as part of the usual agency review process undertaken by an incoming administrations, the person said. 
Gensler did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday evening. A spokesperson for Biden's transition team declined to comment. 
The decision to appoint Gensler was likely to please many Democrats who applauded his tough stance on Wall Street under former President Barack Obama. 
As CFTC chair, he led creation of key swaps rules mandated by Congress following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, developing a reputation as a hard-headed operator who was not afraid to ruffle feathers. 
His efforts put the CFTC well ahead on the implementation of the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law. Other regulators are still implementing the law's rules a decade later. 
A former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker and currently a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, Gensler also oversaw the prosecution of big investment banks for rigging Libor, the benchmark for trillions of dollars in lending worldwide.
Biden's team has also tapped KeyBank NA executive Don Graves to work on a broader economic agency review, the same person said. Graves could not immediately be reached for comment but on his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) page describes himself as a counselor to Biden. 
Before joining KeyBank in 2017, Graves worked in the Obama administration Biden's director of domestic and economic policy. Before that he was executive director of Obama's jobs council, according to his LinkedIn. 
Biden, who leads incumbent Republican President Donald Trump in the key battleground states, according to several television networks, was accused of being too cozy with Wall Street as a senator and later as Obama’s vice president. He has said relatively little on financial reform more broadly.
His appointees are expected to prioritize policies on which Democrats broadly agree - boosting consumer protections and measures to help tackle racial injustice, diversity, wealth inequality and climate change. 

One area Biden has focused on are rules that promote lending to low-income communities, which he has pledged to expand. He has also pledged to crack down on credit reporting agencies which are criticized for harming consumers with inaccurate reports and by focusing on scoring factors that disadvantage minorities.

(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) said on Friday it has sent notices of potential furloughs to 42 parts inventory workers after talks with one union group stalled over pay cuts the airline argues it needs from all employees to offset $1 billion in overstaffing costs.
The first furloughs at the 49-year-old company would take place in January unless the International Brotherhood of Teamsters agrees to a deal or Washington passes ""a satisfactory"" extension of a payroll support program for airlines, Southwest said.
An initial $25 billion in federal payroll support for airline workers expired in September, prompting tens of thousands of furloughs across the industry after lawmakers failed to agree another COVID-19 economic relief deal before the Nov. 3 U.S. election.
Southwest remains in talks over cost savings with representatives of other union groups, it said, and left the door open for negotiations to save the 42 jobs at risk among Teamsters members.
""This is not the result we hoped to achieve,"" Southwest Vice President of Labor Relations Russell McCrady said in an emailed statement.
The Teamsters did not immediately comment.
Unions represent about 83% of roughly 61,000 Southwest employees.
Meanwhile, Southwest's outsourcing of maintenance work to foreign contractors threatened to return to the fray in discussions with the union representing some 2,700 mechanics, after the two sides ended a 7-year contract impasse in 2019. 
The Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA) believes contract language protects members from furloughs as long as Southwest is outsourcing maintenance work, its national director Bret Oestreich said on Friday.
AMFA has asked Southwest to provide information on its outsourcing footprint and costs, while moving forward with discussions on possible cost-savings measures, outside of opening the collective bargaining agreement.

Southwest pilots have also pushed back on the company's proposal to cut employees' pay by 10% but remain in talks, as does the flight attendants' union.

Pictures of ""Tesla Tequila"" https://shop.tesla.com/product/tesla-tequila on the website revealed a sleek, lightning-shaped bottle, a bit different from what Musk had once touted. The product was quickly listed as ""out of stock.""
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Musk tweeted the idea of ""Teslaquila"" on April Fool's Day 2018, which many of his followers considered a joke. However, Musk's efforts to trademark the drink in October of that year were frowned upon by Mexico's tequila producers. (https://reut.rs/2TZW5Wk)
Mexico's Tequila Regulatory Council then argued the ""name 'Teslaquila' evokes the word Tequila ... (and) Tequila is a protected word."" Under the new name, it had no qualms.
""Tesla is now a certified brand of tequila under the strict regulations regarding our national drink,"" the council said in a statement, saying it would be made by Destiladora del Valle de Tequila, a major producer of tequilas and other spirits.
Tesla's website said the beverage will be made by Nosotros Tequila, which is one of Destiladora del Valle de Tequila's more than 100 labels, according to online tequila database Tequila Matchmaker.
Also known as Casa Maestri, the producer already makes a wide range of tequila brands, as well as bourbon, vodka and Canadian whisky, according to the company's website.
According to Tesla's website, the new alcoholic venture will be available only in selected U.S. states, including New York, California and Washington.
The Silicon Valley billionaire is no stranger to selling quirky products in limited one-time sales.
He sold flamethrowers at $500 apiece in early 2018, raising $10 million for his high-speed tunnel venture the Boring Company. Musk also sold 50,000 Boring Company hats previously.
Independent industry consultant Clayton Szczech said that without tasting the Tesla liquor he could not evaluate its quality. But he observed that celebrity products on the whole were not aimed at tequila aficionados.
""I tend to doubt that this tequila is significantly different from everything else they are putting out,"" Szczech said, referring to Destiladora del Valle de Tequila.

The website of the new drink describes it as agave tequila añejo aged in French oak barrels, ""featuring a dry fruit and light vanilla nose with a balanced cinnamon pepper finish.""

34,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2020 05:50PM ET</span>","Analysis: High-flying U.S. tech stocks get post-election lift, near new highs","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A weaker-than-expected election performance by Democrats and fears of new coronavirus restrictions have prompted investors to double down on high-flying technology stocks, which have come roaring back in recent days to put the Nasdaq within striking distance of a record. 
Since Election Day, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up 6.6%, easily outpacing the 4.2% gain in the broad S&P 500 over the same time. This was partly driven by investors and traders unwinding trades placed on pre-election assumptions of a Democratic sweep which they thought would usher in higher taxes and more regulation. 
Polls had forecast Democrats would solidly win the presidency on Tuesday, extend their control in the House of Representatives and potentially win control of the Senate. While Democratic candidate Joe Biden looks likely to win the presidency, the margin of victory appears to be razor thin; Democrats lost seats in the House and the Senate is evenly divided ahead of two runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5.
The result leaves Democrats in a weak position to push through a progressive agenda of increasing corporate and capital gains tax rates, said Steve Chiavarone, portfolio manager at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI). 
Investors had been expected to sell high-flying tech stocks and lock in current capital gains tax levels ahead of a strong Democratic showing in the election. 
But there will still likely be some tax-motivated selling of technology stocks at the end of the calendar year ahead of the Jan. 5 Senate runoff election, Chiavarone warned. 
“Even though a Georgia Senate runoff is a risk in the eyes of the Street, both of those seats going blue is a highly unlikely scenario,"" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, who sees a risk of tax-motivated selling in late December but expects tech stocks to rise another 15% through the end of the year. 
Beyond the short-term impacts that have swung tech this week, investors said the long term reasons to own tech remain. 
""Tech has been getting cheap, at least relative to where it's been, and that sets it up nicely if we have to have a move back to a stricter stay at home mandate,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), for instance, now trades at a price to earnings ratio of 35.1, compared with its 52-week high of 40.9, while Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) trades at a P/E of 94.9, compared with its 52-week high of 152. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) trades at a trailing P/E of 36, down from its 52-week high of 40.2, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) trades at a P/E of 34.9, down from its 52-week high of 38.8.
CORONAVIRUS CONCERNS 
Spiking coronavirus cases may also prompt investor demand on the view that record high cases in the United States will prompt state and local authorities to impose new economic restrictions. [FWN2HQ12G]
""You are seeing (COVID-19) flare-ups and real issues throughout the world, and it's the same types of companies - the Apples, the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s and PayPals - that have fared so well during the pandemic that investors believe will continue to do well if we have another form of an aggressive lockdown,"" said David Marcus, chief investment officer at Evermore Global Advisors. 
Overall, investors will likely remain bullish on technology stocks until there are greater signs that the broad economy has regained its footing and coronavirus treatments and vaccines are widely available, said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist for the multi-asset solutions team at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management. 
Tech stocks ""are the ones that have been able to prove that they have very resilient business models to this new economy that we're going through,"" he said. 
Still, some investors cautioned about the risks of betting too much on tech. 
""The idea that those big tech companies are the only game in town defies the way the economy functions,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are growing less worried about huge gyrations in U.S. stocks now that Election Day has passed.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" fell on Friday for the fifth straight day to end at 24.86, its lowest closing level since Aug. 28. This week, the VIX plummeted more than 13 points, its largest weekly decline since early April.
Prices for VIX futures also dropped broadly over the past week. 
""Investors are continuing to get more comfortable with the political setup,"" though results for the U.S. presidential election and several congressional races remained unclear, said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.
Still, the VIX remains well above its long-term average of 20, and concerns tied to U.S. politics and the coronavirus pandemic could keep volatility expectations steady, analysts say.
Several market analysts have said Wall Street hopes a divided Congress would enable the Senate's Republican majority to block moves to hike taxes or expand healthcare coverage if Democrat Joe Biden becomes president. Senate control could hinge on two undecided races in Georgia.
While U.S. stocks did not appear very unsettled by those races on Friday, Murphy said some investors have recently been purchasing options targeting a January time frame, perhaps in anticipation of the Georgia runoffs. The term structure for VIX futures now indicates that investors see the greatest potential for market swings in the period between mid-December to mid-February. 
Concerns about a rise in COVID-19 cases after the December holiday season could also lift volatility expectations for that period, said Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets.

Even so, overall ""things are mellowing out from a vol perspective,"" said Matt Amberson, principal at options analytics firm ORATS.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks held near the unchanged mark on Friday to close out a strong week as Democratic challenger Joe Biden edged closer to victory in the presidential election, while the monthly jobs report underscored the hurdles still facing the economy.
Biden built on narrow leads in Pennsylvania and Georgia, putting him on the verge of winning the White House, although President Donald Trump has filed lawsuits in battleground states to contest the results.
The three major indexes notched their biggest weekly percentage gains since April as the prospect of policy gridlock in Washington eased worries a Biden administration might tighten regulations on U.S. companies.
""It’s not fairytale land, we don’t go up every day so at some point you would think we would see a little bit of downward pressure,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) in Chicago. 
Control of the U.S. Senate could hinge on four as-yet undecided races. If Republicans retain their majority, they would likely block large parts of Biden's legislative agenda, including expanding healthcare and fighting climate change.
""There is some concern with regards to if Biden creeps ahead or wins Georgia then there is chance that those (Senate) seats will follow. That’s what people are reading into this,"" said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at Stonex Group Inc, New York.

37,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2020 04:15PM ET</span>",EU set to impose tariffs on $4 billion U.S. goods next week,"By Philip Blenkinsop and Andrea Shalal
BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The European Union is poised to move next week to impose tariffs on $4 billion of U.S. imports in retaliation for U.S. subsidies for planemaker Boeing (N:BA), EU diplomats said, teeing up an eleventh-hour showdown with U.S. President Donald Trump.
A majority of EU governments have backed imposing the widely expected tariffs once EU trade ministers meet next Monday - the latest twist in a transatlantic trade saga that has spanned 16 years and four U.S. presidents.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is edging closer to victory in the U.S. election, but Republican Trump would remain president until Jan. 20 and has plenty of leeway to increase U.S. tariffs on Europe that were imposed in a parallel case over subsidies for Airbus.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer last month warned any EU tariffs would ""force a U.S. response"" and Trump has threatened to ""strike back harder""..
Brussels views its own tariffs - authorized by the World Trade Organization last month - as important leverage in negotiations to end a dispute that began in 2004.
""I would expect the tariffs to be imposed next Tuesday or Wednesday,"" an EU diplomat said.
In October 2019, Washington imposed tariffs on Airbus planes and other European products from cheese to olives and single-malt whisky. Combined, the two cases represent the world's largest ever corporate trade dispute.
Washington argues there is no legal basis for EU tariffs because underlying subsidies to Boeing have been repealed. European officials argue it is only the WTO that can decide on compliance and that last month's green light stands.
Both sides accuse the other of failing to obey WTO rulings but are seen as determined to maximize their positions ahead of probable negotiations.
If Biden wins, the avowed transatlanticist is expected to work quickly to mend fences with Brussels on a host of issues, and could use talks over the aircraft subsidies as a gesture of goodwill as he tries to build a more united front against China.
After holding off on tariffs to avoid clashing with the U.S. presidential campaign, EU governments formally cleared tariffs on Tuesday, Election Day, but must now decide their timing.
FARMERS, CONSTRUCTION, CASINO TABLES
Tariffs will hit U.S. planes and parts, fruits, nuts and other farm produce, orange juice, some spirits and other goods from construction equipment to casino tables, diplomats said.
The European Commission said it was fine tuning what it regards as its retaliation rights in case no agreed solution could be found with Washington, including an immediate suspension of U.S. tariffs.
Lighthizer's office had no immediate comment. One senior U.S. source said Trump was not expected to feel constraint about expanding U.S. tariffs, even if he loses the election.
The United States is authorized to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion of European goods, but has not used the whole quota. It could raise duties on various goods or expand the target list.
Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S., said any EU tariffs on spirits would further devastate an industry that has already seen a 41% drop in U.S. whisky exports to Europe due to previous EU tariffs.
European producers have voiced similar complaints about U.S. tariffs. Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic are under mounting pressure to prevent the aircraft feud hurting other industries.
New EU tariffs will also hand Britain, which left the bloc this year, delicate decisions about whether to join neighbours in imposing tariffs at a time when it is caught between trade negotiations with both the United States and EU.

Britain, a partner of France-based Airbus, has pledged to ""keep all options open"".

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) upscale grocer Whole Foods Market said on Friday it had reversed a decision banning its employees from sporting poppy flowers, a symbolic gesture to honour Remembrance Day, following a backlash in Canada.
The move to ban the poppy led to criticism by many on social media, with Canadians expressing their feelings by taking to Twitter with the hashtag ""#LestWeForget"".
""Our new unified dress code policy is intended to create consistency and ensure operational safety across all of our stores,"" a Whole Foods spokesperson said, adding that it was never the intention to single out ""the poppy or to suggest a lack of support for Remembrance Day"".
The poppy is a symbol used by Commonwealth countries to recognise the sacrifice made by armed forces members who have died in the line of duty. Remembrance Day is commemorated on Nov. 11 each year.
""I think Whole Foods has made a silly mistake that I am hoping they will correct very quickly,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at a news conference in Ottawa on Friday.
Veterans Affairs Minister Lawrence MacAulay has been in direct touch with the company to ""highlight that they made a mistake and should change course,"" Trudeau added.

Whole Foods was sued in July by employees accusing the grocery chain of punishing workers who wear ""Black Lives Matter"" face masks on the job. The company had then said the masks violated its longstanding dress code banning clothing with ""visible slogans, messages, logos or advertising"" unrelated to the company.

Investing.com -- Markets had a hard time deciding what to do today after a solid rally this week. And we still don't know who the next president of the U.S. is, though it's looking pretty good for Joe Biden.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.24%, or 67 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.04%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.04%.
Former Vice President Biden appears to be in the lead for the race to become the leader of the free world, with 264 electoral votes to President Donald Trump's 213. Biden has pulled ahead in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona, while Trump leads in North Carolina. 
Pennsylvania's GOP is requesting that the U.S. Supreme Court order the state to not take any action on any mail-in ballots received after Nov. 3. Trump is suing in several states, though legal experts do not see much chance for success, Reuters reported.
Biden and his vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris are expected to give speeches Friday night. 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 638,000 last month, better than the expected 600,000.  That compares to September's revised 672,000 additions.
Daily Covid-19 infections are setting records in the U.S., with more than 100,000 reported in a single day for a second day in a row, CNN reported. 
The number of hospitalized Americans is also climbing, with now more than 53,000 patients, CNN said, citing the COVID Tracking Project.  The U.S. reported 1,210 deaths Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Gold Futures are trading above $1,950, while oil dropped about 4%.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) closed little changed. 
Coty (NYSE:COTY) soared after reporting better profit and lower costs. CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) was also higher on increased guidance and a new chief executive officer.  Hershey Co  (NYSE:HSY) increased after besting earnings estimates and returning to financial forecasts.
Video game maker Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) tumbled as guidance came in weaker than expected. The company’s third quarter revenue forecast of $1.675 billion compares to consensus estimates of $2.35 billion, according to TipRanks.

The stock rose as much as 26%, the most since its direct listing in September. Many investors expect defense spending would be cut under a Biden administration.
Palantir, which was co-founded by Peter Thiel, counts the U.S. Defense Department among its largest customers and could benefit from reduced spending because its software often costs less than what’s made by traditional defense contractors.
Palantir has now gained about 32% since the U.S. election was held on Nov. 3. The company is scheduled to report financial results for the first time as a publicly traded company on Nov. 12.

43,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 06, 2020 02:27PM ET</span>",Women Make Strides in U.S. Labor Market After Pandemic Setbacks,"(Bloomberg) -- Women enjoyed bigger gains in the labor market in October after months of setbacks during the coronavirus pandemic, though economists caution their recovery remains fragile.
The unemployment rate among women 16 and older dropped to 6.7% last month, falling below the rate among men for the first time since February, Labor Department data released on Friday showed. Participation rates also improved, with 55.9% of women in the labor force last month, an increase from 55.6% in September.
While the data are welcome news, women’s job gains continue to be slower than men’s. Before the coronavirus, women made up a larger share of the workforce than men and had made significant strides in closing gender gaps in participation and overall employment.
“We’re still in a pandemic, we still have virtual schooling, there’s no end in sight with the resurgence of Covid -- this is still a huge headwind for the female recovery and I don’t think this report changes that,” said Julia Coronado, founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC. “The question going forward is about the pace of the recovery and how quickly we restore what we had.”
In another positive sign, Americans of color narrowed their gaps in unemployment with their White peers in October. The difference between the White and Black unemployment rates narrowed to 4.8 percentage points, with the Black jobless rate at 10.8%, though that’s still much higher than the 6% rate for White Americans. Hispanic Americans’ unemployment fell to 8.8% and the Asian American rate dipped to 7.6%.
A big chunk of the October job gains came in the leisure and hospitality industries, where the majority of workers are female. But many of those gains are seasonal and may slow during the colder months when outdoor activities like dining become more difficult in some parts of the country, according to MacroPolicy’s Coronado.
The number of women participating in the labor force has increased about 2 million since April, though it’s still down 2.2 million from the pre-pandemic levels. That gap is wider than the 1.4 million deficit among men, who have recovered 63% of their pandemic labor-force losses.
The childcare burden could slow any further improvement in female employment, especially if winter weather keeps children indoors as the pandemic wears on, according to Guy Berger, principal economist at jobs website LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).
“Women of any color are being forced to bear more of the burden of childcare than men going forward,” Berger said.

44,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2020 01:55PM ET</span>",Investors focus on undecided Senate as Biden edges in on presidency,"By David Randall and Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Democratic nominee Joe Biden edges closer to claiming the presidency, investors are focused on the still-undecided race for control of the Senate and the potential consequences for taxes, regulation and the outlook for more stimulus. 
The benchmark S&P 500 has jumped nearly 4% since Election Day, driven in part by expectations that divided control over Congress will make it unlikely that a President Biden could pass his calls to increase corporate and capital gains tax rates. 
The S&P 500 (SPX)dipped 0.2% in afternoon trading on Friday, while yields on benchmark 10-year Treasuries (US10YT=RR) rose to 0.82%, their highest levels since before the Nov. 3 election. 
Biden took the lead over President Donald Trump in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Georgia for the first time on Friday, putting him on the verge of winning the White House.
However, Georgia appears set for run-off races in January to determine its two Senate seats. Biden's move ahead in Georgia focused some investor attention on chances that the Democrats could have more sway in the Senate. If they won those two run-offs it would give them a tie in the Senate and give Kamala Harris a deciding vote. 
Two other Senate races remain undecided, though Republican Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Dan Sullivan of Alaska are leading in those contests.
“There is some concern with regards to if Biden creeps ahead or wins Georgia, then there is chance that those seats will follow. That's what people are reading into this. They're saying, 'OK, if there is this kind of momentum for Democrats, maybe the Senate (control) isn't over yet.' There’s a little bit of hesitation,"" said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at StoneX Group Inc. 
Justin Hoogendoorn, head Of Fixed Income Strategy at Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) in Chicago, said ""even if (Democrats) capture one Senate seat, it just becomes more plausible to push some legislation through. The closer they are to that, the more plausible.”
Unsettled control of Washington will likely weigh on markets as the United States continues to post record daily coronavirus case counts.
""If it's contested, it adds a little bit of uncertainty"" to markets after investors began pricing in a divided government, said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James. 
Delays in the vote count also increase the risk of legal challenges, leaving investors in limbo, said Simon Harvey, currency analyst at broker Monex Europe.
""I think the big risks to markets now is if this isn't wrapped up swiftly - say by Monday- especially considering the level of traction a Biden presidency has gained over the course of the day,"" he said. ""Any lack of clarity over the result before Monday suggests markets will have to brace for a truly contested election with a series of court rulings."" 
Still, despite the uncertainty, expectations for near-term market volatility have declined. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has fallen more than 11 points since last Friday, on track for the largest weekly decline since early April. VIX futures have also dropped broadly.
Few investors are calling for a deep decline in stocks, buoyed in large part by unprecedented levels of financial support from the Federal Reserve. The central bank said Thursday that it will do whatever it can in the coming months to support the U.S. economy. 
It created the fewest jobs in five months in October while the number of part-time workers increased, the clearest evidence yet that the recovery from the pandemic recession was slowing as new COVID-19 cases explode.
Some investors are starting to wade back into stocks that would benefit from a Democratic sweep of Washington. Clean energy exchange-traded funds jumped more than 1.1% in early trading Friday, while technology stocks - seen as more likely to face stricter regulations and more tax-motivated selling if the Senate flips to Democratic control - slipped 0.5%. 

""Now the focus is shifting from the president to Georgia and the Senate because that is really going to define what happens next,"" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors. ""But if Biden gets in and the Senate flips, then we are back to the sweep.""

Bayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann and his wife Corinna purchased a combined 2.45 million euros in shares on Wednesday, according to regulatory filings posted by the company on Friday. 
Finance chief Wolfgang Nickl and consumer health head Heiko Schipper also bought stakes worth 154,000 euros and 309,000 euros, respectively, on the same day. 
Bayer shares have lost more than a fifth of their value since Sept. 30, when the group warned of billions of euros in impairment charges on agricultural assets and a slight decline in core earnings per share in 2021.
Those writedowns amounted to 9.25 billion euros, the company said when it announced quarterly results on Tuesday, also flagging an increase of around $750 million in the cost of settlement terms with U.S. plaintiffs over its Roundup weed killer.
The litigation over claims that Roundup causes cancer, which Bayer is seeking to settle for more than $11 billion, has also dragged the stock lower.
A Bayer spokesman would not comment beyond the filings.

The comments during AIG's third-quarter earnings call offered further detail on how it might carry out the long-discussed divestiture, which it announced last week.
""We currently contemplate either an IPO or a private sale of up to 19.9% of Life and Retirement, followed by one or more dispositions of our remaining ownership interest over time,"" President Peter Zaffino said on the call. AIG last week named Zaffino to take over as chief executive officer in March.
AIG shares were up about 5.5% at $35.26 in midmorning trading in New York.
Zaffino said AIG had no plans to break up the life and retirement unit and sell it in pieces, and that it was aiming to finish the separation of the business in 2021. 
The company plans to use proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt, Chief Financial Officer Mark Lyons said. Activist investor Carl Icahn had pressed for such a divestiture in 2015.
The company reported a slump in third-quarter profit on Thursday, hurt by losses related to storms, wildfires and the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Adjusted pretax profit in the general insurance business declined by 18%, due in large part to elevated underwriting losses from catastrophes, the company said.
Adjusted pretax profit in its life and retirement business, meanwhile, rose 51% thanks to cost containment and investment income, the company said.

51,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2020 11:40AM ET</span>",CVS Health CEO Larry Merlo to step down next year,"By Manas Mishra and Caroline Humer
(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo will retire after a decade-long tenure at the helm of the company during which he led the $69 billion acquisition of one of the oldest U.S. health insurer, Aetna (NYSE:AET).
Karen Lynch, who was with Aetna at the time of the acquisition in 2018, will succeed Merlo in February, CVS said on Friday. Lynch, 57, has been with Aetna for eight years and was previously president of Magellan Health (NASDAQ:MGLN) Services. 
The CVS-Aetna merger was sixty-four-year-old Merlo's vision who wanted to bring more medical services and testing into CVS' HealthHub stores nationwide. The leading pharmacy operator aims to have 600 of those stores by the end of the year and 1,500 next year. 
""Investors will likely view this transition positively as Karen Lynch is well respected by the investor community,"" Evercore ISI analysts said in a client note.
Shares of the company, which raised its full-year profit forecast on Friday after beating analysts' estimates for quarterly earnings, rose 4.1%. 
The company said it has administered more than 6 million COVID-19 tests since March, and expects to play an ""important role"" in COVID-19 vaccinations, once vaccines are available; a handful are in late-stage testing. 
CVS and rival Walgreens (O:WBA) have partnered with the U.S. government to offer on-site vaccinations for residents of care home and assisted living facilities. CVS is also expected to provide vaccinations in its pharmacies. 
In the third quarter, the company saw same-store pharmacy sales rise 6.7%, helping it beat Wall Street estimates for profit. 
CVS earned $1.66 per share on an adjusted basis, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.33 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

CVS raised its 2020 adjusted earnings per share forecast to $7.35 to $7.45 from $7.14 to $7.27 previously.

The U.S. company did not disclose the size of the deal for the operation, where it has over 90 stores, but said it would record about a $1 billion after-tax, non-cash loss related to the divestiture in its fiscal third quarter next year.
Argentina, mired in economic crisis since 2018, has been a tough market for companies in recent years. It is headed for an economic decline of nearly 12% this year, exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, which would be the third straight year of recession.
The country is also battling a currency crisis, has imposed tough capital controls, and recently emerged from a sovereign default after restructuring over $100 billion of foreign currency debt with local and international creditors.
The economic malaise and uncertainty have hit corporations in the country and led to others pulling back, including LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ) Group, which said in June it would halt local operations in Argentina.
Walmart Argentina began operating in 1995 and currently has some 9,000 employees in 92 stores, including the Changomas and Punto Mayorista chains.
With the acquisition, family-owned Grupo de Narváez will own 656 stores, including supermarkets, and apparel and home appliance outlets in nine countries, including Ecuador and Uruguay, and employ more than 24,500 workers. (https://

(Reuters) -  Hershey Co  (N:HSY) beat profit and sales estimates and reinstated its full-year financial forecasts on Friday, after early promotions and strong use of data to predict Halloween trends paid off in the third quarter, sending its shares up 3%. 
Anticipating a slump in trick-or-treating this year due to COVID-19 fears, Hershey launched in-store displays at U.S. retailers as early as August and tweaked much of its merchandise towards everyday consumption.
At the same time, it was tailoring digital ads to households using search data provided by Google (O:GOOGL), targeting those who were more or less likely to go out based on what they searched for. 
The result was an 80% rise in e-commerce sales and net Halloween sales that were ""slightly"" higher than 2019 and also boosted its seasonal market share gains by 4 percentage points.
""We saw lower participation in trick or treat in the final two weeks (of Halloween), but overall, the category showed resilience in a very volatile environment,"" Chief Executive Officer Michele Buck said in prepared remarks.
Halloween, typically the candy industry's biggest holiday season by sales, represents a tenth of Hershey's roughly $8 billion in annual revenue.
In September the company told Reuters it would increase digital spending on the season by 160% this year, as it anticipated parents would buy S'mores, Twizzlers and other candy online. 
Overall, net sales rose 4% to $2.22 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 27, with baking items including peanut butter, syrup, chips and cocoa also improving. 
Excluding items, the company earned $1.86 per share, allowing it to reinstate the full-year outlook it pulled in April. 

It forecast full-year net sales to rise about 1%, anticipating organic sales growth in the fourth quarter would be similar to the third. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to rise between 7% and 8% to between $6.18 and $6.24 per share.

(Reuters) - ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc (O:VIACA) on Friday raised its annual paid subscriber forecast for its streaming services, after nearly hitting its previous target a full quarter ahead of time on strong demand for indoor entertainment during the pandemic.
The company now expects to hit 19 million domestic subscriptions by the year-end for its streaming services, CBS All Access and Showtime, compared to its earlier estimate of 18 million. Subscriptions stood at 17.9 million at the end of the third quarter
The services had significant growth in sign-ups, the company said, as CBS All Access benefited from strong demand for sports content and Showtime OTT from shows like ""The Chi"" and ""Billons"".
ViacomCBS competes in a crowded U.S. video streaming market with dominant players such as Netflix (O:NFLX) with close to 200 million global customers and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), which has more than 100 million global paid customers for its streaming services.
Revenue from streaming and digital video at ViacomCBS surged 56% to $636 million in the third quarter, helped by a more than doubling of ad sales from its free, ad-supported Pluto TV. 
Overall advertisement revenue, however, fell 6%, but improved from a 27% plunge in the second quarter.
Revenue in the company's filmed entertainment division, which includes Paramount Pictures, tumbled 31%, primarily due to lower licensing revenue and theater closures, including limited seating, across the United States and Europe.
Total revenue fell 9% to $6.12 billion, but came in above estimates of $5.94 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

60,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 06, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",Citi and Barclays Push Back Against the Reflation Doom and Gloom,"(Bloomberg) -- Two days after fading odds of a Blue Wave Congress appeared to kill off the reflation trade,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc see signs of life.
While the likely failure of the Democratic Party to take over the Senate means any fiscal splurge will probably be smaller, the prospect of increased Federal Reserve stimulus enhances the appeal of inflation-linked trades in the bond market, according to Citi.
Meanwhile, Barclays is touting value stocks to benefit when U.S. yields rebound from the lows notched this week -- defying Wall Street consensus that the investing strategy remains broken in an era of weak economic growth and lowflation.
Despite a jump on Friday, the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries is headed for the biggest weekly drop in almost three months, while value stocks are back at their lowest versus their growth counterparts since the 1970s.
“Less fiscal suggests that ultimately more monetary (QE) will be forthcoming,” Citi strategists led by Jamie Fahy wrote in a note on Thursday. “This is at a time when policy stimulus is crucial as COVID cases continue to rise, and the trajectory of economic surprises is down.”
The team recommended buying inflation swaps with a target of 2.40%, compared with 2.13% on Friday and this year’s pre-vote peak of 2.20%. The bank is also reducing long dollar bets and bullish on emerging-market stocks as well as oil.
Ten-year breakeven rates, a gauge of inflation expectations, dropped the most since April on Wednesday, reversing recent gains that were partly driven by bets on a Blue Wave. That will probably lower the bar for Fed action, given their fresh commitment to an average inflation target, according to Citi.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday opened the door to increasing bond purchases, noting that more fiscal and monetary support were needed.
The question is whether consumer prices will rebound. Whether it is due to structural changes in the economy or persistently tepid demand, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge has averaged roughly 1.6% over the past decade of cheap money, compared with its target 2% rate.
Given the post-election drop in bond yields and inflation expectations, a trade like Citi recommended might not need a big jump to make money. The benchmark yield was already rebounding on Friday, up five basis points at 9:25 a.m. in New York on Friday.
“Our conclusions are for nominal rates to likely remain pinned near post-Covid averages, with dollar real yields low and stable,” the strategists said. “Tactically positioning for higher breakevens makes sense.”
Barclays is in the optimistic camp.
“The reflation trade will be more moderate, but should not be completely written off,” strategists led by Emmanuel Cau wrote in a note on Friday. They cited improving economic data, a possible vaccine, pent-up demand and a weaker dollar under a more dovish Fed.
In equities, that means it’s worth owning some value stocks, which tend to rise with bond yields as many such shares are more sensitive to the business cycle. Barclays isn’t exactly going all out for value. It’s overweight miners, utilities and financials -- but also tech.
Value has long proved a widow-maker trade for bulls in the post-crisis period. As Joe Biden looked increasingly likely to win White House with a split government, they got a reminder when growth stocks surged anew versus their cheaper peers.
Still, given that the valuation gap between the two types is now by some measures close to an all-time high, it’s tempting to call for a reversal.
“If the economic backdrop normalizes into 2021 and tail risks abate, we think the extreme polarization between growth winners and value losers will narrow,” Barclays strategists wrote.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened modestly lower on Friday, but pared overnight losses on the back of a stronger-than-expected labor market report.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 94 points, or 0.3%, at 28,296 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.6%.  They're all still on course for solid gains over the week, however, buoyed by the prospect that a split Congress will be unable to push through some of the Democratic Party's less market-friendly ideas. 
Just before the opening, stocks had spiked on a  Fox News report - so far unconfirmed - suggesting that President Donald Trump was preparing to concede defeat in the presidential election on the advice of his team. However, a statement from the Trump campaign indicated the opposite, saying that the election was ""not over"", pointing to the likely need for recounts in certain states and again repeating allegations of electoral fraud. 
""The false projection of Joe Biden as the winner is based on results in four states that are far from final,"" the Trump campaign said in a statement.
Trump's legal challenges so far have largely been thrown out by state courts. Biden, meanwhile, had crept into the lead in the late stages of vote-counting in both Georgia and Pennsylvania, all but clinching victory in the presidential election.
""Although there may be some passing concerns with respect to a contested result, the reality is that the U.S. election is now behind us,"" said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer of BlueBay Asset Management in London. ""It would appear that investors have wanted to ‘buy the dip’, but have been left to chase the market as a dip has failed to materialize.""
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock lost 2.4% and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock lost 2.6%, trimming the gains they made in the immediate aftermath of the election.
Earlier, the Labor Department had reported unambiguously positive news in saying the U.S. economy created 638,000 nonfarm jobs in October - more than the 600,000 expected and decidedly more than the 365,000 reported by payrolls processor ADP earlier in the week. 
One standout winner was Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock, which rose 3.6% to its highest in 16 months, extending gains on the back of Tuesday's crucial ballot win in California and undeterred by another big quarterly loss that it reported after the close on Thursday. 
A clear loser was video games maker Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), which fell 10.4% after reporting that sales and earnings both fell on the year in the last three months.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Friday, consolidating after a four-day rally, with investors keeping a wary eye on the race for the White House ahead of the release of key employment data.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 20 points, or 0.6%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 120 points, or 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 94 points, or 0.8%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2% higher Thursday, while the S&P 500 index climbed 2%, and the Nasdaq Composite index added 2.6%. These indices are on course for their best week in seven months, with the Dow and S&P up over 7% this week so far and the Nasdaq Composite 9% higher.
The U.S. presidency race is still ongoing, but the tide appears to be turning decisively in favor of Democrat candidate Joe Biden. The former vice president has taken a narrow lead in vote-counting in Georgia, according to a number of U.S. news outlets, one of the states that incumbent President Donald Trump needs to win to retain his place in the White House.
While Biden now seems likely to become president, the Senate still seems set to stay in Republican hands. This would reduce the prospects of substantial regulatory changes, given a divided Congress, but could also make a substantial coronavirus relief fund tricky to pass.
“Indications point to a Joe Biden presidency, absent the 'blue wave' that markets had been anticipating. Political animosity means a substantial near-term fiscal support package is less likely at a time when incomes are being squeezed and rising Covid-19 cases mean containment measures are looking more likely. Economic risks are mounting,” said ING analyst Carsten Brzeski, in a research note.
Meanwhile, seventeen out of 50 U.S. states reported record one-day increases in coronavirus cases on Thursday, according to a Reuters tally, a day after the country recorded over 100,000 new infections for the first time.
This increase in Covid cases will place an increased focus upon the October jobs report, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with nonfarm payrolls expected to show a gain of 600,000, which would be lower than September’s 661,000. 
CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) and Hershey (NYSE:HSY) all beat expectations for their quarterly earnings earlier, while Coty (NYSE:COTY) and others are still to report.
Oil prices fell Friday, under pressure from signs of overproduction within OPEC and more aggressive discounting by Saudi Arabia in Asia.
U.S. crude futures traded 3.3% lower at $37.51 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.7% to $39.84. These contracts are still heading for their first weekly gain in four.

68,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>","Investors march back into China bets after Ant IPO halt, U.S. vote","By Andrew Galbraith and Tom Westbrook
SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The shock suspension of Ant Group's massive share offering and a possible Joe Biden U.S. presidency have become fresh tailwinds for China's stock market, as investors rush to snap up a piece of an economy recovering rapidly from the coronavirus pandemic.
Chinese regulators torpedoed the fintech giant's $37 billion initial public offering, set to be the world's largest stock market listing, after founder Jack Ma publicly criticised the country's financial watchdogs and banks.
As trillions of dollars locked up by the IPO return to the market, investors searching for a place to park that cash have lifted Chinese e-commerce firms such as Meituan (HK:3690) and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com (HK:9618) to record highs this week.
Even after losses on Friday, the Hang Seng TECH index (HSTECH) was up 8.2% for the week, its biggest weekly gain since early July.
Sean Taylor, chief investment officer in Asia for German asset manager DWS, said the IPO's collapse was stunning, but the scramble to subscribe showed the depth of Asia's investor pool. 
""It shows there is a huge, huge demand for buying equities when they think they've got upside. I expect some of that money goes back into markets,"" he said.
""The IPO pipeline looks pretty healthy and the equity culture is growing...and that's a big thing.""
The fresh enthusiasm for Chinese shares isn't confined to Hong Kong.
Foreign investors bought a net 21.42 billion yuan ($3.24 billion) of Chinese A-shares in the first five trading days of November, Hong Kong stock exchange data showed. Investors were seen betting on resurgent domestic demand and government policies through companies such as liquor maker Kweichow  Moutai  Co Ltd (SS:600519) and LONGi Green Energy Technology Co Ltd. (SS:601012).
These investors were net sellers in August and September and made only tiny purchases in October through the Stock Connect scheme, which gives offshore investors access to shares of Chinese firms traded on the mainland.
BIDEN WIND
Early indications that Democratic candidate Joe Biden could unseat incumbent Donald Trump have also pushed the yuan and stocks up. 
Biden is expected to take a less confrontational approach to Sino-U.S. relations if elected, removing a drag on Chinese shares that have nonetheless outperformed their peers this year as the world's No.2 economy recovers.
The blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) has risen more than 19% this year, versus a less than 9% gain for the S&P 500 (SPX).
Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said the firm was staying overweight China within emerging markets as China's corporate earnings recovery continues.
An influx of new capital will be key to supporting valuations of Chinese companies, already near historic highs, as more rush to list, said Shen Yi, chief executive officer at Shanghai ShenYi Investment Co.
China's A-share market welcomed 325 new listings worth a record 542.5 billion yuan in the first 10 months of 2020, more than triple the value of new listings in the same period a year earlier, Shenwan Hongyuan Securities analysts said in a report.

""The speed is...too high and there's not enough fresh money flowing to the market,"" Shen said. ""Everything depends on the money flow direction for this market.""

69,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>",Germany agrees to give COVID-hit airports financial aid,"By Klaus Lauer
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany agreed on Friday to offer more aid to its airports to try to save jobs and preserve infrastructure as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the aviation industry.
Berlin will discuss with the states financial options for airports over the next two weeks, according to a joint statement from the government and representatives of the aviation industry seen by Reuters ahead of an aviation summit in Berlin.
""Additional joint efforts by the federal and state governments are required to secure the economic basis of the airports in the medium term,"" the document said.
Plummeting passenger numbers mean 25-30% of the roughly 180,000 jobs at Germany's airports are at risk, Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer earlier told Deutschlandfunk radio.
Berlin's long-overdue new airport opened last Saturday just as the aviation industry struggles with collapsing demand. It is not expected to make enough revenue to pay back its debts.
The German industry has demanded compensation of up to 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) to help cover the costs of keeping airports open even when there is barely any traffic due to lockdowns. There was no mention of this sum in the document.
The government is examining possibilities to bridge or cover the loss of revenue at state air traffic control association DFS to prevent a sharp increase in fees for airlines, the document said.
It also wants to expand long-haul routes, which are profitable for airlines but have been largely suspended, by exempting passengers on selected flight corridors from COVID-19 entry restrictions. To do this, it plans to establish pre-defined testing and quarantine regimes with health authorities.
The transport ministry also wants to prevent 'dumping prices' for airline tickets in the future, so that they can't cost less than taxes and fees.
Support for Europe's aviation sector has varied among states, with Germany and France the biggest contributors via bailouts for Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF), according to a study in the Journal of Air Transport Management.
Britain has so far resisted demands for specific financial support to the industry, although UK airports and airlines such as IAG's (L:ICAG) British Airways have benefited from government wage subsidies, emergency loans and financing facilities available across the economy.

70,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 06, 2020 05:49AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Russian Markets Shrug Off Putin Parkinson's Rumor,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Thinking of trading Vladimir Putin's alleged departure from power? Then it's probably best to think again. 
The British Sun and the New York Post have both reported in the past 24 hours that the Russian President is set to step down early next year due to ill-health, in a move that would create, at least temporarily, a vacuum of power. Given the historical unpredictability of power transitions in Russia, that would normally be a negative for the country's financial markets. 
However, there is plenty of reason to doubt the reports, even if one discounts the comment from Dmitry Peskov, Putin's press secretary, on Friday, describing them as ""pure nonsense."" 
Getting the truth about a President's health from official channels is a tricky business at best - as the communications around Donald Trump's and Jair Bolsonaro's bouts of Covid-19 have shown very clearly - and the ultra-loyal Peskov is no exception to the rule. 
More importantly, though, both the reports appear to be questionable journalism, based on a single source: a Moscow-based political scientist called Pavel Solovei, a man with a track record of peddling conspiracy theories that have proved to be unsubstantiated. More sober news outlets with strong local presence, such as Reuters and Bloomberg, have steered clear of the story.
Like all conspiracy theories, this one has enough corroborative circumstantial evidence to give it a semblance of credibility. Specifically, the Duma, Russia's parliament, gave a first reading this week to a bill that will give former Presidents a place in the Federation Council, the equivalent of the U.S. Senate, a seat for life. This has the practical effect of giving Putin and Dmitry Medvedev, who was President from 2008-2012, lifelong immunity from prosecution. 
The bill is thus a safety net that would make it easier for Putin - who has faced countless allegations of corruption from opposition voices during his long rule - to leave office safely when he wishes. 
In addition, rumors that Putin suffers from Parkinson's - a progressive disease whose effects become more pronounced over time - are not new. They first surfaced in 2015 after the British Medical Journal observed asymmetric arm swings in his gait. While the Sun and Post reports cited a recent TV appearance in which he appeared to be in pain, Putin has discharged plenty of official duties in front of live television this year without any obvious discomfort. 
To all this, one could add that the Sun and New York Post are both owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA). Murdoch has had a personal animus against Putin ever since he was chased out of Russia's lucrative outdoor advertising market 15 years ago, although it's far from clear that this has informed editorial decisions in this particular case.
What's more important for Russian markets in the short term is the outcome of the U.S. election, and the price of oil. A split Congress makes it harder for the Democratic Party to exact revenge for what it sees as Russian interference that cost it the 2016 presidential race (although a President Joe Biden could still do much with executive orders alone). 
As for the price of oil - that depends largely on Russia's own actions. It can support prices by postponing a production increase currently scheduled by the 'OPEC+' bloc for the start of next year. Algeria's oil minister and current OPEC President said earlier this week that Russia and Saudi Arabia are currently lobbying other members of the group to do just that. 
Irrespective of that, the ruble and other emerging currencies and stock are obvious beneficiaries of the renewed weakening of the dollar since the U.S. elections. Even after today's tremor, the ruble is still up 2.5% against the greenback this week, while the RTS is up 8.8% - and that's despite a record surge in Coronavirus cases.

“There is likely to be significant disruption at the border,” the National Audit Office said in a report on Britain’s Brexit readiness published Friday. “Many traders and third parties will not be ready for new EU controls.”
The NAO report, which lists multiple areas of risk in the government’s Brexit planning, highlights the looming dangers for commerce between the U.K. and its largest trading partner. From Jan 1., even with a trade deal, businesses will need to file new customs paperwork and comply with new government IT systems to cross the border.
U.K. Warns of 7,000-Truck Line in Worst-Case Brexit Scenario (3)
The problems highlighted by the NAO include a failure to expand the number of customs intermediaries to handle post-Brexit paperwork, meaning some companies will have to stop trading with the EU. Household names including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co. have been among those that have struggled to source the necessary manpower.
The report says the coronavirus pandemic has hampered planning by both government and companies, re-directing staff and resources away from Brexit preparations. It also highlights the danger that the upheaval could coincide with the negative impact of the virus.
Brexit in a Lockdown Is Worst of Both Worlds for U.K. Businesses
“There is a risk that widespread disruption could ensue at a time when government and businesses continue to deal with the effects of Covid-19,” the NAO report said. “It also needs to be alert to any increased risks of smuggling or other criminal behavior which exploits gaps or inconsistencies in border operations.”

74,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>","Toyota, Honda double profit outlook as China rebounds from pandemic","By Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's two biggest car manufacturers, Toyota Motor (T:7203) and Honda Motor (T:7267) on Friday more than doubled their operating profit forecasts, helped by recovering demand in China as it rebounds from the coronavirus pandemic. 
While China's trade friction and worsening ties with the United States put pressure on Japanese companies to pull back from doing business there, China's rapid economic rebound could instead, deepen corporate Japan's dependence on the world's No. 2 economy, say analysts.
Although still weaker than last year, auto sales in the world's biggest auto market have grown for six straight months, jumping 12.8 percent in September.
China's overall economic recovery has also accelerated, expanding by 4.9% in the July-September quarter, compared with 3.2 percent in the previous three months.
Toyota has seen demand in China increase for its electric cars and Lexus luxury brand, while Honda said it has benefited from demand there for models such as its Vezel subcompact crossover sports utility.
Helped by that and following an improvement in quarterly earnings from the previous three months, Toyota said it now expects an operating profit of 1.3 trillion yen ($12.6 billion) for the year through March, 2021, up from the 500 billion it predicted previously. Operating profit for the previous financial year was 2.47 trillion yen.
That topped the 1.25 trillion yen average estimate for full-year profit from 26 analysts polled by Refinitiv. 
""If you compare our second quarter with the first you can see a dramatic recovery,"" Toyota's Operating Officer Kenta Kon said during an online press briefing after Japan's biggest carmaker released its results.
The maker of the RAV4 sports utility vehicle (SUV) crossover and the Prius gasoline hybrid now expects to sell 9.42 million cars worldwide this year - up 3.5% from a previous forecast of 9.1 million, although still below 10.46 million sold last year.
Honda now expects full-year operating profit of 420 billion yen compared with an earlier prediction for 200 billion yen.
A need to win more business in China's automarket is also driving model design and technology research at automakers in Japan and elsewhere, including an accelerating shift to electrical cars as China moves to carbon neutrality by 2060.
A senior Toyota executive in China said in September that annual global sales of electrified vehicles could reach 5.5 million in 2025, five years earlier than initially planned..
Honda wants two-thirds of its production to be new-energy vehicles by 2030, a shift in strategy that prompted it last month to end its participation as an engine supplier in the FIA Formula One World Championship.
Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) last month said it would launch a slew of new vehicles in China over the next five years including electrical cars, as it draws back from the global expansion pushed by ousted chairman Carlos Ghost.
Nissan reports its second quarter results on Thursday.
Although more optimistic about their outlooks, both Toyota and Honda cautioned about the risk still posed by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic as infection rates rise in the United States and elsewhere.
""The surge in coronavirus cases is a concern, particularly in Europe,"" Honda's Executive Vice President Seiji Kuraishi said during an online press briefing.
That sentiment is also shared by some investors.
""Given the yen's appreciation (versus the dollar) and a resurgence of the coronavirus, we have to consider the profit forecast revision cautiously,"" said Kazuo Kamiya, a fund manager at Nomura Securities. 
A strong yen reduces the value of sales booked in the United States.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global stocks were little changed but near a record high while the dollar and U.S. bond yields stayed sluggish on Friday on bets that a divided U.S. Congress would hinder government borrowing, which could pave the way for even more central bank stimulus.
Investors expect Democrat Joe Biden will beat President Donald Trump but Republicans will keep control of the Senate, allowing them to block Democrat policy such as corporate tax hikes and debt-funded spending on infrastructure.
""From here, we believe the impact of the presidential result should be relatively small,"" said Lars Kreckel, global equity strategist at LGIM. ""Whether Biden or Trump are in the White House, governing with a Congress that is very likely to be divided would be difficult and mean very little policy that could significantly move equity markets would be passed.""
A sense that a Biden presidency will be more predictable than Trump's is also underpinning risk sentiment, even though investors saw no quick rapprochement between the United States and China on trade and other issues.
Biden had a 253 to 214 lead in the state-by-state Electoral College vote that determines the winner, according to most major television networks, putting him closer to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win.
In Pennsylvania, which has 20 electoral votes, Biden cut Trump's lead to just over 18,000 by the early hours of Friday. His deficit in Georgia, which has 16 electoral votes, shrunk to about 450.
MSCI's all-country index of the world's 49 markets was flat after gains earlier in the week, still close to the record reached in September.

The Bank of England expanded its asset purchase scheme on Thursday and the European Central Bank is widely expected to announce more stimulus next month.
Investors also focused on the prospects of stalled talks on a U.S. coronavirus relief package restarting.

""This stimulus, when combined with a long-anticipated COVID-19 vaccine, can really lift the economy and drive growth. We consequently remain very upbeat on the prospects for 2021 and 2022.""
In currency markets, lower yields undermined the dollar. The dollar index touched a two-month low of 92.459.
The euro traded at $1.1840 while the offshore Chinese yuan climbed to 6.6000 to the dollar.

At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.4%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.2%.
The result of the U.S. presidential election remains uncertain Friday, but Democrat Joe Biden has strengthened his chances of winning the White House, steadily chipping away at incumbent President Donald Trump’s early lead in a pair of crucial swing states. 
Two of Trump's legal challenges to stop vote-counting were thrown out by state courts in Michigan and Georgia on Thursday, and his remaining actions have failed to have any impact so far. In his first public appearance since election night, Trump repeated unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud and vowed to continue the legal actions.
Meanwhile the coronavirus pandemic continues unchecked throughout most of Europe. Both Spain and Italy recorded their highest daily death tolls in the second wave on Thursday, while Italian regions entered partial lockdowns, joining the likes of France, the U.K. and Germany in shutting down vast swathes of their economies.
This raises the distinct possibility that the continent could suffer from a double dip recession. Earlier Friday, German industrial output rose by less than expected in September as the coronavirus crisis held back activity.
The other major economic data release Friday comes from across the Atlantic, with October U.S. nonfarm payrolls data expected to show a further slowdown in the labor market recovery.
In corporate news, Allianz (DE:ALVG) stock gained 2.1% after the insurer giant posted a rise in net profit despite revenue falling in the third quarter. Swiss luxury conglomerate Richemont (SIX:CFR) stock soared 10% after seeing some positive trends in its fiscal second quarter, thanks largely to a rebound in sales in China.
On the flip side, Aveva (LON:AVV) stock fell 2% after the software provider said it intends to raise 2.84 billion pounds ($3.73 billion) through a rights issue to partly fund the acquisition of SoftBank-backed peer OSIsoft.
Oil prices fell Friday, under pressure from signs of overproduction within OPEC and more aggressive discounting by Saudi Arabia in Asia.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $38.34 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.3% to $40.42. These contracts are still heading for their first weekly gain in four.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,949.30/oz, but remained on course for its biggest weekly gain since July, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1848.

79,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 06, 2020 03:18AM ET</span>",China Starts Thinking About Stimulus Exit as Economy Recovers,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s central bank has started talking about an exit of monetary easing as the economy’s recovery strengthens, in sharp contrast to the U.S. and Europe, where a resurgence in virus cases has forced governments there to consider more stimulus.
Policy makers globally are discussing how to withdraw stimulus, and the consensus is that it should be done sooner rather than later, Liu Guoqiang, vice governor of the People’s Bank of China, said Friday. “Exit is a matter of time and it is also necessary,” he said. “But the timing and method of exit need to be carefully evaluated, mainly based on the status of economic recovery.”
He added that the “international economy is recovering in general, and China’s overall situation is better than the international economy.”
China’s economy has regained all the losses made in the first half, with the recovery first driven by exports and industrial output and then strengthening as consumption picked up. That’s a rare positive for a global economy still clawing its way out of its worst slump since the Great Depression -- and which is now being complicated by the resurgence of Covid-19 cases in Europe and the U.S.
“We have done some research recently, and we can see from the trend that our country’s economy is relatively strong, policies are having an effect, and market confidence is recovering,” Liu said in Beijing at a press conference with other financial officials. “But adjustments of policies shouldn’t rush, or weaken the effect of serving the real economy, nor can there be a policy cliff.”
Liu didn’t provide any details as to the timing of a pullback in stimulus, while emphasizing that policy measures will be adjusted based on changing conditions and market demand, and said that support will be further increased in areas that require long-term assistance.
The PBOC has taken a measured approach to monetary easing this year, lowering interest rates, injecting liquidity and giving businesses loan repayment holidays.

Set up in 2009 by former prime minister Najib Razak, authorities are investigating how billions of dollars went missing from 1MDB - a disappearance the government says led to the finance ministry having to bail out the fund. 
Malaysia said in 2018 the government would have to pay about $13 billion of 1MDB's dues. 
Since April 2017, the government has provided 9.4 billion ringgit in loans and advances to help 1MDB meet its financial commitments and debt obligations, according to the 2021 fiscal outlook report, released ahead of the government's budget announcement on Friday.
Malaysia has also recovered a total of 13.4 billion ringgit ($3.24 billion) in assets linked to 1MDB's financial trail as of the end of September, the report said. 
The amount includes about 2.6 billion ringgit ($628 million) in cash and assets recovered and returned to Malaysia by the U.S. authorities, as well as $2.5 billion paid by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to settle a Malaysian probe into the investment bank's role in the 1MDB scandal. 
Goldman Sachs, which had helped 1MDB raise a total of $6.5 billion in bonds, has also guaranteed to help Malaysia recover $1.4 billion more in 1MDB-linked assets.
The United States has said about $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB in an elaborate scheme that spanned the globe and implicated high-level officials of the fund, former prime minister Najib, Goldman executives, and others.
Malaysian authorities say billions of dollars remain unaccounted for.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Friday, consolidating after the substantial post-election bounce, as the wait for the identity of the next U.S. president continues.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.6% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.3%. 
European stock markets closed higher on Thursday, rising for a fifth day, their longest advance since April. The Dax gained 2%, the CAC 40 ended up 1.2% and the FTSE 100 0.4% higher, lifted by the post-election rally in the U.S. and by fresh monetary stimulus from the Bank of England.
While the name of the next occupant of the White House is still undecided, Democrat Joe Biden has strengthened his hold on the presidential race, steadily chipping away at incumbent President Donald Trump’s early lead in a pair of crucial swing states.

Investors are now looking at Biden beating Trump for the presidency but for Republicans to keep control of the Senate, allowing them to block Democratic plans for hefty infrastructure spending and corporate tax hikes.
“In short, Congress will in all likelihood remain divided for another two years,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. “This amounts to a major upset to hopes of substantial near term fiscal support.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co (T:7267) on Friday more than doubled its full-year operating profit forecast as it reported second-quarter earnings grew 28% amid a rebound in China after auto sales were squeezed by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Japan's third-biggest automaker said it now forecasts a full-year operating profit of 420 billion yen ($4.06 billion) up from a previous prediction of a 200 billion yen profit.
That was well above an average estimate for a 254.6 billion yen profit compiled from 19 analysts polled by Refinitiv.
For the second quarter, operating profit came in at 283 billion yen, up from 220 billion yen in the same period a year earlier.
The upgrade came after a similar move by peer Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) earlier on Friday. Honda and peers like Toyota are focusing more on China, the world's biggest auto market, as it leads a rebound in global demand that was hurt by the coronavirus pandemic.
For the full business year, Honda said it expects to sell 4.6 million cars. That's up from a previous forecast of 4.5 million, but still below the 4.79 million sold the previous year.
Like other automakers, Honda is also accelerating a shift to electric cars and other zero-emission vehicles, a change in strategy that was behind its decision last month to end its participation as an engine supplier in the FIA Formula One World Championship.
Honda last month launched its first mass-produced all-battery car this month - the Honda e - and wants two-thirds of its output to be new-energy vehicles by 2030.
In the United States, meanwhile, Honda is looking to win a bigger market share with redesigned sports utility vehicles (SUVs) as it chases a shift in consumer demand for larger, all-wheel drive models.
In September Honda unveiled plans to deepen its partnership in North America with General Motors Co (N:GM) to jointly develop low-emission vehicles that would allow them to share technology and costs..

Investing.com – South Korea’s  Celltrion Inc  announced results from a small-size early-stage trial for its COVID-19 monoclonal antibody treatment CT-P59 on Friday. The results showed that patients treated with CT-P59 showed at least a 44% improvement in recovery time.
Celltrion (KS:068270) stocks in Korea were up 2.02% to KRW277,500 ($246.24) by 12:44 AM ET (4:44 AM GMT).
In a global phase I trials involving 18 patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms, 15 participants who received the treatment had an average recovery time of about 44% faster than the remaining three people in a placebo group.
None of the patients treated with CT-P59 in the study had required hospitalization or other antiviral therapies so far, with CT-P59 well tolerated with no clinically significant safety issues, the company said.
The positive results will boost Celltrion’s plans to obtain emergency use approval in South Korea for the antibody by the end of year. The company is also planning global phase 2 and 3 trials, after receiving South Korea’s regulatory nod to start phase 3 trials in October. The phase 3 trials will involve around 1,000 asymptomatic patients and patients who have who have come into close contact with COVID-19 patients in Korea.
Celltrion already began commercial production of the drug in September, with around 1 million doses expected to be produced for both the domestic and interntional markets.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co (T:4502) is looking at making vaccines a core business after completing asset sales to lower debt following its takeover of  Shire  Plc (LON:SHP), Chief Executive Christophe Weber said. 
Japan's biggest drugmaker by revenue recently completed $10 billion in sales of mostly over-the-counter drug assets to reduce debt after its $59 billion purchase of Shire, saying it would focus on five key business areas. 
With a dengue fever vaccine in development and deals to make and distribute COVID-19 vaccines in Japan, the company could add a new pillar to its business lineup, Weber said. 
""We are in the vaccines business,"" Weber told Reuters in an interview. ""If the dengue vaccine is successful, yes, it would be a sixth one.""
Takeda's current five core businesses are oncology, gastroenterology, neuroscience, rare diseases, and plasma-derived therapies. 
The company looked into making a COVID-19 vaccine, but determined with its mix of technology and capacity, it was a better fit to work with other developers, Weber said.
Takeda agreed last month to distribute 50 million doses of  Moderna  Inc's (O:MRNA) COVID-19 vaccine in Japan. That was on top of a previous deal to produce  Novavax  Inc's (O:NVAX) COVID-19 candidate, aiming to make 250 million doses.
Takeda's dengue vaccine candidate, TAK-003, is on track for regulatory filing in Asia, Latin America, and the European Union by the end of fiscal 2020, the company said last month. The disease is spread by mosquitoes and is estimated to affect 50 million people a year worldwide with 22,000 deaths.
Following the Shire takeover, Takeda reached its asset disposal goal with the sale of its Japanese consumer healthcare business to Blackstone Group (N:BX) for 242 billion yen ($2.31 billion) announced in August. 

The company was not eyeing any more major sell offs, Weber said, saying any such deals would be ""very marginal.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Friday, ending the week on a down note as the wait continues for a victor in the U.S. presidential election.
Democrat Joe Biden holds onto a razor-thin margin, claiming 264 of the 270 electoral votes needed with Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina still counting votes. Incumbent President Donald Trump has 214 votes and has already mounted legal challenges to vote counts in Nevada, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan as well as requesting a recount in Wisconsin.
Trump also questioned the election’s credibility earlier in the day. “If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us,” he said.
Should Biden win the presidency, he faces the additional challenge of a divided Senate. Current forecasts show that Republicans will retain control of the Senate, which will pose a challenge for Democrats to push through stimulus packages with large price tags.
However, expectations of any sort of stimulus package ran high among some investors.
“We still anticipate that there will be a fiscal package in excess of $1 trillion next year … this stimulus, when combined with a long-anticipated COVID-19 vaccine, can really lift the economy and drive growth. We consequently remain very upbeat on the prospects for 2021 and 2022,” ING Group (NYSE:ING) chief international economist James Knightley told Reuters.
Other investors stuck a more restrained note.
“The market reaction to the unfolding election news suggests that financial markets would prefer to see a constrained Biden presidency … the economic backdrop to this election is one of an incomplete global recovery that remains threatened by the continued spread of Covid-19 in many major economies as well as fast-fading fiscal support measures,” Paul O’Connor, head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson Investors, told Bloomberg.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1% by 10:23 PM ET (2:23 AM GMT). South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.06% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Indexinched down 0.07%, both giving up some earlier gains.
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.73%, after the Reserve Bank of Australia said it is prepared to expand bond purchases if needed to support the economy. A deadline for Chinese traders to stop buying at least seven categories of Australian commodities has also arrived, putting Australian exporters on edge as an Australia-China trade dispute continues to unfold.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.45% and the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.07%.
Meanwhile, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressed that the economy needs more fiscal and monetary policy support, and warned that mounting COVID-19 infection rates are a risk, as the Fed handed down its monetary policy on Thursday. The policy saw Fed officials keep interest rates near zero and make no change to asset purchases. The Bank of England also handed down its monetary policy on Thursday.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) plans to sell full-size sport-utility vehicle (SUV) models in China for the first time, and will import a range of models to beef up its product lineup into the world's biggest car market, its China chief told Reuters.
The plan would mark a change of tack for GM, which currently produces all of the vehicles it sells in China within the country, which is set to be the only major economy to grow this year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
GM, China's second-biggest foreign automaker, is aiming to offer four models as it looks to improve its brand image and support a sales recovery: Chevrolet's Tahoe and Suburban, Cadillac's Escalade and the GMC Yukon Denali.
The Detroit-based company is showcasing those models at the China International Import Expo, or CIIE, an annual import show in Shanghai which started on Wednesday and runs into next week.
""Our intention is to get customer reaction and find a way to sell these cars in China,"" said GM's China chief Julian Blissett.
The automaker sees opportunities for such vehicles, partly because Chinese families are expanding, he added. 
""We are looking into a variety of market sales plans for these vehicles, including online sales, leasing and others,"" he said, declining to give a detailed timeframe for the plan. 
GM's Buick and Cadillac mid-size SUVs helped the group's Chinese sales grow 12% in the third quarter this year, the first quarterly growth in the past two years. 
But it does not have full-size SUV models, which usually have a third row of seats and has room for six or seven people.
BATTLEGROUND 
China, where over 25 million vehicles were sold last year, is a crucial battleground for global automakers including Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), the biggest foreign player by sales volumes, GM and Toyota (T:7203) as well as local leaders Geely (HK:0175) and Great Wall (SS:601633).
The country has seen an auto sales pick up in recent months following a COVID-19-induced slump, and authorities say they have largely brought the epidemic under control following its emergence in the central city of Wuhan at the end of last year.
The expansion plan would also mark GM's first official sales in China of GMC vehicles, a premium brand in the group. Previously GMC vehicles were only sold in the country via unofficial grey importers. 
The imports will, however, not change GM's basic production strategy in China. It will still mostly sell vehicles made in China - for now, at least. 
""Depending on however we go we might make other decisions,"" Blissett said.
GM has a Shanghai-based joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104) making Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac vehicles. It has another venture, SGMW, with SAIC and Guangxi Automobile Group, producing no-frills mini-vans, which has started manufacturing higher-end cars.
Blissett said GM expected ""a strong November and December"" in China after positive October sales. The carmaker is also considering exporting China-made electric vehicles globally, he told Reuters. 

The company's rivals, from Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) to BMW (DE:BMWG), are among a growing number of automakers using China as an export hub for electric vehicles.

95,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>","Uber sees slowest recovery of ride business in home U.S. market, deliveries more than double","By Tina Bellon and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) -  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) said on Thursday demand for its food-delivery service exploded in the latest quarter, but recovery in its global rides business is being held back by its most important market, the United States.
Uber's recovery will depend much on the course of the pandemic, with a resurgence in virus infections threatening to keep customers wary about returning outside or planning frequent trips far into 2021.
Ride bookings were dragged down by a slow recovery particularly on the U.S. West Coast, while Europe and the Middle East recovered more steadily, down only 36% from last year.
Ride-hailing customers who have returned are proving to be price-sensitive, pressuring margins in what was once Uber's largest and most important segment.
The company now heavily relies on cost reductions and growth at its food-delivery business, Eats, which is gradually reducing losses but remains a drag to Uber's bottom line.
Quarterly revenue and adjusted loss missed Wall Street expectations, but the company nevertheless affirmed its goal to be profitable on an adjusted basis before the end of 2021.
Uber shares were down 2% in after-hours trading as an adjusted third-quarter EBITDA loss of $625 million was wider than analyst expectations of a $597 million loss, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Non-adjusted earnings per share came in at a loss of 62 cents, compared with a 65-cent loss estimated by analysts.
Gross bookings at Uber's rides mobility unit recovered from their massive drop in April, but remained down 50% from last year on a constant currency basis. But unlike Uber's other units, the rides segment delivered adjusted EBITDA of $245 million.
Uber executives cautioned that ride demand in Europe, which recovered faster than any other region in the quarter, was likely to decline as several countries on the continent reimposed lockdown measures. 
But they said Uber could stomach a continued drop in rides gross bookings of 10% to 20% below pre-pandemic levels and still achieve its profitability target.
Revenue at Uber's delivery unit, including Uber Eats, more than doubled to $1.45 billion, its highest ever, but the unit continues to lose money despite narrowing losses over the past quarters.
On Thursday, company executives told analysts on a conference call that customers continued ordering food through Eats even after their cities or countries eased restrictions in response to the pandemic. But Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi cautioned it was still to early to tell whether that would persist.
Uber continues to spend money to gain market share over food-delivery competitors. The company is hoping to close its $2.65 billion acquisition of smaller delivery rival Postmates in the first quarter of 2021 to expand further.
Overall, Uber recorded $3.13 billion in third-quarter revenue, falling short of analysts' average estimate of $3.2 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Overall, Uber posted a net loss of $1.1 billion in the months from July to September, including stock-based compensation expenses. 
The company has also gradually reduced its stake in noncore business units over the past months. A German company in September acquired Uber's European freight business and Uber has reportedly been seeking options for its Uber Elevate business.
Uber's third-quarter results come just two days after it scored a significant win in its California home market, where voters passed a company-sponsored ballot measure that went at the heart of the gig economy business model Uber helped create.
With a 58% majority, California voters cemented app-based food-delivery and ride-hail drivers' status as independent contractors, not employees entitled to costly benefits including unemployment pay and health insurance.
California drivers instead will receive more limited benefits, including minimum pay rates, healthcare subsidies and accident insurance. 
Uber, its smaller rival  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT), DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates, who jointly spent more than $200 million on the ballot campaign, hope to turn the California decision into a model for the nation.
Khosrowshahi on Thursday said Uber wanted to engage in dialogues with governments and other states about compromise legislation for gig workers. 
Uber is facing challenges by several U.S. states and countries around the world that believe drivers are misclassified and should be employees.

96,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 06:40PM ET</span>",Investors see silver-lining in U.S. election uncertainty,"By Sujata Rao, Tommy Wilkes and Lewis Krauskopf
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A definitive result on the next U.S. president may still be elusive, but two days after Election Day, investors are back in 'buy-everything' mode - counting on Republicans keeping control of the Senate and limiting regulatory change as well as on full central bank support.
Equities spurted ahead with the S&P 500 (SPX) up 4.2% since the close on Tuesday and about 2% below a record high close, while the Nasdaq (IXIC) is just 1.4% off its record. 
Some analysts forecast that the rally would keep going, especially if bond yields, which dramatically reversed post-Election Day, stay low.
""There is ample room for a 10% further rally assuming bond yields and earnings prospects remain where they are,"" Michael Purves, chief executive of Tallbacken Capital Advisors, said in an email.
Democratic challenger Joe Biden edged closer to victory over Donald Trump in the battle for the U.S. presidency, and there was little sign of panic about the possibility of a contested result that may end up in the courts. 
Disappointment over massive stimulus appears to have been replaced by relief that without a Democratic sweep of Congress and the White House, potential gridlock between a Biden administration and a Republican Senate would scupper any plans to tighten the screws on large corporations, particularly in the technology sector. 
A final call on control of the Senate could be up in the air until January.
“The market kind of latched on to this idea that they think they know what the Senate outcome is going to be,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina. ""That made the debate about the president somewhat less important.”
Todd noted that ""you saw lot of money come out of the market to the sidelines ahead of the election"" and it was now flowing back. 
At the same time, some investors held out hope that even more limited fiscal support could benefit other sectors, such as materials and industrials, whose shares rallied on Thursday. Shares in renewable energy - for which Biden has pledged large investment - also surged, reversing steep declines from Wednesday.
""It should not be ignored that even more moderate policy would also be positive for industrials and cyclical recovery plays,"" said Arnim Holzer, macro and correlation defense strategist at EAB Investment Group in Philadelphia.
The market gyrations of the past 36 hours represent some position unwinding, given the tighter-than-expected race, investors said. But with the U.S. and global backdrop one of abundant liquidity and rock-bottom bond yields, flows into equities and company debt are likely to continue. 
(Graphic: Trump timeline - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xlbvgwyzmvq/trumptimeline.png)
That is especially so for the mega-tech firms - shares in Apple (O:AAPL), Amazon (O:AMZN) and Alphabet (O:GOOGL) extended Wednesday's rally. 
For Jonathan Bell, chief investment officer at Stanhope Capital, the outcome was the best of both worlds.
""Biden being elected increases the chances of a fiscal stimulus deal, but (with a Republican Senate) it also reduces the ability for him to push through significant (tax increases) or policies that might constrain the likes of Amazon and Apple,"" Bell said.
""Tech seems to be thinking that the disruptors, most of which are anti-trust regulations, will not be significant and that the Senate will be able to prevent it.""
Similarly, Didier Saint-Georges, member of the Strategic Investment Committee at asset manager Carmignac in Paris, noted the positives for pharmaceutical shares.
The election has done little to alter the broadly positive investment backdrop, Saint-Georges said, adding: ""Moving from Trump to Biden looks like a revolution but in market terms it may not be that significant.""
FED TO THE RESCUE?
Cue central banks. 
Their asset-buying largesse has floored yields and volatility in Treasuries, sending U.S. stocks on a sharp upward path. The S&P 500 index (SPX) has gained some 57% from its March lows and is already up 7% this week.
The bet now is that any fiscal stimulus shortfall may force the Federal Reserve and peers to pick up the slack. 
(Graphic: Central bank balance sheets swell - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklvymajkvg/Pasted%20image%201604589866870.png)
The Fed kept its loose monetary policy intact on Thursday and pledged again to do whatever it can in coming months to sustain a U.S. economic recovery, although Chairman Jerome Powell tamped expectations that its bond buying might be ramped up in coming months. 
Investors are hoping policymakers might provide some stronger guidance of future help.
Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income, said in an email that the Fed's next move will likely be to make more purchases of Treasuries, but ""clearly less stimulus will dull that requirement from here."" 
Still, the Fed for now gets to ""let the focus sit squarely on other actors, or potential actors, as the wheels of change roll on,"" Rieder said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said Thursday it has approved a petition for iHeartMedia Inc (O:IHRT) investors to exceed the U.S. 25% foreign investment cap.
The company, which filed for bankruptcy in 2018 and then went public in 2019, sought approval in 2019 for foreign creditors to exercise special warrants in exchange for stock in the company.
The San Antonio, Texas-based company had struggled with debt that was taken on by its private equity owners in 2008 to finance a $17.9 billion leveraged buyout of Clear Channel Communications Inc. 
The FCC said the petition will ""enable iHeart to be in a
stronger financial condition post-bankruptcy and provide the company greater flexibility to access foreign investment capital, thereby allowing iHeart to better compete with other media companies, enhance its programming, and better serve the public interest.""
iHeart owns about 850 U.S. radio stations in over 160 markets and its iHeartRadio digital service is available on more than 250 platforms and 2,000 devices.
PIMCO Group sought approval to hold up to 32.99% of the equity interest in iHeart. PIMCO group, which includes Irish and German investors is ultimately controlled by Allianz SE (DE:ALVG). Invesco Group sought approval to own up to 19.99% of iHeart. It has two foreign-organized entities based in Bermuda and the United Kingdom within its funds’ vertical chain of control
The FCC said iHeart must obtain commission approval for any
new or additional foreign entities to hold, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the equity.
iHeartMedia shares closed up 6.6% before news of the FCC announcement came after the bell.

(Reuters) - The husband of a former Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) finance manager who leaked confidential information about the online retailer's financial performance pleaded guilty on Thursday to an insider trading charge, the U.S. Department of Justice said.
Prosecutors said Viky Bohra, 36, of Bothell, Washington, pleaded guilty to securities fraud, admitting that from 2015 to 2018 he used tips provided by his wife Laksha to make $1.43 million of illegal profit trading Amazon stock.
Authorities said Laksha Bohra had taken advantage of her job as a senior manager in Amazon's tax department to provide the tips, despite repeated warnings against leaking confidential information.
Viky Bohra then used the tips to make successful trades ahead of Amazon earnings announcements, through accounts tied to him and his father Gotham Bohra, authorities said.
A lawyer for Viky Bohra had no immediate comment.
Under a plea agreement, prosecutors will recommend that Viky Bohra serve no more than 33 months in prison, and agreed that Laksha Bohra will not face criminal charges.
Viky Bohra faces a Feb. 8, 2021 sentencing before U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle, where Amazon is based.
The Bohras settled related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges in September by agreeing to forfeit trading profits and pay a combined $1.11 million in fines.

100,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 05:31PM ET</span>",Carlos Ghosn's accused escape plotters face skeptical U.S. judge in extradition fight,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - A federal judge in Boston said on Thursday she would likely reject a last-ditch effort by two men to avoid being extradited to Japan to face charges that they helped former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd Chairman Carlos Ghosn flee the country.
U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani said she was leaning toward concluding that the U.S. State Department needed to take an additional step before allowing U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Michael Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor, to be handed over to Japan.
But that step, which involves certifying its compliance with obligations to not extradite people to countries where they could face torture, ""isn't a very heavy lift,"" Talwani said.
Assuming the department did so, Talwani said she likely would rule against the Taylors. She voiced skepticism of their lawyers' arguments that they could not be prosecuted in Japan for helping someone ""bail jump.""
""What we have here is a set of conduct that is a crime here and looks like is a crime there,"" she said.
Talwani said she would hold off on lifting an order she issued last week temporarily blocking their extradition until she formally ruled. Defense lawyer Tillman Finley said the Taylors would appeal any ruling against them.
The Taylors were arrested in May at Japan's request. The State Department informed their lawyers last week it had approved turning them over.
Prosecutors say the Taylors helped Ghosn flee Japan on Dec. 29, 2019, hidden in a box and on a private jet before reaching his childhood home, Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.
Ghosn was awaiting trial on charges that he engaged in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. Ghosn has denied wrongdoing.
Prosecutors said the elder Taylor, a private security specialist, and his son received $1.3 million for their services.

110,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 04:11PM ET</span>","Wall Street rallies on bets for divided U.S. Congress, Fed holds steady","By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on Thursday, as investors bet Republicans would retain control of the Senate and block any major policy changes under a possible Joe Biden White House that could dampen corporate profits.
With votes still being counted in battleground states, investors were abandoning cautious pre-election positioning, driving all of Wall Street's main indexes up for a fourth straight session. 
While a fiscal stimulus package is widely expected, the size of any deal reached in a divided Congress is likely to be much smaller than anticipated. This in turn could pressure the U.S. Federal Reserve to pump more funds into the financial system, supporting equity prices.
Stocks got a brief additional boost from the Fed's statement on Thursday. The central bank kept its loose monetary policy intact and again pledged to do whatever it can to sustain an economy severely damaged by the coronavirus pandemic. In the post-statement press conference, Chair Powell said the Fed would not consider directly funding fiscal activities.
Biden was edging closer to victory after winning Michigan and Wisconsin, but his Democratic party appeared unlikely to win the Senate. This eased investor worries about tighter regulations on Big Tech and a corporate tax hike. 
""They stayed with what the market had expected. I think there's concern about the economy and the trajectory of the economy. But basically, I don't think they surprised the market; they maintained their accommodative stance and maintained that fiscal stimulus is needed,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.

The race between Former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump narrowed ever so slightly with an additional vote count released in Nevada, giving the Democrat a slight leg up on his Republican foe.

States have warned that results may not be known for days. As per the memes, welcome to Groundhog Day.
The Federal Open Market Committee held its short-term rate at 0.25%, as expected by analysts.
“Economic activity and employment have continued to recover but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year,” the FOMC said in a statement. ""Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices have been holding down consumer price inflation."" 
Fed officials have spoken publicly in recent months about the need for more stimulus to support a recovery, though Congress has been unable to reach an agreement on a plan to give aid to households and businesses.  
""Over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses,"" according to the statement.

114,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 03:53PM ET</span>","Jobs Report, CVS, Vote Counting: 3 Things to Watch","by Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- U.S. stocks extended their post-election rally on Thursday as investors bet on a win for Democrat Joe Biden.
Leading up to the election earlier this week, value stocks dominated. But the prospect of a new occupant in the White House has put the focus back on fast-growing tech stocks.
Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ Composite notched triple-digit gains despite the lack of a clear election outcome.
With what seems certain to be a new Congress split between the parties -- hence, gridlock -- big spending packages are less likely, as is bold new regulation. 
The dollar retreated as gold prices surged 3% to more than $1,950.
In a grim new reading, new U.S. coronavirus cases topped 100,000 as the pandemic continues to spread. Friday features the jobs report, a barometer of the economic recovery. The Federal Reserve left short-term rates alone at 0.25% this week, and now all eyes are on its December rate meeting.
Here are three things that might affect the markets tomorrow. 
1. As Covid-19 cases spike, investors look to the jobs report
The combination of a reopening economy and an increase in Covid cases will affect the October jobs report, which comes out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
Payrolls are expected to show a gain of 600,000, which would be lower than September’s 661,000. The unemployment rate is expected to tick down to 7.7% from 7.9%.
2. Earnings from CVS Health and Marriott
While retail sales suffered in the second quarter for CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), profit from insurance made up the difference. Investors will be watching to see what the drug store and insurance giant says on Friday. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect earnings per share of $1.33 on revenue of $66 billion.
Hotel giant Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ:MAR), which like the rest of the leisure industry has been reeling from the effects of Covid-19 shutdowns, is expected to report a per-share loss of 8 cents on revenue of $2.2 billion. Investors will be listening to what the company says about the outlook.
3. Election vote counting tallies and legal fights
Several states are still counting ballots in the U.S. presidential election, and results could continue to trickle out Friday and into the weekend. Americans have been glued to their televisions watching the ongoing drama, which includes multiple lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign to stop vote counting and raise questions about the process.
While stocks haven’t been bothered by the lack of a clear outcome, there’s always the chance that a dragged out process could put pressure on markets. The dollar fell on Thursday as the price of gold spiked. Oil was down more than 1%.

The multi-brand car and truck maker, which owns the Bentley, Bugatti, Porsche, Skoda, Lamborghini and Audi brands, is preparing a strategy meeting next week to discuss long-term trends and implications for manufacturing, investment and sales.
""There are several million cars missing in our planning,"" Herbert Diess said at a Bloomberg event webcast on Thursday, adding that sales in some markets are not seen recovering to pre-crisis levels until 2023.
To compensate, Volkswagen will have to slim down its model range, a step which will have implications for some of the carmaker's manufacturing plants, Diess said.
Volkswagen is doubling electric vehicle sales this year and will double them again next year, he said, adding that electrification will encompass even niche brands. 
""Bentley is becoming within the next four to five years an electric brand,"" Diess said. 
Volkswagen is also seeking to catch up with Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) autonomous driving unit Waymo in the race to develop a self-driving vehicle.

The auto industry will see self-driving cars emerge in the next five to 10 years, Diess said, adding that he currently sees VW in second place behind Waymo in terms of technological capability for putting an autonomous car on the road.

Maybelline maker L'Oreal, which returned to comparable sales growth in the third quarter when coronavirus restrictions eased, has sped up some of its web initiatives as a result of the pandemic, its digital chief Lubomira Rochet said.
""There's been an acceleration in all our partnerships due to COVID-19,"" Rochet said in an online presentation on Thursday. 
The Google partnership relies on technology designed by ModiFace, a Canadian augmented reality specialist acquired by L'Oreal in 2018, and will also extend to the U.S. group's YouTube video sharing platform, Rochet said.
People seeking lipsticks or eye shadows by L'Oreal brands, which include Lancome and Urban Decay, who come across their adverts on Google or YouTube can then try them online.
YouTube is one of the go-to sites for cosmetics users who often seek out make-up tutorials online, or want to learn from others how to curl their hair. 
L'Oreal, which already had a ModiFace partnership with social media site Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), has seen usage of virtual make-up tools rise fivefold during COVID-19 lockdowns this year, and the conversion rate from an advert to a purchase was three times higher with the try-ons, Rochet said. 
Consumers used it to mimic hair dye colours in particular during coronavirus shutdowns, Rochet added. 
Many countries in Europe including France and Belgium have now re-entered lockdown, forcing beauty chains and hair salons to close, and hitting travel retail sales.

Online sales of beauty products, especially in China, have made-up for part of the losses and Rochet expects half L'Oreal's sales are likely to come from the web within the next three to seven years, up from around a quarter now.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been ordered to face a proposed class-action lawsuit by shareholders who accused Chief Executive Tim Cook of concealing falling demand for iPhones in China, resulting in billions of dollars of investor losses. 
In a decision on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) said shareholders led by a UK pension fund can sue over Cook's comment on a Nov. 1, 2018, analyst call that while Apple was facing sales pressure in some emerging markets, ""I would not put China in that category.""
Apple told suppliers to curb production a few days after Cook spoke, and on Jan. 2, 2019, unexpectedly cut its quarterly revenue forecast by up to $9 billion, which Cook blamed in part on pressure on China's economy from U.S.-China trade tensions.
The lowered revenue forecast was the first by Cupertino, California-based Apple since the iPhone's launch in 2007. Shares of Apple fell 10% the next day, erasing $74 billion of market value.
Apple and Cook have said there was no proof they defrauded or intended to defraud the plaintiffs. The company did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment.
In a 23-page decision, Rogers said shareholders plausibly alleged that Cook's statements on the analyst call about China were materially false and misleading.
She said that while Cook might not have known specifics about ""troubling signs"" in China that the company had begun seeing, it ""strains credulity"" he would have been in the dark about the trade tensions and their possible impact on Apple.
The plaintiffs raised a ""strong inference"" that Cook knew about the risks when discussing China on the analyst call, and a ""cogent and compelling inference that Cook did not act innocently or with mere negligence,"" Rogers wrote.
Rogers, who works in Oakland, California, also dismissed claims related to demand for the iPhone XS and XS Max.
The plaintiffs are led by the Norfolk County Council as Administering Authority of the Norfolk Pension Fund, located in Norwich, England.

The case is In re Apple Inc Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 19-02033.

In a complaint filed with a federal court in San Francisco, the government called Visa ""a monopolist in online debit transactions,"" and said the proposed acquisition ""would eliminate a nascent competitive threat"" to that monopoly.
Visa said in January it had agreed to buy privately held software startup Plaid Inc in a $5.3 billion deal aimed at boosting the payments giant's access to the booming financial technology sector.
Visa said it ""strongly disagrees"" with the lawsuit, adding that it ""reflects a lack of understanding of Plaid's business and the highly competitive payments landscape in which Visa operates."" The company said it ""intends to defend the transaction vigorously."" 
Visa shares were up more than 2% in midday trading. 
The Justice Department's lawsuit said Visa's chief executive called the acquisition an ""insurance policy” to neutralize a ""threat to our important U.S. debit business."" 
Visa has some 70% of the market for online debit services, while Mastercard (N:MA) is at 25%, the complaint said.
Plaid, a financial technology company with access to financial data from over 11,000 U.S. banks, ""is a threat to this monopoly: it has been developing an innovative new solution that would be a substitute for Visa’s online debit services,"" the Justice Department said.

Plaid is the backbone of financial technology apps like Venmo, which is owned by PayPal, Acorns and Betterment, the government said in its complaint.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Some U.S. stock investors had feared election week turmoil, but voters' decisions at the ballot box helped many stock picking hedge funds extend a year of gains and even set a daily record, according to managers and people familiar with their returns.
Money managers were positioned relatively cautiously coming into the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday, unsure of the future for corporate taxes, stimulus spending and regulation, managers and investors in their funds said.
Instead, investors were treated to a stock market rally fueled by hopes for policy gridlock with Republicans likely keeping the Senate and Democratic challenger Joseph Biden in line to eke out a White House win once all ballots are counted.
""Markets first got nervous about a contested election but now it feels like we are back to the future with some technology stocks that got hurt a few weeks ago coming back,"" said Troy Gayeski, co-chief investment officer at SkyBridge Capital which invests with some of Wall Street's largest hedge funds. ""What we are seeing is an unwinding of the blue wave trade.""
Investors said many hedge funds had eschewed risk in the weeks ahead of the election to avoid getting things really wrong.
""While it was challenging to sit on your hands really not doing anything, it was the right thing to do,"" said Jason Landau, portfolio manager at Waratah Advisors.
Many long/short funds that bet on or against stocks had already been posting high single-digit or low double-digit gains in 2020. These extended their run on Wednesday as the S&P 500 climbed 2.2% and tech heavy NASDAQ rose 3.9%, a trend higher that continued into Thursday's trading.
Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management gained 38% through the end of October, Scott Ferguson's Sachem Head Capital Management, which often presses corporations to perform better, was up 17% through the end of October, Glen Kacher's Light Street Capital scored a 52% gain through October, and David Fiszel's Honeycomb Asset Management was up 45%, people familiar with the numbers said. Representatives for the funds declined to comment.
Robert Romero's Connective Capital, a small technology focused hedge fund, scored a 4% gain on Wednesday, its biggest of the year, leaving the fund up roughly 45% since January.
“We had one of our best days this year today – one of our best days ever, actually,” Romero told Reuters.
Another small hedge fund manager, Regan Investments, said it made gains of 10% in its equity strategy in the year to November 4.
Toronto-based Vantage Asset Management was up 0.6% on Wednesday in its Vantage Performance Fund, bringing gains since January to 7%.
On Thursday votes were still being tallied as Democrat Joe Biden edged closer to victory over Donald Trump for the U.S. presidency.[L1N2HR0BX] But the official who many stock pickers regard as most important was not on any ballot: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has eased investors minds' with promises of low interest rates for a long time.
""We are going to have noise around the election for some time, but the Fed is still going to provide liquidity,"" said Adam Blitz, who puts money into hedge funds as chief investment officer at Evanston Capital, adding ""this is already the strongest year in years for hedge funds.""
This encouraged buying, even of cyclical value stocks like heavy equipment makers and solar stocks, which rose and then retreated along with prospects for a large stimulus plan.
""We believe many of these will start to recover the losses of this morning,"" said hedge fund Esplanade Capital's portfolio manager Shawn Kravetz. ""We are using opportunistic weakness to add to, and bolster, some of our favorite positions.""
Hedge funds, long derided for high fees and low returns, now have a chance to regain investor confidence in a year where the market was continually roiled by health and economic crises, some managers said.

""Hedge funds need dispersion and volatility to perform and finally they are getting that at a time they are needed to diversify portfolios,"" said Darren Wolf, Head of Hedge Funds at Aberdeen Standard Investments.

123,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>","GM to boost spending on EVs, funded by expanded pickup production","By Ben Klayman and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra said Thursday the automaker will boost capital spending over the next three years to speed development of electric vehicles, funded by expanded production of high-profit pickup trucks in North America.
Barra said GM was talking with automakers about partnerships to develop more vehicles using GM's battery technology. 
GM plans EVs ""across our brands ... into affordable high volume segments,"" she said.
The automaker's EV push is being funded by robust profit from sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in North America, which drove a stronger-than-expected third quarter profit. GM said it will invest C$1 billion to overhaul an idle plant in Oshawa, Ontario, to expand pickup production, under a tentative agreement with its Canadian union.
""We're going to go hard at EVs ... and the North America performance allows us to do that,"" she told analysts on a call. 
The Detroit company, whose shares were up about 2% in midday trading, also said it would generate cash flow of $7 billion to $9 billion during the second half of the year, as sales in its two largest markets recovered more quickly than anticipated during the global coronavirus pandemic. 
Acting Chief Financial Officer John Stapleton said GM will boost annual capital spending through at least 2023 to above the $7 billion rate previously outlined to fund its accelerated EV plans. 
Barra told reporters in an earlier call that third-quarter results were driven by ""the faster and stronger-than-expected industry recovery in the U.S. and China.""
Given the economic uncertainty over the impact of the pandemic and the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, she added: ""There are a lot of moving pieces right now, but we're hopeful that we'll continue to have a strong recovery"" in the fourth quarter. 
She said uncertainty over the outcome of the election had been expected and cited greater concern over spiking coronavirus cases in the United States. 
GM reported net income of $4 billion, or $2.78 a share in the quarter, compared with $2.35 billion, or $1.60 a share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, GM earned $2.83 a share, above the $1.38 a share analysts had expected. Its forecast for the second half of the year, implied fourth-quarter operating earnings in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.7 billion.
GM's third-quarter EBIT-adjusted margin in North America jumped 6.5 points to 14.9% in the quarter, reflecting the strength of its high-margin pickups and SUVs.
GM repaid $5.2 billion of its revolving credit facilities during the third quarter, and an additional $3.9 billion in October. It expects to repay the balance by year-end. 
Earlier, both  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings.

Barra said GM remained in talks with electric and fuel cell vehicle maker  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA), but a deal to build EV pickups and supply fuel cells to the startup had not been finalized.

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) -  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) has offered to allow rivals non-discriminatory access to clearing and data to try and win over antitrust regulators investigating its $27 billion bid for data provider Refinitiv, people familiar with the matter said.
The pledge is part of a package submitted to the European Commission earlier on Thursday, which also included the sale of its Borsa Italiana operations to pan-European exchange  Euronext  (PA:ENX).
The European Union competition enforcer is concerned that creating a more vertically integrated company that combines the origination and distribution of data, and strengthening areas like clearing would make it easy to lock out competitors or to keep prices for data too high, the people said.
The LSE declined to comment.
The Commission had narrowed its list of concerns in its charge sheet known as a statement of objections sent to LSE last month, one of the people said, suggesting that even worries about so-called ""partial foreclosure"" of data are not very strong.
Partial foreclosure refers to an ability of vertically integrated groups to hamper rival access to services or reduce the incentive to compete.
Concessions to address these vertical concerns are typically licensing access or ""behavioural"" remedies, they said, meaning the LSE is now likely to escape structural remedies beyond the sale of Borsa Italiana.
Refinitiv is 45% owned by  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), the parent company of Reuters News.
A European Commission filing on Thursday said that the London exchange group has offered concessions.
The EU executive body, which oversees competition policy in the 27-nation bloc, will now have until Jan. 15 to make a decision. It had previously set a deadline of Dec. 16.
On Tuesday shareholders in the LSE voted in favour of selling Borsa Italiana to Euronext for 4.3 billion euros, contingent on Brussels approving the takeover of Refinitiv.
LSE CEO David Schwimmer said last month that the sale of Borsa will contribute significantly to addressing EU competition concerns.

The EU executive will now seek feedback from rivals and customers on the LSE's proposed remedies as soon as Friday, before deciding whether to accept the offer or demand more.

125,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 11:40AM ET</span>",New York Times warns of easing growth after news storm boosts results,"(Reuters) - The  New York Times  (N:NYT) warned on Thursday its robust digital growth may not be sustainable going ahead, easing expectations after reporting a strong quarter that benefited from a news coverage storm around the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. election.
The company's shares fell 5% on the sobering outlook, even as it achieved the key milestone of generating more revenue from digital sign-ups than print subscriptions.
""2020 is an outlier year. So I don't think you should expect us to get to the same place we are getting in 2020 given the extraordinary nature of the news cycle,"" Chief Executive Officer Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Kopit Levien said on an earnings call with analysts.
Heightened interest in the U.S. presidential election brought 120 million readers to its digital platform on Wednesday alone and over 75 million the day before, Kopit Levien added.
New York Times said it added 393,000 paid digital-only subscribers during the quarter. Of this, 275,000 subscribed for its digital news product, while the remaining were for its popular cooking, games and audio products.
The paper has focused for years on online subscriptions to offset an industry-wide decline in print readership and fickle advertising revenues.
The media company warned of a 30% decline in advertising revenue in the fourth quarter, but said it expects digital-only subscription revenue to rise about 35%.
Advertising sales have been unpredictable as companies slash budgets to cope with a sharp drop in business due to cronavirus-led lockdowns.
New York Times competes with tech giants like  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google as well as other national news publishers to attract advertisers.
Total revenue slipped 0.4% to $426.9 million, but came in above analysts' estimates of $411.8 million, according to Refinitiv data.

Excluding items, the company earned 22 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 11 cents.

130,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 10:55AM ET</span>",Trump administration asks court for extension to respond to refiners' biofuel petition,"By Stephanie Kelly
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court this week for an extension to respond to a petition from oil refiners requesting that the court review a decision that cast doubt on a program exempting refiners from biofuel blending obligations.
The government's request would push their response deadline to Dec. 14 from Nov. 12, according to a letter to the court dated Wednesday. The request comes as the Trump administration has delayed a slew of decisions related to U.S. biofuel laws, choosing to wait until after the U.S. presidential election to decide on politically sensitive matters.
Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners must blend billions of gallons of biofuels into their fuel, or buy credits from those that do. If refiners can prove the obligations would cause them financial harm, they can get waivers from their requirements.
The Trump administration has about quadrupled the number of exemptions it grants to refiners, angering farmers and ethanol producers, who say the waivers hurt demand for their products. The oil industry says the exemptions help against the too-pricey obligations.
In January, an appeals court handling a case initiated by the biofuel industry, ruled that waivers granted to small refineries after 2010 should only be approved as extensions. Because most recipients of waivers in recent years have not continuously received them year after year, the decision threatened to upend the waiver program.
Then in September, oil refiners petitioned the Supreme Court to review the decision.

The administration's request for an extension could postpone already delayed decisions around the RFS. The Trump administration has not decided how to handle exemptions for the 2019 compliance year. It also has yet to set volumes for next year's biofuel blending mandates under the RFS ahead of a looming Nov. 30 deadline.

COMMENTS:
JEREMY SCHWARTZ, HEAD OF GLOBAL RESEARCH AT WISDOM TREE
""If the Republicans keep the Senate it doesn't matter who is president.
The market was expecting a very strong fiscal impulse, offset by higher taxes and that might have led to selling by some people. But as that has come off, tech (sector) has really run. There is an expectation that Biden will have a collaborative tone with (senate majority leader Mitch) McConnell, coming to an agreement about passing some stimulus and taking tax hikes off the table.
So you keep the positive of low tax rates and a collaborative spirit which could bring some stimulus.
Markets will look past some of developments such as Trump contesting the election results, as long as there are no other ramifications such as social unrest that spirals out of control.""
JOHN PETRIDES, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, TOCQUEVILLE ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK
""Nothing is set on stone yet but the market is getting what it wanted and that is Republicans holding the Senate and a Biden victory. That was one of the best case scenarios that the market was looking for.
""By having the Republicans in the Senate, even though we don't know who the president is, it basically enforces that if Biden is elected president, he'll have a harder time passing through his tax plan which was to raise corporate. ""
""Now investors just need to set their expectations that it could be still several more days if not longer until we know who the official president is. If Biden does squeak out in some of these states, president Trump already has an army of attorneys to fight the process. Presumably if it were to flip and Trump were to pull it out, Biden would do the same and contest the result.
We need to be patient here to see who will be President but if Republicans were to win the Senate, that I think that is key and that's why the markets are responding so positively.""
PAUL EITELMAN, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS, SEATTLE
""A protracted period with no known result could inject volatility into financial markets. What we do know is that the U.S. and global economy are both still in the early innings of a new cyclical expansion. Politics offers plenty of surprises, but there are some very powerful economic forces already at work that don’t care at all about who is in the White House.""
FRANCESCA FORNASARI, HEAD OF CURRENCY SOLUTIONS, INSIGHT INVESTMENT, LONDON
""The market is still trying to get its head around the what this result means and the uncertainty is likely to continue until we know who will be the next President. If any contesting is limited to recounting votes, we would expect the impact to be short lived; but if it becomes longer-lasting and adversarial by going through the Courts, then I suspect that will have longer term repercussions and safe haven currencies will outperform vs the US dollar.""
ROBERT WOLF, FOUNDER, 32 ADVISORS, NEW YORK, NY
""A split election with a Biden Presidency along with a GOP led Senate will lead to growth oriented stimulus such as infrastructure but without the likelihood of overly burdensome regulations nor big tax reform legislation being passed. It will also bring on a less volatile and much welcomed environment bringing the end to a White House governing by Twitter.""
NOEL DIXON, GLOBAL MACRO STRATEGIST, STATE STREET GLOBAL MARKETS, BOSTON, MA
""As the market sees it gridlock equals the opportunity to still pursue stimulus but constrain Biden from any major progressive impulses - higher taxes, higher regulation. The tones coming from McConell will be critical once the dust settles and Biden remains on top""
FRÉDÉRIQUE CARRIER, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, RBC WEALTH MANAGEMENT
""While the equity market typically prefers gridlock, this isn’t always the case. Market participants have been clamoring for another large COVID-19 fiscal stimulus package, and have also begun to get their hopes up for an infrastructure spending package. These bills would probably be more modest in size and scope with a divided Congress. Fiscal stimulus could be delayed until after the inauguration, and an infrastructure package is no guarantee.""
""But we think gridlock would be perceived positively for certain sectors. For example, it would mean that far-reaching fossil fuel, health care, and financial industry regulations would be much less likely. We also doubt the Tech and Communication Services sectors at large would face serious regulatory challenges, although select companies could continue to face scrutiny in the near term.""
PETER LEGER, GLOBAL FRONTIERS PORTFOLIO MANAGER, CORONATION FUND MANAGERS, SOUTH AFRICA
""A Democrat win in the U.S. does not mean a stronger dollar, so currencies around the world get a break and we see the dollar weaken and you have currencies strengthening in a number of other markets, so from a returns perspective it's very supportive for emerging markets.""
The trade hostility we started seeing reduces, which is beneficial to any open global economies.""
JUSTIN ONUEKWUSI, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, LEGAL & GENERALINVESTMENT MANAGERS, LONDON
""The Fed today is a bit of a sideshow, but there is a chanceit may strengthen forward guidance around potential QE, and thatwould be dollar-negative as you may also have less fiscalstimulus coming. Another thing that makes us medium-termnegative on the dollar is whether you see a weaker United statesfrom a political perspective going forward. If (post-electionwrangling) goes on for weeks or months, with Republicansrefusing to accept the results, that's not positive from apolitical perspective.""
DIDIER SAINT-GEORGES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, CARMIGNAC, PARIS 
""There is a lot of position-squaring going on and we shouldnot fall into the mistake of reasoning out moves every hour.Things like green energy are long-term trends which willcontinue.""
""Compared to what was anticipated, some (Treasury yield)curve flattening may make sense, but even if some ratespositions were unwound, we should not get carried away trying tosee a reversal. One takeaway is that regulatory risk to thepharma sector has reduced. Pharma has been a laggard this year,so we may see some catch-up.""
JONATHAN BELL, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, STANHOPE CAPITAL,LONDON
""The outcome of the election in terms of the potential for aDemocratic president and a Republican Senate is many ways thebest news for markets because it prevents more extremepolicies."" 
""Biden being elected increases the chances of a fiscalstimulus deal, but (with a Republican Senate) it also reducesthe ability for him to push through significant tax rises orpolicies that might constrain the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) interms of competition authority. The push for him to increaseanti-trust measures is limited and that's perhaps why we'reseeing the Nasdaq rise.""
SIMON CARLTON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CARLTON JAMES GROUP,LONDON
""If you look at the numbers, trends, previous cycles,unemployment numbers -- a double-dip recession is coming, and Idon't think either president, whoever gets in, is going to stopthat. Because I think a correction is not only likely, but is arequirement of these economic cycles. And the COVID dip wasshort-lived and there are so many different factors to take intoaccount that I don't think we've seen the actual correction asof yet.""

China's surprise suspension of Ant Group's planned $37 billion Shanghai initial public offering (IPO) was seen by some analysts and investors as an attempt by Beijing to cut founder Jack Ma and his financial services empire down to size.
Alibaba (HK:6688) Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said during an earnings call that added that Alibaba is ""actively evaluating"" the impact of the Ant Group IPO's suspension on its business and will ""take appropriate measures accordingly"".
Ant Group said separately it would decide whether to restart its IPO after fully reviewing and evaluating relevant measures. 
Alibaba's results also coincided with markets awaiting the outcome of the U.S. presidential election results, with Democrat Joe Biden edging closer to victory.
Under Donald Trump, the world's top two economies have clashed over trade, forcing some Chinese companies to put off U.S. IPOs and list on exchanges close to home.
Revenue at Alibaba's cloud computing business, a focus area for the company, jumped 60% to 14.9 billion yuan, while sales from its core e-commerce business rose 29% to 130.92 billion yuan in the reported quarter.
Net income fell 63% to 26.52 billion yuan, as Alibaba had booked a one-off gain last year from its 33% stake in Ant Group.
Revenue rose 30% to 155.06 billion yuan in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to estimates of 154.74 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares (N:BABA) , which have gained about 39% this year, fell nearly 4% in trading before the bell.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A World Health Organization-led scheme to supply COVID-19 drugs to poor countries is betting on experimental monoclonal antibody treatments and steroids but is shunning Gilead's (O:GILD) remdesivir blockbuster therapy, an internal document shows.
The WHO draft document, seen by Reuters and dated Oct. 30, says the priorities are to secure monoclonal antibodies in a tight market and to boost purchases and distribution of cheap steroid dexamethasone, of which it has already booked nearly 3 million courses of treatment for poorer countries.
Monoclonal antibodies are manufactured copies of antibodies created by the body to fight an infection. 
The paper, which for the first time outlines how the scheme would spend donors' money, does not cite remdesivir among priority drugs - a significant omission as the antiviral is the only other medication alongside dexamethasone approved across the world for treating COVID-19.
Gilead Science (O:GILD), the U.S. company that developed remdesivir, said the WHO scheme had not funded its COVID-19 trials and had never approached the firm for the possible inclusion of the drug in its portfolio.
The drug-supply scheme is one of the four pillars of the so-called ACT Accelerator, a WHO-led project which also seeks to secure COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics and protective gear for poorer countries by raising more than $38 billion by the beginning of 2022.
""Immediate priorities for the (therapeutics) pillar are intensifying efforts on monoclonal antibodies while scaling up dexamethasone use,"" says the WHO document, still subject to changes and expected to be published on Friday or next week.
The drug-supply scheme, co-led by the Wellcome Trust, a charity, and Unitaid, a health partnership hosted by the WHO, urgently needs $6.1 billion, $750 million of which by February, out of a total ask of $7.2 billion.
More than half the money needed urgently would be used to procure and distribute monoclonal antibodies, the document shows, saying these therapeutics could have a ""game-changing"" impact but are in short supply.
No drug based on monoclonal antibodies has yet been approved against COVID-19, but the WHO scheme has already invested in research on the new technology and has secured production capacity at a plant of Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies in Denmark.
Fujifilm was not immediately available for a comment.
The scheme wants to spend $320 million to produce antibodies in that facility, the document says, estimating that would be enough to secure at least 4 million antibody courses assuming upper-range procurement costs of $80 per course.
A spokeswoman for Unitaid, speaking on behalf of the co-leaders of the scheme, confirmed that it wanted to raise and invest $320 million in securing monoclonal antibodies but declined to comment on potential commercial deals citing confidential agreements. 
Another $110 million would be used for regulatory approval and other market preparation procedures for monoclonal antibodies in poorer countries, the document shows, while $220 million would fund clinical trials of monoclonal antibodies and COVID-19 drugs projects in poorer countries. 
Among companies developing monoclonal antibodies against COVID-19 are U.S. pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (N:LLY), Switzerland's  Novartis  (S:NOVN) and U.S. firm Regeneron (O:REGN), whose antibodies were administered together with remdesivir to U.S. President Donald Trump in October when he tested positive for the coronavirus. 
Eli Lilly has already agreed to produce antibodies at the Fujifilm plant from April and make them available at ""an affordable price"" to poorer countries, a company spokeswoman said.
Lilly's drug is being trialled and is seeking emergency authorisation in the United States.
A U.S. government-run trial of the drug was paused in mid-October over safety concerns, but other trials continue. In spite of the suspension, the U.S. administration said last week it had sealed a $375-million supply deal.
It is unclear how and whether the WHO scheme will raise the money needed for the supply of antibodies and other projects.
Regeneron was not immediately available for comment.
Novartis (S:NOVN), which expects results soon from a trial of its arthritis treatment canakinumab against COVID-19, said on Thursday that it received a request several days ago from the WHO scheme seeking information about medicines to tackle the coronavirus. Novartis also makes dexamethasone. 
REMDESIVIR? NO, THANKS
Despite being short of funds, the WHO drugs-supply scheme wants to ""transform the treatment landscape"", the document says, and distribute hundreds of millions of courses of COVID-19 drugs to poorer countries by 2022.
Apart from monoclonal antibodies and dexamethasone, it is also planning to develop and secure experimental drugs, including new antivirals and repurposed drugs.
The scheme wants to spend another $100 million to seal deals with unspecified drugmakers from mid-2021, the document says, and next year plans to invest another $4.4 billion to secure drugs showing positive results in clinical trials. 
The Unitaid spokeswoman said that among repurposed therapeutics, dexamethasone and its alternative, hydrocortisone, were the most promising.
Remdesivir, alternatively known as Veklury, is also a repurposed antiviral which was initially trialled against Ebola.
Unitaid confirmed the scheme had not procured or funded remdesivir. It did not comment on whether it may buy the drug in future or on why remdesivir did not appear among priority treatments in the document.
Remdesivir has been authorised in dozens of countries around the world to treat COVID-19. However, preliminary findings of a major WHO-sponsored trial revealed in October the antiviral had little or no benefit for COVID-19 patients, contradicting previous positive trials.

Governments however continue to buy it, with Germany this week announcing the purchase of more than 150,000 doses for the next six months.

138,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Alibaba’s Slowing Sales Spook Investors Already On Edge Over Ant,"(Bloomberg) --  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.’s revenue grew at its slowest pace on record for a September quarter, underscoring how the e-commerce giant’s post-pandemic rebound is starting to plateau.
Asia’s largest corporation reported a 30% rise in sales in the September quarter, in line with expectations but down a tad from the previous three months. That did little to reassure investors worried about the tightening regulatory scrutiny that forced Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. to call off its $35 billion IPO. Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang would only say it’s evaluating the impact on its business from more stringent rules governing its 32%-owned sister company.
Alibaba’s shares slid more than 4% in New York, extending a volatile streak that began with a $68 billion U.S. selloff. The company enjoys a close relationship with Ant, whose Alipay mobile wallet anchors the majority of Alibaba’s e-commerce transactions and whose microlending services drive consumption. In response to a question about the extent to which Ant loans lead to online shopping, executives said the company doesn’t quantify that traffic.
“As Ant Group’s major shareholder, Alibaba is actively evaluating the impact on our business in response to the recently proposed changes in the fintech regulatory environment, and will take appropriate measures accordingly,” Zhang told analysts on a conference call.

Alibaba booked almost 4.7 billion yuan of profit from Ant in the September quarter, a big chunk of its overall bottom line. The e-commerce giant reported revenue for the three months ended September of 155.1 billion yuan ($23.4 billion), meeting the 154.8 billion yuan average of estimates. Profit fell 60% to 28.8 billion yuan from a year earlier, when it booked a one-time gain from the acquisition of its stake in Ant.
Alibaba had benefited from stronger sales in its home market, which had led the global recovery from Covid-19. Gross domestic product grew 4.9% last quarter, making China the world’s only major growth engine. The e-commerce titan is banking on more than a quarter of a million brands, increased discounting and technologies like livestreamed selling to draw consumers to its annual blockbuster Single’s Day shopping festival, which culminates next week.
“The performance of Singles Day might be a more important benchmark to look at, rather than the third quarter result,” said Steven Zhu, an analyst with Pacific Epoch. “E-commerce is the only sector that will actually benefit from coronavirus, simply due to the fact that a lot of normal consumption is shifted from offline to online.”

Alibaba’s shares have gained roughly 60% from their Covid-19-era lows in March and touched a record high in October when Ant priced its IPO. Retail and institutional investors had flocked to the record $35 billion-plus IPO, betting that Ant will overcome high valuations, regulatory headwinds and rising competition to reshape the future of global finance.
Alibaba’s core commerce business should expand at a compound annual growth rate of 23% from 2021 to 2023, CGS-CIMB analysts including Lei Yang wrote. Growing regulatory scrutiny over Ant’s lending business shouldn’t exert a great impact on Alipay, they wrote.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Alibaba may continue to benefit from accelerated user and merchant adoption of online grocery shopping, cloud computing and remote-work applications, driven by China’s Covid-19 outbreak. Its domestic retail marketplaces have fully recovered from the pandemic. Longer-term sales and profit growth could be driven by global expansion and the monetization of newer business segments such as logistics, media and entertainment.

Revenue for Alibaba’s cloud division jumped 60% in the quarter, driven by demand from customers in the internet, finance and retail industries. The unit is forecast to turn profitable for the first time ever in the year ending March, Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu said earlier. That will be a milestone for the decade-old business, which competes with the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) globally and is fending off upstarts like Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. at home.
To capitalize on the boom in online groceries, Alibaba last month paid about $3.6 billion to double its stake in Sun Art Retail Group (OTC:SURRY) Ltd., taking control of one of China’s largest hypermarts to try and fend off rivals like JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. Other competitors are also challenging Alibaba’s pole position, ranging from upstart  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc. to Tencent-backed Meituan.

139,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 09:32AM ET</span>",Wall Street Surges at Open Again; Dow up 357 Points,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S stock markets surged at the open again on Thursday, shrugging off another gloomy set of weekly jobless claims data and concentrating on the prospect of a new post-election world without either the extremes of either Donald Trump or Nancy Pelosi.
The race for the White House has still not been decided, although Joe Biden has strengthened his position with narrow wins in Michigan and Wisconsin. President Donald Trump meanwhile, has already launched multiple legal actions to stop the counting of votes he considers illegal,  and has demanded a formal recount in Wisconsin.
Meanwhile, The Hill reported earlier that House Democrats are considering a new leader after their surprising losses in the House on Tuesday and their failure to achieve a clear victory in the Senate. Those results have been interpreted by many as a rejection of the party's more left-wing ideas.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 357 points, or 1.3%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.7% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 2.2%.
All three indexes had risen sharply on Wednesday in the aftermath of the election as it became apparent that the Democratic Party’s showing in Congressional elections was likely to restrict its ability to push through radical progressive reforms.
Among individual stocks, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rose 3.1% on the morning after a filing showing that founder Jeff Bezos has now sold $10 billion worth of stock this year, a sharp acceleration over previous years. Whether Bezos was pre-empting a possible rise in capital gains tax under a Democratic Congress isn't clear. 
Amazon's Chinese counterpart  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) fared less well, losing another 3.8% to its lowest in over a month after results that showed a clear slowdown in sales growth. Both Alibaba and Amazon have been big winners of the pandemic, which has accelerated the shift into the digital world for many companies and shoppers. However, sentiment toward Alibaba has clouded over since Chinese regulators suspended the blockbuster IPO of its financial services affiliate Ant Group earlier this week.
Elsewhere, General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock rose 3.6% after it reported a $4 billion profit in the third quarter, some 60% above forecasts. The company notched an operating margin of 15% in its home market in North America. For context, that's over 13 times Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s third-quarter profit of $300 million.  At $400 billion, Tesla's market value is still eight times that of GM.
Gold miner Barrick (NYSE:GOLD) stock rose 6.2% after it reported record revenues thanks to the surge in gold prices during the quarter.
Earlier, the Labor Department had said the number of Americans filing initial jobless claims stuck stubbornly above 750,000 last week, a day ahead of an official labor market report for October that is likely to show a sharp slowdown in hiring from September. 
The numbers may elicit some comment from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in his press conference at 2:30 PM ET, after the Federal Reserve's policy meeting. The Fed isn't widely expected to change policy so close to the election, but the Bank of England joined the Reserve Bank of Australia overnight in increasing monetary stimulus to their respective economies, while the European Central Bank last week all-but confirmed it would do so at its December meeting.

141,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 09:10AM ET</span>",Airbnb to make IPO filing public next week despite COVID-19 surge: sources,"By Joshua Franklin and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - Airbnb Inc plans to make its IPO registration public next week, putting it on course for a New York stock market debut in December even as the COVID-19 pandemic intensifies, two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The U.S. home rental company's planned debut on the Nasdaq is set to be one of the largest stock market listings of 2020, amid a pandemic that has seen demand for house rentals surge as vacationers snub hotels to practice social distancing. 
Airbnb's initial public offering filing will give outsiders their first detailed look into Airbnb's business, shedding light on the company's reinvention after the coronavirus outbreak pushed it to shift focus from city apartments to holiday homes. 
The United States set a one-day record for new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, with at least 102,591 new infections reported, according to a Reuters tally.
Airbnb plans to set an IPO price range and kick off an investor roadshow in December, the sources said, cautioning that the timing is subject to market conditions. 
Reuters reported last month that Airbnb was aiming to raise around $3 billion, and that it could achieve a valuation of more than $30 billion in the IPO.
The U.S. election diminished uncertainty for IPO hopefuls this week, as the prospect of a divided government that would not raise taxes fueled a stock market rally. The CBOE volatility index (VIX), a gauge for short-term volatility that is closely monitored by IPO candidates, has hit a two-week low after spiking to a four-month high in the run-up to the election.
It is already a blockbuster year for IPOs, with the likes of record label  Warner Music Group  (O:WMG), data analytics firm Palantir Technologies (N:PLTR) and data warehouse company  Snowflake Inc  (N:SNOW) going public this year.
It would follow a dramatic recovery from earlier this year. Airbnb secured emergency funding from investors, including Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners, in April, amid the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company said in July that customers had booked more than one million nights in a single day for the first time since March 3. 

Shares of U.S. online travel agency Booking Holdings Inc (O:BKNG), which some Airbnb investors use as a conservative public market proxy for its own stock, have rebounded more than 50% in the past eight months.

142,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 08:40AM ET</span>",How billionaire Jack Ma fell to earth and took Ant's mega IPO with him,"By Keith Zhai, Julie Zhu and Cheng Leng
SINGAPORE/HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - They say talk is cheap. Tell that to Jack Ma.
Corporate China's shiniest star was just days away from seeing his Ant Group list on the stock market in a record $37 billion deal, when he chose to launch a blistering public attack on the country's financial watchdogs and banks.
The regulatory system was stifling innovation and must be reformed to fuel growth, billionaire Ma told a summit in Shanghai on Oct. 24 attended by the great and the good of China's financial, regulatory and political establishment.
Chinese banks, he said, operated with a ""pawnshop"" mentality. 
It was this speech that set off a chain of events that ultimately torpedoed the listing of Ant, the fintech titan Ma founded, according to interviews with government officials, company executives and investors. They all requested anonymity to disclose confidential details. 
Stung by the attack, Chinese regulators and Communist Party officials set about reining in Ma's sprawling financial empire, culminating in the suspension of the IPO on Tuesday, two days before the eagerly awaited market debut in Shanghai and Hong Kong, the sources said. 
While Ma might not have realised the impact his words would have, people close to him had been baffled to learn in advance about the tone of the speech he planned to deliver, according to two sources close to Ma. 
They suggested the 56-year-old soften his remarks as some of China's most senior financial regulators were due to attend, but he refused to budge, believing he should be able to say what he wanted, the sources said.
""Jack is Jack. He just wanted to speak his mind,"" said one of the people.
It was a costly miscalculation. 
Several senior financial regulatory officials were furious at Ma's criticism, two sources told Reuters, with one source characterising the speech as a ""punch in their faces"".
State regulators started compiling reports including one on how Ant had used digital financial products like Huabei, a virtual credit card service, to encourage poor and young people to build up debt, according to the two people.
The general office of the State Council compiled a report on public sentiment about Ma's speech and submitted it to senior leaders including President Xi Jinping, the sources said.
Some of the reports indicated public sentiment was negative on Ma and his remarks, the people said.
Top Chinese leaders then became more involved and asked for a thorough investigation of the company's business activities, which eventually led to the halting of the world's biggest IPO, three of the sources said.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, China Securities Regulatory Commission, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange，and the State Council Information Office did not immediately reply to Reuters requests for comment.
Ma could not immediately be reached by Reuters for comment and e-commerce group  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), which handles media inquiries for Ma, did not respond to a request for comment on this story from its lead founder.
The chance of the flotation getting back on track in the near-term is slim, according to six of the people, as regulators look to tighten scrutiny of the company. No listing is expected for at least the next few months, two said.
SCRUTINY INTENSIFIES
It was a stunning reversal for Ma, who would have added at least $27 billion to his net worth from the IPO. 
In years gone by, most regulators had left the billionaire to his own devices, partly because of his close ties to some senior government officials, according to five of the sources, but also because of national pride in his success.
Ma, a former English teacher, is one of China's internet pioneers, building an e-commerce empire with Alibaba and a fintech giant with Ant.
When the PBOC tried to regulate Ant's payment and wealth management business about five years ago, Ma bypassed the central bank after failing to reach a consensus with regulatory officials and lobbied the central government. The PBOC later dropped those regulation plans. 
""Jack Ma did not bypass the customary process of communicating with relevant regulators regarding Ant's payment and wealth management business,"" Ant's spokeswoman said in an emailed response to Reuters.
But with his Oct. 24 speech, Ma misjudged the shifting priorities of Beijing, according to one senior regulatory source, believing he could challenge the financial establishment yet retain the support of the central leadership.
The bigger picture was that one of the government's main aims this year is to shore up the country's financial sector and tighten regulatory oversight to prevent systemic risks in a pandemic-hit economy, the person said.
Even before Ma's speech, Chinese regulators were gradually increasing their oversight of Ant, which has largely thrived as a technology platform free from costly banking regulations despite its bouquet of financial offerings.
The scrutiny has particularly intensified for the company's rapidly growing online consumer-lending business, a cash cow, which sources demand from retail consumers and small businesses and passes that on to about 100 banks for underwriting.
REGULATORS MAKE MOVE
The Shanghai speech was the trigger for a major escalation, according to half of the dozen people interviewed, prompting senior political officials to ask regulators, including the central bank and China's top banking regulator, for the thorough review of Ant's businesses. 
The watchdogs, who had for years wanted to rein in Ma's fintech empire, moved fast after receiving written instructions from officials including Vice Premier Liu He, a trusted economic adviser to President Xi, said two of the people.
The State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment from Liu.
As part of this drive, regulatory officials rushed to publish a consultation paper this Monday to tighten rules for the country's micro-lending business, which directly impacts Ant, said one person with direct knowledge. 
The draft requires micro-lenders to fund at least 30% of any loan they fund jointly with banks. Only 2% of the loans Ant had facilitated as of end-June were on its balance sheet, its IPO prospectus showed.
Top Chinese industry players including Ant and Lufax Holding Ltd, an online wealth management platform, were aware of the draft details weeks before its public release, said two of the people.
Lufax, which raised $2.4 billion in a New York IPO last month, had informed investors that regulators had required leading online micro-lenders to provide about 20%-30% of any loan they fund jointly with banks, according to two investors who joined its roadshow.
Lufax declined to comment due to quiet period restrictions following its IPO. 
By contrast, Ant's executives did not mention the possible regulatory changes during its two main calls with global investors during its roadshow last week, two other investors said.
Ant's spokeswoman said the company was not aware of the details of the draft online micro-lending rules until they were published on Monday.
HUBRIS AND HUMILITY
After the publication of the micro-lending consultation paper, Ma and the two top Ant executives were summoned to a rare joint meeting with four regulatory bodies.
They were told that the company, notably its consumer-lending business, would face tougher scrutiny over matters including capital adequacy and leverage ratios. 
Regulators had been surprised by the scale and risk model of Ant's lending division, details of which were disclosed in the IPO-related filings since late August. The unit, which includes Huabei and short-term consumer loan provider Jiebei, contributed close to 40% of the group's revenue in the first half of the year.
A day later, the Shanghai stock exchange said it had suspended Ant's IPO, citing a ""significant change"" in the regulatory environment, prompting the company to also freeze the Hong Kong leg of its dual listing.
China's securities industry watchdog said subsequently that recent regulatory changes could have a ""major impact"" on Ant's business structure and profit model. It said suspending the IPO was a responsible move both for investors and markets.
The suspension marked the nadir of what has been a gradually souring relationship over recent years between Ma's corporate empire and Chinese regulators, from the central bank to the internet and markets watchdogs.
After the announcement, however, Ant released a statement in which it pledged to ""embrace"" regulation.

""It has no alternative but to do so,"" Gavekal Research analyst Andrew Batson wrote in a report this week. ""Ma's hubris has now morphed into humility.""

Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) Inc., Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) Inc. and Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) Inc. led the advance, with double-digit gains. Aurora shares rose almost 30%, while Tilray advanced 24%. Shares in Aphria, which operates mainly in Canada, rose 15% in pre-market trading after the company said it plans to buy a craft brewing company to expand into the U.S. ahead of a potential move to legalize.
The ETFMG Alternative Harvest exchange-traded fund, or MJ, climbed 10% in early trading after closing down 3.1% on Wednesday. The gains follow ballot passages in Arizona, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota, which will now add to 44 states that allow marijuana for medical or recreational purposes.
Boris Jordan, chairman of Curaleaf Holdings (OTC:CURLF) Inc., one of the largest cannabis companies, said on Wednesday the state passages were “a green landslide.”
Despite growing support for cannabis in the U.S., federal legislation for legalized pot may be off the table for now, particularly with the possibility that Republicans retain control of the senate.
A divided government however may bode well for the enactment of the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act, known as the SAFE Act, which would enable cannabis banking, senior policy analyst Jaret Seiberg at Cowen & Co wrote in a note.
“This is likely to become the primary focus for the cannabis industry. The downside is that the SAFE Act would not be needed if there was a sweep as Democrats would have legalized cannabis,” Seiberg wrote.
Trulieve Cannabis (OTC:TCNNF) Corp. CEO Kim Rivers said Mitch McConnell’s statement Wednesday about getting the U.S. Senate back to pass a stimulus bill by the end of the year was more good news for the industry on top of the election results.

Markets were trying to gauge the fallout from a split government, and expectations rose that a policy gridlock that would prevent greater regulation and limit fiscal stimulus could also force the hand of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
S&P E-mini futures were up more than 1.5% on the heels of a 2.3% jump in the S&P 500 (SPX) on Wednesday while stocks in Europe followed Asian bourses to clock up healthy gains. Meanwhile, longer-dated U.S. Treasuries extended Wednesday's huge gains, sending yields lower once more.

COMMENTS:
JUSTIN ONUEKWUSI, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, LEGAL & GENERAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS, LONDON
""The Fed today is a bit of a sideshow, but there is a chance it may strengthen forward guidance around potential QE, and that would be dollar-negative as you may also have less fiscal stimulus coming. Another thing that makes us medium-term negative on the dollar is whether you see a weaker United states from a political perspective going forward. If (post-election wrangling) goes on for weeks or months, with Republicans refusing to accept the results, that's not positive from a political perspective.""
DIDIER SAINT-GEORGES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, CARMIGNAC, PARIS
""There is a lot of position-squaring going on and we should not fall into the mistake of reasoning out moves every hour. Things like green energy are long-term trends which will continue.""
""Compared to what was anticipated, some (Treasury yield) curve flattening may make sense, but even if some rates positions were unwound, we should not get carried away trying to see a reversal. One takeaway is that regulatory risk to the pharma sector has reduced. Pharma has been a laggard this year, so we may see some catch-up.""
MICHELE PEDRONI, FUND MANAGER, DECALIA ASSET MANAGEMENT, GENEVA
""The scenario of a 'blue tsunami' is almost certainly off the table. In the short term ... healthcare looks compelling given recent underperformance, strong resilience to current health crisis and attractive valuations, with lower risks from a healthcare reform by Democrat (administration). Tech also looks advantaged.""
""The big bad wolf of regulation and taxes is further away from the door and many who have de-risked into the event will be forced to re-risk.""
JONATHAN BELL, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, STANHOPE CAPITAL, LONDON
""The outcome of the election in terms of the potential for a Democratic president and a Republican Senate is many ways the best news for markets because it prevents more extreme policies.""
""Biden being elected increases the chances of a fiscal stimulus deal, but (with a Republican Senate) it also reduces the ability for him to push through significant tax rises or policies that might constrain the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in terms of competition authority. The push for him to increase anti-trust measures is limited and that's perhaps why we're seeing the Nasdaq rise.""
SIMON CARLTON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CARLTON JAMES GROUP, LONDON
""If you look at the numbers, trends, previous cycles, unemployment numbers -- a double-dip recession is coming, and I don't think either president, whoever gets in, is going to stop that. Because I think a correction is not only likely, but is a requirement of these economic cycles. And the COVID dip was short-lived and there are so many different factors to take into account that I don't think we've seen the actual correction as of yet.""
PAUL SANDHU, HEAD OF MULTI-ASSET QUANT SOLUTIONS, APAC, BNP PARIBAS ASSET MANAGEMENT, HONG KONG
""U.S. markets have zig-zagged to a moderate positive advance to end yesterday. The main reason is that the assumption is that a stimulus deal will be reached, but may not be as expansive as it would have been with a completely Democrat-controlled government.""
""Given the dynamics of the market, any uncertainty to a Biden victory has come through as volatility. I expect that this volatility will continue as the Republicans issue lawsuits over the coming weeks, but hopefully this component of volatility becomes muted as challenges to the voting process hit obstacles. As always, it's prudent to have some tail hedges online for the next few weeks. If those are on, there will be opportunities to buy into volatility.""
JOHN VAIL, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, NIKKO ASSET MANAGEMENT, TOKYO
""It’s going to be interesting to see how much the market actually thinks stimulus will get done. It’s quite possible that even a moderate stimulus plan does not happen, for various reasons: they can’t agree, just like they couldn’t agree before, on how much goes to what.""
""The sectoral movements in markets are indicating that they don’t see a big stimulus ahead, especially in infrastructure, steel stocks, construction machinery equipment, construction machinery equipment rental companies ... a lot of those were sold off quite aggressively last night. As long as there’s no civil unrest, a stalemated government is OK for equity markets, with the proviso that there’s continued monetary stimulation and that nothing is required for the government to do.""
CHRIS BAILEY, EUROPEAN STRATEGIST, RAYMOND JAMES, LONDON
""We had a big rotation trade before the election, and now we have something more akin to what we'd seen in previous months, which is technology leading. It's an interesting interpretation of the election results.""
""It's a combination of the election and COVID-19 trade coming together. The election trade is that there isn't a 'blue sweep'. Those conditions where you would've perhaps favoured reflation - rising bond yields which would've supported value stocks - switched away a bit. We're now back to favouring COVID-19 trade, which is obviously beneficiaries of work-from-home and lower bond yields.""

""What people are underestimating is the role of central banks. It's very clear that central banks are continuing to be helpful with the current economic conditions.""

150,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 07:02AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Soar 383 Pts; Presidential Election Result Draws Nearer,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening sharply higher Thursday, as the post-election rally rolls on with investors buying into the idea of political gridlock reducing the chance of major policy changes, while the result of the presidential vote draws nearer.
At 8:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 60 points, or 1.8%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 383 points, or 1.4%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 290 points, or 2.5%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.6% higher Wednesday, while the S&P 500 index climbed 2.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite index added 3.8%. The last two indices are currently on course to have their best weeks in seven months, with equity markets overall on pace for their best election week in decades.
The race for the White House remained undecided Thursday, but Democrat candidate Joe Biden appears to hold thin leads in the crucial swing states of Wisconsin and Michigan, edging him closer to victory over incumbent President Donald Trump.
Investors also seem to be rejoicing at the signs that the Senate will stay in Republican hands, reducing the prospects of substantial regulatory changes and a potential hefty increase in capital gains tax under a unified Democratic Congress. 
The fly in the ointment is the close nature of the vote, which could open the door to a lengthy litigious process, with President Trump already filing lawsuits, alleging fraud without providing evidence.
“We think this positive risk tone is unlikely to last long,” said strategist John Velis at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), in a research note. “We see a prolonged period of uncertainty expected, with a delayed and contested election that should raise volatility and depress risk appetite.”
While the likes of healthcare and tech stocks have gained sharply on the idea of new regulation being difficult to get past a divided Congress, stocks that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic may suffer if a new coronavirus relief package ends up being a lot smaller than the $3 trillion Democrats had been looking for.
This puts the focus back on to the Federal Reserve, with daily U.S. Covid-19 cases topping 100,000 for the first time. The U.S. central bank will release a statement at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT), and is expected to hold its short term rate at 0.25%, for now.
The key economic release Thursday will be the weekly initial jobless claims number, at 8:30 AM ET, with a drop to 732,000 last week expected, from 751,000 last week. However, Wednesday’s private payrolls disappointment suggests the possibility of a weaker than expected number.
U.S. crude futures traded 1% lower at $38.75 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.6% to $40.97, adjusting after sharp gains Wednesday after U.S. inventories dropped sharply.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.2% to $1,919.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.7% higher at 1.1808.

151,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",COVID vaccine deliveries on ice as AstraZeneca awaits trial data,"By Pushkala Aripaka and Ludwig Burger
(Reuters) - A summer dip in UK coronavirus infections has pushed back test results for AstraZenca's potential COVID-19 vaccine, leading the drugmaker to delay deliveries of shots to the UK government. 
Britain's vaccines chief said on Wednesday it would receive just 4 million doses of the potential vaccine this year, against initial estimates for 30 million by Sept. 30.
AstraZeneca (L:AZN) said on Thursday it was holding back deliveries while it awaits the data from late-stage clinical trials in order to maximise the shelf-life of supplies. 
It is keeping the vaccine frozen in large containers, and will only add a final ingredient, put it into vials and keep it at fridge temperature when the vaccine gets closer to approval.
""We are a little bit late in deliveries, which is why the vaccine has been kept in frozen form,"" CEO Pascal Soriot said on a conference call.
However, he added AstraZeneca was ""fully"" prepared to launch the vaccine when it is ready, adding the company's weekly delivery schedule should roughly match what the UK government has in mind for its vaccination plans.
AstraZeneca and its partner on the project, the University of Oxford, said data from late-stage trials should land this year. If successful, the pair will file for emergency approvals in as many countries as possible at the same time, Soriot said. 
The British duo are racing with Pfizer/BioNTech,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and others to publish the first detailed results from large COVID-19 vaccine trials. A vaccine is seen as the world's best bet for beating a pandemic that has led to more than 1.2 million deaths, roiled economies and disrupted billions of lives.
Earlier this year, AstraZeneca also agreed to start supplying millions of doses by the end of 2020 to the United States, the European Union and poorer nations through epidemic response group CEPI and vaccine alliance GAVI, subject to the results of the trials and regulatory approval.
The company hopes the shot will be effective for at least a year, but only trial data can confirm this.
MIXED RESULTS 
While working on the vaccine, AstraZeneca is also making progress on its pipeline of other drugs. 
On Thursday, the company said two of its main drugs - cancer treatment Lynparza and diabetes medicine Forxiga - had been approved for wider use in Europe.
For the third quarter, product sales of $6.52 billion were ahead of a company-compiled consensus of $6.50 billion. The number excluded payments from collaborations. 
However, core earnings of 94 cents per share for the three months ended Sept. 30 missed analysts' expectations of 98 cents. 
Research and development costs jumped 11% to $1.5 billion, as more projects moved into the final stage of testing on humans - typically the most expensive.

The company said it still expected total revenue in 2020 to increase by a high single-digit to a low double-digit percentage and core earnings per share to increase by a mid- to high-teens percentage.

""A Democratic programme would be more aligned with our worldwide strategy to fight climate change to go electric,"" Diess said on a Bloomberg webcast on Thursday.
Presidential candidate Joe Biden moved closer to victory in the U.S. election as officials continued to tally votes in the handful of key battleground states that will determine the outcome.
VW is in the midst of a global push to launch electric vehicles in China, the United States and Europe, and is betting on economies of scale to make battery-driven cars more affordable.
""The United States, when it comes to market share, is the weakest region in the world,"" Diess said.
Diess added that Volkswagen had established a trustful relationship with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and that the prospect of trade tensions between the United States and other parts of the world would remain even if Biden won.
Policymakers from all parties are determined to rebalance trade relations, in an effort to bring investment and jobs back to the United States, Diess explained.

""The discussions would remain - you always have trade balances, which are a concern for some nations,"" he said.

156,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>","For some Ant investors, outrage that regulatory risks weren't flagged better","By Scott Murdoch and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Some professional investors who bought  Ant Group  stock in its $37 billion IPO are fuming that regulatory risks were not better flagged, especially given they had to jump through hoops to participate in the fintech giant's tightly managed roadshow.
China's suspension of the world's biggest float came at the eleventh hour after authorities published a consultation paper on Monday that recommended tighter rules for online micro-lending companies - which if implemented will require changes to Ant's business model and hit its growth prospects.
Ant (SS:688688) (HK:9988) did make disclosures about major regulatory risks in China in its prospectus and investors are expected to factor in a degree of regulatory uncertainty when making investments.
However, some fund managers who bought stock in the IPO say Ant did not do enough and they wonder how it could not have known that tighter regulations were in the offing.
""There was no mention of microlending regulation tightening, that (was) not a conversation that was had,"" one hedge fund manager in Hong Kong said of the roadshow.
""I don't think (investors) thought it was an issue until the there was a last minute discussion paper from the regulators,"" he added. Like many investors, he declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media.
Ant said in a statement to Reuters it was not aware of the details of the draft on online micro-lending rules until it was published on Nov. 2.
""Since Ant executives were unaware of the draft online micro-lending rules, they were not the subject of any road show calls,"" the statement said.
Fund managers also expressed annoyance that Ant founder Jack Ma publicly criticised financial regulations as stifling innovation last month - a tactless move that many observers believe pushed regulators to suddenly ambush the Hong Kong and Shanghai dual listing.
""It strikes me that this issue could have been dealt with a long time ago. It seems that Jack Ma is being schooled in front of the class for the speech he made last week,"" another hedge fund manager in Hong Kong said.
For some investors, the lack of detailed discussion on regulatory risk was particularly galling given what they say were unprecedented demands made by Ant in order for them to be allowed to participate in the roadshow, and its tight control over topics discussed.
Questions during the roadshow calls - all online due to the pandemic - had to be submitted beforehand and Ant's management chose which ones they answered, multiple sources told Reuters.
One fund manager also said he had to lodge documents outlining how the firm valued Ant, the length of time they intended to hold the stock and present staff biographies for team members taking part in the call. Another said he was required to complete a one page document on the positives he liked about Ant.
An Ant representative said the claims were untrue and it had not made such requests of fund managers during the roadshow.
While some investors were upset, others, who also bought Ant stock, were not, saying the complaining reflected a lack of due diligence.
""The question for other asset managers is why were you putting in billion dollar orders if you hadn't done this homework and now feel this way?,"" said a London-based fund manager.
He said he was able to ask questions on the roadshow, adding that he had a good ""independent understanding"" of the regulatory framework that did not rely on input from Ant management.
Sam Lecornu, co-founder of Stonehorn Global Partners (NYSE:GLP) in Hong Kong, added he was not as surprised as others by the suspension.

""The risks were disclosed very clearly for the people who took the time to read them. We still have our belief that the management can navigate risks like this now and into the future.""

157,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 05:46AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Unicredit Shareholders Likely to See Paradise Postponed - Again,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) became the latest two big European banks to report better-than-expected profits for the third quarter Thursday but their plans to pay out some returns to long-suffering shareholders are likely to have to stay on ice for another few months yet.
Unicredit raised its guidance for the year after reporting a 31% quarter-on-quarter increase in net profit, ahead of expectations. It also said it was still on course to meet its 2021 profit targets. Revenue rose, loan loss provisions fell from the previous quarter, and the core capital ratio strengthened to 14.4%.
The bank operates across most of southern and central Europe but has been particularly supported in the third quarter by a strong rally in Italian bonds, reflecting greater confidence that the euro zone will get through the current emergency thanks to more effective and coordinated action by the European Union and the European Central Bank.
The numbers would put Unicredit in an excellent position to implement its policy of paying out half of underlying profits through dividends and buybacks – were it not for the ECB’s current ban on such measures. The ECB’s ban, which is set to run through the end of the year, risks being extended for another six months or even more, until a naturally cautious supervisor is confident that bank balance sheets have absorbed the worst of the pandemic.
Like many of its peers, Unicredit’s third-quarter numbers have been helped by the economic rebound in the third quarter, which has slowed or even stopped the descent into bankruptcy for some corporate and household borrowers. Unicredits non-performing loan ratio fell to 4.7% as of September. Santander (MC:SAN), which reported a week earlier, said that only 2% of the loans that had been subject to forbearance measures earlier had actually fallen into default.
Almost all of the euro zone’s banks have beaten expectations one way or another in the current quarter. Together with a relief rally in the aftermath of the U.S. election, that’s made for a healthy bounce in their beaten-down stocks: SocGen stock, which rose 3.5% on Thursday after it, too, beat forecasts, is now up over 16% for the week, as is  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), whose increasing focus on wealth management and insurance is becoming more evident in the consistency of its earnings.
Indeed, wealth managers appear to be among the biggest winners from the election, given that the U.S. Republican party’s likely control of the Senate should thwart any radical plans for punitive taxes on the rich by the House of Representatives. The shares of the big three Swiss banks - UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  Julius Baer  (SIX:BAER) – are all up over 10% on the week.
However, for the broader sector, it still seems too early to declare victory (Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and ING (AS:INGA) earnings on Thursday both showed that there's still plenty of scope to disappoint) .
The Eurozone economy is heading back into contraction as the second wave of Covid-19 rises, according to updated EU Commission forecasts published on Thursday. It also cut its growth forecast for next year (although it also reduced its forecast for this year's contraction) and said unemployment will rise to 9.4% of the workforce. On Wednesday, Italy became the latest Eurozone country to declare fresh lockdown measures, including a national 10 PM curfew.
You can argue that much of that bad news (and more) is already factored in to valuations. All the same, it's not a background that will encourage bank supervisors to lighten up any time soon. "

160,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",Global investors dumped equities in October on U.S. election jitters: Lipper,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy
(Reuters) - Global investors pumped more money into debt funds and shed holdings of equity funds in October, data from funds database Lipper showed, confirming heightened worries over stock valuations in the weeks before the U.S. presidential election.
Data from Refinitiv Lipper showed that global debt funds received an inflow of $49 billion in October, compared with an outflow of $2.6 billion in equity funds.
Stock markets have rallied tentatively this week as markets await the results of the Nov. 3 elections. Early indications show Democrat Joe Biden closer to the presidency than incumbent Donald Trump and for Congress to stay divided.
Graphic: Flows into global funds - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwvkjxdepm/Flows%20into%20global%20funds.jpg
""In the face of potential risk events, such as the upcoming US election and evolving second wave of COVID infections, we believe there was an element of profit-taking in the equity market,"" said Gautam Khanna, senior portfolio manager at Insight Investment.
""Investors took the opportunity to move up the capital structure from equity into lower-volatility corporate credit and government assets.""
The surge in inflows in bond funds was also due to a rise in U.S. interest rates as yields climbed to a four-month high in the last month, analysts said.
Global equities have rallied since March, bolstered by government stimulus measures and hopes for a vaccine. But that surge in shares lifted the MSCI World index's (MIWO00000PUS) forward price-to-earnings ratio to 18.3 at the end of October, much above the 10-year average of 14.4.

Apart from equity funds, money market funds also witnessed an outflow of $23 billion last month, after receiving a total inflow of over $1 trillion between March and April this year.
Insight Investment's Khanna said money market funds' assets under management still remain elevated despite the outflows in October.

""This represents excess levels of cash sitting on the sidelines, perhaps out of caution,"" he said.

161,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>",Emerging-Market Stocks Rally to Highest Since 2018 on Biden Lead,"(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market stocks climbed to the highest level in more than two years and most currencies strengthened as Democrat Joe Biden moved closer to victory in the U.S. presidential election.
The MSCI gauge of developing-nation equities rose past a January peak as investors cheered the prospect of a Democratic president and a Republican-controlled Senate. Indonesia’s rupiah and the Russian ruble paced currency advances. Not all risk assets rallied. China’s offshore yuan and the South African rand both gave up some of the gains they made Wednesday.
A Biden victory appears to be welcomed by emerging markets as it would allow lawmakers to pass a U.S. stimulus plan and reduce geopolitical uncertainty including trade tensions with China. As expectations for a Biden win strengthened, a measure of volatility in developing-nation currencies dropped to near the lowest since August.
“It still looks positive for equities including EM,” said Adrian Zuercher, head of global asset allocation at UBS Wealth Management in Hong Kong. “There will be some fiscal stimulus, a vaccine benefits all equities, and the Fed will be more dovish at the margin than it would have been in a Blue Wave.”

The MSCI emerging-market stock index climbed as much as 2% to the highest since May 2018, erasing all its post-pandemic losses. India’s Sensex index also retraced all its 2020 declines as it rallied during Thursday’s trading. A gauge of developing-nation currencies rose to a nine-month high, advancing 0.6%.
Developing-nation assets see-sawed during Wednesday’s U.S. vote count as Biden’s tally initially fell short of opinion-poll projections and prospects of a sweeping Democrat win in both houses diminished, reducing optimism over a huge stimulus package. Trump’s campaign said it‘s suing in Pennsylvania and Michigan to halt vote counts that were trending toward Biden.
While the Democrats now look less likely to take control of the Senate, “expected modest fiscal spending and perceived foreign-policy stability should be supportive of hard-currency EM bonds,” said Ek Pon Tay, money manager for emerging-market fixed income at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management in Singapore.

162,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 03:50AM ET</span>",European Stocks Higher; U.S. Gridlock and BOE Stimulus Help,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Thursday, with investors buying into the idea of more U.S. policy gridlock while the Bank of England added more stimulus to support the battered U.K. economy.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.9%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.2%.
The question of who occupies the White House for the next four years remains unanswered so far Thursday, but Democratic challenger Joe Biden appears to be narrowly ahead in two critical Midwestern states that could tip the election in his favor. This has prompted incumbent President Donald Trump to file lawsuits and demand recounts.
That said, even if Biden is declared the next president, the prospects of the Democrats taking the Senate have dimmed. That may reduce the chance of large-scale, effective stimulus in the near term, but also removes the risk of punitive rises in taxes- especially capital gains tax - to fund the additional spending further down the road.   
Meanwhile, back in Europe, the Bank of England increased its bond-buying stimulus by 150 billion pounds ($195 billion), more than had been expected as it seeks to prop up Britain's struggling economy against the hit from a second coronavirus lockdown. 
“Policymakers noted that ‘risk management’ considerations pushed for a strong early reaction, with the economy faced by a myriad of downside risks stemming from both lockdowns and Brexit,” said ING analyst James Smith, in a research note.
The market is expecting the European Central Bank to make a similar move when it next meets in December., given that the euro zone is also suffering badly from the surge in Covid-19 case.  German industrial orders grew less than expected in September, data showed on Thursday. 
In corporate news, ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) stock rose 0.7% after the world's largest steelmaker beat expectations with third-quarter core profit.
Siemens Gamesa (F:GAM) stock rose 1.6% after the wind turbine maker returned to operating profit in its fourth quarter, and said it expected to increase margins over the next three years.
On the flip side, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) stock fell 1.3% after the troubled airline booked a net loss of 2 billion euros ($2.35 billion) in the third quarter due to the pandemic-related slump in travelling.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) both confirmed a trend of generally better-than-expected bank results for the third quarter, thanks to relatively low loan-loss provisions, but Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) stock slumped after another set of disappointing earnings.
The Federal Reserve is due to announce its latest rate decision later Thursday. It’s not expected to move this time given the political uncertainty.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $38.84 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.6% to $40.96. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1,2% to $1,918.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1759.

166,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 02:35AM ET</span>","Lufthansa warns of higher cash drain, restructuring costs in fourth quarter","By Kirsti Knolle
BERLIN (Reuters) - Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) warned on Thursday it will burn through more cash in the fourth quarter than in the third and that further restructuring measures will weigh on its results as it struggles to cope with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
As a result of continuing travel restrictions to curb the virus outbreak, Germany's flagship airline booked a net loss of 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in the third quarter, compared with a profit of 1.2 billion euros the previous year. 
Third-quarter capacity was just 22% of last year's level, leading to an average monthly operating cash drain of 200 million euros. 
As the airline expects even fewer passengers in the winter, it said that number would grow in October-December, although would not exceed 350 million euros. It aims to return to a positive operating cash flow in the course of the coming year.
""We are now at the beginning of a winter that will be hard and challenging for our industry,"" said Chief Executive Carsten Spohr. ""We are determined to use the inevitable restructuring to further expand our relative competitive advantage.""
Lufthansa and its subsidiaries Eurowings, Swiss, Austrian and Brussels Airlines are slashing their schedules, fleet and staff, with air travel not expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels before 2025. 
The size of the expected restructuring costs will depend on negotiations with trade unions, Lufthansa said. The carrier aims to reduce 22,000 full-time jobs.
Operating expenses were down 43% in the third quarter from the previous year, helped by significantly lower fuel costs and fees. Sales fell to 2.7 billion euros from 10.1 billion euros. 
The airline, which secured a 9 billion euro state bailout in June, said it had liquidity of 10.1 billion euros.
Lufthansa confirmed it aims to increase capacity to around 25% towards the end of the year. 
Rival Ryanair (I:RYA) has warned it might have to cut back its plans to fly 40% of last year's traffic levels in the winter. British Airways-owner IAG (L:ICAG) has predicted fourth-quarter capacity at 30% of 2019 levels.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares scaled a near three-year peak on Thursday and bonds extended their blistering rally as investors wagered the prospect of U.S. policy gridlock would greatly favour some industries while also restraining government borrowing.
The risk of a prolonged contested election did remain, though the count was progressing in an orderly fashion with Democratic challenger Joe Biden narrowly ahead in key states.
""While the official outcome of the U.S. election remains unknown, the odds of a Biden win and Republicans maintaining control of the Senate are increasingly becoming the most likely outcome,"" said Randal Jenneke, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price.
""This outcome is often seen as the 'goldilocks scenario' for financial markets -- no radical policy changes and the Fed providing ample liquidity to try to support the economy and financial markets when required.""
A divided government would constrain fiscal stimulus and any 'radical policy changes', which would boost growth stocks such as healthcare, IT and consumer discretionary, Jenneke added. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 2% to reach its highest since February 2018. Japan's Nikkei rose 1.7% to a more than nine-month top and South Korea put on 2.4%.
Chinese blue chips gained 1.3%, aided by talk a Biden White House might ease back on trade war tariffs.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 firmed 0.6% and NASDAQ futures 1.4%. EUROSTOXX 50 futures added 0.3% and FTSE futures 0.25%.
Both President Donald Trump and Biden have paths to 270 Electoral College votes as states tallied mail-in ballots. Biden remained optimistic on winning while the Republican incumbent filed lawsuits and demanded recounts.
(For the latest election results and more coverage, click: https://www.reuters.com/world/us-election2020) 
Betting sites swung toward Biden as the results trickled in, having earlier heavily favoured Trump.
Yet the prospects of the Democrats taking the Senate also dimmed, pointing to deadlock should Biden take the White House.
""A Biden win without full Senate support means less risk of regulation and higher corporate/personal taxes,"" wrote analysts at Nomura in a note. 
""Asset market reaction over the past 24 hours confirms this view, with the US10-year yields declining sharply, and U.S. tech/WFH/structural growth stocks outperforming on prospects of less economic aid.""
BONDS WIN BIG
Bond markets assumed a divided government would greatly reduce the chance of debt-funded spending on stimulus and infrastructure next year, and thus less bond supply.
That saw 10-year Treasury yields tumble all the way back to 0.74%, having touched a five-month top of 0.93% at one stage on Wednesday.
The overnight drop of 11 basis points was the largest single-day move since the COVID-19 market panic of March.
The diminished chance of U.S. fiscal stimulus will pile pressure on central banks globally to inject liquidity, just as the Federal Reserve and Bank of England hold policy meetings.
""Both could be interesting given the need for central banks to do more,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.
""The Fed in particular will have to take up its QE role again with a weary sigh, in order perhaps to provide yet another bridge to the future when, hopefully, a government stimulus package will have been agreed.""
A renewed focus on Fed easing restrained the dollar, after a wild ride overnight. The dollar index was last at 93.362, a lot nearer Wednesday's low of 93.070 than the top of 94.308.
Likewise, the dollar settled back to 104.38 yen having briefly been as high as 105.32 overnight. The euro held at $1.1734, well away from a low of $1.1602.
Sterling had troubles of its own. 
The Bank of England increased its already huge bond-buying stimulus on Thursday by a further 150 billion pounds ($194.61 billion) to a total target of 895 billion as it sought to cushion Britain's struggling economy against the hit from a second coronavirus lockdown.
The Telegraph newspaper had earlier reported the BoE was considering a move into negative interest rates.
The pound was down 0.3% at $1.2941, compared with an overnight peak of $1.3139.
All the talk of policy easing put a floor under gold prices, leaving the metal a shade firmer at $1,909.1 an ounce.
Oil prices ran into some profit-taking. They had jumped overnight on speculation a deadlocked U.S. government would be unable to pass major environmental legislation that favoured other forms of energy. [O/R]

LONDON (Reuters) - Nestle's Purina brand is launching a line of pet food using insects, as the world's biggest food group tests more environmentally sustainable protein sources. 
The move addresses a trend of people seeking more eco-friendly or allergen-free diets for their pets, and puts the world's largest food company into potential competition with smaller brands like Yora and Green Petfood's InsectDog. 
The Purina Beyond Nature's Protein line, which launches in Nestle's home country, Switzerland, this month, will be available in two variations - one using chicken, fava beans and protein from black soldier fly larvae, and one using chicken, pig's liver and millet.
Both are available for dogs and cats. 

In a blog post last year, the British Veterinary Association endorsed insect-based pet food, saying ""insect protein offers a more sensible alternative to owners who want to offer a ‘livestock-free’ diet to their pets rather than homemade vegetarian or vegan diets which often result in poor pet health & welfare"".

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -  ArcelorMittal  (LU:MT) (AS:MT), the world's largest steelmaker, reported third-quarter core profit above expectations on Thursday as the easing of COVID-19 lockdowns led to improved demand in all regions.
The company, which makes around 5% of the world's steel, said core profit (EBITDA) fell 15% from a year earlier to $901 million, compared with an average expectation of $838 million in a company-compiled poll.
CEO Lakshmi Mittal said in a statement that steel markets had recovered from a very challenging second quarter, with particular improvement in profits in Brazil and its unit grouping South Africa, Kazakhstan and Ukraine.
The company said its mining business also fared better, with higher iron ore prices and increased production. It now expects iron ore shipments sold at market prices to be about the same as in 2019. It had previously forecast a 5% decline.
ArcelorMittal said it had begun to restart some of its idled capacity, although demand remained below normal, with a second COVID-19 wave adding to uncertainty.
The company added that the experience of the past six to seven months had it operating with a leaner cost structure and it aimed to detail more permanent cost savings when it reports full year results in February. It has already decided to close for good its blast furnace in Krakow, Poland.
ArcelorMittal also hit its $7 billion net debt target at the end of the quarter, the lowest level since ArcelorMittal's creation in 2006 and a point at which the company can start returning cash to shareholders.

The company is poised to sell its U.S. assets in a cash and shares deal with Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (N:CLF) for $1.4 billion in a deal that has allowed it to launch a $500 million share buyback.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Thursday, with the race for the White House still undecided but investors seemingly embracing the upside of likely U.S. policy gridlock.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.8% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%. 
The fate of the U.S. presidency remains up for grabs early Thursday, although Democratic challenger Joe Biden appears to be narrowly ahead in two critical Midwestern states that could tip the election in his favor. This has prompted incumbent President Donald Trump to file lawsuits and demand recounts.
That said, even if Biden is declared the next president, the prospects of the Democrats taking the Senate have dimmed, pointing to further deadlock - i.e. similar policies to those which have seen strong stock market gains since the Covid hit in March.
“A narrow win with no Senate majority means that Trump-era tax cuts may not be rolled back, at least not immediately, and fiscal stimulus, though likely, will probably be scaled back from what it would have been under a blue wave,” said ING’s Robert Carnell, in a research note.
A relatively small stimulus package is likely to put the onus on the Federal Reserve, which is due to announce its latest rate decision later Thursday, to do even more on its own to support the economy. Especially with the U.S. setting a one-day record of over 100,000 for new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally.
Back in Europe, the Bank of England has increased the scale of its bond-buying program for supporting the economy by a further 150 billion ($195 billion) pounds to 875 billion pounds, while keeping its key interest rates unchanged as the country heads back into lockdown.
In corporate news, ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) will be in focus after the world's largest steelmaker beat expectations with third-quarter core profit, while troubled airline Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) booked a net loss of 2 billion euros ($2.35 billion) in the third quarter due to the pandemic-related slump in travelling.
Oil prices fell Thursday, continuing the recent volatile trading, as traders focused on a likely Biden presidential election victory and the impact this could have on the complex.
“For oil the shorter term outlook would be bearish, given the increased likelihood that the Democrats take a softer approach towards Iran, which could lead to the lifting of sanctions, and so the return of Iranian oil supply to the market,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Crude prices had jumped as much as 4% on Wednesday after official data showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell 8 million barrels last week, as Hurricane Zeta distorted market projections.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% lower at $38.47 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.8% to $40.51. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.7% to $1,909.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1734.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Mom-and-pop investors who put in bids worth a record $3 trillion in China's Ant group - equivalent to Britain's annual economic output - were stunned after regulators abruptly suspended what would have been the world's largest stock market debut. 
China blocked the fintech giant's $37 billion listing on Tuesday, thwarting its debut in Hong Kong and Shanghai scheduled for Thursday and dealing a severe blow to the company founded by billionaire and  Alibaba  (N:BABA) co-founder Jack Ma.
The suspension followed a Monday meeting between China's financial regulators and Ant executives, including Ma, who were told the company's lucrative online lending business would face tighter scrutiny, sources told Reuters. 
Retail investors in the two markets - from taxi drivers to students and young professionals - used their savings and borrowed heavily from banks and brokerages for what many saw as a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity.

""This situation really reveals a deep problem in the Chinese market and shows a lack of experience in holding such a large IPO,"" Tse said, adding that he would no longer invest in Ant and reinvest in U.S., European or Japanese stock markets.
In China, investors cited the changing business environment as a key factor weighing on Ant's future development with some saying they would still be keen to invest.
""I'd probably invest again just because of the sheer size of the market share Ant Financial has,"" said a 21-year-old student investor in Beijing who goes by the name Clementine. 
The unprecedented retail frenzy for Ant's shares was backed by a massive amount of margin lending by financial institutions in mainland China and in Hong Kong, with brokerages in Hong Kong lending billions of dollars. 
Some banks in Hong Kong offered as much as 30 times leverage at interest rates of between 0.4% and 0.5% for a period of around 10 days, banking industry sources have said.
Ant said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Wednesday that it would refund the application money for the Hong Kong leg of the offering without interest over the next couple of days.
Several Hong Kong brokers said they would waive handling fees and interest rates on margin loans for investors who had subscribed for Ant shares. 
The brokerages included online challenger, Tencent-backed Futu (O:FUTU) and Bright Smart Securities (HK:1428), an established broker which lent HK$47 billion on margin. 
Bright Smart said in a statement on Wednesday that listed companies should be required to compensate investors in such situations.
In contrast, major lenders HSBC (L:HSBA) and BOC Hong Kong Holdings Ltd (HK:2388) said they would still charge interest on margin loans.
Billy Ng, a property manager in his 40s, who subscribed for 20,000 shares on margin financing, said the suspension was political in nature. 
As his bank offered low interest of 0.48%, Ng only had to pay HK$1,400 in interest versus around HK$6,000 normally. 
Ant apologised to investors for any inconvenience, adding it would give further details on the suspension of its listing and applications for refunds as soon as possible.
""It's a joke on the Chinese stock exchange,"" said a 37-year-old secretary who wanted to be known only as Olivia, in reference to the Shanghai bourse disqualifying Ant from listing. 
""If Ant lists again, I'm not sure I'll subscribe again because if its business model changes then it might be less attractive than before,"" she said, adding that she had been allotted 50 of the 350 shares she applied for.

173,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 01:50AM ET</span>","Factbox: China new energy shares, Apple suppliers lead gains as U.S. election result awaited","SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's new energy shares and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers led the gains in the A-share market on Thursday, while defence companies lost ground, as early returns from the U.S. election pointed to a win for Democratic challenger Joe Biden. 
While analysts expect little change in U.S. policy toward China whatever the outcome, a Biden administration is expected to bring a more nuanced, multilateral approach to trade and a less hawkish foreign policy toward developments in the Taiwan Strait. 
Democrat Joe Biden on Wednesday predicted a U.S. election win over President Donald Trump after pivotal victories in Michigan and Wisconsin, while the Republican incumbent sought to offset a narrowing path to re-election with lawsuits and demands for a recount. 
APPLE SUPPLIERS
China's Apple suppliers have been sensitive to the ups and downs in the Sino-U.S. trade war, reflecting concerns of possible Chinese restrictions on U.S. tech firms including the Cupertino, California-based giant. 
Shares of those suppliers gained on Thursday, with acoustic component maker AAC Technologies (OTC:AACAY), BYD Electronic International and Sunny Optical Technology rising between 3.3% and 6%. 
On the mainland, Shenzhen Desay Battery Technology, Shennan Circuits Co Ltd, Goertek Inc and Foxconn Industrial Internet firmed between 2.7% and 8.9%. 
NEW ENERGY 
China's new energy firms are expected to benefit from a Biden presidency, given his pledge to invest more in renewable energy. 
Sales of electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen-powered vehicles in China, the world's biggest auto market, are forecast to rise to 20% of overall new car sales by 2025 from just 5% now, according to State Council.
The CSI300 new energy index climbed as much as 4.4% on Thursday, having gained nearly 70% this year. 
Battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) surged about 150% this year, while solar panel components maker LONGi Green nearly tripled in value.
DEFENCE 
Simmering geopolitical tensions around the Sino-Indian border, the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea have boosted defence companies as Beijing intensifies its military build-up, including preparations to challenge American power further afield.
A second Trump administration is likely to exacerbate those tensions, a potential boon for defence contractors.
A Biden White House is widely expected to take a less confrontational approach in its trans-Pacific diplomacy, though the previous Democratic administration of Barack Obama, in which Joe Biden served as vice president, also clashed with China over its claims to the South China Sea. 
The CSI defense index shed as much as 1.6% on Thursday, bucking a broad rally in the market. The index has gained over 50% so far this year. 
TECH
U.S. restrictions on exports to China's tech and semiconductor industries have marked the sector as a key battleground in the Sino-U.S. trade war as China drives for self-sufficiency.
It is not immediately clear whether Biden would ease restrictions on China's tech industry if elected. 
China has been pushing forward with reforms in its capital markets, including a registration-based IPO system for the tech-focused STAR Market and Shenzhen's start-up board, to help better finance its tech industry and foster new growth drivers. 
The tech-heavy start-up board ChiNext added 1.3% on Thursday, while the STAR50 index was up 1.1%. Both indexes gained 55% and 47%, respectively, this year. 
China's top chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp rose as much as 7.6%, having rallied nearly 100% this year.

Investing.com – Investors are still reeling from the shock of Ant Group Co. halting its dual listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong on Tuesday, two days before shares were set to trade in the $35 billion listing, the world’s largest to date.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding (HK:9988), Ant Group’s parent company, saw its shares soar 5.92% to HK$293.60 ($37.86) by 1:17 AM ET (5:17 AM GMT) on Thursday. They plunged by up to 7.5% immediately after the halt was announced. Alibaba founder Jack Ma saw almost $3 billion shaved off his fortune.
Ant Group was forced to halt the listing after Chinese regulators withdrew their approval, citing a “significant change” in the regulatory environment but declining to provide further details.
Some investors view the halt as sensible, with Ant Group’s business model allowing it to charge higher fees for transactions while most of the risk in need of regulation was taken on by state-run banks.
Ma also put his foot in his mouth when he blamed global regulators for focusing too much on risk and critiqued Chinese measures for stifling innovation during a conference in Shanghai on Oct. 24. The comments came just before the Communist Party’s plenum to hash out the country’s five and 15-year economic plans. The plenum also released new rules affecting Ant’s businesses and summoned Ma to a meeting in Beijing on Monday.
Despite the public reprimand and reputational blow to the transparency of Chinese markets, other investors remained optimistic about the IPO.
“What’s clear to me is that the lending business will grow slower over the next few years. That, in the larger scheme of things, is net positive for the sector and Ant Group. Steady growth is good,” Octahedron Capital Management founder Ram Parameswaran told Bloomberg.
Investors will have learnt from Ant Group’s experience to factor in the political risk in future business decisions. This will likely increase in importance, with China facing continuous pressure from the U.S. as it develops its own core technologies no matter who wins the presidential election.
“This sends a signal to the major tech players not to get too big for their britches and that the party is still in charge. Internationally, however, moves like this do very little to alleviate concerns that tech companies going out are not having their strings pulled by Beijing,” Trivium China consultancy head of digital research Kendra Schaefer told Bloomberg."
176,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 12:15AM ET</span>",Allstate Corp CEO eyes climate insurance plan under potential Biden win,"By Suzanne Barlyn
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Allstate Corp (N:ALL) wants a potential Democratic administration to back a taxpayer-funded program that would pay for losses caused by the largest climate-change fueled natural disasters, the Illinois-based insurer's chief executive said.
Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden was leading Republican incumbent President Donald Trump in electoral college votes on Wednesday evening, as the ballot count looked poised to stretch into a third day.
Biden has outlined an ambitious plan to invest $2 trillion in clean energy to get the United States to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Tom Wilson, chief executive of Allstate, one of the largest U.S. property and casualty insurers, said a possible Biden climate package should include legislation to address property destruction caused by the costliest hurricanes and wildfires that exhaust all insurance coverage and state resources. 
""You need really disaster protection because if the weather keeps getting worse, the private market for those really big events is going to be too expensive,"" he told Reuters on Wednesday when the company reported third-quarter results. 
Insurers are bracing for about $4.3 billion in insured losses from Hurricane Zeta in the United States, catastrophe modeling company Karen Clark & Co said on Monday, adding that this year has seen a record number of named storms making landfall.
That's on top of what Moody's (NYSE:MCO) estimates could be as much as$8 billion in losses resulting from dozens of wildfires on the West Coast this summer which scientists say were partly fueled by climate change.
Growing risks of wildfires have led insurers to drop thousands of homeowners in the most vulnerable areas, according to the California Department of Insurance. 
Allstate would ""love"" to see Biden confront climate change, a problem policymakers have tried to address through long-term measures, said Wilson. ""But people spend a lot of time arguing about the long term solution when a house is burning down.""
A government-backed program could be modeled on state-run insurers of last resort, such as the California Earthquake Authority, which cover natural disaster risks that are too steep for private property insurers to take on, said Wilson. 
The government often pumps money into areas after they have been devastated, but a government-backed insurance program could create a structure more ""equitable"" for taxpayers, he said.
The United States already runs a taxpayer-funded flood insurance program and created government-supported commercial terrorism products following the Sept. 11 attacks, which require insurers to pay part of the claims.
Some property and casualty insurers are also pushing for a federal program to cover small business losses resulting from future pandemics.
While a Democratic bid to gain control of the Senate looked set on Wednesday to fail, reducing the prospects of aggressive legislation, Wilson said he believed there were lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who would support an insurance program.

""I think there are both Democrats and Republicans that are in the areas that are impacted by this, that would be in favor of a solution.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Thursday morning, as the world continues to await a victor in the U.S. presidential elections.
Democrat candidate Joe Biden claimed victory in the states of Wisconsin and Michigan earlier in the day, inching him closer to the White House. Biden has 264 of the 270 electoral votes needed to declare victory, compared to incumbent President Donald Trump’s 214, according to Bloomberg. Whether the U.S. will see a Biden or Trump presidency now hinges on the vote count from a few remaining swing states, and Trump is already pursuing lawsuits and a recount in Pennsylvania and Michigan.
However, should Biden be able to overcome the challenge posed by Trump and become the next president, the failure to achieve the widely expected Democrat sweep of the Senate and House of Representative could hamper his ability to implement his agenda of big stimulus packages to aid the COVID-19-hit economy.
As investors await the results, Asian stocks followed U.S. shares’ lead in seemingly welcoming the prospect of a policy gridlock, hitting their highest level since March 201, and avoided big bets on a big stimulus package.
“A Biden win without full Senate support means less risk of regulation and higher corporate/personal taxes,” Nomura analysts said in a note.
“Equity markets have now decided they like the prospect of a ‘do nothing’ President, lacking control of both houses of Congress, in which respect history is on their side,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of FX Strategy Ray Attrill told Reuters.
“This view will, though, remain contingent on some sort of COVID-19 related fiscal package being agreed, ideally sooner rather than later,” Attrill warned.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 1.20% by 11:04 PM ET (3:04 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI rose 1.49%
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.99%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index soared 2.35%, leading the gains. Alibaba’s Hong Kong stocks soared 5.70% even as Chinese regulators halted the Shanghai and Hong Kong arms of Ant Group’s IPO, expected to have been the world’s biggest listing.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.58% and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.68%.
Meanwhile, the Bank of England will hand down its monetary policy later in the day, which is widely expected to include quantitative easing program that could total GBP200 billion ($259.83 billion).
Investors also await the Federal Reserve monetary policy due on Thursday and the U.S. non-farm payrolls report, due on Friday.
“Both [central bank meetings] could be interesting given the need for central banks to do more. The Fed in particular will have to take up its QE role again with a weary sigh, in order perhaps to provide yet another bridge to the future when, hopefully, a government stimulus package will have been agreed,” IG chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp told Reuters."

S&P emini futures  were up 0.25% on the heels of a 2.3% rally in the S&P 500 (SPX) on Wednesday, catalyzed by the prospect of gridlock in Congress after Democrats appeared to have failed to take control of the U.S. Senate. That raised optimism that disruptive policy changes would be hard to implement regardless of the winner in the presidential contest.
By early Asian trade the dollar index (=USD) had ceded its gains and was up a tad at 93.53 after touching a one-month high of 94.308 during the U.S. day. U.S. 10-year Treasury note futures (TYc1) extended a huge gain after Treasury yields fell hard Wednesday. 
COMMENTS
JIM WILDING, WEALTH MANAGER, PARTNER, CONFLUENCE FINANCIAL PARTNERS IN PITTSBURGH, PA
""A Biden Presidency with divided government (REP Senate, DEM House) would very likely result in more gridlock, and a more neutral impact on markets. We could see increased spending for infrastructure and economic recovery, but limited legislation changes and limited support for tax increases.
""If Trump is reelected, and the Senate remains Republican, we are unlikely to see tax increase, which would be viewed as a positive by the market. Trade battles with China would likely intensify and regulatory changes may pick up even more. An infrastructure bill could also be possible.
""Hopefully, we have election results before Thanksgiving!”
BRAD KARP, CHAIRMAN AT LAW FIRM PAUL, WEISS, NEW YORK

""As the mail-in ballots continue to be counted in several key Midwestern states, it now appears clear that Vice President Biden will secure the required 270 electoral votes to become the 46th President of the United States. Nearly as important as the ultimate electoral outcome is the need for that result to be respected as legitimate across the county. The efforts by Mr. Trump and his lawyers to try to disrupt and discredit the vote count are disheartening and run counter the bedrock principle of our democracy that every legitimate vote be counted. Calls to disrupt the lawful counting of legitimate ballots, or, even worse, baseless rhetoric casting doubt on the results, should be shut down by Republican leaders. These cynical efforts both to ignore valid ballots and to undermine the results of a legitimate election have no place in our democracy.""

181,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 07:50PM ET</span>",Wall Street turns on pollsters as U.S election leaves markets in limbo,"By Simon Jessop, Lawrence White and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street is sick of polls.
Leading up to the U.S. election on Tuesday, popular polls wavered about who would win and by how much. In the span of a couple months, they shifted from a likely victory for Republican President Donald Trump to a tight election contest, and then to a win for Democratic candidate Joe Biden.
On Wednesday, voting tallies offered another big bag of uncertainty about who will run the White House during the next term.
""I'm just absolutely perplexed as to why we ever believe these bloody polls,"" said Stuart Oakley, global head of cash currency trading at Nomura, citing wrong polls during prior U.S. and UK elections, as well as Brexit.
""The polls are so wrong every single time. Why do we give them any credibility whatsoever? It's just unbelievable, the way this keeps happening.""
Major global banks and hedge funds have hired polling firms to supplement what they were seeing in publicly available data, but without necessarily getting an edge.
""This is probably the Waterloo for the pollsters,"" said Simon Maughan, head of Trading Alpha at Liquidnet, drawing a comparison between political polls today and the battle that ended the reign of French emperor Napoleon.
""Whatever they do to reach people is not working,"" Maughan said. 
Pollsters have struggled to accurately gauge people's voting intentions during a rise of populist politics over the past decade. As candidates have become less moderate and more brash, voters may support someone who says controversial things but not want to admit that to their colleagues, friends and family, much less a pollster. [nL4N2HL13U]
Even Trump tweeted on Wednesday that his lead in polls had ""magically disappeared."" His comment added to broader criticism of sites like FiveThirtyEight, which claim to have polling tactics that give them an advantage not always evident in the results.
Reuters conducts its own polls with a firm called Ipsos. The most recent predicted victories for Biden in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, and a narrow win in Florida. [nL1N2HK3G3]
The first three remained uncertain on Wednesday afternoon because not enough votes were counted, while Florida had gone to Trump.
After Trump beat his opponent in 2016 – the opposite of what preeminent polls had predicted – some financial firms hired their own people to call voters with unique questions and get an edge for themselves or clients. Though that helped some hedge funds reap profits around Brexit, successes have been rare.
For instance, an executive at one major bank told Reuters ahead of Tuesday's election it had hired its own polling firm, which convinced management a Biden win was likely. The reasons? High turnout tends to be good for Democrats, the idea that people do not want to admit to supporting Trump in polls is false, and pollsters do not usually get things wrong in the same direction in consecutive presidential elections, the executive said. [nL1N2HL1IN]
A major U.S. hedge fund also had its own polling, which predicted Biden would be ahead, but in a much tighter race, an investor said. Their private polling also showed Republicans would hold onto the Senate, which was not a uniform assumption.
Although Biden is still in the lead, assumptions of a landslide or that Democrats would sweep the Senate have been incorrect. Though millions of votes are still being counted, Trump won far more support than pollsters expected in certain states, especially Florida.
""If I was in the polling business I would be seriously disturbed,"" said Peter Kraus, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive who founded asset management firm Aperture Investments in 2018. ""The samplings are just not precise enough and the margins of error are way bigger than they should be."" 
Kraus does not believe that Trump supporters are reluctant to reveal their allegiance to pollsters.
""The 'shy Trump' thing doesn't make any sense to me,"" he said. ""Trump voters put flags on their cars and drive down the street!""
Nate Silver, who runs FiveThirtyEight, defended the site's predictions on Twitter as others posted criticism. He has long asserted that polling firms are fallible: they offer predictions with margins of error, rather than certainties.
Some investors went so far as to say the era of polling is over. Big firms will stop investing in customary polls and try to figure out election outcomes in a different way, they said.
Tom di Galoma, managing director at New York-based Seaport Global Holdings, predicted that strategies for gauging voter intention will move more toward internet searches, since people rarely pick up their phones for random numbers anymore.

""The polls can't be believed,"" he said.

American equities have surged despite a U.S. presidential election whose outcome remains uncertain, with Wednesday’s session dominated by groups whose relative immunity from the economic cycle have made them defensive havens all year.  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). each rose more than 4% during exchange trading, while drug-developer Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB). soared more than 40%.
Contracts tied to the S&P 500 added 0.1% as of 6:01 p.m. in New York Wednesday, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.4%. During the cash trading session, the S&P 500 rose 2.2% as the Nasdaq 100 surged 4.4%, the best day for the tech-heavy benchmark in seven months. An measure of the S&P 500 that treats Apple Inc. the same as Norwegian Cruise Lines ended the day little changed, highlighting the strength of the index heavyweights.
While increasingly contentious vote counts in the presidential election made for a nervous backdrop, equity markets have remained buoyant thanks to appetite for technology megacaps, befitting a year when that group pushed the Nasdaq 100 up almost 35% even as a pandemic and recession raged. With Democrat Joe Biden declared the winner in Michigan and Wisconsin Wednesday, some investors saw prospects for an end to the political stand-off.
“We’re slowly learning the outcomes in some of the key battleground states,” said Ben Axler, chief investment officer at Spruce Point Management. “That’s helping to mitigate some of the uncertainty.”
After a wild election night sowed confusion across markets, investors remained on high alert Wednesday for developments across a handful of states that have yet to finalize their ballot counts. Close contests in key states could mean results won’t be known for days, though Biden opened a clearer path to the White House over Donald Trump with the Wisconsin and Michigan wins.
Still, investors were forced to recalibrate their election-related bets after it became clear a Democratic takeover of the Senate wouldn’t materialize, thus lessening chances for the large fiscal spending bill the market had been hoping for. That’s made tech stocks more appealing than companies heavily dependent on a strong economic rebound.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell Wednesday as investors pared back growth expectations, and economically sensitive shares of smaller firms underperformed. The Nasdaq 100 had its best day relative to the Russell 2000 gauge of tinier companies since March.
“What today and yesterday shows us is we don’t really care who wins as long as it’s not all or nothing,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners LLC. “The divided government is the best possible scenario for markets. If it gets that, it’s happy.”
In the overnight trading session Tuesday, exchange-mandated rules led to a two-minute trading halt after contracts tied to the Nasdaq 100 surged 3.5% within a 60-minute window. Such guidelines would come into play again should stock index futures rise or fall more than 3.5% in an hour. Hard upside and downside limits stand 7% from a Chicago Mercantile Exchange reference price calculated at the end of the trading day Wednesday.
Meanwhile, trading volume soared in Tuesday’s overnight trading session, with both futures contracts tied to the Nasdaq 100 and Russell 2000 registering record turnover. Micro e-mini Nasdaq 100 futures traded a record of close to 550,000 contracts during the overnight session, CME data show. To put that in perspective, average volume for a full day of trading in the contract this year was roughly 670,000 through October.
Besides the American presidential election, traders have plenty else to contend with this week. Federal Reserve officials conclude a two-day meeting Thursday, and though the tight election puts pressure on them to deploy even more monetary stimulus to support the economy, the central bank is not expected to announce a shift in its stance. Then, on Friday, the government’s monthly jobs report is forecast to show private payrolls increased by about 700,000 after an 877,000 gain in September.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A major bet on a Democratic ""blue wave"" sweep of the U.S. presidency and both houses of Congress was being unwound on Wednesday, as traders pulled out of bearish bets that long-dated Treasury yields would rise. 
Volume in put options on the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (O:TLT), the exchange-traded fund that tracks longer-dated Treasury bonds, reached its highest since June 2019 on Wednesday, according to data from options analytics provider Trade Alert. 
The brisk volume reflected investors exiting bets on rising Treasury yields as the Democratic drive to win control of the Senate in Tuesday's U.S. election appeared to be falling short, although the party's candidate Joe Biden was leading Republican President Donald Trump in some critical battleground states.
""Most of the flow we are seeing today is investors closing put spreads they likely had on for a blue wave,"" said Chris Murphy, the co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group.  
Treasury yields climbed to multi-month highs ahead of the election as investors anticipated a Democratic sweep of the White House and Congress - and massive fiscal stimulus along with it. As those chances faded on Wednesday, yields plummeted - which Tradeweb said was likely to be the largest post-election rally since 2000. 
TLT rose by 2.17% on Wednesday, last trading at $161.08, its highest since mid-October. Bond prices move inversely to yields.
While a divided Congress is still likely to pass a coronavirus stimulus bill, investors said the amount may be smaller than was expected if there had been a broad Democratic victory.
As traders exited positions staked on rising rates, however, they did not replace them with bets that rates would fall, Murphy noted. Other indicators suggested that investors did not expect a major counter-swing in TLT. 

Near-term implied volatility for TLT fell from 18.5% to 13% on Wednesday, which Murphy said could indicate the ETF's movements will be more range-bound going forward.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Insurers appear to have dodged a revival of strict regulations and policy upheavals after an anticipated Democratic ""Blue Wave,"" which would have allowed progressives to push for broad reforms, failed to materialize on Wednesday, said industry executives. 
The U.S. presidential election result was on a knife-edge on Wednesday, with Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden tightly knotted as officials in several states completed their vote counts. [nL1N2HQ0VQ] Congress looked set to remain divided with Democrats keeping the House of Representatives and Republicans on track to retain control of the Senate. 
Multimedia U.S. election coverage: https://www.reuters.com/world/us-election2020 
That bodes well for the insurance industry, which had feared a Democratic sweep would allow progressives to reprise regulations introduced after the 2008-2009 financial crisis and push a disruptive healthcare overhaul.
Health insurance stocks jumped on Wednesday, as fears of a dramatic change faded. The S&P 500 managed care index <.SPLRCHMO> rose 9.8% as investors and insurance trade groups cheered an expected Republican hold on the Senate. [nL1N2HQ2LA]
""The Senate traditionally has been a brake in our country on populist impulses, and populist impulses really can create a lot of volatility,"" said Nat Wienecke, an executive at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association. 
Among the industry's top policy worries had been a major overhaul of the Affordable Care Act, but with the split in Congress, ""it's going to be very difficult to do substantial healthcare reform,"" said James Sung, associate director of insurance ratings at S&P Global Ratings. 
""We're reading it as less risk for the industry,"" he said. 
Still, insurers face potential risk from social unrest should a contested election bring protesters into the streets. 
""If you see another round of civil unrest as we saw in the third quarter and second quarter, we're talking probably something that ends up in the billions of dollars of direct insured losses,"" said Paul Newsome, insurance analyst at Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) in Chicago.
Policywise, the industry had also fretted that a Biden administration would reprise for life insurers the ""systemically important"" label created following the crisis for big financial companies whose failure threatens the economy. 
It triggers strict federal oversight and was scrapped early on by Trump's regulators, who argued it was not necessary after large U.S. insurers trimmed their assets.
""That just stopped under the Trump administration but that could be reversed on a moment's notice,"" said Howard Mills, former superintendent of New York’s insurance department and an industry consultant, but a Republican Senate is unlikely to confirm progressives to the agencies that assign the label. 
Prudential Financial Inc (N:PRU) shed the label in 2018, the last insurer to do so. American International Group Inc (N:AIG), which nearly failed during the financial crisis, shed the label in 2017 after selling businesses, while MetLife Inc (N:MET) cast off the designation in 2016 after winning a lawsuit. 
Many life insurers were also concerned a Biden administration would revive the ""fiduciary rule"" adopted by the Obama administration's Department of Labor in 2016 to curb conflicts of interest among providers of financial advice. The rule was struck down in 2018 by a federal appeals court, in a major victory for financial groups under Trump. 
Life insurers fought the rule, partly due to checks it imposed on agents and additional scrutiny of some annuity products. Some progressives have argued it should be revived. 
But on Tuesday, William Wheeler, president of Bermuda-based annuity provider  Athene Holding Ltd  (N:ATH), said during an earnings call that he did not see that as a risk if Biden wins. He noted that moderate senior congressional Democrats, who analysts expect to hold more sway within the party under a divided Congress, did not appear to support such a move. 

Insurers also hope to play a role in any infrastructure spending plan. After the crisis, life insurers purchased a third of the Build America Bonds issued to raise capital for infrastructure, according to the American Council of Life Insurers. The industry has “significant capital to deploy” for further infrastructure initiatives, said Mills, adding that a bill is likely to move forward regardless of who is president.

The proposed layoffs, of 855 unionized workers and another 975 who do not belong to a union, would save the company $44 million on a recurring annual basis, Aeromexico said. 
Although the cuts will first cost the company $31 million in severance benefits, Aeromexico said the expected outcome ""significantly outweighs the program's one-time cost."" 
Aeromexico sought approval from the court to carry out the layoffs by the end of the month, according to the court filings. The company did not specify which positions would be eliminated.
Aeromexico in June began a Chapter 11 restructuring process in the United States, becoming the third Latin American airline to file for bankruptcy protection, and has since received approval for up to $1 billion in financing.
According to statements filed with the Mexican stock exchange, Aeromexico already reduced its workforce by nearly 2,000 positions in the second quarter, and cut another 96 people in the third quarter.
The company posted a net loss of $130 million in the third quarter under the strain of the coronavirus pandemic, yet said passenger demand had begun to revive. 
Shares in Aeromexico on Wednesday fell 3.82%.

190,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 05:00PM ET</span>","Analysis: Wall Street worries tight U.S. election clouds pandemic fight, stimulus","By David Henry and Suzanne Barlyn
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With the U.S. presidential election result a nail-biter, bankers, traders and financial analysts on Wednesday said Wall Street was worried the ultimate presidential winner could struggle to work with a divided Congress to fight the coronavirus pandemic and pass a quick economic stimulus package.
They spoke to Reuters as several key states reported tight margins between Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Though Biden has the lead, millions of votes still need to be counted.
The results so far suggested Biden was likely to win and that Congress will likely remain divided.
Republicans looked likely to keep control of the Senate, which would make it harder for Biden to get legislation passed or have cabinet members and judges approved. Democrats were maintaining a firm grip on the House of Representatives, which could hinder Trump if he wins a second term.
""Now having (a stimulus package) done in early January or February becomes a big feat,"" said a bank lobbyist who was not authorized to speak publicly. ""That's where the minds of bank managements are going to be next and that is certainly what the markets are focused on.""
Many on Wall Street see more stimulus as necessary for economic recovery, but such a package is likely to be smaller and take longer with no ""blue wave"" victory for the Democrats.
Bankers would be happy with a Biden win because the industry sees him as a steadier and less divisive leader than Trump, one bank executive said. Although there are concerns the election results could get caught in extended litigation, people feel more confident Biden could negotiate a stimulus package with Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell than Trump doing so with Democrats in the House, said the executive.
Markets rose, with major U.S. stock indexes up 1.4% to 3.8% on Wednesday, short of the relief rally some had expected but well into positive territory.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, one of Wall Street's emissaries, urged patience for the final results and said he had faith in the systems that will decide the outcome. Other prominent financiers took to Twitter to joke about the situation or express personal feelings.
""I was wrong. It hurts,"" wrote Mike Novogratz, a former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) partner who is now active in cryptocurrency and donates to Democrats. He had expected voters to hand Biden a more decisive win.
Ahead of the election, the financial industry's biggest worry was soaring taxes and tough regulation if a ""blue wave"" put Biden in the White House and Democrats in control of both the Senate and the House. 
Many worried that pressure from progressive Wall Street critics like Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez could push Biden further from his historically moderate positions on the economy and regulations.
Those concerns receded as election results rolled in.
""The concept that Elizabeth Warren would be running Treasury and Bernie Sanders would be running the Department of Labor is a lot less likely this morning than it was if we have had that 'blue wave,'"" said Fred Cannon, research director for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
David Boies, a prominent corporate lawyer who represented former Vice President Al Gore in a U.S. Supreme Court case that put Republican George W. Bush in the White House, said his Wall Street contacts prefer a divided government, which is usually unable to make extreme changes in the status quo.
The unusual election saw historically high turnout in a politically polarized population and a much larger than usual number of mail-in votes during a deadly pandemic, which slowed vote counting in key states. The divide between Biden and Trump narrowed from about 200,000 votes to just 6,000 within hours, he noted. He believes the uncertainty could last several days.

""Everyone, whether it's the man in the street or the man on Wall Street, is fascinated and focused on how this is changing,"" Boies said.

Investing.com – The Dow cut some losses but ended higher on Wednesday, as former Vice President Joe Biden's bid to take to White House was given a huge boost after picking up a wins in Wisconson and Michigan.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.34%, or 367 points. The S&P 500 was up 2.15%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 3.85%.
Biden holds a 253-to-214 electoral college lead over President Donald Trump, after picking up wins in key swing states of Wisconsin and Michigan. Biden is now in ascendency needing to pick up just one win from the outstanding states.
""After a long night of counting, it's clear that we're winning enough states to reach 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency,"" Biden said. ""I'm not here to declare that we've won, but I am here to report that when the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners.""
While the Democrats' path to the White House has cleared up somewhat, a blue wave – Democrats taking the White House and Congress – is unlikely after Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine,  maintained her seat, denying Democrats a key win that many expected would be tightly contested.  
Without a Senate majority, the Democrats may struggle to push through major legislation including a large broad-based stimulus bill, climate change measures, and massive infrastructure spending.
Healthcare and technology led the broader market higher as the fading prospect of a blue wave eased fears that the group may come under pressure from tax hikes and intensive regulatory scrutiny.
“The Democratic Party has become increasingly critical on Internet company market power, with more liberal members, such as Elizabeth Warren [D-Mass.], of the party calling for breakups or utility-like regulation,” Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Justin Post said in a recent note.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which together make up a quarter weighting of the S&P 500, were up sharply, with the latter up 8%.
Energy also climbed higher, on a sharp uptick in oil prices after U.S. weekly crude inventories fell unexpectedly.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that weekly crude stock fell by 8 million barrels last week. Economists had expected a build of about 900,000 barrels.
On the economic front, signs of cracks in the labor market just days ahead of the nonfarm payrolls report due Friday was largely cast aside in the shadow of the election.
Private payrolls grew by 365,000 last month, a sharp decline from the 749,000 in September, according to a report released Wednesday by ADP and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. That beat economists’ forecast of 650,000.
Also raising some concern about the recovery, services activity slowed in October.
ISM nonmanufacturing data for September showed a fall to 56.6 from 57.8 the prior month, missing expectations of 57.5.
“This month's level indicates continued expansion, but at a slower pace. Combined with this morning's weak ADP data, it does not bode well for Friday's payroll data,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
In other news, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and LYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) jumped more than 14% and 11%, respectively.

192,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 04:50PM ET</span>",Analysis: No White House result? Wall Street's 'fear gauge' shows less panic,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Going into Election Day, market participants fretted about possibly waking up to an unclear result. But with that outcome realized, they seemed remarkably calm about not knowing the winner of the U.S. presidential race.
As it turns out, the likelihood of continued gridlock on Capitol Hill provided some solace.
Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" plummeted as U.S. stocks surged on Wednesday, which investors attributed to near-certainty of a divided Congress. Republicans appeared likely to maintain control of the Senate, diminishing the prospect of a Democratic sweep in Washington. 
Several analysts had pointed to a drawn-out election process - including the possibility of a challenge before the Supreme Court - as a dire scenario for U.S. equities. Though that risk is not off the table, the congressional outcomes have removed much uncertainty, investors said. A divided Congress would counterbalance the White House's agenda whether Republican President Donald Trump or Democrat Joe Biden won the election, they said. In particular, it would reduce the likelihood of corporate tax hikes and increased regulation. 
""Regardless of where the presidential slot goes, the market has gained confidence in that trajectory,"" said Eric Metz, president and chief investment officer at SpiderRock Advisors.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) ended 5.98 points lower at 29.57, its biggest one-day decline since April 2. VIX futures also broadly fell, though by more modest amounts than the index.
Having the election in the rear-view mirror also paved the way for a lower VIX, investors said, given an array of anxieties - including civil unrest after Election Day - had already been priced in. 
""We're not seeing an 'all-clear,' but maybe some of those worst-case scenarios are off the table,"" said Matt Thompson, managing partner at Thompson Capital Management.
Given recent history, market participants had geared up for extreme election-related volatility. In 2016, the VIX jumped overnight after Trump's surprise victory. However, the VIX plummeted the following day as U.S. stocks rallied, reversing course from a late-night plunge in futures.
The VIX posted similar declines on Wednesday. Still, it remains well above its long-term average near 20. December VIX futures were trading above other listed contracts, suggesting concerns about risks into early 2021, such as a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.
""Volatility hasn't disappeared,"" said Stacey Gilbert, portfolio manager for derivatives at Glenmede Investment Management.
Even so, with Election Day over, a massive risk event has been lifted from U.S. markets. Investors homed in on the presidential race as a volatility source nearly a year in advance. Cboe Global Markets (Z:CBOE) listed October and November VIX futures earlier than usual so that investors could hedge for the event. VIX futures reflect volatility expectations for the 30 days following their expiration.
For much of the year - aside from the coronavirus-driven sell-off in U.S. stocks - October futures traded at a premium to other contracts as investors focused on the election as a major risk event. As worries grew over the possibility that a delayed or contested election result would prolong market volatility, November futures began trading at higher prices.
More recently, however, concerns about post-election market swings had begun to recede. In October, volume in VIX puts, used to position for a drop in volatility, surpassed volume in VIX calls, used as a hedge against a rise in volatility. That pattern continued in early afternoon trading on Wednesday.
The potential for extreme market gyrations is likely to diminish in the coming weeks, investors said.

""The big event is out of the bag,"" said Michael Purves, chief executive of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. ""Eventually things will become a little bit normalized.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The timetable for delivery of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine candidate has slipped and Britain will receive just 4 million doses of the shot this year, the head of the UK's vaccine procurement programme said on Wednesday. 
In May, Britain agreed a deal for 100 million doses of the vaccine, developed by Oxford University and licensed to AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), with 30 million doses estimated for delivery by September 2020.
Oxford's trial chief said earlier he was optimistic that late-stage trial results of its efficacy could be presented before the end of the year, and that doses of the shot are already being made.
UK Vaccine Taskforce Chair Kate Bingham said that the target of 30 million doses of the vaccine by September had not been achieved, and she estimated that Britain would get 4 million doses by the end of the year instead.
""The predictions that were made in good faith at the time were assuming that absolutely everything would work and that there were no hiccups at all,"" she told lawmakers.
She said the scale-up in manufacturing usually took years to do but instead was moving at unprecedented speed, adding that the full 100 million doses would be delivered next year.
""We're starting with low numbers of doses - by which I do mean millions of doses, but not tens of millions of doses initially - and then that will then ramp up so that we will end up with the hundred million doses ... in the first half of next year,"" she said.
AstraZeneca said in a written statement that it was making rapid progress to begin supplying hundreds of millions of doses on a rolling basis once it receives regulatory approval.

""While we are ready to produce finished products, we must be thoughtful of how much is progressed to the final stages of the process to ensure maximum shelf life. We hold inventory in the drug substance form in order to have the longest possible shelf-life upon regulatory approvals,"" it added.

199,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 04:06PM ET</span>",Analysis: U.S. states votes legalizing marijuana to drive growth despite election uncertainty,"By Shariq Khan and David Randall
(Reuters) - Votes to legalize marijuana on Tuesday by a handful more U.S. states should spur further development of the industry and possibly bring changes at a federal level, even if pro-decriminalization candidate Joe Biden loses his bid for the White House, according to industry executives and analysts. 
Consumer demand and the promise of tax revenue are leading more states to embrace pot, which then leads other states to follow suit, making what happens at the local level more important, they said.
Shares of U.S. companies with footprints in multiple states, including  Curaleaf  Holdings (OTC:CURLF) Inc (CD:CURA),  Cresco Labs  Ltd (CD:CL) and Green Thumb Industries Inc (CD:GTII), were all up on Wednesday after voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota chose to legalize recreational use.
The votes should add steam to an industry now pushing hard for new federal legislation. 
""The momentum of the legal industry will likely remain unchanged regardless of the election outcome,"" said Matt  Hawkins  (NASDAQ:HWKN), founder and managing partner at cannabis-focused private equity firm Entourage Effect Capital.
""As long as there is strong consumer demand, the industry will continue its upward growth trajectory and the pathway to legalization will likely speed up regardless.""
For example, approval in New Jersey is expected to open up other eastern states, such as New York and Pennsylvania, said Salvator Armenia, vice president of business development at producer C21 investments (CD:CXXI). Those states and nearby Connecticut already allow marijuana sales for medical purposes.
Tuesday's votes takes the tally of U.S. states where recreational use will be legal to 15 plus the District of Columbia. Mississippi voters also backed legalizing cannabis for medical use, while Oregon voters approved legalizing the psychoactive substance psilocybin found in ""magic mushrooms.""
The ""total addressable market"" in those five states alone is considered to be as large the entire Canadian cannabis market, worth a potential $5 billion to $9 billion annually, Armenia said. 
The path to federal legislation that would allow cannabis companies to bank and trade freely is still unclear, with Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a major opponent. Republicans appear poised to retain control of the senate.
Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations, cautioned that several bills would need to pass before U.S. companies found themselves on the same regulatory playing field as their Canadian counterparts. 
CLOSER TO ACCEPTANCE
In last month's debate with Vice President Mike Pence, Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris said marijuana would be decriminalized at a federal level under a Biden administration.
""Each election cycle cannabis comes closer to federal acceptance, and this election is pivotal to those goals,"" said Cynthia Salarizadeh, founder and president of House of Saka, a cannabis-infused beverages business.
Cannabis sales have surged with people stuck at home during the coronavirus pandemic. In California, sales data for August showed a 26% jump over the past year, while sales in Nevada were up 34%, according to BDS Analytics. 
Alcohol and tobacco companies have taken notice, with some investing in the sector. Drinks maker Constellation Brands (N:STZ) has a stake in  Canopy Growth  Corp (TO:WEED) (N:CGC), while Marlboro maker Altria (N:MO) has a stake in Cronos Group Inc (TO:CRON).
Still, federal decriminalization, or legalization in more states, would not be without challenges, investors said. Many point to Canada as an example.
Though the country became the first G-20 nation to legalize recreational use of cannabis in 2018, regulatory hiccups in Canadian dispensary rollouts, slow international legalization, and a lack of profitability sent investors packing over the next year. That left most companies at a fraction of their market values by the beginning of 2020.

Shares of Canada-based pot producers and distributors, including Canopy, Cronos, Aurora Cannabis (N:ACB) and Tilray (O:TLRY) all fell on Wednesday as the chances of a swift victory for Biden faded.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said on Wednesday he was uncertain if he had a legal basis to bar the U.S. Commerce Department from imposing restrictions on video-sharing app TikTok after a Pennsylvania judge had already blocked the government's plan on Friday.
Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd, the owner of TikTok, argues that the previous ruling could still be overturned on appeal.
U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols for the District of Columbia ordered both parties to file legal papers by Friday to address whether TikTok still faces ""irreparable harm"" from the U.S. order that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google app stores remove the app for download by new users.
The Trump administration contends TikTok poses national security concerns as the personal data of U.S. users could be obtained by China's government. TikTok denies the allegations.
Nichols said he was unsure if TikTok could demonstrate ""irreparable harm"" to win a new injunction.
On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Wendy Beetlestone stopped the Commerce Department from barring TikTok's data hosting within the United States and other technical transactions that she said would effectively ban the use of the app in the country.
The restrictions were set to take effect Nov. 12. A Justice Department lawyer told Nichols the government had not decided whether to appeal Beetlestone's order.
Beetlestone, whose ruling came in a lawsuit filed by three TikTok users, noted the app has over 100 million U.S. TikTok users.
On Sept. 27, Nichols issued a preliminary injunction against the government's order. Beetlestone's order also blocks the app store download ban.
Talks have been ongoing to finalize a preliminary deal for Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) to take stakes in a new company to oversee U.S. operations. U.S. President Donald Trump has said the deal had his ""blessing.""

Investing.com -- Tech and growth stocks got a fresh jolt of adrenaline on Wednesday as the prospect of a divided Congress next year put a stop to the reflation trade.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ Composite each rose more than 400 points. A divided Congress means there’s less likelihood Democrats can push through a big spending bill, as well as raise taxes and hike regulations. 
A contested election for the White House is adding uncertainty to the near-term. The timing of a new stimulus bill from Capitol Hill is murky, especially since the two sides could not agree on the scope and size of a plan even before the election.
Earnings continue to roll out, giving investors a glimpse at how well  -- or how not well -- companies are managing through the economic recovery. The Federal Reserve is also expected to opine on rates on Thursday.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Healthcare and drug makers in view
Healthcare is bound to be a topic next year no matter who takes the White House, but a split Congress may make it difficult for Democrats to make much progress on expanding coverage. Meanwhile, drug prices will be under scrutiny.
 Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) shares soared 14% on Wednesday. It is expected to report earnings of $4.24 a share on revenue of $39 billion. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), up 6%, is seen reporting EPS of $1.49 on revenue of $10 billion. AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN), up 6%, is seen reporting EPS of 50 cents on revenue of $6.6 billion.
2. Gold shines on Barrick
Gold has been a hot trade this year as investors seek a haven from a falling dollar and volatile markets. The yellow metal touched a high above $2,000 this summer and has since traded back down to around $1,900, but many have an optimistic view on the next year.
Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD), the mining company that recently attracted an investment from Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (NYSE:BRKa), is one of the companies that benefitted from rising gold prices in the most recent quarter. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect it to report EPS of 32 cents on revenue of $3.37 billion. 
3. The Fed could speak on the economic outlook
Investors await word from the Federal Open Market Committee, which held its periodic two-day meeting this week and will release a statement at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT). Analysts expect it to hold its short term rate at 0.25%.
Fed officials could speak on the direction of the economy and what the outlook is given the uncertainty of Covid. Several of them have spoken publicly in recent months about the need for more stimulus to support a recovery, though Congress has been unable to reach an agreement on a plan to give aid to households and businesses.

Investing.com – The Dow rallied for a third-straight day shrugging off uncertainty over the election outcome amid a tight race to the White House.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.58%, or 433 points. The S&P 500 was up 2.30%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 3.71%.
Former Vice President Joe Biden holds a 248-to-213 lead over President Donald Trump, after picking up a win in key swing state Wisconsin. While the path to maintain his presidency has narrowed, Trump may still emerge victorious as the race to 270 electoral votes to secure the White House is set to go down to the wire as counting continues in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Georgia.      
In a blow to hopes of a blue wave – Democrats taking the White House and Congress – the path to reclaiming the Senate majority continued to narrow as Republicans have held onto the bulk of the dozen seats that were at risk.
Without a Senate majority, the Democrats may struggle to push through key legislation including a large broad-based stimulus bill, climate change measures, and a massive infrastructure spending.
Health care and technology led the broader market higher as the fading prospect of a blue wave eased fears that the group may come under pressure from tax hikes and intensive regulatory scrutiny.
“The Democratic Party has become increasingly critical on Internet company market power, with more liberal members, such as Elizabeth Warren [D-Mass.], of the party calling for breakups or utility-like regulation,” Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Justin Post said in a recent note.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which together make up a quarter weighting of the S&P 500, were up sharply, with the latter up 8%.
Energy also climbed higher, on a sharp uptick in oil prices after U.S. weekly crude inventories fell unexpectedly.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that weekly crude stock fell by 8 million barrels last week. Economists had expected a build of about 900,000 barrels.
On the economic front, signs of cracks in the labor market just days ahead of the nonfarm payrolls report due Friday was largely cast aside in the shadow of the election.
Private payrolls grew by 365,000 last month, a sharp decline from the 749,000 in September, according to a report released Wednesday by ADP and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. That beat economists’ forecast of 650,000.
Also raising some concern about the recovery, services activity slowed in October.
ISM nonmanufacturing data for September showed a fall to 56.6 from 57.8 the prior month, missing expectations of 57.5.
“This month's level indicates continued expansion, but at a slower pace. Combined with this morning's weak ADP data, it does not bode well for Friday's payroll data,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
In other news, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and LYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) companies jumped more than 13% and 12%, respectively.
Californians voted against a labor law that aimed to reclassify drivers of the ride-hailing companies as employees rather than independent contractors."

204,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 03:10PM ET</span>",Investors pull back on 'blue wave' ETF bets as election outcome remains unclear,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of some exchange-traded funds viewed as favorably positioned to benefit from a broad Democratic U.S. election victory came under pressure on Wednesday, as the race turned out to be closer than expected with no clear winner.
Clean energy ETFs were among the hardest hit in a wider market rally, along with those tracking marijuana stocks, financials and small companies. The sell-off reflected bets that Democrats would have a harder time pushing through key policies and large fiscal stimulus unless they win both the presidency and the Senate.
""There is no major shift going on but there is a slight 'blue wave' unwind,"" said Anita Rausch, head of capital markets for WisdomTree Investments (NASDAQ:WETF).
Either President Donald Trump or his Democratic rival Joe Biden could still win, but investors and betting markets are wagering on a Biden victory with the Republican Party keeping a hold of the Senate.
Shares of the Invesco Solar ETF (P:TAN), which had risen about 30% over the last two months, led the way lower among clean energy ETFs, falling 2.5% while the S&P 500 index rallied 3.2%.
Seeking to allay concerns that his plan to fight climate change would harm the economy, Biden had promised a ""clean energy revolution that creates millions of unionized middle-class jobs"" if he is elected.
The sell-off in clean energy shares may reflect reduced clarity on whether the election outcome would favor environmentally friendly policies that would benefit the sector, said Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's head of ETF and mutual fund research.
Some economically sensitive areas such as financials and small caps, seen as benefiting from a larger stimulus package, also struggled. The small-cap stock market index (RUT) was up 0.9% and the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (P:XLF) was barely positive on the day.
Marijuana stocks, which some had expected to benefit from decriminalization at the federal level, were also down, with the cannabis-focused ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF off 1.7%.
ORDERLY TRADING 
Some analysts were expecting a broad Democratic victory to spark broad selling in ETFs focused on technology and other areas sensitive to Biden's proposed tax increases.
On Wednesday, tech stocks led Wall Street higher, with the Invesco QQQ ETF (O:QQQ) gaining 4.6%.
""There was a potential, if there had been a decisive victory, for some potential selling of equities, specifically ETFs, ultimately with the expectation that there might be a capital gains tax increase if there was a 'blue wave,'"" said Ben Slavin, global head of ETFs and asset servicing at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK).
With broad-market volatility subdued, trading in ETFs was for the most part orderly, market watchers said. The ETF market had weathered big swings this year with little evidence of dislocations.

""I don't see any impact on the infrastructure or the ETF ecosystem ... related to the election,"" Slavin said.

205,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>","Uber, gig economy companies see California win as national model","By Tina Bellon and Munsif Vengattil
(Reuters) - Gig economy companies want to turn California voters' decision to make ride-service drivers contractors into a model for the nation, as several states consider requiring drivers from Uber,  Lyft  and rival services be treated as employees with higher compensation.
Voters in California on Tuesday approved a ballot proposal by Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, Lyft Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) and its allies that cements app-based food delivery and ride-hailing drivers' status as independent contractors, rather than employees. 
Uber's shares rose 12%, while Lyft jumped 9%. The companies, along with DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates, poured more than $205 million into the campaign. 
According to California figures, 58% supported the measure. The results are incomplete and must still be certified.
The ballot measure, known as Proposition 22, carves an exception for ride and delivery companies in a controversial state labor law and offers gig workers some healthcare, minimum pay and other benefits. The state had said gig workers would have to be treated as employees under the law.
""Now, we're looking ahead and across the country, ready to champion new benefits structures that are portable, proportional, and flexible,"" DoorDash Chief Executive Officer Tony Xu said in a statement.
Uber, which is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the bell on Thursday, in an email to California customers on Wednesday said the vote paved the way for a more secure future for app-based workers.
""We'll continue to advocate for drivers everywhere, because we agree that they deserve better,"" the email said.
Uber, Lyft and others have long advocated for what they consider a ""third way"" in employment law by fusing contractor status with limited benefits. Labor groups have dismissed the proposal as creating a new underclass of workers with fewer rights and protections.
Trend-setting California passed the first state law requiring companies that control how workers do their jobs to classify those workers as employees, and others have followed.
Democratic states including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Washington, Oregon and Illinois have introduced similar laws or launched audits against gig companies and Massachusetts in July sued Uber and Lyft over allegedly misclassifying their drivers. 
Massachusetts' attorney general said the state's case against Uber and Lyft would continue.
The question of whether gig workers should be treated as employees has also become a national issue in U.S. politics and the presidential campaign, dividing Democrats and Republicans. 
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has voiced strong support for California's labor law, while the U.S. Labor Department under President Donald Trump has published a rule that would make it easier to classify workers as independent contractors.
Lyft's Chief Policy Officer Anthony Foxx in a statement on Wednesday said Lyft stood ready to work with all interested parties, including drivers, labor unions and policymakers, to build a stronger safety net for gig workers.
Stephen Ju, a  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst, in a note on Wednesday said Proposition 22's success may stunt other regional efforts to change classification. 
Reclassifying drivers in California could have amounted to more than $392 million each for Uber and Lyft in annual employee-related costs, a Reuters calculation showed.

The companies warned they could cut 80% of drivers, double prices and even leave California, their home market, if they lost.

206,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 02:54PM ET</span>",BlackRock’s Rick Rieder Bets on Emerging Markets After U.S. Election,"(Bloomberg) -- Emerging markets are an attractive investment opportunity in the event of a Joe Biden presidency and a Republican-controlled Senate, according to the world’s largest money manager.
Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., said developing-nation assets look more appealing in this low-rate world and could also benefit from a more moderate leader in the White House.
“We’ll have a dynamic with a decent economy, presumably if you don’t have a second wave of Covid, so I actually find some of the risk assets -- some of the yielding assets -- much more attractive than Treasuries,” he said on Bloomberg TV. “Buying the 10-year note at 75 basis points won’t take your return to the promised land.”
Rieder, who was busy trading well into the early hours of the morning as election results trickled in, said he still expects a significant U.S. stimulus package, even if it’s less than anticipated. Meantime, gridlock could stymie major tax increases, benefiting technology and health care stocks, he said.
The New York-based investor said cash is an effective hedge today, while crypto assets are also a useful addition to a balanced portfolio. One of the biggest challenges will be when markets shift their focus back to the pandemic.
“It will take a week or two and that will be at the forefront,” Rieder said. “That’s why you can’t get too overzealous about taking a lot of risk today. We’re definitely not out of the woods with Covid or getting a vaccine.”

207,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 02:36PM ET</span>","Oil Stocks Climb, Renewables Slip as U.S. Green Ambitions Dim","(Bloomberg) -- Shares of oil and gas companies climbed and renewable energy firms tumbled Wednesday as the U.S. presidential election remained too close to call and Republicans appeared set to retain control of the Senate.
The S&P 500 Energy Index climbed as much as 2.5%. A Bloomberg Intelligence index of large solar companies dropped as much as 4.9%, the most during intraday trading since March, and the WilderHill Clean Energy Index fell as much as 5.1%.
While the outcome of the presidential race remains unclear, a Joe Biden victory would likely coincide with a Republican-controlled Senate that could hinder his efforts to address climate change, promote clean energy and roll back fossil-fuel subsidies.
“Perhaps the biggest conclusion to be drawn at this stage is that there is only a small likelihood that existing oil & gas tax incentives will be removed in the U.S. -- even if Biden emerges as the winner,” Artem Abramov, head of shale research at Rystad Energy, said in a note to clients. Still, Biden would be able to ban new fracking on federal lands via an executive order, which would hit producers in New Mexico and elsewhere.
“There was some anticipation of a Democratic sweep and the possibility of major climate reform,” Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said in an interview. Even if Democratic nominee Biden wins, without a Democratic Senate “he’ll have to rely on executive action, tinkering around the edges, rather than anything game-changing or transformative.”
With votes still being counted in key battleground states, it’s unclear if the U.S. will more aggressively shift toward green energy, as Biden has pledged -- or if President Donald Trump will get four more years to promote fossil fuels.
“Even in the event that Biden wins the election, we think the prospects of the solar industry look much less favorable given a lower probability of an extension of the investment tax credit,” said Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA, in a research note. CFRA downgraded SunPower and manufacturer  Canadian Solar  (NASDAQ:CSIQ) Inc. to hold from buy.
While investors may be spooked by the uncertainty, it’s unlikely a second Trump term would significantly thwart the growth of wind and solar power. Demand for clean power has increased throughout the Republican’s presidency, thanks to state-level policies, corporations pushing to go green and a growing appetite for environmental, social and governance, or ESG, investments.
A Biden victory, conversely, could be give natural gas a boost as “a cleaner transition fuel” in the shift to a lower-carbon economy, RBC analyst Scott Hanold said in a note.

208,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 02:16PM ET</span>","Investors positioning for U.S. gridlock, dialing back bets on large stimulus and tax hikes","By David Randall and Tom Arnold
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Investors began pricing in a greater chance of gridlock in Washington, scaling back predictions of a large coronavirus relief bill, as votes continued to be tallied from Tuesday's U.S. presidential election, which was much closer than polls had suggested. 
That saw some tempering of so-called ""reflation"" trades that had predicted a strong Democratic score in presidential and U.S. Senate races would lead to a bigger stimulus and higher inflation, as well as some safe-haven buying on caution that the election is so close. 
""Markets had priced in a Democratic sweep over the last few days, and with greater prospects of divided government, the fiscal response in 2021 looks much different,"" said Katie Deal, Washington Policy associate analyst at T. Rowe Price. 
U.S. Treasuries and the dollar gained as investors calculated that even if Democratic challenger Joe Biden were to win the White House, his party may not have the support of the Senate needed to push through the large fiscal stimulus investors had hoped for.
Technology stocks surged, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) gaining more than 3.5%, betting on receding chances of a Democratic takeover of Washington that could usher in an increase in capital gains taxes or tougher antitrust measures.
Even though Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" the CBOE Volatility Index, eased, it remained unusually high, reflecting the likelihood that it may be days before the result is known in the three key Rust Belt states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
Reflecting that uncertainty, betting markets swung violently on the presidential vote. Early in the count, bookmakers flipped from having for months assumed a Biden win to suddenly pricing a high probability that President Donald Trump would keep the White House. But as votes streamed in, they reversed again and now strongly favor Biden's chances - up to 70% or more. 
Trump won the battleground state of Florida and with the race down to a handful of states, both Trump, 74 and Biden, 77, had possible paths to reach the minimum 270 Electoral College votes needed to win.
The U.S. dollar jumped to its highest in three months against the euro before giving up some gains, while the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note slipped off five-month highs as investors prepared for prolonged political uncertainty.
NO 'BLUE WAVE'
But some investors saw fading chances for Democrats to score a big win in the Senate and regain control of the upper chamber as Republicans held the line in several contests that had seemed up for grabs. 
Markets have been fixated in recent weeks on prospects for a massive stimulus bill to help the U.S. economy recover from the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 230,000 Americans.
The prospect of a ""Blue Wave"" sweep in which Biden wins and Democrats capture the Senate had gained a lot of investor attention in recent weeks. It was seen as the surest path to a massive fiscal package that could support equities and accentuate trends of a weaker dollar and a steeper yield curve due to greater government spending. 
Analysts at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) said the picture so far ""blurs the path towards a fiscal stimulus package and causes reflation trades, still palpable yesterday, to unwind."" 
Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING in London said the thought ""is that regardless who wins the presidential race, Congress will remain divided. This justifies a reversal of the ‘reflation trade' that was priced in the run-up to vote."" 
Some investors see a Trump win, which would take tax hikes favored by Biden off the table, as a best-case scenario for the stock market. Ahead of the election, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) predicted an ""orderly"" Trump victory as the most favorable outcome for equities.
The increased chance of continued Republican control of the Senate was seen as decreasing the chance of rising capital gains taxes and boosting tech, said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance Securities. 
Since the 2016 election of Trump, who ushered in corporate tax cuts that supported equities but also imposed trade tariffs that led to volatility, the U.S. stock market has gained over 57% and hit new highs.
Investors remain most worried about the presidential race being too close to call or contested for a while.

""Markets can live with either candidate,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners. ""The scenario they don't want are legal problems over the outcome and significant political unrest.""

209,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>",Analysis: Wall Street cheers U.S. election removing major tax-hike threat,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief on Wednesday, as the latest U.S. election tallies pointed to a divided government that made the prospect of tax hikes advocated by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden unlikely. (N) 
Biden has proposed raising the capital gains tax rate from 20% to 39.6% for those making over $1 million, which would represent a big blow to the asset management industry. Other tax hikes he has put forward include increasing the statutory corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%.
Biden was leading in key Midwestern states in the race for the White House as votes were being counted on Wednesday afternoon, but President Donald Trump's Republican Party was poised to keep control of the Senate even as Democrats retained their majority in the House of the Representatives. [nL1N2HQ0VQ] Tax changes would need to be voted through the House and the Senate and be approved by the White House to become law. 
Even if Biden were to prevail over Trump, the composition of the legislature would make it challenging for him to push ahead with his tax changes. Pollsters' earlier predictions that Democrats would win control of the White House and Congress had cast a cloud over Wall Street, fund managers said.
""The markets are taking comfort from the fact that there likely won't be a significant tax increase any time soon,"" said Troy Gayeski, co-chief investment officer of hedge fund investment firm SkyBridge Capital.
Shares of private equity firms, whose performance fees would have sustained a big tax hit were Biden to have his way, soared on the early voting results. Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX), KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) and  Carlyle Group  Inc (O:CG) shares jumped 7.1%, 7.4% and 4.2%, respectively. Other fund managers, including hedge funds and venture capital firms, also expressed relief.
""Regardless of the outcome for president, fears of a blue wave and the potential for a sweeping overhaul for private equity regulation are likely stemmed with the Republican Party likely maintaining control of the Senate,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday.
Shares of large mutual fund managers such as BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and T. Rowe Price Group Inc (O:TROW), whose business would also have a taken a hit from a capital gains tax hike, also rallied. 
""Even if Biden wins the presidency, it will be much more difficult for him to pass his proposed tax increases and the market clearly likes that,"" said Bolvin Wealth Management Group President Gina Bolvin. ""Markets like gridlock because a divided government takes out extremes.""

IMPACT ON DEALMAKING
A capital gains tax hike would have also weighed on Wall Street's business of advising on mergers and acquisitions. Investment bankers said a pickup in corporate divestments by individuals, families and private equity firms in the run-up to the election was fueled by fears of Biden implementing his tax plan. Bankers were worried about deal activity slowing down over the next few years if Biden's tax changes were enacted. [nL8N2H55OY]
Even though taxes are only one consideration for corporate sellers, the prospect of divided government has now removed a significant overhang for dealmakers, advisers to companies said.
""If you had a family that was looking to sell a business, they may breathe a sigh of relief now on potential tax changes but they need to be aware that things may change again in two years,"" said Daniel Wolf, a partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP. 
Banks were big beneficiaries of tax cuts under Trump, making a reversal seem ominous. Biden's tax plan would have reduced big banks' earnings per share by a median of 7.4% based on 2021 estimates, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Betsy Graseck. Bank stocks were slightly up on Wednesday afternoon. [nL1N2H60SQ]
""It is now unlikely that we're going to get a hike in the corporate tax rate,"" said Fred Cannon, director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

There was more good news for Wall Street in several key congressional races. Many banks' favorite lawmakers declared victory overnight, leaving the composition of banking committees in the House of Representatives and Senate largely intact. [nL1N2HQ2L5]

210,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 01:40PM ET</span>","Biogen Alzheimer's drug closer to approval with U.S. FDA staff backing, shares jump 40%","By Deena Beasley and Manojna Maddipatla
(Reuters) - Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) has shown ""exceptionally persuasive"" evidence that its experimental Alzheimer's disease drug is effective, U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff said on Wednesday, elevating its chances of a swift approval and sending company shares soaring.
An FDA approval could come by March, which would make the drug, aducanumab, the first new treatment for the disease in decades and the first that appears to be able to slow progression of the fatal, mind-wasting condition that affects millions of people.
Shares of Biogen and its partner Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) Ltd both jumped 40%. The FDA staff comments also buoyed shares of other Alzheimer's drug developers, including a 15% rise in shares of Eli Lily and Co.
The agency's documents were released ahead of a meeting on Friday of outside experts who will review, and decide whether to recommend approval of, aducanumab, an antibody designed to remove amyloid plaques from the brain.
""Briefing documents suggests a positive Advisory Committee vote, which bodes well for approval,"" Guggenheim analyst Yatin Suneja said in a research note. Mizuho Securities analyst Salim Syed called it ""almost a best-case scenario"" for Biogen.
FDA drug reviewers said results from one pivotal trial of aducanumab were persuasive and strongly positive. They acknowledged that a second large trial did not succeed, but maintained it did not detract from the findings of the positive study. The FDA is not obligated to abide by its expert panel recommendations, but typically does.
One statistical reviewer at the FDA said another study is needed to confirm whether aducanumab is effective. ""There is no compelling substantial evidence of treatment effect or disease slowing,"" FDA staffer Tristan Massie wrote in the review.
Alzheimer's disease afflicts nearly 6 million Americans and millions more worldwide. Biogen estimates about 1.5 million people with early Alzheimer’s in the United States could be candidates for its drug.
Patient advocacy groups have argued that aducanumab needs to be approved due to that large unmet medical need. 
""If a third trial is recommended then years could go by ... while people aren't granted access to the drug,"" said Dr. Howard Fillit, chief science officer at the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Foundation.
Biogen and its investors also need an aducanumab approval after the company recently lost a patent fight over its big-selling multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera. If approved, annual sales are forecast to reach $5.3 billion by 2025, according to Refinitiv.

Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen in October last year revived its plans to seek approval for aducanumab, months after it had said that an independent futility analysis of its two pivotal studies showed they were unlikely to succeed.
Biogen said it changed course after a new analysis showed a high dose of the drug could slow disease progression. 
The FDA staff said data from one of the trials ""provides the primary evidence of effectiveness as a robust and exceptionally persuasive study demonstrating"" a clinically meaningful treatment effect.
Shares of Biogen were up $99.57 at $346.58, and shares of Eisai were up $30.82 at $110.12.

211,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 01:18PM ET</span>",Stock Traders Seize on a Failproof Mantra of the Bull Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Stock traders who once counted on a fiscal splurge under a Blue Wave Congress have kept their mojo thanks to a time-tested driver of the bull market: Cheap money.
As Treasuries surged, investing strategies riding near-zero interest rates got another shot in the arm -- helping money managers look past their dashed hopes for a massive stimulus under a unified Democratic government.
With U.S. stocks jumping as the ongoing vote count pointed to a Joe Biden win under a Republican Senate, market pundits were quick to tout the positive case for equities. A stimulus package -- albeit a smaller one -- is still likely, while the Federal Reserve is iron-clad in its resolve to pin down rates.
Among the winners for the renewed low-for-longer regime: Large-cap companies over small, growth stocks over value, America over the rest of the world. In sum, it’s game on for a rally long seen as divorced from Main Street.
“Less stimulus means lower U.S. Treasury yields, lower inflation expectations and an increased burden on the Fed to offset economic damage from the current Covid surge,” Evercore ISI strategists led by Dennis DeBusschere wrote in a note. “As a result, bond volatility is likely to move significantly lower, which will bias the VIX lower and support equities.”
As inflation expectations dropped on Wednesday, real yields fell, helping strategies linked to growth and momentum stocks. The drop in long-term borrowing costs is good for shares such as Big Tech that are attractive for their long-term growth, since it means future cash flows can be discounted at lower rates. Conversely, all that bodes ill for value stocks that had gained a bit of traction lately on expectations for a Blue Wave.
The return to tech leadership is also likely to benefit hedge funds, which tend to be overweight the sector, according to a note from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG’s prime risk advisory team. Wednesday’s market moves lifted the outperformance of popular bullish bets among such clients, it said.
Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 Index of small-caps were set for their worst day versus the S&P 500 since April. Emerging-market shares headed for their biggest underperformance against U.S. stocks -- which benefit from having more growth exposure -- in more than a month.
Before the election, many investors had counted on a Democratic sweep to reverse these long-term trends in the equity market, especially since valuation gaps between the winners and losers had already widened to the most in years.
Instead, political gridlock is likely to bring more of the same, at least for now.
“It is one of the calmest in terms of market shifts,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists Andrew Sheets and Serena Tang wrote in a note. “Scenarios with less fiscal stimulus are more likely than 24 hours ago, and that reduces the probability of larger, more extreme market rotations, rotations that we do not believe investors were positioned for.”
Even with the result still undecided, traders appear unfazed. In stocks, the Cboe Volatility Index dropped the most since March and bets on higher short-term swings in bonds also faded.
All in all, between expectations for rates to stay low for longer and some sort of fiscal stimulus eventually, risk sentiment appears sound. History is generally also on the side of staying put. As stocks rise over the long-term, performance has been similarly positive in both years of a split Congress and of unified government, according to an analysis from Capital Group published before this year’s vote.
And then there is always the Fed put.
“Fed intervention, and future fiscal stimulus (albeit slower and smaller than would be the case for either party’s clean sweep) should provide a modest upside to U.S. equities,” Mizuho International strategists Peter Chatwell and Henry Occleston wrote in a note.

(Reuters) - The United States' big technology names led gainers on Wall Street on Wednesday, as investors sought the security of this year's big stay-at-home corporate success stories in the face of a presidential election set to go down to the wire.
Overall, Wall Street's main indexes surged to a more-than-one-week high with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (IXIC) outperforming. (N)
Following are the major movers as traders and investors digested the results and President Donald Trump's chances of beating Democratic challenger Joe Biden to win a second term.
BIG TECH
Technology mega-caps have benefited from Trump's softer stance on regulation and anti-trust policies as well as a tax cut that targeted U.S. big business.
Microsoft (O:MSFT), Intel (O:INTC) and  IBM  (N:IBM) rose between 0.4% and 2.2%, while FAANG stocks Facebook (O:FB), Apple (O:AAPL), Amazon (O:AMZN), Netflix (O:NFLX) and Google (O:GOOGL) surged between 3.2% and 7.5%.
""With a Trump presidency more likely than expected and a more evenly balanced Senate, any big change like higher capital gains tax or a legislation that regulates the tax more aggressively is less likely, and that's why tech is doing better,"" said TS Lombard's head of strategy, Andrea Cicione.
U.S.-LISTED CHINESE STOCKS
The iShares MSCI China ETF (O:MCHI) scaled all-time highs, up 4.5% as a Biden administration is expected to ratchet down tensions in the U.S.-China tariff war.
Shares of Baidu (O:BIDU) JD.Com (O:JD)  Alibaba  (N:BABA) rose between 2.8% and 5.6%.
DEFENSE 
The iShares US Aerospace & Defense (Z:ITA) and the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (P:XAR) extended gains to a third session.
Contractors  Northrop Grumman  (N:NOC),  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) and Raytheon (N:RTX) rose between 2.2% and 6.0% after the Congressional results so far suggest Republicans retaining control of Senate.
""This removes the threat of a Blue Wave, and 'progressive' Democrats attempting to take an axe to the Department of Defense budget to fund other spending priorities,"" said Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard.
PHARMACEUTICALS
 Pfizer  (N:PFE),  Merck & Co  (N:MRK), Eli Lilly (N:LLY), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (O:REGN), Bristol Myers (N:BMY) and Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) all rose between 2.7% and 7.5%.
Analysts at SVB Leerink said a Trump win with a close Senate race was almost an ideal outcome for biopharma and that an effectively split Senate would likely shield the industry from any sweeping reforms.
(GRAPHIC: Trump vs Biden stock baskets - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprxamgpe/Pasted%20image%201604092623457.png) 
BANKS
Some of Wall Street's big banks slid, with JP Morgan (N:JPM), Bank of America (N:BAC) and Citi (N:C) down between 1.0% and 2.7% as market participants feared a divided Congress would make it harder for Washington to pass another coronavirus stimulus package.
""Now there will be a split Congress and, therefore, a lot more fiscal restraint and those expectations of higher inflation and high yields favoring banks and financials will have to be reassessed,"" Cicione said. 
 Wells Fargo  (N:WFC), Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) managed to eke out gains, with Goldman up 2%.
ALTERNATE ENERGY
The Invesco Solar ETF (P:TAN) dropped 3.5%, having gained more than 40% from September lows, while the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (O:ICLN), another instrument representing the developing sector, which Biden had made a key plank of his agenda, fell 2%.
""The fact that Republicans are likely to retain a Senate majority would make it virtually impossible for Biden (if he wins) to enact his major climate reforms,"" said Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov.
Stocks of solar energy firms such as First Solar (O:FSLR), Enphase (O:ENPH) and JinkoSolar (N:JKS) traded between 4.4% and 10.3% lower.
INDUSTRIALS
Shares of infrastructure companies such as  Caterpillar  (N:CAT), Vulcan Materials (N:VMC) and Jacobs Engineering (N:J) slid between 5.3% and 7.5%.
MARIJUANA
Major cannabis producers had surged after the vice presidential debate, when Biden's partner on the ticket Kamala Harris said marijuana would be decriminalized at the federal level under their administration.
But with exit polls surprising markets, the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (N:MJ) slipped 2.4%.
Shares of Tilray (O:TLRY), as well as U.S.-based listings of Canada's  Canopy Growth  (N:CGC),  Cronos  (O:CRON) and Aurora Cannabis (N:ACB) fell between 9.4% and 7.8%.

213,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 12:22PM ET</span>",European stocks jump at close with eyes on tight U.S. election race,"By Sruthi Shankar
(Reuters) - European stocks closed with strong gains on Wednesday as investors unwound bets of a Democratic sweep in the U.S. presidential election as the race proved far closer than polls had predicted.
The healthcare sector (SXDP), typically considered more stable during times of economic uncertainty, rallied 4.9%, while technology stocks (SX8P) that have powered a rebound in global equities since the pandemic lows, surged 3.0%.
Global markets were whipsawed earlier as U.S. Republican President Donald Trump took the lead over Democratic rival Joe Biden in a number of vital swing states, while opinion polls had given Biden a strong lead nationwide for months.
Adding to concerns, Trump falsely claimed he had won the election with millions of votes still uncounted, and said he would go the U.S. Supreme Court to fight for the win if needed.
After falling as much as 1.3% at one point, the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) swung 2.1% higher, while the German DAX (GDAXI) gained 2% and UK's FTSE (FTSE) rose 1.7%.
European markets gained earlier this week on anticipation a Biden win would bring better trade ties with Washington and a bigger fiscal package for the coronavirus-hit U.S. economy.
Economically sensitive banking (SX7P), oil & gas (SXEP) and mining (SXPP) stocks fell into the red after leading a surge this week on hopes of more stimulus.
Wind turbine makers Vestas (CO:VWS) and Siemens  Gamesa  (MC:SGREN), which were expected to benefit from Biden's clean energy plan, fell 3.5% and 1.6% respectively.
""Markets are to some extent reversing the pricing in of the 'blue wave'. We have better support for likes of healthcare and technology,"" said Jonathan Stubbs, equity strategist at Berenberg. 
On Wall Street, the technology-heavy Nasdaq (IXIC) index surged 4.1% as investors said chances faded for Democrats to score a big win in the U.S. Senate, lowering bets of higher antitrust scrutiny and capital gains taxes. 
""We would interpret the outperformance of the Nasdaq as possibly a divided government, less fiscal stimulus, and more stay-at-home environment as COVID-19 cases rise,"" said Matthias Scheiber, global head of multi asset portfolio management at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management.
European equities, which lean on ""value"" sectors such as banks and energy, trade at a record low relative to U.S. stocks which count big on ""growth"" sectors like technology.

Among individual movers, German online fashion retailer Zalando (DE:ZALG) jumped 4% after it confirmed the increased guidance it gave last month.

Britain's Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) surged almost 5% after encouraging performance in its food business but reported the first loss in its 94 years as a publicly listed company.

214,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 12:15PM ET</span>",Ant's IPO fiasco set to clip its wings and dent its value,"By Scott Murdoch and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's surprise suspension of Ant Group's record $37 billion listing is likely to delay rather than destroy its chances of a stock market debut though the financial technology giant's valuation and growth prospects are set to take a hit.
The last-minute ambush by China's regulators was seen by analysts and investors as an attempt to cut Ant founder Jack Ma and his financial services empire down to size but they expected it to eventually list in Hong Kong and Shanghai as planned.
""Ant's business is likely to be restricted by new financial regulations. As a result, the relaunched IPO price will most likely be lowered,"" said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research.
Ant has been trying to present itself as a technology firm rather than a financial giant and its valuation up until now has benefited from its tech focus. 
But Chinese regulators have become uncomfortable with parts of its sprawling empire - namely its lucrative online lending business which contributed almost 40% of its overall revenue in the first half of the year.
Under draft rules published on Monday, online lenders in China would have to stump up more of their own capital for loans, which is expected to hurt Ant's business model. Ant's co-lending subsidiaries Huabei and Jiebei would also no longer be allowed to sell wealth management products, analysts said.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said on Wednesday that recent regulatory changes could have a ""major impact"" on Ant's business structure and profit model. 
It said suspending the initial public offering (IPO) was a responsible move both for investors and markets.
COLLISION COURSE
The suspension was seen as a stunning rebuke for billionaire Ma, a former English teacher who built e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and its affiliate Ant into two of China's biggest success stories.
Ma's net worth was set to almost double following the IPO to $59 billion, based on the valuation of Ant shares. Instead, his estimated wealth fell $3 billion after shares in Alibaba, in which he has a stake of 4.8%, fell 8.1% in New York on Tuesday.
Shares in Alibaba, which owns a third of Ant, ended 7.5% lower in Hong Kong on Wednesday and were trading nearly 3% higher in New York. 
The Shanghai stock exchange's decision on Tuesday to suspend the IPO followed a meeting between China's financial regulators and Ant executives, including Ma, who were told the company's online lending business would face tighter scrutiny, sources told Reuters.
The exact nature of the regulators' concerns and just how long a suspension might last is not known. The Shanghai bourse described the meeting as a material event that could cause Ant to be disqualified from listing.
Ant said in a filing on Wednesday it would maintain close communication with regulatory authorities and the Hong Kong and Shanghai bourses on the progress of its IPO and listing and would disclose information in a timely manner.
Ma's public criticism last month of financial regulations as stifling innovation had put him on a collision course with regulators in China, analysts said.
IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST
Regulators have, however, also become uncomfortable with banks increasingly using micro-lenders or third-party technology platforms such as Ant for underwriting loans amid fears defaults could rise and the quality of loans deteriorate in an economy hit by the coronavirus pandemic. 
At a regular media briefing in Beijing, Wang Wenbin, a spokesman at the Chinese foreign ministry, said: ""(The suspension) is a decision made to better safeguard capital market stability and protect investor rights and interests.""
Mom-and-pop investors who put in bids worth a record $3 trillion in Ant - equivalent to Britain's annual economic output - were stunned after regulators abruptly suspended what would have been the world's largest stock market debut.
The halt to the IPO has not only hurt Ant but also the bank leading the listing, China International Capital Corporation (CICC), as it is likely to miss out on a hefty payday and a jump in global investment banking rankings. 
Chinese state media on Wednesday described the move as necessary and in the public interest.
""The basic message of Chinese regulators' intervention in the Ant IPO is that this de-risking agenda is still the top priority. No innovation is so important that it can be allowed to create financial instability,"" said Andrew Batson at Gavekal Research.
Batson said Ant would almost certainly return to the market but it might have to make substantial changes to its internal organisation and business model to meet regulatory requirements.
LOWER VALUATION
Analysts pointed to a consultation paper issued by the People's Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission on Monday that recommended the tightening of regulations for online micro-lending companies as foreshadowing the regulators' move against Ant.
""It is disappointing as there was a lot of work by all parties and it still surprises us this new regulation was not dealt with earlier,"" said a Hong Kong-based fund manager who bought stock in the IPO.
""The IPO will come back but timing is the question. And valuation will certainly be lower,"" said the fund manager, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
Iris Tan, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said she thought regulators were aiming to level the playing field for fintech players and traditional financial institutions and that she expected Ant to be required to have more registered capital for its consumer credit business.
Chinese bank shares rose on Wednesday, reflecting the possibility of a more level playing field, with the CSI300 banks index climbing 1.7%.
But few people were willing to hazard a guess as to just how long the delay might last or how far Ant's valuation could fall. 

Its listing had been set to value Ant at $315 billion, which would have made it Asia's fifth most valuable firm and worth more than the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's biggest bank by assets.

LONDON (Reuters) - Financial markets have been thrown a curve ball by a closer-than-expected U.S. presidential election result, raising the prospect of a disputed outcome and diminished fiscal stimulus to contain the COVID-19 shock.
While Democrat challenger Joe Biden had been a strong favourite to defeat incumbent President Donald Trump, the latter's unexpectedly strong showing whacked some investment bets such as in green shares and short dollar positions. 
The following charts show changes in betting odds and various asset classes as the vote count progressed:
1/DON'T BET ON IT
Betting markets swung from Biden towards Trump as counting started and then back towards the Democrat challenger, according to Britain-based Smarkets Exchange which now gives him a 60% chance of winning. That's a massive flip from 29% in early counting.
Online prediction market PredictIt saw a similar reversal, giving Biden a 73% chance of winning, from as low as 30% earlier.

2/BONDS: LOWER AND FLATTER 
Ten- and 30-year U.S. Treasury borrowing costs posted their biggest one-day drop since June as investors pared bets on a big Democrat-led fiscal stimulus package and expectations grew the Federal Reserve would have to step in again to support the economy. 
Yields inched off lows as betting odds swung [GVD/EUR].
The gap between 2- and 10-year yields saw its biggest one-day narrowing move since end-March as chances faded of a Democrat sweep of the White House and both houses of Congress. [US/]

3/DOLLAR RISE AND EBB
Investors initially rushed to the greenback, seeking safety amid the uncertainty as well as trading the view that a Trump win was dollar positive. But after rising as much as 1.2% versus a currency basket and around 1% to the yuan its gains ebbed. [FRX/]
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said the uncertain outcome meant it no longer saw a ""compelling narrative"" for dollar weakness.

4/THE FUTURE 
The prospect of a prolonged fight over the election outcome whipsawed equities, especially U.S. stock futures throughout the session. They rose when voting seemed to favour Trump, dropped when he vowed to make a Supreme Court challenge and then steadied to await the outcome.

5/ IS IT GREEN?
Big swings were seen on green assets which enjoyed a bumper rally in recent months, thanks to Biden's pledge to invest big in environmentally friendly projects. Solar and wind energy shares and ETFs lost as much as 6%-7% initially but clawed back most losses as Biden's chances appeared to improve.

216,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>",Wild Election Night Barely Registers in Wall Street’s Crazy Year,"(Bloomberg) -- They’ve faced down everything from the fastest bear market in history to barrels of oil selling for less than nothing. After traumas like that, it’ll take more than a messy election to derail bulls in the 2020 stock market.
A close or contested outcome to the U.S. presidential vote was supposed to be Wall Street’s worst-case scenario. Now, it’s come to pass. Investors needed roughly an hour to shake it off.
As they adjusted to the horse race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, early overnight volatility in stock futures was replaced by a broad rally. The benchmark S&P 500 Index jumped almost 3%. The tech-focused Nasdaq 100 surged more than 4%.
It’s all a far cry from the dramatic predictions of what a contested result would mean. Remarkable as it sounds, as nerves settle and clarity on the vote emerges, people on the Street are predicting more gains to come.
“With the chances of a significant increase in tax rates and headwinds to cash return largely off the table, the S&P has about 13% upside form yesterday’s close,” Dennis DeBusschere at Evercore ISI wrote in a note to clients. “Either a narrow Biden victory or Trump’s re-election would push that slightly higher.”
Steeled by months of upheaval, buttressed by bottomless Federal Reserve support, that brand of confidence was all over Wall Street the day after the vote. Sure, a decisive victory by either side would have brought clarity, but a divided government comes with upsides, too.
Consider that a President Biden could walk back the trade war, but probably not push a tax hike through a Republican-controlled Senate. Chances of any major legislation passing could be slim. The tech giants leading Wednesday’s bounce may be in no danger of imminent tougher regulations.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. were five of the six biggest drivers of the S&P 500’s rally. It’s a return to a trade that because of its haven qualities has been a big winner for most of the year.
“People said back in March and April that tech is a safe play. This sentiment is now returning -- big time,” Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, said by phone. “If a capital gains tax isn’t going to be increased, all those investors waiting to take chips off table in their tech positions are now saying, ‘You know what, I’ll hold on.’”
The downside of a divided legislature is that the stimulus floodgates may not open, and the shares of companies most exposed to the economic cycle are underperforming.
Banks -- especially vulnerable because they’re hurt both by the slowdown and low interest rates -- were some of the worst performers on Wednesday. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). were two of the biggest drags on the S&P 500.
Meanwhile, the election still has to be settled. Trump has already falsely claimed victory, said counting should stop and pledged to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, though his meaning was unclear.
“The absolute low point of the night, hands down, was seeing the currently-sitting president of the United States intimating that certain legally cast votes shouldn’t be counted,” Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments, said in a phone interview. “From a market participant standpoint, that is the most fear-inducing and volatility-inducing point of the evening.”
But investors were ready for volatility in the build-up to the vote. The Cboe Volatility Index, the options-derived measure of expected price swings for the S&P 500 known as the VIX, was above 40 a week ago compared with a one-year average of less than 28.
“The whole market was braced,” said James Masserio, co-head of equities and equity derivatives for the Americas at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY). “We were running special election risk scenarios: what happens if you have this kind of sector rotation? What happens if you have rates and equities move? Everybody saw this coming.”
The VIX dropped 6.6 basis points as of 11:10 a.m. in New York.
“Everyone kind of knew, no matter what, the results weren’t going to happen last night,” said Varghese Thomas, president and COO of TradingScreen. “Everyone’s buckled in and ready for the ride. And so far it hasn’t been as bumpy from a markets perspective.”

218,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>","Analysis: Whoever triumphs, investors see China, green and easy money bets as election winners","By Tommy Wilkes, Scott Murdoch and Tom Westbrook
LONDON/HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The close and inconclusive U.S. election has scuppered some short-term trades premised on a clear Joe Biden sweep, but money managers say they are sticking to bets on plentiful stimulus, a Chinese rebound and a green boom, regardless of who triumphs.
President Donald Trump's battle against Biden, the Democratic challenger, is going down to the wire, with millions of votes still to be counted as more states report results. 
From trade to taxation to climate, the two men have vastly different policy platforms. Biden's pledge to tie the U.S. economic recovery to tackling climate change is set against Trump's desire to remove regulatory hurdles to oil, gas and coal.
Lulled by Biden's opinion poll lead, some investors had positioned for higher U.S. bond yields and renewables shares. Some of those trades took a hit - shares in U.S. solar firms and European wind farms fell, while U.S. Treasuries gained and European shares initially underperformed.
Traders were also quick to dump automotive stocks (SXAP) as the spectre of more Trump protectionism resurfaced following years of a trade war with China.
""We expect quite a lot of market volatility. However, the core investment conditions that we see for the next 12 months won't be reversed by this volatility,"" said Rick Lacaille, global chief investment officer at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
Vast fiscal and monetary stimulus unleashed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is ""yet to work its way fully through the system"", Lacaille said, predicting that would continue to determine investment conditions in the coming year.
Indeed, fund managers appear in no rush to shake up portfolios, especially as a clear outcome is still potentially days away or could end up in the courts. 
There are several reasons. First, regardless of who is the next U.S. president, the global health and economic crisis triggered by COVID-19 will dominate the investment landscape.
Second, Asian shares clung to gains, implying confidence that the region's economic growth would not be derailed by a Trump win or policy gridlock in Washington. 
And perhaps most importantly, money should remain cheap and plentiful in the United States and elsewhere, underpinning the longer-term outlook for equity markets. 
A U.S. stimulus package is considered inevitable as politicians of all stripes try to spur an economic recovery hit by a resurgence in COVID-19.
While a Biden win could bring more spending -- along with higher yields on the government debt to pay for it -- the prospect of a delayed outcome sparked little panic, though U.S. Treasury bonds rallied. 
""Where we do have an anchor is that we know monetary policy will remain very easy and may become even easier,"" said Salman Ahmed, global head of macro and strategic asset allocation, at Fidelity international.
A shift to more environmentally-friendly investing is here to stay too, most reckon.
""The greening of the global economy is going to be something that will happen regardless of who's in charge, green energy is cheaper than fossil fuel energy,"" said Rupert Watson, head of asset allocation at Mercer Investments. 
""Politicians can give it a kick in the right direction but it will happen anyway.""

CHINESE STORY INTACT
In Asia, investors said they would continue to bet on China's recovery.
While the yuan  sold off sharply as Trump's chances appeared to improve, most did not expect the turbulence to last.
""Overall, globally, the world is underinvested in Chinese assets. There is still a relatively nice interest rate on the renminbi and China is outperforming in terms of growth,"" said Andreas Koenig, head of global FX at Amundi, Europe's biggest fund manager.
Emerging market assets remained well bid in Wednesday's trading session, and Koenig said he would be buying more yuan, Mexican pesos and Russian roubles once an election outcome was clear -- whoever makes it to the White House.
China's economic recovery has put a solid footing under company earnings and pushed its blue chip stock index (CSI300) up about 16% this year, compared to a 1.4% drop on broader global stocks (MIWO00000PUS) - something investors think has further to run.
""Chinese equities and bonds will likely continue to attract interest from overseas investors ... Chinese consumers and exports, the two pillars to China's economic growth engine, are intact,"" said Lei Wang, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management in New Mexico.

223,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 09:38AM ET</span>",Wall Street Surges at Open as Biden Edges Ahead in Tight Race,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened sharply higher on Wednesday as Joe Biden edged ahead in a presidential election that failed to produce a clear winner overnight. 
With most votes counted, the Democratic former vice president had overturned early deficits to enjoy wafer-thin advantages in the crucial swing states of Wisconsin and Michigan. If he wins these two and the state of Nevada, where counting is also still ongoing, his victory would be more or less assured.  
However, at least part of the positive reaction from stocks was due to signs that the Senate will stay in Republican hands, reducing the prospect of a hefty increase in capital gains tax under a unified Democratic Congress. 
By 9:37 AM ET (1437 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 117 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.8%. 
Michael Townsend, a political analyst with  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), said via Twitter that two more years of a divided Congress, as seems likely, would mean ""no big tax changes, no end of filibuster, no packing the (Supreme) Court, not much of anything from a legislative standpoint.""
Most importantly, from a short-term market perspective, he added that it means ""Modest, not massive, stimulus package probably waits until early 2021.""
Mohamed El Erian, chief economic advisor at Pimco parent Allianz (DE:ALVG), also noted to CNBC that it means more pressure on the Federal Reserve to act, when it announces the results of its latest policy meeting on Thursday.  His comments came just ahead of a much weaker-than-expected private payrolls report from ADP, which set a gloomy tone ahead of the official U.S. labor market report for October, which is due on Friday.
ADP said the private sector created only 365,000 jobs in October, well below the 650,000 consensus forecast, in a sign that the labor market rebound is flattening out as a new wave of Covid-19 threatens the U.S.. Deaths from the coronavirus topped 1,000 on Tuesday, while hospital admissions are now at their highest in over three months. The ISM non-manufacturing purchasing managers index for October also fell by more than expected. 
Among individual stocks, the big winners included Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) . after California voters approved a ballot exempting them from a new law that would have forced them to reclassify drivers as employees, with all of the attendant non-wage costs that implies. Uber stock rose 11.8% while Lyft rose 12.1%. 
Health insurance stocks also gained strongly, as the prospect of deadlock in Congress reduced the risk of a major overhaul that would hit the sector's profitability. Cigna (NYSE:CI) stock rose 12.5%, while Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) stock rose 8.9% and UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) stock rose 8.5%.

225,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 08:30AM ET</span>",Stocks turn positive in knife-edge U.S. election race,"By Wayne Cole and Marc Jones
LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Share markets and the dollar whipsawed while bonds gained on Wednesday as results from the U.S. presidential election proved far closer than polls had predicted, potentially leaving the outcome in doubt for days or even weeks.
Democratic contender Joe Biden took to the air to declare he was optimistic about winning and called for all votes to be counted, no matter how long it took.
President Donald Trump responded in trademark combative style, saying he had won, that ""they"" were trying to steal the election, and that he would go the U.S. Supreme Court to fight for victory. (Full Story)
Investors had initially wagered that a possible Democratic sweep by Biden could ease political risk and provide a boost to fiscal stimulus.
But the mood quickly changed as Trump snatched Florida and Ohio and ran much closer in other battleground states than polls predicted.
U.S. equity futures went on a wild ride, climbing as the voting seemed to favour Trump, dropping when he vowed to make a Supreme Court challenge, before clawing higher and steadying again as betting markets leaned back in Biden's favour.
Europe's main bourses were also choppy on the prospect of a long and bitter fight. London, Paris and Frankfurt had all fallen as they opened, but turned modestly positive ahead of U.S. trading having also shrugged off data showing the region heading for a 'double dip' recession. 
Amundi's Head of Global Views Didier Borowski said ""prudence"" was needed with the U.S. election result firmly in limbo.
""We expect an 85% likelihood of knowing the winner within ten days."" However, there is a ""real possibility"" it could take until January, including the Senate. ""This environment is conducive to volatility and a retreat towards safe havens.""
Dealers said investors may consider a status quo result would lessen political uncertainty and remove the risk a Biden administration would roll back corporate tax cuts.
The technology sector saw reason to gain, with NASDAQ futures jumping 2.8%. E-Mini futures were last up 1.2%, a more than 2% swing from the 1% drop seen when Trump vowed to go to the Supreme Court. 
Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance Securities, said the move in techs appeared to be a play on the Senate potentially staying Republican.
Brenner said that under a Biden win tech stocks were seen faring worse, as Democrats would be expected to tackle the sector in hearings and because a potential rise in capital gains tax would hit tech stocks harder.
Stéphane Monier, CIO at Lombard Odier said a divided Congress would have ""far-reaching implications for markets, mostly because it means that any kind of pandemic recovery package is still tough to approve"".
TOO CLOSE TO CALL
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei finished 1.7% higher, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.4%.
Chinese blue chips rose 0.7%, with markets uncertain how Sino-U.S. relations would develop.
Some investors hedged against the risk of a contested election or at least a drawn-out process as mail-in ballots were counted.
""It's a wait-and-see,"" said Matt Sherwood, head of investment strategy at Perpetual in Sydney.
""I think the odds of a clean (Democrat) sweep are diminishing, almost by the minute. That reduces the possibility, or the likelihood at least of a large stimulus programme being agreed to in the first days of a Biden administration.""
That saw 10-year Treasury yields fall back to between 0.79% and 0.82, having been at a five-month top of 0.93% before the vote.
The U.S. dollar also had a roller coaster session, falling, then rising, before easing back again to sit up 0.2% against a basket of currencies at 93.392 =USD. The euro bounced back to $1.1717 from a hard overnight that had taken it as low as $1.1602. 
Emerging market currencies pinballed. The Mexican peso recovered from a 2% tumble taken when the sudden chance of a Trump victory sparked nerves about U.S. trade policies continuing to favour tariffs.
Norway's crown, Australia's risk-sensitive dollar and Britain's pound were all fighting back too, China's Yuan spun to hit a 2-week high while the Russian rouble RUB=, which had been one of the hardest fallers in the election run-up, gave back overnight gains. 
STILL TO COME
Investors await the outcome of U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England meetings this week, which are expected to at least give a nod to further stimulus following the latest acceleration of coronavirus infections in Europe and the U.S.
The Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday cut interest rates to near zero and boosted its bond-buying programme, adding to the tidal wave of cheap money flooding the global financial system.
Gold had been buoyed by the extensive liquidity but ran into profit-taking on Wednesday, losing as much 1% to $1,887 an ounce.
Oil prices overcome their own wobbles to reclaim gains made after industry data showed crude inventories in the United States dropped sharply. 
Dealers said a returned Republican administration would likely be more positive for the oil industry than the Democrats that favour renewable technology.

U.S. crude futures were up 96 cents, or 2.6% at $38.62 a barrel, Brent crude futures gained 2.9% cents to $40.86, while U.S.-listed solar shares of Enphase, Sunpower, Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) and First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) and Invesco's solar ETF, which have all been boosted by Biden's climate change concerns dropped up to 7% in pre-market trade.

227,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Finance executives fret as U.S. presidential vote too close to call,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss, Lawrence Delevingne and Anna Irrera
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Financial executives worldwide are waiting for a clear winner in the U.S. election after President Donald Trump without evidence claimed foul play in the fight for the White House, stoking fears of a drawn-out count that will keep markets on edge.
While the Republican incumbent has handed the financial industry huge tax breaks and deregulatory wins, Trump's first term has also been marked by volatility and unpredictability, particularly in international trade.
Wall Street has leant to the left this election, with Democratic challenger Joe Biden outstripping Trump in financial industry fundraising. 
Many executives said they did not support all Biden's policies, but said they believed he would be more predictable and better for the country.
""There was a lot of trepidation for this election. There were people expecting violence. The White House was fenced up,"" said David Bailin, chief investment officer of Citi's private banking arm.
""Guess (NYSE:GES) what? We now have something to worry about. Had there been a clear election outcome, there would have been one day of activity. A prolonged struggle, given the sort of tensions, could be something uglier,"" he said.
Global investors on Wednesday began reversing some Biden trades that had prompted a jump in Wall Street's main indexes on Tuesday.
""People are mostly talking about banks today: they are the worst performing sector, as the likelihood of a blue wave and big Biden stimulus plan recedes,"" said Paul Leech, co-head of equities at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
Several financial markets, including U.S. equity futures and the U.S dollar, gyrated as voting projections for swing states appeared to favour Trump.
Bank stocks in Europe fell, with the STOXX index of European lenders down 2% while the main bourses in London, Paris and Frankfurt rose by 0.2% to 0.3% by 1130 GMT.
London-based banks that staffed trading floors overnight reported a long night of talking to nervous clients. The greatest trading activity was in the early hours of Wednesday before volumes tailed off sharply before dawn. 
Jim McCormick (NYSE:MKC), global head of desk strategy at British investment bank NatWest Markets, said it would be ""all hands on deck"" with the outcome so uncertain.
Analysts said it could be days before all votes were counted. 
The experience was very different from Nov. 9, 2016, when, with no pandemic raging, New York city and other financial centres hosted informal watch parties in bars, and Trump's victory was called at around 2.30 a.m.
While there were few signs of disruption or violence at polling sites on Tuesday, Trump's assertion of election cheating without citing evidence left some finance executives wondering if it was too soon to rule out civil unrest.
""There are no problems right now but that's only because there's no answer right now,"" said Billy Weber, CEO of Checkpoint Capital, a fixed-income platform. 
Others said financial firms could cash in on the volatility.
""You start seeing customers increasingly looking to hedge either positions, so you start seeing volumes picking up on risk management products,"" Johann Scholtz, an equity research analyst at Morningstar said.

'PERFECT STORM' 
The S&P 500 Index has risen 48.8% during Trump's tenure, which he has frequently cited as a measure of success. But Trump has not been uniformly loved by the financial industry. 
He has attacked corporate leaders, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co CEO Jamie Dimon, and Wall Street chiefs have distanced themselves from Trump as he drew criticism for his handling of the pandemic and of racial justice protests. 
But the U.S. financial industry is also worried about higher corporate taxes, a fresh enforcement crackdown and an emboldened consumer watchdog under Biden. [L1N2HD1OK]
The former vice president has cast himself as someone who will unify the country and has aligned himself with progressives fiercely critical of Wall Street. 
Regardless of the winner, the global financial community prefers a decisive outcome.
""If we get a Biden victory and a split in terms of the Senate remaining with the Republicans and the Democrats in Congress, I think markets would take that probably worse,"" said Devan Kaloo, global head of equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
Still, some young Republican finance executives said they were anticipating gathering to celebrate a Trump victory. 
Charles Kolean, a 25-year-old investment industry worker who spent months raising cash to re-elect Trump, said he had reserved a section of a Dallas bar, where he and some 100 friends planned to toast another four years for the president, albeit wearing masks. 

""The perfect storm is coming together to make Donald Trump a two-term president,"" he said.

228,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 06:54AM ET</span>",Nasdaq Futures Soar; Tech Gains as Election Hangs in the Balance,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Wednesday, in choppy trade, with tech stocks outperforming as investors seek to balance positions given a tighter-than-expected presidential election race.
At 8 AM ET (1200 GMT),S&P 500 Futures traded 21 points, or 0.6%, higher, the Dow Futures contract fell 10 points, or 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 250 points, or 2.5%. 
The race for the White House remained fiercely contested Wednesday, with several battleground states still to declare thanks to the unprecedented numbers of mail-in ballots that need to be processed.
Incumbent President Donald Trump has won much of the south of the country, while Democrat Joe Biden has seemingly taken Arizona, meaning the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are now seen as key. States have until December 8 to resolve any disputes over vote counts, but Trump has already declared victory and urged an end to vote-counting, a move that the campaign of his rival Joe Biden called ""illegal and outrageous"". 
“The election is far closer than polls had suggested,” said ING’s James Knightley, in a research note. “Animosity and the threat of legal challenges argues against a swift fiscal support package which, with the growing threat of Covid, will be a concern for markets as activity becomes increasingly constrained.”
This has resulted in volatile trade, with investors moving back into technology stocks, one of the most trusted sectors over the last few months, but one that had seen hefty recent selling.
Specifically, ride-hailing firms Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) have posted strong gains premarket after California voters passed a proposal which means these companies don’t have to classify their drivers as employees. 
There are a number of economic data releases scheduled for Wednesday, including October ADP nonfarm employment and the September trade balance. But the key release will be the October ISM non-manufacturing PMI number, with the surge in coronavirus cases likely to lead to a drop in confidence in the services sector.
The evidence from Europe wasn’t encouraging, as IHS Markit's final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good gauge of economic health, dropped to 50.0 last month from September's 50.4. This suggested a double-dip recession is a real possibility.
Meanwhile, the earnings slate is relatively quiet Wednesday, with  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (NYSE:HLT) due before the open while Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Allstate (NYSE:ALL) report later in the day.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, with news that U.S. inventories dropped sharply last week, according to industry data, helping to counter worries about uncertainty over the election and rising coronavirus cases. Official stocks data are due later in the session.
U.S. crude futures traded 2.5% higher at $38.59 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.5% to $40.70, climbing back above the $40 level. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,903.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1709.

""Unite cannot comprehend why LBG would choose to cut 1,000 staff who have given the bank such commitment and dedication during a global pandemic,"" said Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer.
Lloyds posted forecast-beating quarterly profits last month after cashing in on a coronavirus-driven boom in demand for mortgages.
The majority of the latest roles cut are non-customer facing roles in the bank's group transformation and retail teams, with no branch closures announced.

230,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",Volatility Bets Looking Smart as Messy Election Whipsaws Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Stock traders who paid historic premiums to insure against wild swings are looking smart as Wall Street sizes up a contested election outcome with a divided Congress -- a worst-case scenario.
As post-vote disputes look more likely, S&P 500 futures swung violently between gains and losses in early London trading. The Cboe Volatility Index stayed well above its historic average at around 35 while the volatility futures curve remained firmly elevated.
It all looks potentially troubling for the high number of short-volatility trades that flooded the market in recent days, though it’s too early to judge their outcome. The put/call ratio of the VIX spiked to the highest in more than a decade in October, showing a slew of bets on the fear gauge to fall.
“Delays and/or lack of a clear result prolongs uncertainty, and raises the possibility the result will be legally disputed,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) strategists led by Emmanuel Cau wrote in a note on Wednesday. “Volatility is thus likely to remain elevated.”
Markets are braced for choppy trading. President Donald Trump falsely declared early Wednesday he had won re-election against Joe Biden and said he would ask the Supreme Court to intervene, even as several battleground states continued to count votes.
In their “too close to call“ scenario spelled out several weeks ago, Barclays strategists led by Maneesh Deshpande wrote: “Volatility would stay elevated and VIX futures would likely remain in backwardation,” referring to a downwardly sloping shape that’s a sign of heightened near-term anxiety.
Wall Street’s fear gauge has been famously jumpy for months in advance of the vote, as traders piled into hedges ahead of one of the most anticipated event risks in decades. While some of the high cost of options was attributable to call option demand, it’s also a sign that investors were prepared coming into Tuesday’s contest.
By one account, the volatility risk premium for the S&P 500 was near the highest level in the past decade on the Friday before the vote.
“The level of the VIX and the high sustained level of implied to realized volatility for several months indicates that the market rally since March was not just blindly complacent,“ Tallbacken Capital’s Michael Purves wrote in a note.

232,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 05:41AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Green Stocks Hit, Pharma Lifted by Election Uncertainty","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- With the outcome of the U.S. election in the balance, the clearest losers in European markets on Wednesday are the clean energy companies that had hoped for a decisive Democrat victory that would have paved the way for an accelerated transition to renewables. 
The big winners, meanwhile, appear to include pharma stocks, on the perception that a Congress set to remain split between the two main parties will be unable to enact any radical health reform that undercuts their pricing power. 
By 5:50 AM ET (1050 GMT), the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (NYSE:XLE), a rough proxy for the sector, was down 2.3%, having earlier lost as much as 3.5%. That it clawed back some of its losses was due to the first signs of late-counted votes skewing heavily toward the Democratic Party's candidate Joe Biden. The results from Milwaukee, a Democrat stronghold, erased a slim lead in the key swing state of Wisconsin that President Donald Trump had held after early counting. Similar developments are widely seen as possible in other undecided states, where the results of cities such as Philadelphia, Detroit and Atlanta have the potential to swing statewide counts in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia.
Some of the biggest losers were wind turbine makers:  Vestas Wind Systems AS  (OTC:VWDRY) stock fell 6.8%, and  Nordex  (DE:NDXG) stock fell 8.2%, while Siemens Gamesa (OTC:GCTAY) fell 3.0%. Vestas had earlier reported record quarterly deliveries and upheld its guidance for the current year.
Operators of wind and solar farms, which had hoped for a significant expansion of their market opportunity in the U.S., also suffered, with Oersted (OTC:DOGEF) stock falling 3,0% and Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) stock falling 1.0%. 
Iberdrola had only last week said its 81%-owned unit Avangrid (NYSE:AGR) would buy PNM Resources (NYSE:PNM) in a deal valued at $8.3 billion that would greatly expand its footprint in the U.S.
By contrast, pharma and health stocks started the session strongly before giving up some of their gains on the Milwaukee results.
Fresenius Medical Care (NYSE:FMS), whose biggest business is as operator of kidney dialysis clinics in the U.S., rose 5.7%, while pharma giants AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) and Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) saw their local stocks rise 4.7% and 3.6% respectively.
That is more a reflection of developments in the race for the Senate, where consensus expectations that the Democrats would overturn the Republican majority appear increasingly likely to be confounded.
With the GOP keeping control of the Senate and the Democrats keeping the House of Representatives, there is less chance of a radical reform of U.S. health care that would destroy the pricing power of the pharma and health sectors."
233,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>","Market ties between China, U.S. set to deepen regardless of who wins White House","By Samuel Shen and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As the world awaited definitive results from the U.S. presidential election, Chinese investors betting on the re-election of Donald Trump sent shares of a Shenzhen-listed air traffic control software firm soaring on Wednesday.
Wisesoft Co Ltd (SZ:002253), whose Chinese name sounds like ""Trump's big win"", saw its shares jump as much as 9.8% after early returns showed few signs of a conclusive Democratic victory in U.S. polls, making the stock a rare clear winner on the day.
Analysts and investors widely expect a win by Trump, who launched a trade war with China that will soon enter its 28th month, to weigh on Chinese shares in the short term.
""With Trump, Chinese companies don't know where the next hit is coming from and that makes it hard for them to make decisions about allocating capital,"" said Will Malcolm, portfolio manager at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors.
""With Biden, there would be 'guardrails' to the madness, so at least some idea of where the risks are, and companies can make decisions more easily. This would therefore benefit Chinese equities."" 
Whatever the result of the election, ties between U.S. and Chinese financial markets are only set to deepen, despite the trans-Pacific trade war and rocky diplomatic relations.
Amid talk of Sino-U.S. financial decoupling, China has accelerated reforming its capital markets, giving foreigners easier access to its stocks and bonds while promoting international use of the yuan.
Overseas investors held Chinese equities worth 2.75 trillion yuan ($409.5 bln) at the end of September, according to the latest data from the People's Bank of China, up nearly 1 trillion yuan from a year earlier, with the country's robust economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic proving a strong draw.
The blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) has gained more than 16% since the end of 2019, compared with a 4.3% gain for the S&P 500 (SPX). 
A rising yuan, high yields and inclusion in major global indexes have also fueled interest in Chinese government bonds, pushing total foreign holdings of its interbank market bonds to near 3 trillion yuan.
China's major stock indexes rose on Wednesday despite the election nail biter, though the onshore yuan  hit its weakest point since Oct. 13 as Trump's odds of victory rose.[.SS][CNY/]

WALL STREET FLOCKS
Even in the month before the election, amid widespread uncertainty about its outcome, major Wall Street institutions were intensively engaged with China, defying rising geopolitical risks in search of long-term growth opportunities.
Over three consecutive weekends, senior executives from U.S. firms including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Fidelity, Warburg Pincus, Bridgewater and Fidelity International attended - virtually and in person - a string of high-level Chinese financial conferences.
Ben Zhou, Hong Kong-based managing director of Warburg Pincus, said Sino-U.S. tensions have had little impact on the U.S. firm's China strategy or confidence in China. 
""Instead, we hope to seize new opportunities, because under the current circumstances, China's financial system is more open,"" Zhou said.
China this year fully opened its giant financial industry, scrapping foreign ownership limits in futures, brokerage and mutual fund businesses as part of the interim Sino-U.S. trade deal signed in January.
A top-level Sino-U.S. financial roundtable was held on Oct. 16 between Chinese officials and Wall Street banks with the aim of fostering goodwill and enhancing cooperation, two people with direct knowledge of the closed-door event said. 
Participants included BlackRock, Vanguard, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Fidelity, the sources said.
BlackRock and Fidelity plan to set up mutual fund units in China, while U.S. investment banks including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have bought control of their Chinese brokerage ventures.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks and asset managers in Britain can use exchanges from the European Union to trade shares from January, Britain's financial regulator said on Wednesday, creating a cross-border clash in securities rules for investors.
Britain left the EU in January and access to the bloc ends on Dec. 31, leaving both sides to decide where investors in their jurisdictions are obliged to trade shares.
The EU's securities watchdog ESMA has already said that investors from the bloc can only trade sterling-denominated shares in London, Europe's centre for multi-currency cross-border stock trading on platforms like the London Stock Exchange's Turquoise, Cboe, and Aquis Exchange.
But Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said on Wednesday it would allow firms to continue from January trading all shares on trading venues from the EU where they choose to do so, rather than limiting themselves to platforms headquartered in Britain.
""Any restriction on the trading of shares based on currency does not reflect the multicurrency nature of global capital markets and limits the ability of firms to determine how best to use global capital markets to support economic activity,"" the FCA said in a statement. 
Brussels had hoped that Britain would oblige investors in the United Kingdom to use domestic platforms to avoid a clash in regulatory requirements.
The FCA said it remains open to discussing with ESMA how to minimise any disruption that could arise from overlapping requirements on financial counterparties.

""Our approach, driven by our objectives, will preserve the ability of UK-based firms to execute their share trades at the venues where they can get the best outcomes for themselves and their customers,"" the FCA said.

235,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>",Explainer: What's next for Ant after China suspends $37 billion listing?,"By Yingzhi Yang and Pei Li
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's suspension of Ant Group's $37 billion listing just days ahead of its stock market debut has thrown the company and its investors into a tailspin and it faces a scramble to try and satisfy financial regulators, analysts say. 
The company has been trying to present itself as a technology company, rather than a financial giant, but Chinese regulators have become increasingly uncomfortable with parts of its sprawling empire, namely its most lucrative credit business which contributed close to 40% of the group’s revenue in the first half of the year.
WHAT ARE THE NEW REGULATORY RULES ANT FACES?
Chinese regulators moved on Monday to recommend the tightening of regulations for online micro-lending companies to help contain potential financial risks and rein in rising debt levels, foreshadowing Ant's listing suspension on Tuesday.
Analysts said Ant will need to abide by these rules and disclose their financial impact in order to press ahead with its plans to list in Shanghai and Hong Kong. 
The draft rules published by China’s central bank and banking regulator seek to raise the bar for micro-lenders to be able to provide online loans directly to consumers or jointly with banks, while limiting the amount they can lend.
The draft, open for public feedback until Dec. 2, requires small online lenders to provide at least 30% of any loan they fund jointly with banks, which is widely considered to be a key rule that will hurt the profitability of Ant’s current business model.
Ant’s two co-lending subsidiaries Huabei and Jiebei will no longer be allowed to sell wealth management products based on the new rules, analysts noted. 
""If the rules will be implemented, the online micro-lending industry will be heavily adjusted and the internet companies that are aggressively expanding through the lending business will be severely impacted,” wrote Dong Ximiao, chief analyst at Zhongguancun Internet Finance Institute, in a report published on Wednesday. 
WHAT ANT NEEDS TO DO
Zhang Yi, chief executive of consultancy iiMedia, said that regulators likely realised that Ant's credit business was not unlike a commercial bank when details were made public in its prospectus. 
To comply with regulatory demands, Ant’s best option might be split up its businesses into several IPOs, which include a credit unit IPO and a tech unit IPO (the payment unit), and get different multiples for different units of its businesses, Zhang said. 
More specifically, Ant will need to apply for new licenses for its credit business to fully comply with regulators and be regulated as an entity under financial holding company rules which took effect on Nov. 1, analysts noted.
These requirements mean that Ant's IPO will likely be unable to go ahead in the short-term, others said. 
On Wednesday, Ant said it would refund the application monies relating to the Hong Kong public offering, together with brokerage commission and transaction fees, in two batches without interest.
POSTPONEMENT, NOT CANCELLATION? 
Analysts also noted that since Ant as well as the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges described the listing as being ""suspended"", it will still press forward once major issues have been resolved. 
""Such regulatory and business model adjustments are all part of a process, they are not individual one-time-off events,” said Alex Sirakov, senior associate at advisory firm Kapronasia. 
""Financial services and consumer protection are not a static space and a good game theory outcome will imply that all sides involved will have to make concessions.""
Li Chengdong, a Beijing-based tech analyst, said Ant's valuation would likely be dented but what was in the company's favour was that it was still a giant with state investment backing and had an influential founder in the form of Jack Ma. 

""To stress systematic safety, this is the regulators' stressing their stance,"" he said. ""Ant may end up having an IPO that was not as ideal as what it would have had this time, but it won't be too bad.

236,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 04:50AM ET</span>",Big fees and bragging rights lost: Ant bankers hit by shock IPO suspension,"By Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The eleventh-hour halt to Ant Group's record $37 billion listing has not only hurt the firm, but also lead bank China International Capital Corporation (CICC), which likely loses out on a hefty payday and a jump in global investment banking rankings.
CICC <601995.SS> (HK:3908) had the coveted position of being the only bank to work on both legs of the Hong Kong and Shanghai listing, which would have made it eligible to earn more in fees than other banks on the deal.
League tables published on Monday by Dealogic distributing credit for the Ant deal saw CICC shoot to the second spot globally for new listings from fifth, placing it behind  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and ahead of Wall Street majors.
That would have been CICC's highest position on the global tables since it topped the rankings in 2009, the Dealogic data showed.
CICC, which saw its shares slide 6.5% on Wednesday, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Shanghai stock exchange decided Tuesday to suspend the deal just days before its debut after regulators stepped in, prompting Ant to halt the Hong Kong portion of the listing as well. 
Equity capital market bankers, who have had a good year including a record third-quarter, were expecting Ant to close out 2020 with a bang. But with the listing suspended, Ant's army of investment bankers, including those from Wall Street firms, will have to forgo fees as well as bragging rights for having worked on the world's largest IPO.
""If the deal gets indefinitely delayed, the lead banks will likely only get some of their legal costs back. It all depends on what was agreed at the outset,"" said capital markets consultant and former investment banker Philippe Espinasse.
The 24-strong banking syndicate which underwrote the Hong Kong leg of the deal were due to be paid up to $198 million, the company's prospectus showed.
""There are no proceeds to be paid from,"" said one Hong Kong banker not working on the IPO. ""You do it for the pleasure of working for the king,"" he said in reference to Ant founder and billionaire Jack Ma.
The banker was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.
The missed opportunity represents a double whammy for CICC and the other main underwriters on the deal as they had been discouraged from working on assignments for Ant competitors during the process.

237,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 04:18AM ET</span>",Two Bad Election Scenarios Come Back to Haunt Global Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- Heading into the U.S. election, two potential outcomes were giving investors heartburn: A contested election, or a Joe Biden presidency with a Republican Senate.
Now, both look more likely than 24 hours ago.
President Donald Trump falsely called himself the victor and said he would ask the Supreme Court to intervene as results look to close to call in many battleground states. U.S. stock futures swung between gains and losses, Treasuries jumped and cross-asset volatility rose on renewed fears over protracted post-election wrangling.
“The key inflection point for markets will be whether the government -- be it Biden- or Trump-led -- is divided,” said Peter McCallum, rates strategist at Mizuho International Plc in London. “As things stand, this is the most likely outcome, hence stocks being a little lower and the Treasury curve bull flattening.”
The Senate, which had been seen by many transferring to Democratic leadership, broke toward Republicans throughout the night, while the House of Representatives is going to remain in Democratic hands.
The main worry around divided government: Markets have been hoping for a large fiscal stimulus package that will be less likely if the two parties need to work together.
“With Republicans still in charge in the Senate, we’d be surprised to see a stimulus bill early next year much in excess of $500 billion, far less than the $2 trillion we expected if Democrats had won,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics in New York.
“A Democrat president with a Republican senate would likely be forced into a fiscal contraction which is not spectacularly helpful for growth,” said Sebastien Galy, a macro strategist at Nordea Investment Funds SA, which oversees the equivalent of $255 billion in assets. “A contested election will mean probabilities adjusting for weeks on end possibility.”
The even bigger worry for money managers -- lack of a resolution for weeks -- also doesn’t look far-fetched in the current scenario. Investors had been making bets recently on volatility declining soon after the election.
“The results are close enough to be challenged or contested,” said Elsa Lignos, global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “The fear of a contested outcome has not really materialized in risk-off yet, but it does unfortunately seem more likely in the day ahead.”
With no “blue wave” for Democrats on Tuesday night, volatility will likely remain elevated.
“The odds have increased that the election comes down to one state now (particularly after Arizona was called for Biden by FOX), which means a still-heightened chance of litigious outcome,” said strategist Charlie McElligott of Nomura Securities International Inc.
McCallum advises buckling up for continued drama.
“We would marginally favor going long risk assets here and fading the Treasury bull flattening,” McCallum said, “But clearly this will be volatile.”
Still, stock bulls can find plenty of ammo in this scenario, according to Kelvin Tay, the Asia Pacific chief investment officer for UBS Group AG’s wealth-management unit. He reasoned that legislative gridlock in Washington would prevent significant changes to the tax code and support corporate earnings growth.
“I would remain positive on equities because of interest rates at these levels, negative real yields and because the economy is recovering,” he said. “Equities are the right asset class to be in.”

238,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 03:39AM ET</span>",European Stocks Lower as Hope for Clear Election Result Fades,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Wednesday, as investors worried that a tightly fought U.S. presidential election will not result in an immediate clear cut victory, potentially prompting a prolonged legal battle and continued uncertainty.
At 4:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.3%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.2%.
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden are currently locked in a tight race for the White House.
Trump has effectively won Florida, Iowa and Ohio, critical battleground states, yet Biden looks to have claimed Arizona, a state the current president claimed four years ago. Several key states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, are still counting, and that could take some time due to the unprecedented number of mail-in votes.
Yet, despite this uncertainty, Trump has claimed victory and threatened action in the Supreme Court to curtail the vote counts in those important swing states. 
“We will win this, and as far as I’m concerned, we already have won it,” Trump told supporters at an event that - in defiance of tradition - was held at the White House.
Biden's campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon in a statement called Trump's claims ""outrageous, unprecedented, and incorrect."" and "" a naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens.""
“This very close outcome brings back the risk of a contested election or one – like that seen in 2000 – which could be decided by the courts,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. 
In addition, it looks increasingly unlikely that the Democrats will regain control of the Senate, suggesting that Congress will remain split between the two big parties.
This is the result the market didn’t want to see, as it threatens paralysis in Washington, with little hope of the U.S. economy receiving the additional stimulus that the step up in coronavirus cases suggests it needs.
Aside from the U.S. election news, China’s services sector saw a sixth consecutive month of growth in October, as the world’s second largest economy continues to rebound strongly from its coronavirus hit.
This is good news with the  European equivalent figures are due for release later Wednesday. But with the region suffering badly from the second wave of the Covid-19 virus, these strong figures are unlikely to be matched.
In corporate news, BMW (DE:BMWG) stock fell 2.2% despite the German car manufacturer saying its third-quarter profit rose almost 10% thanks to rebounding Chinese demand for luxury cars.
Marks and Spencer (LON:MKS) stock rose 3.2% despite the iconic U.K. retailer reporting its first pretax loss in nearly 100 years, as it said its new partnership with online outlet Ocado (LON:OCDO) has started well.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, with news that U.S. inventories dropped sharply last week, according to industry data, helping to counter worries about uncertainty over the election and rising coronavirus cases.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $37.77 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.5% to $39.91. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,895.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1688.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW's (DE:BMWG) third-quarter profit rose almost 10% thanks to Chinese demand for luxury cars, but the German automaker warned a new wave of coronavirus infections sweeping Europe and the United states posed a ""considerable"" risk to its business.
Sales of luxury cars reached a new record in the quarter, but the cautious outlook sent BMW shares lower on Wednesday. 
""After a more stable phase in the economic environment in the third quarter, the pandemic is now clearly regaining momentum,"" BMW said.
""If the pandemic takes an even more serious course and the global economy experiences a perceptible downturn, the risk exposure could be considerable, particularly on the demand side."" 
BMW shares dropped 3.1% in early trade, underperforming Germany's blue-chip DAX (GDAXI) index. 
Like rival Mercedes (DE:DAIGn), BMW's quarterly pretax profit recovered in the third quarter, rising 9.6% to 2.46 billion euros ($2.87 billion), lifted by an 8.6% increase in deliveries of luxury cars. 
The automotive EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margin rebounded to 6.7%, from minus 10.4% in the second quarter and 6.6% a year earlier.
""BMW beat mostly on earnings quality with auto margin recovering to year ago level,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Philippe Houchois said, pointing to prudent cost management, lower R&D spending and a rebound in demand from China. 
Deliveries of BMW-branded vehicles jumped of 9.8% during the quarter, mainly thanks to a 31% spike in China, which helped offset a 15.7% drop in demand in the United States, where the pandemic has hit sales.
BMW reiterated it expected to achieve an automotive EBIT margin of 0%-3% this year. 
Despite a recovery in demand in some markets, overall deliveries of high-end vehicles as well as group pretax profit are expected to be significantly lower than last year, it said.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 03:25AM ET</span>",U.S. banks see several allies returned to key congressional seats,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Many Wall Street banks' favorite lawmakers were returned to Congress overnight, boding well for the industry which has been trying to rebuild a broad base of bipartisan support a decade after the financial crisis tarnished its image in Washington.
While the outcome of the presidential election and many Congressional races remained unclear early Wednesday, the composition of key banking committees in the House of Representatives and Senate should remain largely intact, ensuring some continuity for the industry next Congress.
These committees take the lead on financial services legislation, oversee the country's top financial regulators, and can conduct investigations into the industry. Their members range from industry allies to fierce, outspoken adversaries. 
All members of the Democrat-led House Financial Services Committee were up for re-election. Committee chair Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT) easily won, as did Rep. Patrick McHenry, who is expected to resume his role as the top Republican on the panel. 
Though often a bank critic, Waters is seen by the industry as a pragmatist who is willing to work across the aisle. 
Other members of the House panel who were returned to their Congressional seats with the help of industry backing include Republicans Andy Barr, French Hill, Ted Budd and moderate New Jersey Democrat Josh Gottheimer.
Which party will control the Senate remained unclear early Wednesday, but Republicans had succeeded in fending off Democratic challengers in several close competitions. If Republicans retain control of the Senate, leadership of the influential banking panel could fall to Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey, a major proponent of free markets.
Four Democrats and six Republicans on the panel were up for re-relection, four of whom ran tough races. Thom Tillis, an industry ally and the top recipient of banking industry cash among Senate Republicans held a slight lead in a race too close to call in the early hours of Wednesday, as did Senator David Perdue, another Republican bank ally.
Democratic Senator Mark Warner, a senior moderate who backed legislation easing small bank rules in 2018, won his race. 
REBUILDING THE CENTER
The banking industry has tried over the past two years to rebuild the bipartisan support it enjoyed in Congress before the 2008 bailout turned many Democrats against it. That strategy has involved backing moderates in both parties. 
The American Bankers Association (ABA), the country's largest bank group, for example, began running independent ads supporting lawmakers for the first time during the 2018 mid-terms, and backed 14 candidates during the 2020 campaign. 
They included Gottheimer, Hill, Tillis, Budd and Barr, as well as Republican Senator Cory Gardner, who has backed an industry campaign to make it possible for banks to service cannabis-related companies in states where the drug is legal. Gardner lost his reelection bid in Colorado to Democrat John Hickenlooper. 
The ABA also ran ads backing Rep. Greg Stanton, an Arizona Democrat seen by Washington insiders as another business-friendly lawmaker. Stanton also received an endorsement from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation's largest business lobby. Stanton won his race. 
""In this election year, we continued to expand our political engagement on behalf of candidates in both parties who understand and appreciate the critical role banks of all sizes play in the economy and in their communities,"" said Rob Engstrom, the group's chief political strategist. 
Industry campaign donations have also grown more bipartisan, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. 
In the 2020 election cycle, campaign contributions from commercial banks and their workers to Republicans and Democrats running in congressional races are split nearly evenly, at $14 million and $13.6 million respectively. 
That is a significant shift from four years ago, when Republicans pulled in $18.9 million from the industry, nearly twice as much as Democrats.

Treasury, the world's largest listed winemaker, said in a filing it had been notified that the China Alcoholic Drinks Association (CADA) wrote to China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) requesting tariffs on Australian wine as part of a previously announced anti-dumping probe.
The request reflects a deepening trade stand-off between the countries which began a free trade agreement in 2015 but have since seen the relationship cool as Australia joined a global call for an investigation into the origins of the new coronavirus.
In the filing Treasury said it ""will continue to engage proactively with its customers in China to both assess the impact of this request on future import orders and support them in any new process requirements.""
Treasury said it didn't know which products for which CADA proposed tariffs, whether the ministry would apply them retrospectively, nor what the financial impact could be. The company makes most of its profit from Asia, where China is one of its main markets.
Amid the souring of relations, this week the South China Morning Post said China was expected to block imports of sugar, red wine, lobster, barley, coal and copper ore and concentrates from Australia. China said reduced imports of Australian products were the result of buyers' decisions.
Australian trade minister Simon Birmingham invoked the 2015 free trade agreement on Wednesday, telling local radio Australian exporters did not engage in dumping - exporting below cost to take market share - and that there was ""no reason why our exporters should see any disruption"".
""What I would urge Chinese authorities to do is to make it very clear that the commitments they've given to Australia under the China Australia Free Trade Agreement ... will be honoured,"" he said.
CADA, the Chinese industry body, was not immediately available for comment.

(Reuters) - Foreign investors turned net buyers of Indian equities as slowing COVID-19 cases boosted hopes of a faster economic recovery from pandemic lows, while other Asian equities faced outflows on caution ahead of the U.S. presidential election.
According to stock exchange data, Indian shares witnessed inflows worth $2.66 billion in October, after seeing an outflow of about $1 billion in the previous month.
On the other hand, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietamese equities faced a combined outflow of $2.3 billion, the data showed.

Thai equities, which have shed 22.7% this year to mark the biggest fall among major world stock indexes, witnessed an outflow of $700 million in October on concerns over the ongoing anti-government protests.

""That said, there exists risks given potentially prolonged indetermination of the results due to early voting and also a possibility of contest of the results.""
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if the vote count indicates he has lost to Democratic challenger Joe Biden.

245,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 04, 2020 02:00AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Lower as Trump Takes Election to the Wire,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Wednesday, giving back some of Tuesday’s sharp gains as investors fret that a tightly fought U.S. presidential election will not see an immediate clear cut victory, prolonging the uncertainty potentially for some time to come.
At 3 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.8% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.3%. 
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden are currently locked in a tight race for the White House, overturning earlier hopes for a unambiguous decision, and raising the likelihood that the final verdict won’t be known for several days.
Trump has won Florida, Iowa and Ohio, critical battleground states, yet Biden looks to have claimed Arizona, a state the current president claimed four years ago. Several key states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, are still counting, and that could take some time due to the unprecedented number of mail-in votes.
The major European cash indices closed markedly higher Tuesday, with the DAX gaining 2.6%, the CAC 40 2.4% and the FTSE 100 2.3%. These gains were largely down to investor optimism that, with Biden holding a clear lead in the national polls, the Democrats could take control not only of the White House but also the Senate. This would likely result in a substantial coronavirus relief package being passed.
However, “the likelihood for the Senate flipping to the Democrats has seriously decreased,” said Nordea analyst Andreas Steno Larsen, in a live blog. “It is still possible, but the main guess currently is that we will have a continued Republican majority. The probability for a BIG stimulus package is thereby reduced markedly.”
Aside from the U.S. election news, China’s services sector saw a sixth consecutive month of growth in October, as the world’s second largest economy continues to rebound strongly from its coronavirus hit.
The Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index rose to 56.8 in October, higher than the previous month’s 54.8 reading and above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. 
This is good news with the European equivalent figures are due for release later Wednesday. But with the region suffering badly from the second wave of the Covid-19 virus, these strong figures are unlikely to be matched.
In corporate news, BMW (DE:BMWG) said its third-quarter profit rose almost 10% thanks to rebounding Chinese demand for luxury cars and reiterated its outlook despite the new lockdowns in Europe.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday after U.S. inventories dropped sharply last week, according to industry data, helping counter worries about lockdowns given rising coronavirus cases and rising supply from Libya.
U.S. crude stockpiles fell steeply by 8 million barrels for the week ending October 30, according to the latest American Petroleum Institute data, released late Tuesday. This compares with the small 600,000-barrel build expected.
U.S. crude futures traded 2.4% higher at $38.58 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.3% to $40.22, climbing back above the $40 level. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,897.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.6% lower at 1.1641.

(Reuters) - U.S. stock futures jumped early on Wednesday as President Donald Trump led Democratic rival Joe Biden in Florida and other competitive swing states that will help decide the election.
S&P emini futures  were last up 0.9%, extending a rally in Tuesday's trading session, when the S&P 500 delivered its strongest one-day gain in almost a month.
Nasdaq 100 emini futures  jumped 2.6%, with some investors pointing to a lower threat of antitrust scrutiny for major technology companies under Trump than under a Biden presidency.
Graphic - ""Biden"" shares vs ""Trump"" shares: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxabbovx/biden%20vs%20trump%20shares.PNG
Trump led Biden in Florida, while other competitive swing states that will help decide the election outcome, such as Georgia and North Carolina, remained up in the air. 
Longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields retreated from five-month highs and Mexico's peso weakened sharply.
On betting website Smarkets, odds reflected a 56% chance of Trump winning, up significantly from 33% earlier in the day.
""Trump is just doing better on the margin everywhere, and there have not been any big Biden upsets,"" said Bob Shea, Chief Executive Officer at TrimTabs Asset Management in New York. 
""What we are seeing now is Trump doing better and people are just defaulting to 'Trump is good for the market', so why not just buy now and cut to the chase.""
Investors for months have said they favor a definitive, fast resolution to the election, rather than a drawn out process that many have feared. Quickly settling the election would clear the way for a deal on a stimulus package to help the damaged U.S. economy.
Early results also suggested the Democrats were less likely than previously expected to take the Senate from Republicans in a so-called blue wave, which could mean a more modest stimulus deal.
""The blue wave outcome that the markets were looking for has essentially gotten marked down from being a 90% possibility to a less-than-40% probability,"" said Tom di Galoma, a managing director at Seaport Global Holdings in New York.
On election night 2016, U.S. stock index futures plunged as Trump pulled off an upset victory against Democrat Hillary Clinton. However, the next day marked the start of the so-called ""Trump rally"" that saw the S&P 500 jump 5% in a month, fueled by promises of massive tax cuts and financial deregulation.
The S&P 500 has climbed about 57% since Trump's election in 2016, with the information technology index (SPLRCT) surging 149% and energy (SPNY) tumbling 56%, according to Datastream.

In Tuesday's trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 2.06%, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 1.78% and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) climbed 1.85%.

LONDON (Reuters) - A group representing European and U.S. investors with a collective $30 trillion in assets urged the United States to quickly rejoin a global accord to tackle climate change on Wednesday, as a decision by President Donald Trump to leave the pact came into effect.
The group, whose members include big investors such as New York-based BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, warned that the United States risked falling behind in the race to create a cleaner global economy by leaving the 2015 Paris Agreement.
""Recommitting to the Paris Agreement would provide an important policy signal, helping unlock additional flows of investor capital to support sustainable growth and job creation across key sectors of the U.S. economy,"" Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, said in an email to Reuters.
The coalition of European and some U.S. funds joined other investor groups in Asia, Australia and New Zealand in issuing a joint statement calling for a U.S. return to the Paris pact.
The statement was timed for release on Wednesday morning, after U.S. election polls were due to be closed, indicating how the withdrawal from the Paris deal remains a contested issue.
BlackRock did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said in the run-up to Tuesday's U.S. presidential election that he would take the country back into the Paris accord. 
Trump campaigned at the last election on a promise to leave, saying the deal would hit the U.S. economy. He was bound by U.N. rules to wait until Nov. 4, 2019, to begin a year-long process required for a country to exit. No other country has left.
Mindy Lubber, chief executive of sustainability advocacy group Ceres, which also signed the statement, said withdrawing from Paris was a ""monumental mistake,"" but pointed to climate pledges by U.S. states and companies as signs of progress.

""There's a reason investors are standing up and saying let's get back into the Paris Agreement because they believe it's good for the economy as well as good for the environment and our future,"" Lubber told Reuters.

Like other automakers, Subaru, which sells two-thirds of its cars in the United States, had to shutter vehicle factories earlier in the year as the coronavirus spread. Customers also stayed away from dealerships leading to a drop in production and sales.
The improved profit outlook by Japan's No. 7 automaker compared with a previous prediction of 80 billion yen. It is 48% less than it posted in the year that ended March 31 and also less than an average estimate for a 114 billion yen annual profit compiled from 19 analysts polled by Refinitiv.
The maker of Outback and Forester sport-utility vehicle crossovers said last month it doesn't expect the U.S. market to rebound to the 17 million vehicle level it had been at before the pandemic for two to three years. 
In the three months to Sept. 30 Subaru posted an operating profit of 46.3 billion yen compared with a 2.6 billion yen profit a year ago.

BRIAN BETHUNE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ALPHA ECONOMIC FORESIGHTS LLC, BOSTON
""It's still early. It's a little tighter than most people had expected. As the map fills out, you could easily see swings of 10-20 basis points on the U.S. Treasury 10-year note. 
""If the Republicans control the Senate they won't be as much interested in a big stimulus. Markets actually prefer gridlock. It keeps things from being tilted one way or the other, whether it's on spending or taxes. This is the issue: markets would rather have a predictable environment in terms of taxes and trade, as opposed to not knowing what tariffs will hit them in the next six months. So one 'predictable' path would be a continuation of the current regime, or for the Senate to see a lot of Democratic gains but a Trump White House.""
MAX GOKHMAN, HEAD OF ASSET ALLOCATION, PACIFIC LIFE FUND ADVISORS, NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA 
""It is very important not to extrapolate too much from these first numbers. While Biden may lose Florida, he may win Texas where the polls just closed. And that would carry more electoral college votes and be a much bigger upset. This will be a wild night at best and maybe a wild 48 hours. 
""The market impact will be pretty volatile. The irony is that because some investors, including us, moved to more neutral positions, any moves can be amplified and make conditions that much more volatile. The question is will it come down to Pennsylvania and Ohio. I will be up for hours and think that sleep is something I'll be getting on Thursday.""
MATT SHERWOOD, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, PERPETUAL, SYDNEY
""At the moment there are no firm conclusions to make other than it looks like Trump's won Florida, and so therefore, that opens up a path to victory for him and it all comes down to the Midwest.
""It's a wait-and-see. I wouldn't be flipping portfolios or making asset allocation decisions based on partial state results yet. You're just going to have to sit back and wait for the result to actually reveal itself.
""I think the odds of a clean sweep are diminishing, almost by the minute. That reduces the possibility, or the likelihood at least of a large stimulus program being agreed to in the first days of a Biden administration.""
LEI WANG, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, THORNBURG INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
""The election outcome – or lack thereof – will not prompt any major changes to our holdings across sectors or geographies.
""In fact, an unknown outcome or a contested election scenario would likely add a risk premium in the short term, triggering risk-off behaviours and elevated volatility. But once the dust settles...the market will go back to focusing on the long-term implications of the winner's policies, many of which we have been able to contemplate and price in throughout the campaign.""
TONY ROTH, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, WILMINGTON TRUST INVESTMENT, PENNSYLVANIA
""Unless Biden can hold onto Ohio tonight or potentially North Carolina, which looks like a very dim prospect right now, given the rate at which the president seems to be catching up, it appears that we're not going to know the election outcome for some time, which is going to be tough for the market to digest...We thought coming in that Biden had a very strong chance of winning this, but I think those chances are coming down.""
TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, INVERNESS COUNSEL, NEW YORK
""Once again, it seems like the pollsters got it wrong. The states that are expected to be in play are still in play. If it's a Trump administration, it's going to be the same, maybe accentuated, because he has nothing to fear. The cold war with China will be worse. The lack of support for states and local governments will be worse. The support for the stimulus will be watered down. It will not be very supportive of the broader population. 
""If it's Trump, you are not going to see a big package. There is a risk with the virus becoming more widespread, and that's not good for the economy. Regardless of who is elected, we will still have a vaccine. Big tech will probably rally if Trump is re-elected because of a lack of regulation and effort to break them up.""
DAVID R. KOTOK, CHAIRMAN AND CIO, CUMBERLAND ADVISORS, FLORIDA
""The market wanted a decisive blue wave and to do that it needed Florida early. Markets were discounting the big blue wave so futures have turned red. 
""In the selloff last week we raised our allocations (to U.S. stocks) We took advantage of the selloff and it looked to us that the selloff reached extremes in sentiment...and so far that has been a good trade.
""I’m a believer that when you remove uncertainty in a political race like this, the removal of the uncertainty means that markets go up and I believe we have had a very high uncertainty premium which reflected in extreme last week. 
""My biggest worry is violent reaction in the country and the stretching out of the decision. We went through one of those 20 years ago. Part of the mindset of people is that market agents were prepped for that. What they are not prepped for is civil unrest that becomes decisively violent. That is my biggest fear."" 
YUICHI MURAO, SENIOR INVESTMENT OFFICER, NOMURA ASSET MANAGEMENT, TOKYO
""The markets appear to have priced in a Biden victory to some extent, which is why we saw environment stocks outperform and energy stocks and tech stocks fare relatively weak. The market was worried about corporate tax hikes.
""In the case of a Trump victory, there will be policy continuity, which means not much negative impact on corporate earnings but smaller fiscal stimulus than what a Biden government would likely deliver.
THOMAS HAYES, CHAIRMAN, GREAT HILL CAPITAL, NEW YORK 
""I think the market came with a strong expectation of a blue wave and now they have to look at a status quo situation. If Trump wins, the corporate rate will remain the same, which is the biggest issue for the stock market where it might lose up to $20 of S&P earnings if tax rates go up. 
""The best case is going to be a gridlock, either for a Biden or Trump presidency. I think the market is repricing its assumptions. If you don’t have a blue wave, you gonna have a smaller stimulus.""
SIMON WESTON, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER ASIAN EQUITY, AXA INVESTMENT MANAGERS, HONG KONG
""Markets went into the election count looking like they were expecting a 'blue wave' or at least a conclusive win for Biden.
""However, counting so far suggests that the results will be much closer than this, with the key state of Florida looking like it will go for Trump. This raises the prospect that we might get a contested election, or at least one where we will not get a result for some time as votes take time to be counted.
""This higher uncertainty has seen a lot of these early trades reverse – with the dollar appreciating and markets selling off from opening highs ... this caution will likely continue until and unless we get a clearer indication of the outcome.""
JAKE DOLLARHIDE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, LONGBOW ASSET MANAGEMENT, TULSA, OKLAHOMA
""The blue sweep argument is about immediate stimulus, like a sugar high. Trump doing better than investors thought is ultimate chaos. If you expect a blue sweep and all of a sudden Trump looks competitive and looks like he could win, then you throw caution to the wind. If Republicans start winning Senate seats again and you have gridlock, the market could go down. But longer term, you could lead to lower taxes and higher stock prices as the recovery trade continues.
""S&P futures favor a sugar high, a blue sweep is great. The market is thinking shorter-term. The market favors certainty, and Trump appearing to do better than investors thought is uncertainty.""

Here are the latest developments on the 11th-hour scrapping of what was poised to be the world’s biggest IPO, worth $34.5 billion:

252,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 10:35PM ET</span>",China slams the brakes on Ant Group's $37 billion listing,"By Julie Zhu, Meg Shen and Greg Roumeliotis
HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - China suspended Ant Group's $37 billion listing on Tuesday, thwarting the world's largest stock market debut with just days to go in a dramatic blow to the financial technology firm founded by billionaire Jack Ma.
The Shanghai stock exchange said it had suspended the company's initial public offering (IPO) on its tech-focused STAR Market, prompting Ant to also freeze the Hong Kong leg of its dual listing scheduled for Thursday.
This followed a meeting with China's financial regulators on Monday during which Ma and his top executives were told that Ant's lucrative online lending business would face tighter scrutiny, sources told Reuters.
The Shanghai bourse described Ant's meeting with financial regulators as a ""major event"" which, along with a tougher regulatory environment, may cause Ant to be disqualified from listing.
In China, analysts interpreted the move as a slap down for Ma, who had wanted Ant to be treated as technology company rather than a highly regulated financial institution.
""The Communist Party has shown the tycoons who's boss. Jack Ma might be the richest man in the world but that doesn't mean a thing. This has gone from the deal of the century to the shock of the century,"" Francis Lun, CEO of GEO Securities, said.
To revive its listing, Ant is trying to establish if it needs to disclose more information to the Shanghai exchange about its relationship with regulators, or if the bourse expects it to resolve all its issues with the regulators, which would take much longer, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
At an event last month attended by Chinese regulators, Ma said the financial and regulatory system stifled innovation and must be reformed to fuel growth. He also compared the Basel Committee of global banking regulators to ""an old man's club"".
Ant believes the public criticism put Ma in the crosshairs of regulators, the person said.
The suspension reverberated across markets.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding, which owns about a third of Ant, fell 9% in early U.S. trading, wiping nearly $76 billion off its value, more than double the amount Ant was planning to raise.
""This is a curve ball that has been thrown at us ... I don't know what to say,"" said one banker working on the IPO. 
SHARPER SCRUTINY
With its unique business model and the absence of rivals in China or elsewhere, analysts say Ant has mainly thrived as a technology platform away from the banking sector's regulations, despite its array of financial products. 
But Beijing has become uncomfortable with banks increasingly using micro-lenders or third-party technology platforms such as Ant for underwriting loans amid fears of rising defaults and a deterioration in asset quality in a pandemic-hit economy.
Reuters reported last month that regulators had scrutinised banks that used Ant's technology platform excessively for underwriting consumer loans as part of a drive to curb risks in the country's financial sector.
The tougher regulatory focus on Ant's cash cow and rapidly growing consumer lending business had emerged as a key concern for investors in the IPO, despite the company's attractiveness as a financial technology player.
Ant originates demand from retail consumers and small businesses and passes that on to about 100 banks for underwriting, earning fees from the lenders with minimal risk to its own balance sheet. 
Ant's consumer lending balance was 1.7 trillion yuan ($254 billion) at the end of June, or 21% of all short-term consumer loans issued by Chinese deposit-taking financial institutions. Only 2% of the loans it had facilitated were on its balance sheet, its IPO prospectus showed.
""It's the right move to regulate what's essentially a financial institution as their peers. And it's wrong not to do that in the past, and the mistake is being corrected. It will have a negative impact on pricing,"" said Zhong Daqi, founding partner of Guangzhou Zeyuan Investment Management Co.
Under draft rules published on Monday by China's central bank and banking regulator, small online lenders must provide at least 30% of any loan they fund jointly with banks.
A banker in Hong Kong close to other Chinese fintechs said those firms thought the new rules were tailor-made for Ant. The banker said Ant may have to split its businesses and make payments, micro-lending and wealth management separate units.
SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE
Ant was set to go public in Hong Kong and Shanghai on Thursday after raising about $37 billion - including the so-called greenshoe option of the domestic leg - in a record IPO that had attracted leading global investment firms.
It was also a sensational draw for mom-and-pop investors in China and Hong Kong who bid a record $3 trillion, equivalent to the annual economic output of Britain, while for the Hong Kong leg retail investors borrowed heavily from banks to buy shares.
An official at a Chinese state-backed investment firm, which is also an existing investor in Ant, wondered whether it would be ""politically correct"" to make fresh investments in the company given its regulatory run-in.
Starting as a payments processor in 2004, Ant quickly built an empire by offering users short-term loans credited within minutes, as well as selling insurance and investment products. 
China's state-backed Economic Daily newspaper said in a commentary that the IPO suspension showed regulators' determination to protect the interests of investors and the most pressing matter was for Ant to carry out ""rectifications"".
""Ant may be just falling victim to their own size and success,"" said Alex Sirakov, senior associate at advisory firm Kapronasia.
Ant apologized to investors for any inconvenience, adding it would give further details on the suspension of its Hong Kong listing and applications for refunds as soon as possible. 
""We will properly handle the follow-up matters in accordance with applicable regulations of the two stock exchanges.""
Alibaba said it would support Ant to adapt and embrace the evolving regulatory framework. 
CICC and China Securities Co, co-sponsors for Ant's STAR IPO, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
U.S. banks JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) declined to comment, while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The three Western banks are co-sponsors of Ant's Hong Kong IPO along with CICC.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning, giving up some ground. Investors are on tenterhooks as votes are counted in the U.S. presidential election with no clear winner yet.
Currently, Democrat candidate Joe Biden has 131 electoral votes, while incumbent President Donald Trump has 98 votes, according to Bloomberg.
There were wide expectations that Biden would lead a Democrat sweep in the White House, Senate and House of Representatives, reducing political risk and increasing the possibility of big stimulus packages to help the COVID-19-hit economy compared to a Trump re-election. However, these expectations were shaken with a closer race than expected and it could be several days before the result is announced. Trump won Indiana’s electoral votes, the first state to be decided.
Investors are now hedging against the risk of a contested election as mail-in ballots are being counted.
""In typical election risk-driven fashion it's been the stairs up and express elevator down as early results, especially out of Florida, are pointing away from the quick Biden outcome markets were looking for … markets have taken a step back from the Democratic sweep scenario,""Axi chief global markets Stephen Innes told Reuters.
Other investors agreed with Innes.
“The race is closer than the market thought. Reflation is one thing, but a close result, and we are far from the end, is a market negative,” Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce strategist Patrick Bennett told Bloomberg.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.35% by 11:11 PM ET (3:11 AM GMT), returning from a public holiday.
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.77%
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.22%, reversing earlier gains, despite the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announcing a monetary policy on Tuesday including an interest rate cut to 0.10% from 0.25% and the purchase of AUD100 billion ($71.10 billion) worth of government bonds by the RBA board.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.40%, recovering from the shock of Ant Group Co. halting both the Shanghai and Hong Kong legs of a planned $35 billion dual listing on Tuesday, after a meeting with Chinese regulators.
China’s Shanghai Composite rose 0.41%, while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.25%. October's Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 56.8, according to data released earlier in the day. The reading is up from September's 54.8 figure.
Investors also await monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, due on Thursday. Both policies are widely expected to at least give a nod to further stimulus measures to aid their economies."

(Reuters) - Missouri's highest court on Tuesday refused to consider Johnson & Johnson's (N:JNJ) appeal of a $2.12 billion damages award to women who blamed their ovarian cancer on asbestos in its baby powder and other talc products.
The Missouri Supreme Court let stand a June 23 decision by a state appeals court, which upheld a jury's July 2018 finding of liability but reduced J&J's payout from $4.69 billion after dismissing claims by some of the 22 plaintiffs.
Johnson & Johnson said it plans to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
It said the verdict was the product of a ""fundamentally flawed trial, grounded in a faulty presentation of the facts,"" and was ""at odds with decades of independent scientific evaluations confirming Johnson's Baby Powder is safe, does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer.""
The New Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey-based company also said it will set aside a $2.1 billion reserve for the verdict, to be reflected in its year-end financial results. 
Kevin Parker, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a statement: ""Johnson & Johnson should accept the findings of the jury and the appellate court and move forward with proper compensation to the victims.""
Johnson & Johnson said in May it would stop selling its Baby Powder talc in the United States and Canada.
The company said last month it faces more than 21,800 lawsuits claiming that its talc products cause cancer because of contamination from asbestos, a known carcinogen.
In its June decision, the Missouri Court of Appeals said it was reasonable to infer from the evidence that Johnson & Johnson ""disregarded the safety of consumers"" in its drive for profit, despite knowing its talc products caused ovarian cancer. It also found ""significant reprehensibility"" in the company's conduct.
Johnson & Johnson has faced intense scrutiny of its baby powder's safety following a 2018 Reuters investigative report that found it knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc. 
Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos. (https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/)

Johnson & Johnson shares closed down 19 cents at $138.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.

256,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump administration shelves bid to blacklist China's Ant Group - sources,"By Humeyra Pamuk, Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has put on hold an effort to blacklist   Ant Group  Co Ltd  (HK:6688) (SS:688688), the Chinese financial technology company affiliated with e-commerce giant  Alibaba , following a phone call between a company executive and a top U.S. government official, four people familiar with the matter said. 
Reuters reported last month that the U.S. State Department had submitted a proposal to add Ant Group to a trade blacklist in order to deter U.S. investors from taking part in its initial public offering, which was expected to rake in a record $37 billion before being postponed on Tuesday. 
But the Commerce Department, which oversees the blacklist, shelved the proposal after Alibaba Group Holding Inc (HK:9988) President Michael Evans urged Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to reject the bid in a phone call, the people said, declining to be named because they were not authorized to speak on the matter. 
Three of the people said fears of antagonizing Wall Street ahead of Tuesday's presidential elections and the possibility of a lawsuit helped convince Ross to set the plan aside. 
""It could spur legal action or cause a chill in markets,"" one of the sources said. 
In contrast, the fourth person said Ross was taking into account the fact that Alibaba's (N:BABA) platform Taobao is already on the United States Trade Representative's notorious markets list due to concerns it includes some counterfeit goods. That means it already faces U.S. government scrutiny, the person said, stressing that Ross's decision was neither due to the phone call nor market, election or legal concerns. 
Ant and the State Department declined to comment. Ross and Evans could not be reached for comment. 
Ant is China's dominant mobile payments company, offering loans, payments, insurance and asset management services via mobile apps. It is 33% owned by Alibaba and controlled by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.
Inclusion on the trade blacklist, known as the entity list, forces a company's U.S. suppliers to seek special licenses before selling to it. It does not, however, prevent U.S. investors from buying its shares, and its impact on a fintech giant like Ant would have likely been largely symbolic. 
While Ant's Alipay payment app is currently unavailable for American users, according to a company spokesperson, China hawks in the Trump administration fear it could access sensitive banking data belonging to future U.S. users.
Donald Trump's administration has recently shown some reluctance to flex its muscle against Beijing before Tuesday's election, in which polls show the Republican incumbent trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden by double digits nationally. 
In September, Commerce softened a bid by the Defense Department to add China's top chipmaker SMIC to the entity list, instead instructing the company's U.S. suppliers to seek licenses before shipping it certain high tech items. 
With the spread of the coronavirus, which originated in China last year, and Beijing's crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong, Trump had stepped up actions against Chinese companies like Bytedance, which owns social media app Tiktok, earlier this year. 
But a move by the Trump administration to ban certain U.S. transactions with the Chinese owners of messaging app WeChat and TikTok has been held up in court. 
Investors had largely shrugged off concerns over Ant Group, bidding for a record $3 trillion for its shares before China suspended the Ant Group's stock market listing, in a dramatic move that left investors and bankers scrambling for answers. 

The Hong Kong leg of the IPO was being sponsored by China International Capital Corp,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is working as a joint global coordinator. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is also involved.

257,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 07:45PM ET</span>","As Japan moves to revive its countryside, pandemic chases many from cities","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - When the coronavirus outbreak caused rice and instant noodles to disappear from supermarket shelves in Tokyo this year, Kaoru Okada, 36, decided to leave the capital because he was worried about food security.
Okada settled in the central Japanese city of Saku, Nagano prefecture, about 160 kilometres (100 miles) northwest of Tokyo, maintaining his online retail and export business while growing vegetables in shared farms and threshing rice.
""I moved out of Tokyo in June as soon as the domestic travel ban was lifted, thinking now is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,"" Okada told Reuters. ""Living close to a food-producing centre and connections with farmers give me a sense of security.""
As the pandemic has pushed many companies to allow telecommuting, it has also caused population to flow out of Tokyo - the first time that has happened in years, the latest government data showed.
The shift could boost Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who made revitalising Japan's decaying rural regions a core plank of his socioeconomic platform.
In September, 30,644 people moved out of Tokyo, up 12.5% year-on-year, while the number moving in fell 11.7% to 27,006, the data showed.
It was the third straight month the those moving out outnumbered those moving in, the longest run on record, led by people in their 20s and 30s.
Mizuto Yamamoto, 31, now uses telecommuting to skip Tokyo's jam-packed morning trains.
An employee at staffing firm Caster Co, he moved about 150 km (93 miles) west of Tokyo to Hokuto in the mountainous Yamanashi prefecture last year with his wife and 2-year-old son.
""It was good to move to quiet areas like Hokuto surrounded by rivers, the Southern Alps and Mt. Fuji,"" Yamamoto told Reuters. ""There's no crowd of people, which reduces the virus risks.""
NOT CLINGING TO TOKYO
Premier Suga, from rural Akita prefecture in the north, made the revitalisation of Japan's countryside one of his key goals.
Despite a lack of jobs and infrastructure to support them, local governments and businesses have been trying for years – largely in vain - to draw more people to rural areas.
Hidetoshi Yuzawa, an official in Iida, Nagano Prefecture, said Nagano is among the most popular places to migrate because of how much support, including mentors, it offers newcomers. 
With help from Iida, Mio Nanjo, a 41-year-old pastry chef, is renovating a traditional house into a cafe, which she plans to open in the town of Matsukawa next spring.
A single mother of three, Nanjo moved from an area southwest of Tokyo this summer after the pandemic shut down the confectionery where she was working and her son lost his job at a truck maker.
""The move allowed me to start all over again,"" Nanjo told Reuters. ""There's no point of clinging to Tokyo, where there are crowds and many people commit suicide.""
Jobs are also leaving the city. 
A major staffing firm, Pasona Group Inc, said in September it would move its headquarters and 1,200 employees to Awaji island off Kobe, western Japan, the home of 68-year-old chief executive Yasuyuki Nambu.
The lockdowns this spring were a decisive factor, Nambu said, adding that the trend would continue as companies and employees changed their mindsets about work-life balance.
""Regional society is stress-free, and you can live a life rich in delicious foods and activities such as fishing and farming,"" Nambu told Reuters.
Other firms, such as Caster, have already based their business model on telecommuting, making it easy to hire workers by offering jobs wherever they are, said Shota Nakagawa, 34, CEO of the company in the southern Japanese city of Saito.
""Workers can avoid commuting on rush-hour trains and companies can spare transportation costs and reduce office space, all of which will improve profits,"" Nakagawa said.
But in Saku, Okada, the online business owner, has no intention of living there forever - although that doesn't mean he'll move back to Tokyo.

""As long as I can work anywhere, I will keep hopping to find a place best suited to my life at the time,"" he said.

258,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 06:18PM ET</span>",U.S. Stock Futures Edge Higher With Election Results on Tap,"(Bloomberg) -- Calm prevailed in U.S. equity futures after the biggest two-day rally since September, as investors await the outcome of the U.S. presidential election that could reshape the American economy.
December contracts on the S&P 500 rose 0.2% as of 6:07 p.m. in New York. The cash index jumped 3% in the past two days as investors speculated Congress will deliver a spending bill once the election is decided. Polls in the earliest battleground state close at 7 p.m. New York time, while Florida and Pennsylvania accept votes until 8 p.m. Final voter polls taken before voting began Tuesday showed Democrat Joe Biden with a lead nationally over Republican Donald Trump.
Markets have been volatile during the final weeks of the campaign as investors fretted over the potential for a contested outcome, a surge in coronavirus cases and stretched valuations that make megacap tech shares look expensive as the economic rebound starts to slow. The S&P 500 has moved at least 1% six of the past seven sessions. Biden’s solid lead has some investors speculating there’ll be a relatively quick decision on who will prevail, removing a major level of uncertainty.
“Most real investors are sitting on their hands waiting to see what happens with the election,” said Matt Maley, Miller Tabak + Co.’s chief market strategist. “As long as we can get a relatively quick decision on who wins, the market will get a year-end rally.”
A surge in mail-in ballots and early voting has made it more likely that some states won’t be able to declare a winner on Tuesday, exposing markets to a drawn out process for determining the next president.
Adding to anxiety is that markets haven’t always been prescient in knowing what outcome they’d prefer. In 2016, Trump’s perceived recklessness was considered bad news for a stock market that detests uncertainty. Futures plunged the maximum 5% as he took the lead late on Nov. 8, 2016. By morning, as investors warmed to his pledges of cutting taxes and slashing regulations, futures had rebounded higher. The S&P 500 has rallied 56% since his surprise win.
Investors have come around on Biden as his lead solidified, banking on his promise to broker a massive aid package to jumpstart the economy hit by the pandemic. Assets seen benefiting most from a Biden administration have climbed alongside his polling lead. The Invesco Solar ETF, ticker TAN, has surged over 140% in the past six months, buoyed by optimism that Biden would boost infrastructure and green-energy spending.
Hopes of a multi-trillion fiscal aid package has boosted benchmark Treasury yields to the highest level since June, dragging beaten-down shares of financial companies higher as well. Meanwhile, the Nomura-Wolfe Biden Election Basket -- a group of stocks that wagers on potential winners from a Democratic victory while betting against shares seen as losers -- climbed to a record on Monday. The basket holds 30 pair trades across sectors including technology, health care, utilities and others.
But not all outcomes under Biden are considered market-friendly. He also has pledged to roll back the huge tax cuts that Trump handed corporate America back in 2017, a move that, irrespective of the public-policy merits it may have, at least has the potential to create stress for equities. Democrats have also promised tighter financial regulation and will look at how megacap tech companies operate.
Another possibility is that a Biden win is not accompanied by Democrats taking over control of the senate, leaving Congress divided. That could temper expectations for a spending bill and threaten to stall much of Biden’s platform.
The S&P 500 retreated in both September and October after a torrid summer rally. It closed Tuesday about 6% below its all-time high.
While trades reflecting a Democratic sweep held firm, betting markets aren’t convinced. One gauge slipped to just over 50% odds of the so-called Blue Wave -- that Democrats oust President Donald Trump and take Congressional majorities. Traders hedged prospects of post-vote volatility, driving a measure of expected swings in China’s yuan to its highest level in more than nine years.
“The closer the race is, the bigger the risk is,” said Erika Karp, founder and CEO of Cornerstone Capital Group. “A close outcome is a risk to the market. The longer it drags out, the bigger the risks.”

259,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 05:20PM ET</span>",Investors bet U.S. stock swings will calm down after Election Day,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors were pulling back on expectations for big swings in U.S. stocks on Tuesday, looking for market uncertainty to recede after Election Day.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" declined as the S&P 500 (SPX) climbed nearly 2% in part on anticipation of a clear presidential election outcome. (N)
At 35.55, the VIX remained well above its long-term average near 20 and was implying more than 2% moves for the S&P 500. Moreover, options on the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (P:SPY), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the benchmark U.S. stock index, were pricing in a 3.5% move by the end of the week, according to Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.
Some signs show investors expect volatility to fade once the election is in the rear-view mirror. The term structure for VIX futures is inverted, with short-dated contracts trading at higher prices than longer-dated contracts. That signals investor anxiety is most elevated in the near term.
The VIX term structure was partially inverted heading into the 2016 election, wrote Michael Purves, chief executive of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. Following that election, the VIX plummeted, and the term structure soon returned to its typical upward slope, signaling alleviation of near-term market worries.
The term structure may not revert as quickly this time, Purves wrote, given other concerns such as the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Even so, options activity suggests some investors have been positioning for greater calm in U.S. stocks. VIX puts have traded at higher volumes than VIX calls over the past month, a departure from the norm. VIX puts are used to position for declining volatility, whereas VIX calls are used to protect against climbing volatility.
That pattern continued on Tuesday, wrote Murphy, including two large purchases of VIX put spreads that would benefit from the index falling to the 20s, near its levels in August, about a month after the election.

""From a volatility standpoint, the sentiment seems to have shifted,"" said Andrew Thrasher, portfolio manager at the Financial Enhancement Group.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The cruise industry will extend its suspension of U.S. cruise operations through Dec. 31, an industry group that represents 95% of global ocean-going cruise capacity said on Tuesday.
The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) said its members will use the remainder of the year to prepare for the implementation of measures to address COVID-19 safety issues.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday issued a framework for a phased resumption of cruise ship operations after a no-sail order issued in March in response to the coronavirus pandemic was to expire on Saturday. [nL1N2HL29F]
Extending the suspension ""will provide additional time to align the industry’s extensive preparation of health protocols with the implementation requirements under the CDC’s Framework for Conditional Sailing and Initial Phase COVID-19 Testing Requirements for Protection of Crew,"" CLIA said.
The CDC said it was requiring testing and additional safeguards for crew members. A U.S. House of Representatives committee is investigating whether the White House in September blocked the CDC from extending the no-sail order through mid-February. 
The no-sail order came amid a rising number of coronavirus cases on cruise ships. On Tuesday, shares of major cruise lines Carnival Corp (N:CCL), Norwegian Cruise Line (N:NCLH) and  Royal Caribbean  Cruises (N:RCL) closed up modestly.
""Subsequent phases will include simulated voyages to test cruise ship operators' ability to mitigate COVID-19 risk, certification for ships that meet specific requirements and a phased return to cruise ship passenger operations,"" the CDC said.
The industry has committed to ""100% testing for passengers and crew prior to boarding, mask-wearing, physical distancing requirements, highly controlled shore excursions"" and other precautions.
The CDC said through Sept. 28, data showed ""a total of 3,689 confirmed cases of COVID-19 or COVID-like illness cases on cruise ships and 41 deaths.""

The cruise industry generates over $53 billion in annual economic activity and supports 421,000 American jobs spanning almost every sector. CLIA estimates the suspension has resulted in a loss of $25 billion in economic activity and over 164,000 American jobs.

Investing.com – The Dow climbed Tuesday as value stocks racked up gains on hopes that a victory for Vice President Joe Biden will ensure a more generous stimulus package is rolled out to inject power into the economic recovery. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.06%, or 554 points. The S&P 500 was up 1.73%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.85%.
As U.S. voters hit the polls, Biden holds a lead over President Donald Trump across key swing states including Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, according to the New York Times/Siena College poll.
“Should Biden manage to secure one of those three states (especially Florida or North Carolina) then the chances for Donald Trump would fall dramatically,” ING said in a note. “In other words, while there is a high risk of a delay in the result, there is also a material chance that Joe Biden may have virtually secured a win by 03:00 EST (08:00 GMT) if results show he’s clearly ahead in those states.”
In recent months, Wall Street has suggested that a Biden victory would be good for value stocks as the economy will get a boost from a bigger stimulus package, easing the hit from higher taxes and plans to expand public health care coverage.
Biden has suggested raising taxes to 28% from 20%, though that would still below the 32% rate seen before Trump took office.
Others, however, suggest that a blue wave – the Democrats taking control of both the White House and Congress – may prompt the Fed into hiking rates again.
The effect of a blue wave “could bring the first rate hike by the Fed in from 2024 to 2025 to maybe 2023 to 2024,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.
Industrials and consumer discretionary stocks are among the top gainers.
Financials were led higher by banking stocks as Treasury yields climbed on hopes that the passing of election uncertainty could refocus lawmakers' efforts on policies that would ensure the economic recovery remains on track.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) closed 3% higher, while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) was up 2%.
The move higher in banks helped eased weakness in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) after the fintech giant’s better-than-expected results were offset by earnings guidance that disappointed Wall Street.
In other earning news, cash-strapped theater chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) rose 9% despite reporting a wider-than-expected quarterly earnings following a 90% plunge in revenue.
‘We give AMC credit for restlessly seeking ways to improve its net debt position and remain afloat. However, we do not expect attendance levels to begin to normalize until mid-2021, which presents a real risk to the industry, and AMC in particular,” Wedbush said in a note as it lowered its price target on the stock to $2.50 from $4.
Technology also played a role in the broader market move higher as the Fab 5 built on their late-day rebound from Monday.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gained more than 1%."

Value stocks rose Tuesday, as did financials, and Treasury yields climbed on the hopes we can get past the election and lawmakers can refocus on policies to help the economy. 
Gold shot above $1,900 an ounce, rallying for a third day in a row, because we are still concerned results will take forever to come out amid legal challenges and slow vote counting. 
Crude oil prices surged as markets bet on the likelihood of aggressive reflationary policies in the aftermath of Tuesday’s U.S. elections. 
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow, although only the first one probably counts:
1. Trump, Biden or not yet?
The U.S. is picking a new president. We may know the identity of the winner imminently, or it could go to court. Either way, buckle up.
2. Economic data
We'll get a double dose of economic data in the form of the ADP jobs number at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT) and the September trade balance at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). The gauge of private-sector hiring for October is expected to show a gain of 650,000 jobs, down from the 749,000 added in September. The trade deficit is predicted to narrow to $63.8 billion from $67.1 billion.
3. Earnings from chipmaker Qualcomm, others
On the earnings front, the big attraction is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. Fresh off an antitrust court win against the FTC, the chipmaker should benefit from 5G adoption and is expected to post revenue of $5.9 billion. We'll also hear how the pandemic has affected  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc (NYSE:HLT) and get results from insurers Metlife (NYSE:MET) Inc. and Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL).

Investing.com – The Dow climbed Tuesday as value stocks continued their bright start to the week as the U.S. election is finally upon us.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.07%, or 447 points. The S&P 500 was up 1.83%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.80%.
As U.S. voters hit the polls, former Vice President Joe Biden continues to hold a lead over President Donald Trump, by about 2 to 7 percentage points, according to recent surveys.
In swing states, where the election can be won or lost, the race is tighter.
In recent months, Wall Street has suggested that a Biden victory would boost value stocks as the economy will get a boost from a bigger stimulus package, easing the hit from higher taxes and plans to expand public health care coverage.
Biden has suggested upping taxes to 28% from 20%, though that would still below the 32% rate seen before Trump took office.
Others, however, suggest that a blue wave – the Democrats taking control of both the White House and Congress – may prompt the Fed into hiking rates again.
The effect of a blue wave “could bring the first rate hike by the Fed in from 2024 to 2025 to maybe 2023 to 2024,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.
Industrials and consumer discretionary stocks are among the top gainers today.
Financials were led higher by banking stocks as Treasury yields climbed on hopes that the passing of election uncertainty could refocus lawmakers' efforts on policies that would ensure the economic recovery remains on track.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were up more than 3%.
The move higher in banks helped eased weakness in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) after the fintech giant’s better-than-expected results were offset by earnings guidance that disappointed Wall Street.
In other earning news, cash-strapped theater chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) rose 9% despite reporting a wider-than-expected quarterly earnings following a 90% plunge in revenue.
‘We give AMC credit for restlessly seeking ways to improve its net debt position and remain afloat. However, we do not expect attendance levels to begin to normalize until mid-2021, which presents a real risk to the industry, and AMC in particular,” Wedbush said in a note as it lowered its price target on the stock to $2.50 from $4.
Technology also played a role in the broader market move higher as the Fab 5 built on their late-day rebound from Monday.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gained more than 1%."
265,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>","Western Union expects better 2021 after COVID-19 hit, says CFO","By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) -  Western Union  Co (N:WU), the world's largest money transfer firm, expects an improved outlook for 2021 as people adjust to the novel coronavirus and on expectations for additional U.S. government stimulus to help the economy, its chief financial officer said on Tuesday.
Remittance flows, a vital source of external financing for developing countries, have tumbled this year as new migration has slowed and some existing migrant workers return to their home countries after losing jobs.
Western Union, which relies on such transfers for its business, last week reported third-quarter revenue of $1.3 billion compared to a Refinitiv IBES estimate of $1.25 billion and reinstated its 2020 full-year financial outlook with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share in the range of $1.72-$1.77.
""Generally, I would expect a better 2021 than we saw this year,"" Raj Agrawal told Reuters in a video interview. ""At least here in the U.S., we should get some economic stimulus. The election will be behind us, all of these things will help the U.S., which is a big part of our business, and I do think people have learned to live a little bit more with the pandemic and we will see better times next year.""
The World Bank expects remittance flows to fall by 7% to $666 billion in 2020, before a further decline of 7.1% in 2021. The World Bank's estimated contraction for 2020 was less severe than the almost 20% dip it had forecast in April.
While an easing of COVID-19-related lockdowns helped a recovery in Western Union's retail business in the third quarter, the firm has also been boosted by faster-than-expected growth in its digital business, which includes money sent via the internet, mobile or its digital partners.

In the last two quarters, Western Union's digital business had been growing in the 40%-50% range, said Agrawal, adding that digital revenues accounted for around 21% of its total consumer revenue, with the remaining 79% driven by retail.

266,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>",Europe Stocks Rise the Most Since June Ahead of U.S. Vote Result,"(Bloomberg) -- European equities advanced the most in almost five months, with investors looking ahead to the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 2.3% by the close in London, the biggest gain for the benchmark since June 16. Cyclical sectors, such as banks and automakers, led the advance. France’s BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA surged after recording a bigger-than-expected boost from trading. The S&P 500 jumped for a second consecutive day.
Stocks are rebounding after worries about fresh lockdowns across Europe sparked a selloff that dragged the Stoxx 600 to a five-month low last week. Investors are bracing for the results of Tuesday’s electoral contest between U.S. President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, which has been a key source of market uncertainty besides Covid-19 developments.
“Stand ready to react to the U.S. election outcome,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note, predicting a fiscal stimulus agreement shortly afterward, regardless of the outcome. “Along with Covid-19, U.S. policy uncertainty has been a major source of volatility” and the election outcome “should provide greater clarity,” he added.
While trades reflecting a Democratic sweep held firm, betting markets aren’t convinced. One gauge slipped to just over 50% odds of the so-called Blue Wave -- that Democrats oust Trump and take Congressional majorities.
The Stoxx 600 fell more than 8% since an Oct. 12 peak to a low of 341.76 last week, before rebounding. The benchmark is poised for its worst annual drop since the 2008 financial crisis.
Pictet Asset Management cut European stocks to neutral from overweight, citing uncertain near-term prospects for the region as the 750 billion euros ($878 billion) of pandemic recovery funds aren’t expected to kick in until the middle of next year, according to Chief Strategist Luca Paolini.
“The return of lockdowns in Europe has affected investors’ mood as they tend to fear a repeat of the first wave,” said Oddo BHF strategist Sylvain Goyon. “But the latest correction of the market seems overdone as our quantitative analysis shows the reality is much less grim.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Crispin Odey is to step back from running his London-based hedge fund firm as part of an overhaul of the group and instead focus on managing money for clients, the firm said on Tuesday.
Odey, one of Britain's highest-profile hedge fund managers and political donors, recently pleaded not guilty to a charge of indecently assaulting a woman in 1998 and remains on bail, with a trial scheduled for early next year.
As part of the reorganisation, Odey Asset Management (OAM) said it planned to create a new legal entity, Brook Asset Management, and would rename a number of funds under the Brook banner in the coming weeks.
""We have been planning for the next phase of OAM’s development for some time, while always mindful of fostering and maintaining the investment led and performance driven culture, that has driven its success these past three decades,"" said Chief Executive Timothy Pearey.
Crispin Odey would himself run a new fund focused on preserving capital during periods of high inflation, in addition to running his other funds, the company said.
""I am very excited about my new inflation focused Fund, as so few people in the market are thinking this way. This provides great opportunity for investment, which now more than ever demands one’s full attention,"" Odey said.
""The markets will continue to be very testing over the next few months as inflationary factors start to make themselves known.""

Crispin Odey was one of the biggest donors to the successful campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, and donated 10,000 pounds ($12,800) to Boris Johnson during his campaign to become prime minister.

The largest U.S. bank, which earlier this year agreed to pay more than $920 million and admitted to wrongdoing to settle federal U.S. market manipulation probes, said it was in talks with a U.S. regulator to resolve the latest issue. 
Although JPMorgan did not name the regulator, it added that there was no assurance that the current talks would lead to a resolution. 
The bank said it already had measures in place to address the problems with its internal controls.
In September, JPMorgan agreed to pay $436.4 million in fines, $311.7 million in restitution and more than $172 million in disgorgement after probes into its trading of metals futures and Treasury securities.

In October, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), another Wall Street powerhouse, agreed to pay an even larger fine of nearly $3 billion over its role in Malaysia's 1MDB corruption scandal, lifting a cloud that has hung over the bank for years.

269,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 01:15PM ET</span>",Explainer: Ant juggernaut jackknifes on $37 billion road to market,"(Reuters) - With more than 730 million monthly users in China on its Alipay app and a growing role linking lenders and borrowers, Ant Group had appeared unstoppable as it marched towards the world's largest stock market debut this week.
But these plans came to a juddering halt on Tuesday when the Shanghai stock exchange suspended its $37 billion IPO, prompting Ant, which was spun out of billionaire Jack Ma's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group, to freeze the Hong Kong leg too.
WHAT IS ANT?
Ant traces its beginnings to Alipay, which was launched by e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2004 as a payment service that aimed to address Chinese buyers and sellers' concerns about transacting online in the country's then-nascent e-commerce market.
Alipay now handles more transactions yearly than Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V), mostly in China, but Ant's portfolio of services has expanded far beyond the lifestyle and payments app.
Ant's credit businesses originate demand from retail consumers and small businesses and pass that on to banks for underwriting, earning fees from the lenders and putting its own balance sheet at minimum risk. 
Ant's consumer lending balance was 1.7 trillion yuan ($254 billion) at the end of June, or 21% of all short-term consumer loans issued by Chinese deposit-taking financial institutions. But only 2% of the loans it had facilitated were on its balance sheet, its IPO prospectus showed.
Ant also partners with asset managers, including mutual funds, insurers, banks and securities firms in China to originate investments for Alipay users. Its signature product is Yu’e Bao, which lets people put their spare cash in money-market funds. The first Yu’e Bao fund was once the world’s largest money-market fund.
A robo adviser operated by Ant and Vanguard Group helps investors pick which funds to invest in for a small fee. Ant’s InsureTech business, meanwhile, sells a range of insurance products that cover everything from shipping delays to accidents.
WHAT KIND OF ANT, TECH OR FIN?
Ant has used artificial intelligence and other technologies to facilitate not just payments and loans, but products from insurance to wealth management, making it chiefly a technology vendor for financial institutions.
Ma has called Hangzhou-based Ant a ""techfin"" rather than a ""fintech"" firm and it has benefited from the far richer valuations the market affords to tech firms than to financial institutions. 
But while Ant has portrayed itself as a technology company, Chinese regulators place it firmly in the financial sector. 
Before China's central bank and regulators met on Monday with Ma and top Ant executives over draft rules for online micro-lending, some analysts had said Ant hoped to escape the closer scrutiny given to financial firms.
WHAT IS IT WORTH?
Ant benefits from the far richer valuations the market affords to tech firms than to financial institutions.
Ant had secured tech-style pricing for its IPO, which valued it at about $315 billion, or more than 31 times its forecast 2021 net profit. The combined market capitalisation of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is $548 billion.
While this valuation is in the same ballpark as Alibaba, which trades at 27.6 times forward earnings and PayPal at a multiple of 45, some investors think Ant should be valued at up to $400 billion or more in the IPO, sources have told Reuters.
That compares with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world’s biggest bank by assets, at a multiple of around 6 and reflects the fin-to-tech shift Ant began two or three years ago as Chinese regulators sought to control financial risks.

Last year, Ant made most of its revenue from fees generated by its digital finance technology platform.

270,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>",European stocks hit one-week high as investors await U.S. election outcome,"By Sruthi Shankar
(Reuters) - Banking and auto stocks propelled the European stocks benchmark to a one-week high on Tuesday, while investors anticipated a clear win for Democrat Joe Biden in the U.S. presidential election would lead to more economic stimulus. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) closed 2.3% higher - its best day since mid-June. Bourses in Frankfurt (GDAXI), Paris (FCHI) and London (FTSE) saw similar gains.
Stock markets worldwide found strength in signs that Biden held a strong and consistent lead in national opinion polls over Republican President Donald Trump, although the race is tighter in several swing states.
A Biden win is widely considered to be supportive for European equities in the near-term because of expectations it would mean a bigger stimulus package and better trade ties with the United States. 
Banks (SX7P) led gains among European sectors, with French lender  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) jumping 6.1% as a surge in currency and commodity trading helped it beat quarterly profit estimates.
Automobiles & parts sector (SXAP), which has borne the brunt of the Trump administration's trade war with China, gained 3.5%.
Boosting the index, luxury automaker  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) surged 7.1% after it forecast 2020 earnings at the top of its previous guidance range as new models such as the hybrid SF90 Stradale start to reach customers.
Insurers (SXIP), financial services companies (SXFP) and construction & materials (SXOP) were the other top gainers. 
""Even though last minute surprises from the U.S. vote can't be ruled out, I believe European equities are close to a very interesting turnaround point which could mean a more 'structural' return of investor interest towards the region,"" said Michele Pedroni, portfolio manager at Decalia Asset Management in Geneva.
""Any reversal, however, could be jeopardised should the crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic drag on for too long, given that Europe has limited political and economic manoeuvre space to progressively provide support to its economy,"" he added.
The STOXX 600 shed almost 6% last week as soaring coronavirus cases pushed major economies including France, Germany and the United Kingdom back into partial lockdown, leading economists to cut fourth-quarter economic growth expectations.
Among other individual movers, British homebuilder  Crest Nicholson  (L:CRST) surged 16.5% after it reinstated its dividend and said annual earnings would top market expectations.

German meal-kit delivery company HelloFresh (DE:HFGG), which has more than doubled in value this year as lockdowns drove demand, slipped 1.2% after quarterly results.

271,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 12:11PM ET</span>","Thomson Reuters revenue rise, cash flow outlook lift shares","By Kenneth Li
(Reuters) -   Thomson Reuters  Corp  (TO:TRI) (N:TRI) said third quarter revenue rose on gains in its legal and corporates divisions and cost cuts helped lift its 2020 free cash flow outlook, prompting a near 4% rise in its shares on Tuesday.
The news and information company said the results gave it ""increasing confidence"" for its full-year financial forecast, although the course of the COVID-19 pandemic could change this.
Thomson Reuters, which owns Reuters News, said in a statement that its revenue rose 2% to $1.44 billion in the third quarter, while its operating profit rose 21% to $318 million.
""I’m very pleased to report our markets and businesses continue to prove resilient in the face of a challenging broader macro-environment,"" Chief Executive Steve Hasker said.
The company said its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose by 42% in the third quarter as a result of higher revenue and a pandemic-related cost cutting program.
Executives said during an analyst call that Thomson Reuters had surpassed its cost cutting target by about $30 million to reach a total of about $130 million, and that the company planned to reinvest in its core businesses during the fourth quarter.
Matt Arnold, an analyst at Edward Jones, said in a research note that it was a ""solid quarter"" for Thomson Reuters, that demonstrated the ""resilience of its subscription based model"".
Chief Financial Officer Michael Eastwood said in an interview that Thomson Reuters was still evaluating acquisition targets and could announce a deal this year or early in 2021.
The company has about $700 million to spend as part of a $2 billion budget to fund expansion in its legal, tax and accounting businesses.
Thomson Reuters' adjusted earnings of 39 cents per share were ahead of the 38 cents analysts expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, while the company's quarterly revenue was also slightly above Wall Street expectations.
The Legal Professionals, Tax & Accounting Professionals and Corporates divisions all had higher organic quarterly sales and adjusted profit.
Thomson Reuters said its results were boosted by strong sales from Practical Law, Westlaw Edge and its European and Canadian businesses and a revenue increase from the tax division after a U.S. tax filing deadline extension from April to July.
Organic revenues at the Reuters News division slipped 2%, reflecting a decline in the agency business and the ongoing impact of the coronavirus crisis on its events business.
Thomson Reuters reaffirmed its full-year guidance of revenue rising by 1% to 2% and raised its free cash flow forecast to about $1.1 billion, at the higher end of the previous outlook.
The company also confirmed that  London Stock Exchange 's (L:LSE) purchase of the Refinitiv data and analytics business is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, when it also expects to incur a tax bill of about $600 million.
Thomson Reuters executives said that the company could fund the payment through free cash flow, its cash on hand of $1.2 billion or by drawing on credit facilities.

The sale of Thomson Reuters' 45% Refinitiv stake will result in it holding 15% of the LSE, estimated to be worth some $9 billion, which it plans to sell within five years and use the proceeds to reinvest in its main businesses.

272,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 12:10PM ET</span>",McKesson says states seek $21 billion from drug distributors in opioid settlement,"By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - McKesson Corp (N:MCK) on Tuesday said it and two other major U.S. drug distributors could be expected to pay up to $21 billion under a new proposal to resolve thousands of lawsuits alleging they helped fuel the U.S. opioid crisis.
McKesson and rivals AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC) and  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH) last year proposed paying a combined $18 billion to resolve the roughly 3,200 lawsuits, with drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) paying another $4 billion.
That proposal, part of a settlement framework negotiated with four state attorneys general, met resistance from lawyers for local governments and several states, leading to further talks. J&J on Oct. 13 said it would now contribute $5 billion.
San Francisco-based McKesson in a quarterly report said under the new $21 billion settlement framework proposed by attorneys general, it would pay about $8 billion over 18 years.
The proposal is subject to further negotiations, and McKesson said it ""has not reached a point where settlement is probable.""
""Communities are desperately in need of the relief this deal would provide,"" said Laura Brewer, a spokeswoman for North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, who is involved in the settlement talks.
AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health declined to comment.
The lawsuits, largely filed by states, counties and cities, seek to hold drug companies responsible for an opioid addiction epidemic that according to U.S. government data resulted in 450,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2018.
The lawsuits accuse drugmakers of deceptively marketing opioids and distributors of ignoring red flags indicating the prescription painkillers were being diverted for improper uses. They deny wrongdoing.
McKesson said the proposed settlement also calls for the distributors to make changes to their anti-diversion programs.

OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and generic painkiller manufacturer  Mallinckrodt  Plc (N:MNK) previously filed for bankruptcy protection in connection with their own multibillion-dollar proposals to resolve opioid lawsuits against them.

273,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>",Stocks’ Election Gauge on Verge of Settling in Trump’s Favor,"(Bloomberg) -- A stock-market election indicator that is often ridiculed for its randomness but whose record of prescience is hard to ignore, at least completely, is about to settle in Donald Trump’s favor.
A rally into Election Day is pushing the S&P 500’s performance over the past three months into positive territory -- a comeback for the indicator which turned negative last week. In some circles, the rebound may be seen as boding well for President Trump’s bid for re-election given that a rising market has tended to precede a victory for the sitting party 86% of the time since 1928.
As random as the three-month span looks when it comes to the market’s return and the relationship to elections, the time-honored track record is worth heeding for traders bombarded by conflicting messages on the race between Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden. The theory proved spot on in 2016. Amid all the polls showing Hillary Clinton’s dominant lead over Trump, the S&P 500 fell for nine straight days before the election week, cementing its three-month performance into negative territory. In the end, Trump won.
Read: Six Investors Size Up Trump’s $9 Trillion Stock Market Bull Run
Of course in a year where the pandemic and ensuing lockdowns have upended virtually every political narrative, putting faith in a market indicator comes with its share of danger. Millions of Americans have already cast their ballots, and polls show few people remain undecided before the vote.
Still, at a time when  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).’s investor clients predict a Trump victory, while respondents in an Evercore ISI survey say they expect Biden to take over the White House, some traders might think they are better off turning to market’s collective wisdom. The S&P 500’s performance in the months leading up to the election has correctly signaled who will win 20 out of the last 23 times.
But even having a near-perfect foresight on the election doesn’t mean things are getting any easier. While Trump’s focus on lower taxes and easier regulations helped prolong the last bull market, his party’s trepidation over expanding government aids may not sit well with traders as coronavirus cases have surged, threatening the economic recovery. On the other hand, Biden’s victory could bring more fiscal stimulus, but that’s likely to be funded by higher taxes.
Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said that even if he knew the election results right now, he wouldn’t have a clear idea on how the markets would respond.
“If Trump wins along with the Senate, is there a lame-duck spending package or will Pelosi make them wait until next year, if it happens at all?” Boockvar noted, referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “If Biden wins with the Senate, do we rally in anticipation of a massive spending bill in Q1 or do we sell off for the next two months as people lock in 2020 capital-gains tax rates and earnings numbers get cut ahead of a possible corporate-tax rate increase in 2021?”

276,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>",What investors are watching for the election - and what could go wrong,"(Reuters) - The stakes are high for financial markets as Americans go to the polls on Tuesday in U.S. elections that have already made history with a record number of early votes cast.
From potential major policy changes to huge election night volatility and post-election swings, this is what investors are watching out for on and after Nov. 3: 
** Trading on the night. Stocks have been rocky in the run-up to the election and the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" has risen in recent weeks. Traders will be glued to screens following how U.S. futures  react to every twist and turn on election night, as well as U.S. Treasury futures  and the dollar (=USD). 
** U.S. Treasuries. The $20 trillion U.S. Treasury market has been asleep for months but recently showed signs of life as opposing bets on how the economy will perform clash amid jitters over the election.
** Currencies. Election-induced volatility may give a short-term boost to the dollar, though many investors believe the currency is set to weaken over the longer-term.
** How robust exchanges are. Exchanges and retail brokers, under scrutiny after recent outages, have spent months planning for the U.S. election. Now their preparations for what could be a highly volatile trading period are about to be put to the test.
** Market safeguards. Price limits and circuit breakers are safeguards meant to stop a market from moving too far or too fast over a specific period of time. Here is how they would work if markets tumble post-Election Day.
** Liquidity crunches. Large Wall Street banks have been running ""war game"" drills in their trading businesses and preparing clients for unexpected scenarios, hoping to avoid liquidity crunches or technical errors as markets react to news.
** Credit rating scrutiny. Some of the more influential observers of the election process will be the agencies that determine the country's credit rating.
** Major policy shifts. Investors could confront dramatically different paths for the country on taxes, government spending, trade and regulation, depending on who wins.
** Stocks to watch. Various stocks and sectors could see dramatic swings, and investors have spent months trying to identify potential winners and losers.
** A bullish stock market. For those looking for stronger gains ahead, a Trump win may be a favored outcome according to one measure. 
** Should Biden win, as polls suggest, his cabinet picks will receive close scrutiny from investors gauging how the new administration's policy could impact markets. 
** Big Tech. If Biden wins, technology companies could face higher tax rates and tax-motivated selling as well as increased regulation. 
** Green funds. Fund managers have been betting that green-type stocks with environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials would benefit from a Biden win.
** Healthcare stocks. A Biden victory and a potential Democratic takeover of the U.S. Senate could clear the way for prescription drug price and healthcare coverage reforms, generally seen as potential negatives for companies in the sector.

** Retail investors, meanwhile, will be among those looking to take advantage of post-election volatility.

Investing.com --  Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) rose 6% after saying it would meet the high end of its guidance for 2020. At least someone's having a good year.
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for 2020 are expected at 1.1 billion euros ($1.28 billion), with adjusted earnings per share of 2.80 euros, both on the high end of guidance from August.
Not that it was a great quarter. Shipments of 2,313 vehicles were down by 161 units from a year earlier, while revenue of 888 million euros failed to meet the expected 899 million euros.  
About 2,000 cars were not made because of a seven-week production suspension due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but the company expects to be able to catch up and make 500 of those units.
Shares are trading close to the record hit in August, and are up about 20% in 2020.
Sponsorship, commercial and brand revenues fell about 31% because of a reduction in the number of Formula 1 races and corresponding lower revenue accrual, as well as reduced in-store traffic and museum visitors.

279,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 10:36AM ET</span>","Banks Rush to Take Fines Under Trump, Casting Light on Misdeeds","(Bloomberg) -- Giant banks have racked up more than $4 billion in U.S. penalties in a wave of settlements weeks before the presidential election. That says a lot about an industry that once vowed to behave after the 2008 financial crisis -- and about the regulatory risks it sees ahead.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). recently incurred a record punishment for foreign bribery under a roughly $3 billion package of accords for its role in Malaysia’s plundered 1MDB investment fund. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. resolved a market-manipulation probe for more than $920 million.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). was fined $400 million for failing to maintain adequate risk controls.
For the industry, that bulge of settlements -- plus others -- removes the threat of stiffer fines if President Donald Trump loses this week and challenger Joe Biden installs more aggressive regulators to take over active probes.
But the penalties also cast fresh light on the persistence of financial professionals’ misbehavior, with investigators noting that the schemes at Goldman and JPMorgan began brewing before the 2008 crisis was fully over. That’s an untimely stain as banks brace for the potential arrival of new sheriffs.
“To the extent that some of the lessons from the financial crisis seem to be going unlearned, I think that is a problem,” said Christopher Wolfe, head of North American banks coverage at Fitch Ratings Inc. “You would think by now that everybody knows you’re going to get caught -- these things always get found out and there’s always going to be consequences for it, but yet people still engage in this behavior.”
Recurring misconduct doesn’t only antagonize regulators. Fines can indicate governance failings that can weigh on banks’ credit ratings, especially in a more difficult economic environment, Wolfe wrote in a report last week. Investors also are increasingly focusing on environmental, social and governance matters, which may become a bigger issue for banks regardless of who wins the election, Wolfe said.
More Deals
The three giant U.S. banks aren’t alone in settling recently. Since the start of August, Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB),  Capital One  Financial Corp (NYSE:COF)., Bank of Nova Scotia and Toronto-Dominion Bank also have resolved probes with penalties that piled up into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
If Trump loses, more banks may rush to wrap up cases before Biden’s inauguration.
“There are a handful of financial institutions in my view that may try to settle with an outgoing Trump administration rather than face what could be a more aggressive Biden enforcement regime,” said Elliott Stein, senior litigation analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “If Trump wins, I think ongoing cases continue apace.”
To be sure, ending a probe isn’t just a matter of writing a check. Accords often include agreements to overhaul internal systems or controls. In some cases, such as the Federal Reserve’s cap on  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.’s assets -- essentially limiting the bank’s growth -- that’s the main focus.
Ultimately, remediation can stretch over years and cost 12 times as much as an initial fine, soaking up management’s attention and other resources, according to Gabrielle Haddad, founder and chief operating officer of Sigma Ratings, a data and analytics firm part-owned by Fitch.
“The sentiment in the public from regulators to consumers, to ESG investors -- they’re all becoming much less tolerant of financial crimes and misconduct,” Haddad said. “There’s going to be increased pressure on banks and corporates” to manage nonfinancial risks that can have serious economic consequences, she said.
Banks may win some credit if they take a tougher stand on wrongdoing with measures in-house, according to Stein. Goldman, for example, has said it will cut pay for certain current and former leaders, including Chief Executive Officer David Solomon and his predecessor, Lloyd Blankfein.
“Egregious cases result in stiff fines no matter which administration, but the more banks can do on their own to administer punishments, like with clawbacks, the more leniency they may get from the government,” Stein said.

281,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 09:50AM ET</span>",Analysis: Retail traders position for volatility after U.S. election,"By John McCrank and Imani Moise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Retail investors have been a growing force in 2020, exploding in numbers during lockdowns and helping fuel the rebound in stocks from pandemic-driven lows. Now, as election-related volatility spikes, this new cohort sees opportunities.
Day traders are tapping resources online and in virtual communities to position themselves for what could be a bumpy ride depending on how long it takes to resolve Election Day uncertainties.
In the past year, traditional online brokerages like  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW) and Fidelity joined upstarts like Robinhood in getting rid of trading fees, while also allowing users to buy slices of individual shares, making it easier than ever before for anyone to own a piece of a company.
When stock prices plunged in March and governments and central banks flooded the economy with liquidity, millions of would-be investors saw an attractive entry point and downloaded trading apps on their mobile phones.
""It's just something I picked up as a hobby,"" said Sam Freeman, 23, a cancer researcher in Chicago, who said he started day trading in April after seeing a conversation on options trading on Twitter. He has been trading  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) options and said he made money off a rally around Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) stock split.
With the election at hand, he is leaning on a  Slack Technologies Inc  (N:WORK) group comprised of a few thousand retail traders with various levels of experience, and social media, to position himself. 
He said he is betting on a victory by Democrat Joe Biden over Republican Donald Trump, followed by a sharp market sell-off.
But with a record number of early ballots having already been cast, the results may come in later than in previous years, which ""could increase volatility in the market especially in the event of a close outcome,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a research note. 
DIY GENERATION
Despite the volatility that has been a hallmark of 2020, record numbers of individuals have been tapping the markets.
Three million new Robinhood accounts were opened in the first four months of 2020, the brokerage said. TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD), which was recently bought by Schwab, said more than 1.2 million new funded accounts were opened on its platform in the first half of the year and usage of the firm's educational resources is up more than three times that of 2019.
""The retail investor has the ability to be much more sophisticated than ever before,"" said Spencer Mindlin, an analyst at Aite Group.
Along with near-frictionless trading and a bevy of educational materials, the rise of retail is partly due to the tech-savvy, independent-minded millennials coming of age, he added. 
""It's more about do-it-yourself, like DIY YouTube videos on how to invest your money,"" he said.
Jaidan Craig, 23, of Provo, Utah, said he has been investing for a few years and regularly posts investing videos for his YouTube channel's https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo2N-4FJicQw74I4LIuoKIA nearly 2,000 followers. He said he aims to emulate Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater, the world's biggest hedge fund, who espouses ideas like diversifying portfolios across different asset classes.
Craig invests some money every week, and lately, he said he has found stocks too pricey, so he has been holding more cash. If stock prices drop due to election uncertainty, he will treat it as a buying opportunity. 
""The main thing is just investing more of my cash, deploy more of that into stocks as they drop,"" he said. 
The surge of new retail investors benefits the market in many ways, such as promoting financial literacy and bringing more attention to a wider variety of companies than institutional investors tend to focus on, said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University. 
""Individual investors bring a lot to the table,"" he said.
To be sure, those investors are not always going to hit home runs, he added.
Retail investors can be bitten by sophisticated strategies in which losses can stack up if markets turn, such as trading on margin, using derivatives or betting on highly speculative stocks. 
Early this summer, seasoned traders were scratching their heads as retail traders bid up bankrupt or soon-to-be-bankrupt stocks, like Hertz (N:HTZ), Chesapeake, Whiting (N:WLL) and JC Penney (OTC:JCPNQ), which had a rollercoaster ride, drawing comparisons to casino gambling.

""But some college kid with $25 to spare can basically afford to lose that playing on a fractional share on some popular trading app,"" rather than spending the cash on avocado toast, Angel said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday, on a wave of bets on a rapid and substantial fiscal stimulus package for the economy in the wake of elections to the White House and Congress on Tuesday
Conventional wisdom has it that such a package will only be possible if both the White House and Congress are controlled by the same party. The move thus appears to imply expectations of a 'Blue Sweep' for the Democratic Party, although the polls are far from clear about this, especially as regards control of the Senate, where 35 seats are up for grabs in today's elections.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 385 points or 1.4%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7%. in a further sign of a rotation of money out of growth and momentum stocks into underperforming 'value' names. 
""We continue to expect more procyclical rotation across and within assets into next year,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts in a note to clients onTuesday. .""However, risky assets might suffer if real yields were to increase further into year-end without better growth news.""
A notable outlier to the trend was  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group. The Chinese e-commerce giant's ADRs fell 8.9% after Chinese regulators abruptly suspended the record-breaking IPO of Ant Group, the financial services giant spun out of the company.
After selling off heavily last week in reaction to a rapidly-rising wave of the coronavirus which prompted fears of fresh lockdowns, investors have chosen to 'look through' short-term volatility for now, despite the likelihood that the election outcome still won't be clear by Wednesday morning. 
""Clarity around the U.S. elections – should we get it – will provide some uncertainty relief although better news on the vaccine is more crucial to support risky assets into year-end,"" Goldman analysts led by Christian Mueller-Glissman wrofe  ""This is all the more true now that new lockdowns are increasingly weighing on investor sentiment.""
Factory orders for November and the latest Redbook Research overview of the retail sector earlier were both marginally better than expected, but such factors are being overshadowed  somewhat by the elections.
The sudden surge of risk appetite has extended a sell-off in bond that has pushed the yield curve to its steepest since March. That's supporting financial stocks by restoring the profit margins that banks can generate by borrowing at ultra-low short-term rates and lending at higher long-term ones. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock was up 3.2, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) was up 3.1% and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock was up 2.5%
By contrast, Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock, one of the big winners of the acceleration of the trend toward e-commerce and remote living this year, fell 3.0% after reporting disappointing third-quarter numbers for user growth.

286,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>",Analysis: Progressive or moderate? How a Biden cabinet could affect U.S. stocks,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Should Democratic challenger Joe Biden prevail, as polls suggest, some on Wall Street are looking ahead to his cabinet picks to gauge whether he will govern as a business-friendly moderate or promote progressive legislation that could weigh on sectors such as financials and oil but bolster clean energy. 
Among the cabinet posts that are most likely to have an effect on stock prices are secretary of the Treasury, which could oversee a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill backed by House Democrats, and Transportation, which will likely oversee a broad infrastructure package to hasten the development of electric vehicles as part of Biden's $2 trillion climate change plan.
Progressive (NYSE:PGR) lawmakers are pushing him to exclude any corporate executives or lobbyists from potential positions, people involved told Reuters. Biden has said he would consider Republicans for his cabinet as well, though that is unlikely for Treasury chief because it would set up a major fight with progressives who have their eye on that role in particular, according to people close to the campaign.
Overall, the former vice president leads by 10 points in national polls, although his lead is narrower in the battleground states that will likely tip the election. 
""A cabinet that is not dominated by the progressive end of the Democratic spectrum would be more favorably viewed by the market"" and dampen fears of increasing regulations under a Biden administration, said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW). 
The COVID-related recession and the so-called ""K-shaped"" recovery's divergence of fortunes between the wealthy and everyone else, have boosted a fundamental progressive argument that American capitalism grossly favors the rich and needs to be reformed.
Progressive policies tilt toward more government-run healthcare, providing subsidies for college tuition and increasing worker wages, while moderates support privately run healthcare plans and are less-inclined to support government spending on large projects like the Green New Deal. 
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a progressive who is seen as one of Biden's possible picks to lead the Treasury, has called for strengthening the walls between commercial and investment banks, boosting consumer protections and allowing the U.S. Postal Service to partner with credit unions to provide basic consumer banking services. 
Fed Governor Lael Brainard and former Treasury deputy secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin are also seen among the most likely https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden/months-before-election-liberal-groups-press-biden-on-picks-for-economic-posts-idUSKBN2300HK selections for the Treasury post. Another possible pick is Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo, according to the Washington Post. 
“The Biden-Harris transition team is not making any personnel decisions pre-election,"" said a spokesperson for the Biden-Harris transition team. Representatives for Warren, Raimondo and Brainard did not respond to requests for comment. 
“Brainard would be a strong and safe choice for a Biden administration,"" said Kevin Gallagher, director of the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University. He cited her experience working at the Treasury under the Obama administration, a previous role at the White House under former President Bill Clinton and her current role as a member of the Federal Reserve Board. 
""The question is whether she is seen enough in tune with the more progressive wing of Biden's coalition,” Gallagher said.
While Warren and Brainard are qualified, ""the foundation of Warren's career has been attacking the banking industry,"" Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said in a September research note, and that would ""likely rattle investor confidence."" 
Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said in a recent research note that the market appeared to be underpricing the possibility of cabinet picks like Warren who would be negative for the market. 
The S&P 500 financial sector is down 1 percent since the first Trump-Biden debate on Sept. 29, compared with a 2.8% decline in the S&P 500 index as a whole, according to Refinitiv data. 
A Warren selection would likely come only with a blue wave that gives Democrats at least a two- or three-seat advantage in the Senate so as not to allow Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, a Republican, to select Warren's replacement, said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI). 
Biden's ""margins in the Senate are going to be the really important thing to watch here"", he said. 
A lower-profile pick that may have wide market implications will be the secretary of transportation, which Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both filled with a member of the opposing party in a show of bipartisanship. 
Shares of clean energy companies and electric vehicle stocks have jumped over the last month in anticipation of a Biden victory.

""In an environment where you could see major infrastructure spending and additional regulation in terms of electric vehicles and fuel standards, this may be a relatively important economic position,"" Chiavarone said.

287,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>",China tells Ant to expect scrutiny of credit business ahead of record listing: sources,"By Julie Zhu and Cheng Leng
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's top financial regulators told   Ant Group  Co Ltd 's (HK:6688) (SS:688688) founder Jack Ma and two top executives that the company's lucrative online lending business faces tighter government scrutiny, sources told Reuters, days before its record-setting listing. 
Ant's controller Ma, its Executive Chairman Eric Jing and Chief Executive Simon Hu were summoned to a rare joint meeting with senior representatives from four regulators on Monday, as Beijing published new draft rules for online micro-lending.
The trio were informed that the company, notably its cash-cow consumer lending business, will face tougher scrutiny over matters including capital adequacy and leverage ratios, said two sources who were briefed on the matter. They declined to be identified as details of the meeting have not been made public. 
The move comes as some of the regulators were ""surprised"" by Ant's business and financial figures, including the scale and profitability of its credit business, details of which were disclosed for the first time in its IPO prospectus in late August, said the first source. 
Ant's credit unit contributed close to 40% of the group's revenue in the first half of the year. It holds Ant's consumer credit business that includes Huabei, which operates like a virtual credit card service, and short-term consumer loan provider Jiebei. 
Beijing has become more uncomfortable with banks heavily using micro-lenders or third-party technology platforms like Ant for underwriting consumer loans, amid fears of rising defaults and deteriorating asset quality in a pandemic-hit economy.
Ant's consumer lending balance was 1.7 trillion yuan ($254 billion) as of the end of June, accounting for 21% of all short-term consumer loans issued by Chinese deposit-taking financial institutions.
""Regulators have long aimed to curb the fast-growing online lending industry to prevent systematic risks to the vast financial sector,"" said the first source.
""Ant's high-profile blockbuster IPO has become the tipping point as it urges all relevant regulators to step up efforts to look into its sprawling business.""
During the meeting on Monday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) and the foreign exchange regulator also told Ant to properly comply with the new micro-lending rules, said the second person.
Ant declined to comment. CBIRC and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment. The PBOC and CSRC were unable to be reached by phone outside of business hours.
China's central bank and banking regulator separately published draft micro-lending rules on Monday which seek to increase the bar for micro-lenders to be able to provide online loans directly to consumers or jointly with banks, while limiting the amount they can lend.
The draft, open for public feedback until Dec. 2, requires small online lenders to provide at least 30% of any loan they fund jointly with banks, which is widely considered to be a key rule that will hurt the profitability of Ant's current business model. 
Only 2% of the 1.7 trillion yuan consumer loans Ant facilitated were on its balance sheet as of the end of June, its prospectus showed. The company takes an average 30%-40% cut of the interest on loans it facilitates, analysts estimate, without bearing such products' credit risks.
Ant is set to go public in Hong Kong and Shanghai on Thursday after raising about $37 billion, including the greenshoe option of the domestic leg, in a record public sale of shares.
The latest regulatory move will likely cast a cloud over Ant's post-debut performance, warned the sources and some institutional investors in its IPO. 
""One tree far taller than others may fall victim to a strong wind more easily,"" said the second source.

288,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 07:18AM ET</span>",Eggless Egg-Maker Eat Just Prepping for Europe Next Year,"(Bloomberg) -- Eat Just Inc. is ready to sell plant-based eggs in western Europe: it’s got a manufacturer, a distributor and a delivery service lined up. All it needs now is government approval to put that supply chain into action.
The San Francisco-based startup is awaiting safety approvals from the European Union for using mung bean protein, the ingredient that makes its liquid food scramble when cooked. Then it can start selling in countries such as Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, Chief Executive Officer Josh Tetrick said in an interview.
“We’re in conversations with major retailers, large quick-service restaurants, large hotel operators in most countries in western Europe,” Tetrick said. The final regulatory approval should come in time for Eat Just to start its European business next year, he said.
Read: Eat Just, Maker of Plant-Based Eggs, Eyes $2 Billion Valuation
Sales of meat and dairy alternatives in the EU and U.K. are expected to grow by about 10% a year during the next five years as environmental, health and animal-welfare concerns prompt Europeans to cut back on beef or pork. That’s attracting companies such as Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc., based in El Segundo, California, though some products may face relatively strict regulations and lengthy approval processes.
Part of what attracts Eat Just to western Europe is the willingness of the population to consume more plant-based proteins.
“You find even more openness in western Europe than you would find in the U.S.,” Tetrick said.
Impossible Foods Inc. also awaits market approval after filing an application last year to market a burger containing soy leghemoglobin, an iron-containing molecule made with a genetically engineered yeast. The Redwood (NYSE:RWT) City, California-based company uses the ingredient to make its vegetarian burgers juicier so they mimic ground beef when cooked.
Entering Europe would help Eat Just expand beyond current markets in the U.S., Hong Kong and mainland China. It’s set to start building a plant-protein factory in Singapore that will open by mid-2022, Tetrick said.
Eat Just is working toward achieving operating profitability and once it gets there, it will then consider options for going public. The target for reaching the milestone is by the end of 2021, Tetrick said. It wants to bring down the cost of an egg below 5 cents by the end of 2023, which would be significantly below the cost of the cheapest egg globally, he said.
The company completed a deal with German potato starch producer Emsland Group to manufacture protein from mung beans and handle processing byproducts. German poultry producer PHW Group will distribute the egg across the region’s restaurants and retailers. The company also has a partnership with Berlin-based food-ordering service Delivery Hero SE.
“The best way to change traditional agriculture is to partner with traditional agriculture, not to stand outside of it,” Tetrick said. “Companies are really skilled at figuring out how to move those animal proteins into the homes of human beings. Let’s plug something that we think is a little bit better into their systems.”

289,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>","Shares rise, dollar sinks as investors bet on clear Biden poll win","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's stock markets rallied on Tuesday and Wall Street looked set to follow as investors bet on a clear win for Joe Biden as the United States votes in its most polarised presidential election in living memory.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Biden made a last-minute push for votes in battleground states on Monday and though their campaigns were wary of possible legal disputes that could delay a clear outcome, a wave of risk appetite swept through markets.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 1.6% in a second day of robust gains, having slumped to a five-month low last week as many of the region's top economies were forced back into almost complete coronavirus lockdowns. (EU) Growth-sensitive cyclical sectors such as oil and gas (SXEP), miners (SXPP) and banks (SX7P) once again led therally - all rising between 2-3.5%.
""Markets are pricing for a Biden win, certainly a clear outcome, and they want a clear and uncontested outcome,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
A shock Trump win, a contested result, or just a divided outcome could all trigger corrections in markets, he said.
""Control of the Senate is crucial for any 'blue wave' scenario to materialise, otherwise divided government continues and fiscal stimulus expectations will need to be scaled back,"" added Alvin Tan, Asia forex strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
Reassuring earnings from French bank  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) lifted its shares by 6.5%, adding to a sense that the banking sector was holding up relatively well to an economic pounding from the COVID-19 crisis.
But a 40% fall in full-year earnings at Associated British Foods (L:ABF) due to a profit plunge in its Primark clothing business was a reminder of how the pandemic is wreaking havoc with corporate balance sheets. ABF shares fell 1.7%. No major European economic data is due on Tuesday, with only a smattering of earnings to steer investors. BNP bank was buoyed by a surge in currency and commodity trading to beat third quarter profit expectations.

BINARY MARKET MOOD
Analysts said that while the mood was more upbeat on Tuesday, it remained febrile as European countries introduced tougher lockdown restrictions to fight a pandemic that was set to hit the economy further.
Australian's central bank became the latest to take action to shore up the coronavirus-hit economy, trimming interest rates to near zero on Tuesday and ramping up its bond-buying plans.
Investors are also waiting on Federal Reserve and Bank of England meetings this week that are also expected to bring more support.
""The problem with markets is that they are very binary. One day everything is hunky dory and the next day it's the depths of despair and so you have to tread that tightrope between the two that creates volatility,"" CMC Markets' Hewson said.
The global tone had also helped by gains on a Wall Street on Monday underpinned by U.S. manufacturing activity accelerating more than expected in October.
Wall Street futures were up 1% ahead of the start of New York trading. (N) MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS had added 1.4% overnight. The gauge is less than 1% shy of a 2-1/2 year high struck in mid-October and up over 5% this year, driven by a 37% rebound from China's markets since March.
Currency markets also seemed to be tilting towards a victory for Biden. The dollar was down almost 0.5% against a basket of the world's other top currencies (=USD) at 93.656 after hitting a month-high on Monday. [/FRX]
Analysts believe a Biden win would weaken the dollar as the former vice-president is expected to spend big on stimulus and to take a freer approach to trade, boosting other currencies at the dollar's expense and potentially pushing up bond yields. 
The euro (EUR=) extended gains through the morning to stand 0.5% higher at $1.1645. Sterling  went up 0.6% to just below $1.30, while Russia's rouble , which has been one of the currencies hit hardest by the prospects of a Biden win, also saw a strong bounce. [.RU]

Strategists at Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute said polls were suggesting a greater likelihood of a Democratic sweep in the election.
""We are starting to incorporate themes we believe would outperform in that event, moving toward a more pro-risk stance overall despite last week's market pullback,"" the strategists said in a report.
South Korea's main index <.KSII> advanced 1.7% and Hong Kong's index (HSI) sprinted 2.2% higher. The MSCI China index hit a 23-year high too as Chinese factory activity also expanded the fastest in a decade.
The safe-harbour yen  was steady at 104.76 yen per dollar.[FRX/] Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.
The Aussie dollar  fell as much as 0.2% and Australia's ASX 200 (AXJO) ended 2% higher as the central bank trimmed interest rates to near zero and expanded its bond-buying programme, as expected.
Oil prices were clawing higher after two weeks of weakness, with Brent futures (LCOc1) up nearly 3% at $40 a barrel again and U.S. WTI up 3.2% at $38. [O/R]
Gold  ticked up 0.2% to $1,894 an ounce, while benchmark U.S. and European bond market yields, which are a proxy for governments' borrowing costs, were also shuffling higher.
""There is an expectation that there will be a Biden victory,"" said Jan von Gerich, an analyst at Nordea. But he said that there was a ""preparedness that there could be some big moves"" on Wednesday should the result be unclear.

290,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Soar 442 Pts in Speculation on Clear Election Result,"By Peter Nurse
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening firmly higher Tuesday, continuing Monday’s hefty gains, as investors hope for a clear political result after one of the most contentious presidential election campaigns in history.
At 8:25 AM ET (1205 GMT),S&P 500 Futures traded 43 points, or 1.3%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 442 points, or 1.7%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 72 points, or 0.6%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.7% higher Monday, posting its biggest gain since Oct. 7. The S&P 500 index gained 1.2%, its largest advance since Oct, 12, while the NASDAQ Composite index underperformed, adding just 0.2%.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden will cast their respective votes later Tuesday, as the highly contentious presidential election campaign comes to its climax. 
The latest polls still have Biden in a comfortable lead in the national surveys, but the tally in all-important swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where the electoral college margin could be decided, looks like being a lot closer. 
That said, investors appear to be betting on a Democratic sweep of the White House and Congress, which would likely result in a more stable political climate and, in all probability, a generous fiscal stimulus package.
“This is based on the $3.4 trillion stimulus proposed by House Democrats over the summer that would front-load support for household incomes and deliver relief for state and local government,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Meanwhile, the number of new Covid-19 cases in the United States hit another record high last week, according to a Reuters analysis. The number of new cases reported each week has risen for four straight weeks, with the biggest increases seen in the last two weeks.
This sharp increase in coronavirus cases has already been seen in Europe, prompting many governments in the region to introduce new partial shutdowns in an attempt to halt the surge in the virus before the Christmas holiday season. 
Meanwhile, the third-quarter earnings season continues on Tuesday with Bayer (OTC:BAYRY), Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) and Humana (NYSE:HUM) reporting before the bell.
Economic data releases Tuesday include the Johnson Redbook index, ISM NY business conditions, and September factory orders, but most eyes will be on the Federal Reserve meeting and the monthly employment report later in the week. 
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, helped by talk the major oil producers will look at rolling over oil output restrictions into 2021. Eyes will also be on the release of the API crude inventories for last week, released later Tuesday. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, including Russia, are due to increase supply by two million barrels per day in January, but are now under pressure to push back this decision due to  weak market conditions.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $36.75 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.4% to $38.82.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,893.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1659.

291,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 06:46AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Tired of Trump, Deutsche Bank games ways to sever ties with the president - sources","By Matt Scuffham, Tom Sims and John O'Donnell
NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB) is looking for ways to end its relationship with President Donald Trump after the U.S. elections, as it tires of the negative publicity stemming from the ties, according to three senior bank officials with direct knowledge of the matter.
Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) has about $340 million in loans outstanding to the Trump Organization, the president's umbrella group that is currently overseen by his two sons, according to filings made by Trump to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics in July and a senior source within the bank. The three loans, which are against Trump properties and start coming due in two years, are current on payments and personally guaranteed by the president, according to two bank officials. 
In meetings in recent months, a Deutsche Bank management committee that oversees reputational and other risks for the lender in the Americas region has discussed ways in which it could rid the bank of these last vestiges of the relationship, two of the three bank officials said. The bank has over the years lent Trump more than $2 billion, one of the officials said. 
One idea that has come up in the meetings: sell the loans in the secondary market, two of the bank officials said. But one of the officials said that idea has not gained traction, in part because it is not clear who would want to buy the loans and the attendant problems that come with it.
While it was known that Deutsche Bank has been closely examining its relationship with Trump, including by setting up a working group in 2016 to review the bank's relationship with him, its recent eagerness to end all ties and the contours of discussions in light of the election have not been previously reported.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment.
WARREN'S WARNING
The German bank, which first started lending to Trump in the late 1990s, has been dragged into congressional and other investigations into the real estate mogul-turned-politician's finances and alleged Russia connections.
The probes and the bad press, seen by one senior executive as ""serious collateral damage"" from the relationship, are an unwelcome distraction for the bank, the three officials said. It comes at a time when Chief Executive Christian Sewing is trying to turn Deutsche Bank around after its decades-long run at becoming a major Wall Street bank left it nursing huge losses. 
Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat member of the Senate banking committee, has previously called for an investigation into Deutsche Bank over its money laundering controls and has demanded answers from the lender about its relationship with Trump and his family. She told Reuters that she intended to keep pushing for a probe in the next administration.
""You bet I'm going to continue to fight for accountability and strong enforcement of our banking laws, especially for giant institutions like Deutsche Bank,"" she said.
What happens next for the bank rests on the outcome of Tuesday's elections, according to the three bank officials.
If the Republican president loses, and Democrats take control of the White House and Congress, senior Deutsche Bank executives believe congressional investigations that have stalled amid a court battle over access to Trump's financial records could be rejuvenated, the three bank officials said.
In this scenario, however, Deutsche Bank executives believe they will also have more freedom to deal with the loans and end their relationship with Trump, the officials said. They hope doing so might help reduce some of the scrutiny, they said.
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS
The loans, which are against Trump's golf course in Miami, and hotels in Washington and Chicago, are such that the Trump Organization has only had to pay interest on them so far, and the entire principal is outstanding, two of the three bank officials said. They come due in 2023 and 2024, the filings show.
The businesses backing the loans face challenges. The coronavirus-driven economic slowdown has hit the travel industry, including hotels. Moreover, last month Reuters reported that Trump's plan to make money by developing houses and hotels on his golf courses, including the one involving the Deutsche Bank loan, had not panned out so far.
The Deutsche Bank executives are not unduly concerned about Trump's ability to repay the loans, given the president's personal guarantees and the time left before they come due, the three bank officials said. 
If Trump is not in office, Deutsche Bank executives feel that it would be easier for them to demand repayment, foreclose if he is not able to pay it off or refinance, or try to sell the loans, according to two of the three bank officials.
Since Trump has personally guaranteed all the loans, Deutsche Bank could also seize the president's assets if he is unable to repay, two of the three bank officials said.
If Trump wins a second term, Deutsche Bank executives feel their options would be fewer, the three bank officials said. The bank wouldn't want the negative publicity inherent with seizing assets from a sitting president and would likely extend the loans until he is out of office, two of the bank officials said.

The bottom line, the three bank officials said, is that the matter won’t be resolved until well after the election.

292,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>",U.S. experts to review Biogen drug that could be first new Alzheimer's treatment in decades,"By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - U.S. health experts this week will decide whether to recommend approval for Biogen Inc's (O:BIIB) Alzheimer's drug, which could become the first new treatment for the mind-wasting disease in decades even as serious questions persist over whether data show if it works.
In a field littered with unrelenting failure, Biogen believes in aducanumab it has the first drug that can treat an underlying cause, and therefore slow progression, of Alzheimer's. But its path to approval has been anything but smooth or assured.
Biogen abruptly ended clinical trials of aducanumab last year after an early look at trial results showed it was not effective. Last October, the company shocked many Alzheimer’s experts by reversing course, saying that a new analysis showed aducanumab could help patients with early-stage disease preserve their ability to function independently for longer. In July, Biogen filed for approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
Now the agency faces tremendous pressure to approve a treatment option for millions of Americans suffering from Alzheimer's and the millions more expected to face it in coming years.
Patient advocates say the need for a new Alzheimer’s treatment that could help people remain independent is heightened by the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 229,000 people in the United States, including tens of thousands of seniors in nursing homes.
""The pandemic came and it changed everything,” said Russ Paulsen, chief operating officer at patient advocacy group UsAgainstAlzheimer's. “We need something to keep people out of nursing homes."" 
A committee of outside advisers to the FDA will discuss aducanumab on Nov. 6. The agency's final decision is expected by March. European health regulators have also accepted the drug for review.
Charles Flagg, a 79-year-old retired minister from Jamestown, Rhode Island, had been enrolled for years in a trial of aducanumab before it was stopped. He started receiving the drug again in August as part of a follow-up study, according to his wife Cynthia Flagg.
“He's not 100 percent himself, but overall I'm not dealing with someone that needs to be led around or be in a care home,” Flagg said. 
Aducanumab, an antibody designed to remove amyloid plaques from the brain - a strategy tried with many failed Alzheimer's drugs - would reap billions of dollars in sales if approved.
Biogen, along with partner Eisai Co Ltd (T:4523), is one of the last large drugmakers pursuing treatments for a disease that afflicts nearly 6 million Americans and millions more worldwide. Biogen estimates about 1.5 million people with early Alzheimer’s in the United States could be candidates for the drug. 
'CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL'
Late last year, Biogen said one of its two pivotal studies of aducanumab showed a statistically significant benefit at slowing cognitive and functional decline in patients with early Alzheimer's. A second trial failed to achieve that goal, but did show a benefit for a subset of patients who were given a high dose for at least 10 months. 
In March, it opened a follow-up long-term safety study to 2,400 people who had previously participated in trials of aducanumab, like Flagg.
Many Alzheimer's researchers say Biogen should conduct a third large study to prove aducanumab works. They worry about its possible side-effects, such as brain-swelling, and the potential cost.
""Aducanumab's efficacy as a treatment for the cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease cannot be proven by clinical trials with divergent outcomes,"" said Mayo Clinic neurologist Dr. David Knopman, who was recused from the expert panel because he helped conduct the trials.
Others believe the FDA could approve the drug without another trial. 
Previous clinical studies had largely targeted patients in later stages of the disease, while many experts now believe attacking Alzheimer's as early as possible may be the key to success. But there was a lack of clarity on how to assess a drug's success when functional deficits are less pronounced.
In 2018, the FDA revised its standard of proof guidance for reviewing Alzheimer’s drugs by essentially combining what had been separate goals for cognition, or memory, and day-to-day function. The new guidance stressed the need for a drug to show “clinically meaningful” benefits, a term it has not clearly defined. 
Alzheimer's advocacy groups are pushing for a broad definition, saying it should include preserving the ability to perform daily activities such as shopping independently or remembering to turn off a stove.
“They have been trying to lower the bar and help any company to get a drug approved,” said Dr. Marwan Sabbagh, from the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. ""How much (improvement) do you need to be clinically meaningful? Naturally this is very subjective.”
The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

293,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 06:21AM ET</span>","Factbox: A second Trump term could mean fewer regulations, more trade wars and high TV ratings","(Reuters) - If U.S. President Donald Trump secures a second term in the White House, look for an auto emissions battle with California, a bid to downsize Big Tech and more strong audience ratings for cable news. 
Here is how a re-election of President Trump could impact six key industries. For a FACTBOX on how these sectors might change if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the election, click.
AUTOMAKERS 
A Trump re-election would leave U.S. automakers caught in the crossfire of a war over climate policy between Washington and the state of California.
California sued Trump for rolling back national vehicle emissions standards and seeking to cancel the state's authority to mandate sales of electric vehicles. 
Automakers stand to save billions in compliance costs under Trump's emissions approach. But the clash with California over emissions and electric vehicles has divided automakers. It has also left the industry to deal with two sets of regulations for the increasingly divergent coastal Blue state markets and heartland, Red state markets. Automakers have long advocated resolving differences between California and federal climate policy to create a single, national set of standards to guide their technology investments.
During his first term, Trump put pressure on Detroit automakers to step up investments in the United States, attacking General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co for decisions to close plants, or invest in China and Mexico. Trump periodically threatened German automakers with tariffs. His steel and aluminum tariffs raised costs for U.S. automakers.
PHARMACEUTICALS
Trump has been a vocal critic of high drug prices but experts say the pharmaceutical industry will likely fare better under a Trump second term than they would if Joe Biden wins the White House. 
Trump passed a number of executive orders designed to slash drug prices in his first term but experts say they have had little practical impact. 
His efforts to spur Congress to pass new laws to reduce drug costs have been much less successful, in part because his own party blocked a bill that would have allowed Medicare, a government health insurance program, to negotiate lower drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. 
MINING
Trump, should he win re-election, is expected to continue to slash mining industry regulations and shorten the permitting process, part of a wide-ranging effort to boost domestic production of the minerals used to make electronics, weapons and a host of other goods.
Trump signed several executive orders in his first term that labeled rare earths and other minerals as critical to national defense, ordering the Pentagon to financially support junior projects. The U.S. only has one rare earths mine, though it relies on China for processing. A second Trump term could see multiple new domestic rare earth mines as well as new processing equipment from Rare Element Resources Ltd and others. 
At least one mining project could be jeopardized in Trump's new term, however. Alaska's Pebble Mine project, a massive copper and gold deposit in the Bristol Bay watershed, has come under criticism by Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. and Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who have said the mine would destroy areas where they enjoy fishing and hunting. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in late August extended its permit review timeline out past the election, a step that came after both privately lobbied the president.
The mine's developer, Vancouver-based Northern Dynasty Minerals (NYSE:NAK) Ltd, has said the mine can be safely developed. But Alaska's two U.S. senators, both Republicans, have publicly come out against the mine, adding further pressure on Trump to deny it permits.
MEDIA
Media companies are poised to benefit if Trump gets another four years in office, based on demand for TV, print and digital news coverage since his election in 2016.
While news consumers first tuned in for coverage of the outspoken president and his administration, the triple threat of the coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis, and racial strife have kept them engaged. 
The New York Times, for example, saw its digital-only subscriptions grow more than fourfold between the end of the second quarter in 2016 and the same period this year. Shares of the New York Times Co are up more than 250% since election day 2016.
Evening TV news broadcasts have also seen a resurgence, with Comcast-owned NBC, ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc-owned CBS and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co’s ABC experiencing their biggest news audiences in years. 
Ratings for cable news networks AT&T-owned CNN, Fox Corp-owned Fox News and Comcast’s MSNBC - with their loyal, politically-divided followings - are up 72 percent from last year, according to Nielsen. Fox News was the highest-rated network in all of television for prime-time viewers in July, August and September, per Nielsen.
But despite the uptick in audiences, news organizations continue to suffer from declining advertising revenue, spurred by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), and exacerbated by the pandemic. Many marketers have slashed their advertising budgets, leading news organizations to lay off tens of thousands of employees. 
If the negative news cycle continues into a second Trump term, ad dollars may not follow. For years, ad tech firms have offered tools for brands to block ads from appearing on web pages or URLs that include keywords like “shooting” or “murder.” These advertising ""blacklists"" exploded in usage after the 2016 U.S. election, when brands sought to avoid polarizing news stories. Many brands have been reluctant to buy ads against coronavirus and Black Lives Matter coverage.
A second Trump term could help sustain interest in journalism, with an engaged public glued to the news, and a president who has acknowledged his role keeping them there. 
“Another reason that I’m going to win another four years is because newspapers, television, all forms of media will tank if I’m not there because without me, their ratings are going down the tubes,” Trump said in 2017, according to the New York Times. 
RETAIL/TRADE 
U.S. President Trump has imposed $370 billion in tariffs on goods imported from China, part of his ""America First"" agenda. Those tariffs on products ranging from handbags to small electronics are estimated to have cost U.S. importers some $61.6 billion through early September, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and have been blamed for eroding U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. Retailers argue the tariffs will result in higher prices for consumers and lost jobs.
“If Trump wins, he will see the election as a validation of his strategy on trade policy, including his use of tariffs, and will certainly continue to follow this strategy with China,"" said Jonathan Gold, National Retail Federation Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy.
The trade organization hopes any new deal can be reached without the threat of tariffs. 
TECH
If Trump holds the White House, big tech companies will face continued pressure from regulators on antitrust issues. The Trump administration has already sued Alphabet’s Google and a suit against Facebook is said to be coming soon. Should Democrats win the Senate, that could add to the risks for tech, as Democrats are calling for even more scrutiny of practices they say have stifled innovation and reduce competition. Trump may also ramp up his rhetorical war over what he contends is censorship of conservative views on the major social platforms.
The most immediate tech question for Trump will be what to do with TikTok, the Chinese-owned app that his administration says is a security risk that must be transferred to American ownership or banned.

With the election in the rearview, tech companies who depend on China as a supplier or buyer will be watching to see if Trump’s approach to trade ratchets up or cools down.

294,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>",EU watchdog slams Germany for lapses in Wirecard fraud,"By Huw Jones and John O'Donnell
LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany failed to do enough to avert the Wirecard fraud, the European Union's markets watchdog said on Tuesday as it delivered a highly critical verdict on the country’s handling of its biggest post-war corporate scam.
Wirecard's former Chief Executive Markus Braun and other executives have been held on suspicion of running a criminal racket that defrauded creditors of 3.2 billion euros ($3.73 billion).
Those accused, including Braun, deny any wrongdoing. 
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) began a fast-track review in July into how Germany's markets regulator BaFin and the country's accounting watchdog the Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel (FREP) enforced EU transparency rules governing company information for markets and investors.
ESMA said in a rare 190-page rebuke of another regulator that it found a number of deficiencies, inefficiencies and legal and procedural impediments relating to BaFin's independence from issuers and the Finance Ministry.
""For BaFin ... there is a heightened risk of influence by the Ministry of Finance given the frequency and detail of reporting to the MoF in the Wirecard case, in some cases before actions were taken,"" the ESMA report said.
German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told reporters he welcomed the report and that its recommendations were broadly in line with the government's action plan to address supervisory shortcomings highlighted by the Wirecard scandal.
""So I don’t look at this (report) as something critical,” Scholz added. 
There were deficiencies even though BaFin and FREP had adequate resources, though confidentiality requirements prevented them from sharing information, ESMA said.
BaFin's internal controls failed to pick up that some of its market abuse team were buying and selling Wirecard shares, ESMA noted.
Deputy finance minister Joerg Kukies told Reuters in October that it would ban watchdog staff from trading shares in companies it regulates following the scandal.
CRUSHING VERDICT 
Markus Ferber, a German member of the European Parliament, said the report was a ""crushing verdict"" on financial supervision under the oversight of Finance Minister Olaf Scholz. 
Wirecard, whose shares were included in Germany's index of blue chip companies, stunned markets in June when it said that 1.9 billion euros it had claimed to hold in accounts were missing.
The European Commission asked ESMA to undertake the review and will use the findings to determine if there is a need for more centralised EU supervision of markets to stop such scandals from happening again.
""The Wirecard case has once again highlighted that high-quality financial reporting is essential for maintaining investor trust in capital markets, and the need to have consistent and effective enforcement of that reporting across the European Union,"" ESMA Chair Steven Maijoor said in a statement.
In a response included in the ESMA report, BaFin said it disagrees that it should have demanded further examination of Wirecard's financial statements after allegations surfaced in the press.
""As long as BaFin has no specific indications that go beyond only public publications like press articles, BaFin cannot issue a report to the public prosecutor's office,"" the regulator said.
FREP said ESMA's findings are ""not supported by the evidence and explanations"" provided during the review and are ""distorted by hindsight bias"".
Fabio De Masi, an influential German lawmaker, said the report was a ""slap in the face"" for BaFin. 

Germany's coalition government in October agreed a package of reforms to financial and accounting rules aimed at avoiding another Wirecard scandal.

295,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 05:58AM ET</span>",StockBeat: European Stocks Likely to Do Better Under Biden - Up to a Point,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Consensus wisdom has it that the clarity of the election result in the U.S. tonight is just as important as the identity of the winner. But for European stock markets, which struggle to decouple from U.S. ones at the best of times, that rule probably only goes so far.
For sure, neither market is going to enjoy the sight of lawyers and parties haggling over which votes should be counted and which not in the event of a tight result. Nor can any good come of attempts to delegitimize the election in general by the Trump campaign ahead of time – or, indeed, of the violent protests that boarded-up storefronts seem to be anticipating in the case of Trump’s re-election.
One can make a case for higher risk premiums (and thus lower valuations) for U.S. equities whatever the outcome of the poll, given that the erosion of U.S. democracy, of its impartial institutions and its legal predictability, seems set to continue under the debilitating effects of social media in any case.
The U.S.’s governability has been taken for granted for decades. There is no immutable law that says it should be in future, especially under a president and a Supreme Court at odds with the majority of the population. The best hope for European equities is that any such volatility subsides quickly.
The idea that a Biden victory will be better for European stocks seems logical enough: Europe has had nothing but grief from Trump’s trade wars not just against itself, but against China, a major buyer of European capital goods and luxury items.
A Democratic establishment is more likely to pursue U.S. interests through a softer line, dropping threats of tariffs and possibly unblocking the World Trade Organization’s executive organs. The EU, like many others, needs the WTO to work for the smooth functioning of its trade with non-U.S. entities too (not least, as of January, the U.K.)  French luxury groups such as LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) should benefit, as should Airbus (PA:AIR) and the German automotive sector.
Likewise, the shift in U.S. energy policy under a Democratic administration toward renewables and re-entering the Paris Climate Accord could greatly expand market opportunities for utilities such as Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) and Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) (the latter of which just made a clear statement of intent with its acquisition of New Mexico-based PNM Resources (NYSE:PNM)), as well as turbine makers Vestas (OTC:VWDRY) and Siemens  Gamesa  (MC:SGREN).
And, as Berenberg Bank chief economist Holger Schmieding pointed out in a note to clients on Tuesday, a Democratic administration and Congress is more likely to steer the U.K. away from risking a chaotic end to the post-Brexit transition agreement, especially as regards keeping the Irish border open.
However, the issues that have plagued U.S.-EU commercial relations will not go away overnight. European countries remain determined to replace the tax revenues they have lost through the destruction of so many businesses by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and other Big Tech names, to whom many lawmakers in the next Congress will remain – directly or indirectly – personally indebted.  A Democratic establishment may also push Europe to take a harder line toward Russia, notably with regard to the still-incomplete Nord Stream 2 pipeline.  And with the U.S.-China relations seemingly permanently reset, the EU will have to make hard choices about where its sympathies and long-term interests lie – the kind of choices that the EU is not very good at. Expect that to be reflected in due course too, even under a mellifluous and avuncular President Biden."
296,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>","Bayer takes $10 billion writedown, flags higher Roundup settlement bill","By Ludwig Burger and Patricia Weiss
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGn) is facing a double hit from a higher legal bill for claims relating to weedkiller Roundup as well as 9.25 billion euros ($10.82 billion) in impairments on agriculture businesses, much of it related to its  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) deal.
The company said the write-downs, driven by weaker demand from farmers due to low biofuel prices, plus an increase of about $750 million in the costs of settlement terms with U.S. plaintiffs over Roundup, resulted in a loss before interest and tax of 9.4 billion euros in the third quarter.
Bayer was caught up in litigation over Roundup, based on the herbicide glyphosate, as a result of its 2018 takeover of Monsanto for about $63 billion, which made it the world's largest supplier of seeds and pesticides.
""The impact of the (coronavirus) pandemic is placing additional strain on our Crop Science Division. We are also facing negative currency effects,” Chief Financial Officer Wolfgang Nickl said.
Nickl said a massive depreciation of the Brazilian real was weighing heavily on business in the world’s second-largest agricultural market.
Bayer said it was unable to say what part of the impairment was attributable to legacy Monsanto businesses, saying only that two-thirds of the writedowns were due to currency and interest rate effects.
Bayer on Sept. 30 had predicted impairment charges in the mid to high-single-digit billion-euros range on agricultural assets and warned of a slight decline in 2021 core earnings per share.
Bayer struck an $11 billion outline agreement with U.S. plaintiffs' lawyers in June but a judge later took issue with a side arrangement on future cases that may yet be lodged, known as a class plan.
Addressing those concerns will prove about $750 million more costly, Bayer said on Tuesday.
Bayer said it was ""far enough along in the negotiations to know that the new plan will come in at approximately 2 billion U.S. dollars, an increase over the original cost of 1.25 billion U.S. dollars."" 
Bayer's shares were down 0.6% at 0850 GMT, marking a loss of 22% since Bayer first flagged write-downs and a likely decline in 2021 earnings on Sept 30.
""This situation confirms our belief that Crop Science is a business with low visibility,"" said Jean-Jacques Le Fur, an analyst at brokerage Bryan Garnier. He reiterated a ""sell"" recommendation, also citing uncertain Roundup litigation costs. 
The charges more than offset combined gains booked in the quarter from the sale of its Animal Health business to Elanco (N:ELAN) and the divestment of a stake in industrial park operator Currenta of 5 billion euros.
That resulted in a net loss of 2.7 billion euros compared with an average analyst projection of 1 billion euro in net income.
Bayer said that 88,500 of the 125,000 glyphosate claims in the class settlement have been agreed in principle and that it was hoping to make considerable progress over the next few months.

298,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 03:55AM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco third-quarter profit slumps 44.6% as pandemic chokes demand,"By Hadeel Al Sayegh and Rania El Gamal
DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian state oil giant Aramco (SE:2222) on Tuesday reported a 44.6% drop in third-quarter net profit as the coronavirus crisis continued to choke demand and weigh on crude prices. 
Share prices of global oil companies have been hammered this year as investors fret over the impact of the pandemic on energy demand and the long-term shift away from fossil fuels.
Oil prices have recovered only slightly since tumbling to their lowest in almost two decades in March, prompting Aramco and other majors such as Shell (L:RDSa) and  BP  Plc (L:BP) to slash capital expenditure this year and next. 
Weaker refining and chemicals margins also hit Aramco's net profit, which fell to 44.21 billion riyals ($11.79 billion) for the three months ended Sept. 30, in line with an analyst estimate of 44.6 billion riyals provided by Refinitiv but down from 79.84 billion riyals in the same period of last year.
""We saw early signs of a recovery in the third quarter due to improved economic activity, despite the headwinds facing global energy markets,""  Saudi Aramco  Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said in a statement.
Aramco's shares rose as much as 1% and were 0.6% higher at 34.4 riyals by 0830 GMT. Although down 2.3% year to date, Aramco has outperformed the likes of Exxon (N:XOM), BP and Shell, which are down by more than 50% while  Chevron  (N:CVX) is down by 40%.
Analysts say that is partly because of the broader performance of the Saudi stock market, on which Aramco is listed, but also because the company has guaranteed its dividend payment. 
Aramco said it would distribute a dividend of $18.75 billion for the quarter, in line with its plan to pay a base dividend of $75 billion for 2020.
But equity analyst Yousef Husseini at investment bank EFG-Hermes said Aramco would likely have to increase its debt financing in the short- to medium-term, or further cut capital expenditure, in order to be able to maintain the dividend unless oil prices recovered to at least $55 a barrel. 
Dividends from the world's top oil producing company, which went public last year, play a critical role in helping the Saudi government manage its fiscal deficit. 
Aramco's net profit almost doubled from 24.62 billion riyals in the second quarter, which the company attributed to higher oil prices, although it noted that was partly offset by a drop in volumes sold. 
Saudi Arabia has slashed its crude production since May under a global supply cut pact with OPEC and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, to support oil prices and demand.
Aramco had free cash flow of $12.4 billion in the third quarter, compared with $6.1 billion in the second quarter.

299,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 03:54AM ET</span>",Ant Group Trades at 50% Premium in Hong Kong Gray Market,"(Bloomberg) -- A rare move by China’s top regulators to rein in Ant Group Co.’s expansion plans hasn’t curbed interest in the fintech stock, which continues to trade at a 50% premium ahead of its debut this week.
Institutional investors bought shares at about HK$120 ($15.50) apiece in gray-market trading for a second day Tuesday, compared with the listing price of HK$80, according to people familiar with the transactions. They declined to be identified discussing private matters.
The preliminary trading suggests investors aren’t put off by a warning from China’s regulators that Jack Ma’s firm faces increased scrutiny and will be subject to the same restrictions on capital and leverage as banks. Ma, Ant’s billionaire co-founder, was summoned to a rare joint meeting on Monday with the country’s central bank and three other top financial regulators.
Anticipated Debut
Ant’s initial public offering is the most anticipated in years, attracting at least $3 trillion in orders for its dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai ahead of its trading debut on Nov. 5. The stampede for shares is fueling predictions of a first-day pop, even as skeptics warn of risks including the U.S. elections, tightening regulations in China and rising Covid-19 infections worldwide.
“It’s pretty extraordinary given the backdrop and it shows you how much Asia is decoupling from the United States,” said Gary Dugan, chief executive officer of the Global CIO Office in Singapore, which didn’t take part in the IPO.
In a so-called gray market, investors can bid for new shares before they officially start trading on a stock exchange. The over-the-counter mechanism is often seen as an early indicator of investor demand for an IPO. Individual buyers will be able to trade through a similar channel on Wednesday in Hong Kong.
The fintech company’s $34.5 billion IPO gives it a market value of about $315 billion based on filings, bigger than JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and four times larger than  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). The sale vaults Ma’s fortune to $71.6 billion, topping the Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. heirs.
The IPO surpasses Saudi Aramco’s record $29 billion sale last year, and the $25 billion raised by Ma’s  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. in 2014. Ant priced its Shanghai stock at 68.8 yuan ($10.27) apiece. The company may raise another $5.17 billion if it exercises the option to sell additional shares to meet demand, known as the greenshoe.
The IPO is attracting interest from some of the world’s biggest money managers, and sparking a frenzy among individual investors in China clamoring for a piece of the sale. In the preliminary price consultation of its Shanghai IPO, institutional investors subscribed for over 76 billion shares, more than 284 times the initial offering tranche, according to Ant’s Shanghai offering.
“The market’s infatuation with growth stocks is very strong at the moment,” said Arnout van Rijn, chief investment officer for Asia-Pacific at Robeco. With many investors betting China’s domestic economy will be sheltered from the trade war with the U.S., “it’s not surprising that there’s more demand than supply for a stock like this.”
Elderly Club
Ant has faced censure in Chinese state media in recent days after Ma criticized local and global regulators for stifling innovation and not paying sufficient heed to development and opportunities for the young. At a Shanghai conference late last month, he compared the Basel Accords, which set out capital requirements for banks, to a club for the elderly.
“Good innovation is not afraid of regulation, but is afraid of outdated regulation,” Ma said. “We shouldn’t use the way to manage a train station to regulate an airport, neither should we regulate the future with the method from yesterday.”
Opinion pieces in official newspapers -- including those run by the central bank and banking watchdog -- have faulted Ant for straying from its core payments business and called out big tech for misleading users to consume beyond their means.
Ant said in a statement late Monday it will “implement the meeting opinions in depth” and follow guidelines including stable innovation, an embrace of supervision and service to the real economy.
Ant was formed when Alibaba launched the Alipay payments app in 2004 as an escrow service for buyers and sellers on Ma’s e-commerce website. In 2013, users were given the ability to save money and earn interest on the balances stored on their accounts. The firm then started offering credit to small businesses, branching out from its consumer-finance focus.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Tuesday, helped by some positive corporate news as well as investors looking for a more predictable U.S. political climate as the contentious presidential election campaign comes to an end.
At 4:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.8%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 1%.
The earnings season in Europe continued apace Tuesday, with BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) leading the way. Its stock rose 5.6% after the French bank beat market expectations on Tuesday on the back of a solid performance in its investment banking unit.
Additionally, IWG (LON:IWG) stock rose 7.2% after the U.K.-based office space provider reported an improvement in sales activity after being hit hard by the pandemic causing many companies to implement work-from-home policies.
 Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) stock rose 2.8% after the German retailer reported a profit in the third quarter, as cost-cutting offset a decline in sales.
On the flip side, Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) stock fell 1.3% after the pharmaceutical giant took impairment charges of 9.25 billion euros ($10.79 billion) and said that it would have to pay even more to settle claims that its Roundup weedkiller causes cancer.
Still, most attention will be on the U.S. presidential election, to decide whether President Donald Trump or Democratic rival Joe Biden will occupy the White House for the next four years. The latest surveys suggest Biden has a substantial lead nationally, but the polling in several of the key swing states looks a lot closer. 
Investors are looking for clarity after a contentious campaign. However, a winner may not be declared for several days, owing to mail-in vote counting. And that declaration might still be contested in court.
Meanwhile, the French government is set to reimpose an evening curfew on Paris, to tackle worsening Covid-19 figures. European leaders are desperately trying to halt the surge in the virus before the Christmas holiday season. The U.K., France, Italy and Germany, among others, have introduced partial shutdowns in the last few days.
Aside from the U.S. political developments, investors are braced for an eventful week with central bank meetings by the Federal Reserve and Bank of England, as well as the release of U.S. jobs data for October.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, helped by Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak meeting with the top managers of Russian oil companies to discuss a possible rolling over of oil output restrictions into 2021.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, including Russia, are due to increase supply by two million barrels per day in January, but are now under pressure to look at this decision due to the weak nature of the crude market.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $36.98 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.3% to $39.07.
Elsewhere, gold futures were flat to $1,892.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% higher at 1.1684.

301,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>",China's Ant expected to double on debut amid pent-up retail demand: fund managers,"By Samuel Shen and Julie Zhu
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's  Ant Group  is expected to double its market value on debut, as unmet demand from mom-and-pop investors and an impending inclusion in major global indexes could offset worries about tighter regulations, fund managers said.
The fintech giant will be listed in Hong Kong and Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market on Thursday following its record $37 billion IPO, which attracted from retail investors alone a bid value equivalent to Britain's GDP.
The IPO values Ant (HK:6688) (SS:688688), a spinoff from Jack Ma's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group (HK:9988), at about $315 billion. The combined market cap of JPMorgan (N:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS),  Citigroup  (N:C) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS) is $548 billion.
""Ant will be the market's icon,"" said fund manager Zhang Yingbiao from Shenzhen Longteng Huijin Fund Management Co, which bought Ant's IPO shares via a bidding process.
The stock is expected to more than double in Shanghai on its debut due to its ""uniqueness"", but the listing could ""suck blood and steal the limelight"" from the rest of the market with heavy first-day turnover, he said.
Ant, China's dominant mobile payments firm that also offers loans, insurance and asset management, presents itself mainly as a technology vendor for financial institutions, but financial regulators say the firm remains under their purview. 
The Hangzhou-based giant is benefiting from the richer valuations the market affords to tech firms than to financial institutions, analysts say.
For many fund managers in China, Ant stock is a ""must-have"" given its ""huge growth potential"", said Zhong Daqi, founding partner of Guangzhou Zeyuan Investment Management Co, which expects Ant to rise as much as 150% on debut in Shanghai.
Large issuances typically curb a stock's first-day rally on STAR, where debut gains average about 160%, but a long queue of retail investors who missed out during the Ant IPO process could test that, Zhong noted. The Shanghai tranche of the IPO was heavily skewed toward strategic and institutional investors.
""Ant represents the future of banking, and is a disruptive force,"" said Zeng Qiang, a retail investor who plans to buy shares on the secondary market. 
""It's no longer a catfish. It's a whale.""
INDEX HOPES, REGULATORY WORRIES
Expectations that Ant shares will be included in major stock indexes are further burnishing their appeal.
Global index publisher FTSE Russell expects to include Ant's Hong Kong-traded shares in relevant FTSE indexes at the close of Nov. 11 in ""fast entry"". 
MSCI intends to add Ant's Hong Kong and Shanghai-listed shares to relevant indexes as of end-Nov. 30. 
Ant will likely also be added to other indexes over the next several weeks, such as Hong Kong's Hang Seng and China's CSI indexes, said Brendan Ahern, Chief Investment Officer at Krane Funds Advisors.
Its market debut comes against the backdrop of the U.S. presidential election, which could increase market volatility, and tighter regulatory scrutiny.
Just ahead of Ant's listing, Chinese finance regulators held talks with Ant leaders, including billionaire founder Ma, as China unveiled new draft rules for online micro-lending, widely seen as targeting Ant's aggressive expansion.

Ant's growth potential could be capped by increasing regulatory scrutiny and saturation of the payment market, said Zhang Long, fund manager at Eastern Zeging (Xiamen) Asset Management Co. ""Market expectation is too high for Ant.""

302,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 03:20AM ET</span>",Analysis: Barriers to China-U.S. investments could outlast Trump,"By Kane Wu and Echo Wang
HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump raised barriers for Chinese companies seeking to invest or raise money in the United States that will have a lasting impact even if he does not win a second term, according to dealmakers and policy experts.
Chinese acquisitions of U.S. companies dropped to $1.86 billion last year, a tiny fraction of the $61 billion they totaled in 2016, when they were at their peak right before Trump came into office, according to Refinitiv data. 
Chinese venture capital investments into the United States, which peaked in 2016 at nearly $15.7 billion, totaled just $6.7 billion as of Oct. 27, according to PitchBook data.
Foreign direct investment from China into the United States has declined by 90% to $4.7 billion so far this year compared to 2016, according to the Rhodium Group.
Much of this is the result of Trump's policies. The United States blocked many Chinese acquisitions, especially of U.S. technology firms, on national security grounds, and even ordered some Chinese firms such as the owners of social media apps TikTok and Grindr to divest them. U.S. stock exchanges raised their listing standards after many investors got burnt in auditing scandals involving Chinese firms, including coffee chain operator  Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY). And Chinese nationals found it harder to secure U.S. work permits. 
This trend could continue, even if China-U.S. tensions over hot-button issues such as trade and the future of Hong Kong eased, dealmakers say. This is because concerns about corporate China abusing its technologic prowess and misleading investors are shared by both Republican and Democratic U.S. lawmakers.
""The United States no longer views China as a partner, but an enemy and a threat... America has become very unfriendly soil to anything Chinese,"" said Fred Hu, chairman of Chinese private equity firm Primavera Capital Group, which has investments in U.S. companies. He added that U.S.-China relations were unlikely to improve in the short term.
Under Trump, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes deals for potential national security risks, toughened its stance on Chinese companies. 
CFIUS reviews are confidential, and the secretive government panel does not disclose how many deals it blocks each year. But in its annual reports to the U.S. Congress, CFIUS has revealed its heightened scrutiny of Chinese deals; it reviewed 140 deal applications by Chinese acquirers in the first three years of the Trump administration, more than those from any other country, compared to 20 such applications in the first three years of Barack Obama's administration. This is despite Chinese applications with CFIUS for U.S. deals declining from 60 in 2017 to 25 in 2019.
Among the deals that CFIUS blocked under Trump were Chinese financial technology giant Ant Group's $1.2 billion acquisition of U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc (O:MGI) and China-based semiconductor investment fund Unic Capital Management's $580 million acquisition of U.S. semiconductor testing equipment company Xcerra Corp. Some Chinese acquirers also abandoned their U.S. acquisitions before CFIUS blocked them.
""CFIUS has brought great changes for Chinese firms' overseas acquisitions, in the tech sector especially,"" said Peter Kuo, a partner in China-backed private equity fund Canyon Bridge, whose attempted $1.3 billion acquisition of U.S. chip maker Lattice (OTC:LTTC) Semiconductor Corp (O:LSCC) was thwarted by CFIUS in 2017. The fund is now focused on investing in Chinese companies.
The U.S. crackdown spilled over into venture capital investments. Many Chinese venture funds and some state-backed ones, who flooded into Silicon Valley several years ago in the search for reasonably valued unicorns, left the U.S. in the last couple years, as CFIUS also scrutinized sizeable minority stake investments. Some Chinese investors into U.S. venture capital firms also retreated.
""Now we have zero Chinese investors in our fund,"" said Edith Yeung, general partner of Silicon Valley-based venture capital fund RaceCapital. She said she had to reject many Chinese investors from her fund due to the regulatory risk. 
IPO SCRUTINY
Trump said this year he was also looking ""very strongly"" at the possibility of delisting Chinese companies that do not comply with U.S. accounting standards from U.S. exchanges, but did not follow through on that threat.
While the total value of Chinese companies listing in New York has reached $2.5 trillion so far this year - almost double the total four years ago before Trump came into office - Nasdaq has updated its rules to make it more difficult for small Chinese firms to float on their exchanges.
As a result, only five Chinese IPOs under $25 million landed in New York this year, compared to nine last year. 
Policy experts said deep U.S. suspicion of China's economic power, technological advances and accounting standards will likely result in many of the hurdles to cross-border investments remaining in place even if Trump's Democratic challenger Joe Biden succeeds him in January.

""Our take is that the U.S. containment on China is bipartisan,"" Natixis economists wrote in a note last week.

303,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 03:15AM ET</span>",Standard Life Aberdeen to toughen engagement process after Boohoo scandal,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Asset manager  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Aberdeen has overhauled its company engagement process after being burnt by a scandal at fast-fashion retailer  Boohoo  (L:BOOH) over allegations of poor working conditions at some of the company's suppliers earlier this year.
Boohoo's shares slumped in July after allegations that workers were being paid less than the minimum wage at some of the company's suppliers.
Boohoo in September accepted all the recommendations of an independent review, which found several failings in its supply chain.
Standard Life Aberdeen, which had previously been one of Boohoo's largest investors, subsequently sold out after describing the company's response to the allegations as ""inadequate"".
Aberdeen Standard Investments' Global Head of Stewardship Euan Stirling said the experience had been ""painful"", particularly after his team had engaged heavily with Boohoo.
""What we had been doing over the period was not just sitting idly by and counting the pennies as they rolled in,"" Stirling, speaking at Reuters ESG Europe conference on Tuesday, said.
""We had been making quite significant demands of the company and of specific executives in providing us and the board with assurance over their supply chain, and encouraging them quite forcefully to adopt stronger industry-led practices.""
As a result of the experience, Stirling said he had decided to change the process for key engagements going forward.
Institutional investors use ""engagements"" to talk to companies they invest in about a range of issues, including corporate governance. 
""We're trying to now make them more rigorous; specific milestones set out at the beginning of an engagement programme, timelines associated with that and (then) looking for specific outcomes as well,"" he said.
""It's a significant development in the way that we engage,"" he said, adding it would apply to companies where ASI had significant concerns or in which it had a large equity or debt holding which could be materially impacted by the issue in question.

By using milestones, Stirling said the company would be able to determine when and how to escalate the engagement, with the ultimate option being, as with Boohoo, to sell out.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Tuesday, as investors welcome the end to a contentious U.S. presidential election campaign and hope for an end to political uncertainty.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.5% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.8% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.7%. 
Polls open Tuesday, although nearly 100 million voters have already cast their ballots, to decide whether President Donald Trump or Democratic rival Joe Biden will occupy the White House for the next four years. The latest surveys suggest Biden has a substantial lead nationally, but the polling in several of the key swing states looks a lot closer. 
“Assuming the opinion polls are correct and Joe Biden wins a convincing victory with the Democrats retaining the House of Representatives and gaining control of the Senate this is likely to be the scenario that delivers the swiftest, most aggressive fiscal stimulus,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
However, the picture may not be this clear as a winner may not be declared for several days, owing to mail-in vote counting. And that declaration might still be contested in court.
Meanwhile, Italy became the latest European country to introduce tougher containment measures to take on the spread of the Covid-19 virus, including curbs on travel between the worst-hit regions and a nighttime curfew.
European leaders are desperately trying to halt the surge in the virus before the Christmas holiday season. The U.K., France and Germany, among others, have introduced partial shutdowns in the last few days.
Aside from the U.S. political developments, investors are braced for an eventful week with central bank meetings by the Federal Reserve and Bank of England, as well as the release of U.S. jobs data for October.

307,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 01:25AM ET</span>",Analysis: Investors brace for another wild ride on U.S. Election Night,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - On Tuesday night, James McDonald plans to sit among 19 computer screens in his Los Angeles office, waiting for the right moment to pounce on what he hopes will be one of his most profitable trades of the year.
That moment will come when the winner of the U.S. election becomes clear, he said.
The chief executive of hedge fund Hercules Investments has set up a trading strategy geared to benefit from a momentary spike in volatility he believes will occur when investors adjust their positions in response to the election result. 
Those kinds of gyrations are just the thing that Salem Abraham, president of Abraham Trading Company, is seeking to guard his portfolio against. A ranch owner and fund manager based in Canadian, Texas, Abraham plans to keep two of his firm's traders on the phone as he watches the election results from home, ready to pare back on U.S. stock futures if markets appear set for a plunge.
With the market swings that followed President Donald Trump's unexpected victory in 2016 still fresh in investors' minds, many have spent the last several weeks reducing their exposure across assets and hedging their portfolios against post-election volatility, while a few have developed strategies that could produce handsome profits - provided they work.
""This is one of the biggest events of the year,"" said Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC. ""The uncertainty here makes the trading interesting.""
On the night of Nov. 8, 2016, U.S. stock futures dropped as much as 5%, the Mexican peso sold off and haven assets such as gold rallied as investors scrambled to reposition their portfolio for a Trump presidency. 
The following day, however, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained more than 1% while the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" plunged more than 7 points from its session high of 21.48. 
A night of sharp market moves would suit McDonald just fine. His strategy involves long and short positions on futures on the S&P 500 (SPX) (ESc1) and the Nasdaq-100 Volatility Index <.VOLQ> . As the election results become clear, he expects that half of his investment will produce outsized gains even if the remainder incurs losses, which he seeks to limit using stop-loss orders.
""There's a big profit opportunity once we know who the president is,"" McDonald said. ""We want to capitalize on that big inflection.""

CLOUDY OUTCOMES
Others have prepared strategies that could benefit should volatility persist into Wednesday's trading. 
EAB Investment Group has recommended options strategies on credit and currency exchange-traded funds for clients, said Arnim Holzer, the firm's macro and correlation defense strategist. Should the race appear tight in battleground states such as Florida and Pennsylvania, he expects high-yield bonds to underperform and the yen and Swiss franc to rally.
Analysts at TD Securities estimate the S&P 500 could climb 3% and 10-year Treasury yields could rise 15 basis points on Wednesday if Democratic nominee Joe Biden wins the presidency and his party wins 51 seats in the Senate, while the benchmark index could rise 1% and 10-year yields drop 10 basis points if Trump wins and Republicans keep control of the Senate.
An unclear election outcome, however, could result in more severe moves that day, with the S&P 500 tumbling as much as 5%and yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note falling by 15 basis points. 
Some investors will seek to add to their favored positions should asset prices fall. 
Garvin Jabusch, chief investment officer of Green Alpha Advisors, raised his cash allocation in order to add to holdings of renewable energy shares should they pull back. Clean energy stocks have soared in the past two months, mirroring Biden's lead in polls.
""We're keeping some dry powder to buy back those bargains,"" Jabusch said.
Yet some are wary of jumping into the market immediately after the election.
Mike Zigmont, head of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management, said he had temporarily sold off his portfolio, which includes short options positions, in order to bypass any market whiplash. 

""This particular event is so wrapped up in emotion and so complicated and so cloudy that it throws all kinds of risk into the mix that we just don't usually come across,"" Zigmont said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday said Philadelphia and Baltimore may sue eight big banks for allegedly conspiring to force state and local governments to pay inflated interest rates on a popular type of tax-exempt municipal bond.
U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said the cities may pursue antitrust claims in the proposed class action over the banks' marketing of variable-rate demand obligations, once a more than $400 billion market, from 2008 to 2016.
Philadelphia and Baltimore said the collusion reduced available funding for hospitals, power and water supplies, schools, transportation and other essential municipal services.
The defendants included affiliates of Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), Royal Bank of Canada (TO:RY) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC).
VRDOs are long-term bonds with short-term interest rates that typically reset weekly. Investors may redeem the bonds early, and banks must remarket those bonds to other investors at the lowest possible rates.
Philadelphia and Baltimore, which issued a respective $1.67 billion and $261 million of VRDOs, accused the banks of sharing proprietary information about bond inventories and planned rate changes.
They said this dissuaded redemptions, and enabled the banks to charge hundreds of millions of dollars in remarketing and service fees for ""effectively doing nothing.""
In his 34-page decision, Furman said the cities offered ""reason to believe that defendants stood to gain by participating in the rate-fixing scheme and that the scheme was possible only with defendants' coordinated efforts.""
Furman also said six banks must face breach of contract claims. He dismissed all claims of unjust enrichment.
The banks declined to comment or had no immediate comment.
Diana Cortes, a lawyer for the City of Philadelphia Law Department, said the plaintiffs were pleased Furman upheld their ""core"" antitrust and contract claims.
The VRDO market exceeded $400 billion in 2009 but has shrunk. S&P Global Ratings recently rated $144.9 billion of the securities.

The case is Philadelphia et al v Bank of America Corp et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-01608.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were up on Tuesday morning, with all eyes on U.S. as the presidential election starts later in the day. Stocks saw gains during the Asian session despite the possibility of a contested election, alluded to by both Democrat candidate Joe Biden and incumbent President Donald Trump.
“It’s pretty much a binary outcome … the question is, is the market right now looking at a Biden victory? And will it be disappointed if we don’t have that?” Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) chief market strategist Quincy Krosby told Bloomberg.
A contested U.S. election could also introduce volatility to the market. Although Biden is ahead of Trump in the polls, votes from swing states could lead to a closer race.
“Uncertainty will likely remain until Wednesday morning when we should have clarity on who holds the Presidency and Senate, assuming, and this is a big if, the polls are correct,” Nordea Investment Funds SA senior macro strategist Sebastien Galy said in a note.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Signs that people are moving away from Tokyo, as telecommuting becomes the norm for many business amid the COVID-19 pandemic, have put property investors on edge and pushed Japan's real estate investment trust (REIT) index to five-month lows.
Although Japan's total population has been dropping since 2009, capital Tokyo has defied the trend, attracting young workers from all over the country.
But data from the Tokyo metropolitan government shows the city's population dropped by around 10,700 in October to 13.971 million, its fourth decline in five months.
""We have expected Tokyo's daytime population to shrink over time but we did not think such a change would take place that quickly,"" said Kazufumi Takeuchi, senior analyst at UBS.

Tokyo's population had reached 14 million this year, from about 12 million in 2000, spurring property demand.
But signs of a drop in population is putting pressure on REITs, researcher Makoto Sakuma from NLI Research Institute said. Pricey properties in Tokyo make up the core part of portfolio for many REITs.
Japan's main REIT index (TREIT) fell to a five-month low last Thursday. It is down 23.5% for the year, while the broader index (N225) has recovered its pandemic losses.
Graphic: Japan REIT index - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjpqazwrpx/201103B.png
Analysts say people are moving to suburbs instead of staying near office as they work from home amid virus-related curbs.
House prices have not come down yet ""but as more people work from home, the demand is weakening especially for a tiny one-room residence where you just go back to sleep"", Sakuma said.
 Advance Residence  Investment (T:3269), a residential REIT, said its occupancy rate dropped in September, a month that typically sees a rise as Japanese companies tend to move staff ahead of the start of the financial half year in October.
Signs of exodus from Tokyo could put pressure on offices, key assets of Japan's 12 trillion yen ($115 billion) REITs.
""Now that companies have realised people can work outside the office, if they are forced to choose between cutting costs on office or labour, I think most ... will cut office first,"" said Akihiko Murai, portfolio manager, Fidelity International.
""So if there is an economic downturn of the same magnitude as the previous one, the damage on the office sector would be larger. The financial industry may be a bit too optimistic because it isn't the worst affected sector this time.""

The meeting comes after Ma questioned whether international financial regulations are suitable for the Chinese economy at a summit held in Shanghai at the end of October.
Ant, backed by  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) (HK:9988), is China's dominant mobile payments firm, also offering loans, insurance and asset management, and is set to raise about $34.4 billion in the world's largest initial public offering. 
The People's Bank of China, China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and foreign exchange regulator held the talks with Ant's controlling shareholder Ma, its Executive Chairman Eric Jing and Chief Executive Simon Hu, CSRC said in a statement, without giving details.
An Ant spokeswoman said the company would ""implement the meeting opinions in depth"".
Draft micro-lending rules, published separately by the central bank and banking regulator, set a 5 billion yuan ($748 million) registered capital threshold for micro-lenders that offer loans online across different regions.
While it made no mention of Ant, the draft comes as regulators sharpen their focus on banks that heavily use micro-lenders or third-party technology platforms like Ant for underwriting consumer loans, amid fears of rising defaults and deteriorating asset quality in a pandemic-hit economy.
The draft is open for public feedback until Dec. 2.
Guo Wuping, head of the consumer protection division at the banking regulator said in a Monday commentary in the 21st Century Business Herald that the rights of users of Ant-owned consumer loan companies Huabei and Jiebei deserve close scrutiny.
Guo in the commentary said such fintech loan companies effectively perform the functions of banks and should adopt similar risk controls.
New methods of financing and disorderly competition has created ""chaos that violates the rights and interests of financial consumers,"" Guo said in the commentary.

China's Financial Stability and Development Committee, a cabinet-level body headed by Vice Premier Liu He, on Sunday flagged risks associated with the rapid development of fintech, in what was widely interpreted as a government response to the rise of players like Ant.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The union representing pilots at Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) on Monday urged U.S. regulators to simplify the procedure recommended to address an emergency that can force down the nose down of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, an issue in both of two fatal crashes and the plane's grounding.
Monday was the deadline for submitting public comments to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which on Oct. 6 released a draft report on revised training procedures for the MAX that has been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes killed 346 people.
The FAA proposal adds new training requirements to deal with a safety system called MCAS tied to both fatal crashes.
Separately, the families of many victims of the March 2019 Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 737 MAX crash opposed the training changes as ""inadequate.""
The families called the changes ""insufficient to ensure that 737 MAX pilots are properly equipped to handle all MCAS-related emergencies and prepared to serve as the last line of defense against another tragedy.""
The FAA is requiring new safeguards to MCAS, including requiring it receive data from two sensors, before it allows the 737 MAX to return to service.
Pilots will undergo new simulator training before they can resume flights, including training on multiple flight deck alerts during unusual conditions along with how to respond to a runaway stabilizer with timely pilot actions required.
In both crashes, pilots grappled with Boeing’s flawed MCAS flight control system, which repeatedly forced down the jet’s nose, and multiple audio and visual warnings.
The Southwest pilots union said the revisions to the runaway stabilizer procedure should be simplified.
The union added ""error rates increase exponentially with a
checklist containing eight memory steps including three conditional steps."" After testing the checklist in a MAX ""simulator"" the union ""found it difficult to recall the steps in order, and furthermore find this checklist is 'clunky at best.'""
The union recommends redesigning the procedure.
The British Airline Pilots Association proposed changes including requiring all five MAX special flight training elements be conducted in a MAX full-flight simulator, instead of allowing some in a 737-NG simulator.
The Allied Pilots Association recommend reducing intervals for recurrent training on runaway stabilizer from 36 months to 24 months.
Boeing declined to comment. An FAA spokesman said the agency ""will evaluate all the comments we receive.""
Reuters reported earlier the FAA could unground the MAX as early as mid-November.

LONDON (Reuters) - Donald Trump's campaign slogan in 2016 could have been 'build the Wall Street’, but a scan across global markets throws up plenty of surprises, especially in the emerging economies that have been in Trump's cross-hairs. 
While the numbers may have been exaggerated by this year's COVID-19 crisis, most analysts agree that Trump's tax cuts, combined with low interest rates and the online boom, have made Wall Street a winner over the last four years.
UniCredit's chief economist, Erik Nielsen, highlights how the S&P 500 (SPX) has delivered a 65% total return over Trump's term compared with a dismal 14% for Europe's STOXX 600 (STOXX). 
Boosted by the pandemic this year, the tech-skewed Nasdaq has done even better. It is up a whopping 110%, led by a stratospheric 285% leap by the 'FAANGs' quartet of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), that has also driven the value of world stocks up $15 trillion.
Wall Street's run has been ""impressive"" said Hans Peterson, global head of asset allocation at SEB investment management. 
Trump's tax cuts have helped somewhat, ""though it has really been a combination of things that have worked for American companies"", such as low rates and business models that have led to stronger earnings, he said.
For a graphic on Global markets since Trump's election:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprxazdpe/Pasted%20image%201604321715307.png
The other star market of Trump's presidency, however, is certainly not linked to his policies.
MSCI's China equity index has jumped the same 65% as Wall Street, thanks to its own tech titans and Beijing's stimulus that offset the hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. trade tariffs the agitating White House has put in place.
China's currency, the yuan , is also fractionally higher than where it was in November 2016, and the growth of the country's bond markets has seen its government debt join one of the world's most coveted bond indices.
Other emerging markets that were initially in Trump's cross-hairs have had a much rougher ride, although in many cases it has been COVID-19 that has done the real damage, as has been the case with oil (LCOc1) and commodity markets.
Mexico's peso , which slumped nearly 8% the day Trump was elected in 2016, is now down nearly 13%. But it was up nearly 15% from those lows before the pandemic struck, even though the NAFTA trade deal had been shredded and parts of Trump's ""big beautiful wall"" had gone up. 
Turkey's lira , which came under scrutiny when Ankara was buying Russian-made defence missiles, has collapsed more than 60 percent, though its domestic strains have been the bigger problem.
In contrast, Russia's rouble  had been up until Trump's Democrat rival, Joe Biden, who is expected to take a tougher line on Moscow, began opening a lead in the polls.

WALLS AND WORRIES
The moves have cascaded through EM equity and debt markets too. Russian stocks are exactly where they were back in 2016 in dollar terms, whereas Mexico's and Turkey's equivalent indexes are down 35% and 55% respectively.
Russian dollar-denominated bonds have made holders a stellar 33% total return over the last four years despite various wobbles around sanctions and investigations of Trump's links to Moscow. 
That is better than the near 20% return on U.S. Treasuries, German bunds and corporate credit, roughly the same as Japan's stock market (N225), albeit not as much as the near 50% leap for safe-haven gold .
""It (Russia) has been one of best fiscal stories out there,"" said Aberdeen Standard Investment portfolio manager Viktor Szabo. 
But ""over the past couple of days the rouble's performance has been even worse than the lira's, which is saying something,"" he added, linking it to the concerns over Biden's stance. 
Venezuela's bonds are at the opposite end of the spectrum. 
They have shown some signs of life in recent weeks after becoming almost worthless after Trump's administration sanctioned https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-markets-jpmorgan/jp-morgan-cuts-venezuela-debt-from-popular-bond-benchmarks-idUKKCN1U41KX them in early 2019 in a bid to force President Nicolas Maduro and his allies from power.
Mexico's peso has also been climbing again, on hopes that it will not face the same kind of border worries should Biden win. 
""With these U.S. elections, not all emerging markets are the same,"" said Manik Narain, head of EM strategy at UBS.

316,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 04:40PM ET</span>",Hedge funds raise Canadian energy shorts ahead of U.S. election,"By Maiya Keidan
TORONTO (Reuters) - Hedge funds upped bets against Canadian energy companies in the run-up to Tuesday's U.S. presidential election, regulatory filings reviewed by Reuters showed.
Market participants have speculated energy stocks could fall if Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden wins the race against incumbent President Donald Trump.
Biden has laid out a series of plans for the environment, which include a desire to ""transition from the oil industry,"" words that ricocheted across Canada as the world's fourth-largest crude producer and major exporter to its neighbour south of the border.
""There is a sense that there is a greater chance of a Biden win,"" said Rob Romero, portfolio manager at Connective Capital. 
""I do think Biden would promote a more interventionist policy into the economy, favoring renewable energy, so demand for Canadian energy could be challenged.""
""For example, gas and liquids pipeline projects would receive less support, and enforcement of environmental regulation would be increased."" 
The number of short trades as a percentage of total traded volume for  Imperial Oil Ltd  (TO:IMO) rose to approximately 49% for the second half of October, from approximately 36.5% for the first half of October, regulatory filings showed. 
 Cenovus Energy  Inc (TO:CVE) saw an increase to 39.3%, from 36.5%, over the same period, while the number rose in Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources Ltd (TO:CNQ) to 26.2%, from 25.6%, according to the data.
That compared with 35.6% for Imperial Oil between Sept. 16 and Oct. 1 and 27.1% for Cenovus and 20.4% in  Canadian Natural Resources  over the same period.
The energy sub-index (SPTTEN) has fallen 55% since Jan. 1.
Hedge funds typically engage in the practice of short-selling by borrowing a stock from an institutional investor, such as a pension fund, and selling it back at a lower price when shares fall, pocketing the difference.
A Biden win is expected to benefit the cannabis sector as vice president pick Kamala Harris has promised the Democratic party will decriminalize marijuana at the federal level. Some investors expect such a move to benefit U.S. weed companies more than the Canadian producers.
The number of short trades as a percentage of total traded volume rose in Canada’s No. 2 marijuana producer  Aurora Cannabis  Inc (TO:ACB),  Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC) Corp (TO:WEED) and  Aphria Inc  (TO:APHA) in the run-up to the election.
Biden has also pledged to rescind the presidential permit for Keystone XL, a heavy oil pipeline TC Energy Corp (TO:TRP) has sought to build for more than a decade.

However, short trades in TC Energy most recently fell to 21.2%, from 36.6% last month.

Investing.com - Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) reported Monday third-quarter earnings that met expectations and revenue that topped estimates on elevated demand in developed markets and improved quarterly performance in emerging markets.
Mondelez shares fell 1.4% in after-hours trade following the report.
Mondelez announced earnings  per share of $0.63 on revenue of $6.67B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.63 on revenue of $6.49B.
""Our third quarter performance was strong across all key metrics, with broad-based revenue growth as demand remained elevated in Developed Markets and sequentially improved in Emerging Markets,"" the company said.
Gross profit margin increased 20 basis points to 39.9%, underpinned by volume leverage, pricing and productivity, though partially offset by higher raw material costs and incremental Covid-19 related costs, the company said.
Looking ahead to full-year 2020, Mondelez guided organic net revenue to rise 3.5% and adjusted EPS to grow 5% on a constant-currency basis. The currency translation is forecast to lower 2020 net revenue growth by approximately 3% with a negative $0.04 impact to adjusted EPS.

318,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 04:35PM ET</span>",Wall Street rises but market braced for choppy week on eve of U.S. election,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P closed higher on Monday with the Nasdaq posting slimmer gains on the eve of the U.S. presidential election, as investors girded for what could be big market swings this week. 
Last week all three indexes notched their biggest weekly decline since March, and this week market participants largely expected short-term volatility and the likelihood of major long-term policy shifts related to taxes, government spending, trade and regulation. The longer-term moves will depend on whether Republican President Donald Trump or his Democratic challenger Joe Biden wins the White House race.
Biden leads in national opinion polls, but races are tight in battleground states that could tip the election to Trump. Analysts said the outcome most likely to shake equity markets in the near term would be no clear winner on Tuesday night. 
While the Dow and S&P were on the plus side, they ended well off session highs, and the Nasdaq dipped for awhile into the red as mega-cap technology and tech-related names struggled to gain traction after slumping in the prior week. 
Growth stocks (RLG) rose 0.54%, but were soundly outperformed by beaten-down value names, which tend to provide better returns coming out of a recession. The Russell 100 value index (RLV) jumped 1.92% to notch its biggest daily percentage gain in nearly five months. 
""It is hard to say whether this is sector rotation, an institutional driven event today or traders speculating on what might happen tomorrow,"" said Peter Giacchi, Head of DMM Floor Trading at Citadel Securities in New York.
""The longer this plays out over the course of the week, if it takes that long, the more volatility we could expect."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 423.45 points, or 1.6%, to 26,925.05, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 40.28 points, or 1.23%, to 3,310.24 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 46.02 points, or 0.42%, to 10,957.61.
Investors betting on a Biden administration, which is expected to deliver a massive fiscal stimulus and promote green energy, have fueled a rally in solar stocks, industrials and small-cap names in recent weeks.
On the other hand, JP Morgan has listed Bank of America (N:BAC),  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) and  Citigroup  (N:C) in its ""Trump basket"" of stocks. The S&P banks index <.SPXBK> added 2.27%. 
Energy (SPNY), materials (SPLRCM) and industrials (SPLRCI) enjoyed the sharpest percentage gains among major S&P sectors, climbing more than 2.7%. 
The S&P 500 ended a turbulent week at near six-week lows on Friday, after quarterly reports from technology mega-caps failed to impress and as coronavirus cases surged in the United States and Europe. The weekly percentage drop was the largest since late March, which marked the end of a selloff that sent the benchmark index into a bear market, or drop of more than 20% from a high. 
The CBOE volatility index (VIX), known as Wall Street's fear gauge, inched lower after ratcheting up last week to the highest in nearly four months.
Investors will also watch this week's Federal Reserve two-day policy meeting, the monthly jobs report and earnings from about a quarter of the S&P 500 companies. 
 Clorox Co  (N:CLX) shares jumped 4.24% after reporting its strongest quarterly sales growth in more than two decades and raising its full-year revenue forecast.
Market research firm Nielsen Holdings Plc (N:NLSN) rose 3.85% on plans to sell its consumer goods data unit for $2.7 billion to private equity firm Advent International.
But the S&P airlines index <.SPCOMAIR> fell 1.44% while cruise operators Carnival Corp (N:CCL), down 1.17% and  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd  (N:NCLH), off 2.77% also lost ground, reflecting fears over a relentless surge in COVID-19 cases.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.94-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.04-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 7 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 21 new highs and 55 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.01 billion shares, compared with the 9.1 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Investing.com – The Dow racked up gains Monday, on a late-day rebound in tech from session lows and strength in value stocks ahead of the U.S. election on Tuesday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.60%, or 423 points. The S&P 500 was up 1.22%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.42%.
Value stocks across sectors like energy, materials, and industrials were in favor as investors bet that a Joe Biden presidential victory could boost the economy. 
Ahead of the U.S. presidential election, national polls suggest that former Vice President Joe Biden maintained his strong lead over the weekend against President Donald Trump in key battleground states.
Some suggested that a so-called blue wave – Democrats taking control of the White House and Congress – would prove a short-term gain to the economy as a bigger stimulus package would likely be rolled out, but growth may suffer beyond 2021 amid a possible hike in taxes. 
""In the near-term, we see a blue wave as the most constructive outcome for the economy, with more than $3tn in fresh fiscal stimulus contributing to robust GDP growth to 2021 …  but beyond 2021 time-frame, the implications of a blue wave become much less market friendly,"" Action Economics said in a note. ""Once Democrats have dealt with COVID and the economic fallout, their next policy priority will probably be healthcare expansion financed by tax increases.""
Energy, led the move higher as oil prices climbed despite lingering concerns about the pandemic impact to demand as several European countries including Germany, France, Belgium, Ireland, Austria and Belgium returned to lockdown.
Tech, meanwhile, added impetus to the rally as the Fab 5 rebounded from session lows. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ended off the day's lows, while Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) closed in the green.
Clorox (NYSE:CLX), meanwhile, rose 5% after delivering a quarterly earnings beat on strong sales of household goods.

321,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 03:46PM ET</span>","U.S. Election, Restaurants, Car Sellers: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com --  The end of a contentious U.S. election season lifted stocks on Monday, though volatility is certain to weigh on markets until a clear outcome is known.
President Donald Trump and his opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, criss-crossed key American swing states on the last day before the 2020 election. Polls open on Tuesday, but already nearly 100 million voters have cast early ballots.
A winner may not be declared for several days, owing to mail-in vote counting. And that declaration might be contested in court, something Trump has hinted at during this weekend’s rallies.
Still, the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched double-digit highs on Monday even though tech stocks felt pressure.
Here are three things that could affect markets on Tuesday:
1. Stocks anticipate a Blue Wave
Polls have Biden leading Trump by more or less than 10 points going into election day. Quinnipiac’s national poll put Biden at 50% and Trump at 39%. Polls can be very wrong, however. And national voting doesn’t count as much as the tally in the all-important swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where the electoral college margin could be decided.
Stocks have largely priced in a Biden victory, with the Senate switching to Democrat control -- a so-called Blue Wave. A Biden presidency is likely to have more stimulus and greater regulation, particularly as concerns the environment, but also spending on infrastructure and clean energy. A Trump second term would likely see less stimulus but some infrastructure spending.
2. For restaurant operators, election could mean higher wages
Restaurant stocks could come into focus with a Biden win. The candidate has advocated for a national minimum wage of $15 an hour, something that has already been adopted in several big cities.
That puts pressure on margins for chains like  The Cheesecake Factory  (NASDAQ:CAKE), The Wendy’s Co (NASDAQ:WEN) and  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) if menu prices aren’t raised. That said, stimulus and a return to better economic times should help restaurants including McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)and Restaurant Brands International Inc (NYSE:QSR) as pandemic-weary consumers decide to call it quits on home cooking.
3. Used car dealers racking up pandemic-boosted sales
Autos are big on shoppers’ lists this fall. That trend has already boosted shares of giant second-hand auto retailers such as AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN),  CarMax Inc  (NYSE:KMX) and recently debuted  Carvana  Co (NYSE:CVNA), and new stimulus from Washington could support continued buying.
The pandemic-related shut downs encouraged many to buy suburban homes and purchase cars to get around in a socially distanced way. Edmunds.com found that as of June, used car sales were up more than 22% from a year earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) disclosed it could face costs of up to 722 million euros ($840 million) to resolve a Justice Department investigation into excess diesel emissions and as a result of higher fuel economy penalties.
The Italian-American company said the impact of a U.S. appeals court ruling in August overturning the Trump administration's July 2019 rule that suspended a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regulation more than doubling penalties for automakers failing to meet fuel efficiency requirements could be significant.
FCA in a securities filing said the amounts ""accrued could be up to 500 million euros ($581 million) depending on, among other things, our ability to implement future product actions or other actions to modify the utilization of credits.""
The automaker declined to comment Monday.
In October 2019, FCA said it incurred a $79 million U.S. civil penalty for failing to meet 2017 fuel economy requirements after paying $77.3 million for 2016 requirements.
FCA's filing said it is uncertain if ""NHTSA will appeal the ruling"" and unclear if the ruling will be applied retrospectively to the 2019 model year.
If the higher rate were applied retrospectively, Fiat Chrysler ""may need to accrue additional amounts due to increased CAFE penalties and additional amounts owed under certain agreements for the purchase of regulatory emissions credits.""
Separately, FCA recognized a 222 million euro ($258 million) provision ""to settle matters under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice primarily related to criminal investigations associated with U.S. diesel emissions matters.""
FCA in January 2019 agreed to an $800 million settlement to resolve claims from the U.S. Justice Department, California Air Resources Board and owners that it used illegal software that produced false results on diesel-emissions tests.
FCA said settlement talks remain ongoing and it is not clear if it will reach agreement with the Justice Department.
FCA separately agreed in September to pay $9.5 million to settle allegations it misled investors over its compliance with emissions regulations.

Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) in 2017 as part of its diesel emissions Justice Department settlement pleaded guilty to fraud, obstruction of justice and falsifying statements.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission collected a record $4.7 billion in fines in fiscal 2020, buoyed by several large settlements even as agents were forced to work remotely for a large part of the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The SEC reported Monday that it assessed $1 billion in penalties and ordered $3.6 billion in ill-gotten funds disgorged across 715 separate cases.
While the caseload is the lowest in four years as agents faced ""unprecedented challenges,"" the total fine amount was a record for the SEC.
""Since mid-March, the entire [enforcement] division has been working from home, which has created unique impediments to several important aspects of our work, such as taking testimony from live witnesses, gathering evidence, and litigating our cases in court. Nevertheless, the division found ways to recommend meaningful cases to the Commission,"" the agency said in its report.
A handful of sizeable cases drove the bulk of the agency's collections, including when it ordered Telegram Group Inc to return $1.2 billion to investors and pay an $18.5 million penalty to resolve charges that it offered an unregistered digital token coin offering - the company neither admitted nor denied the SEC's claims.

Other hefty fines include a $500 million penalty against  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) as part of a joint Justice Department investigation into its sales practices, and a $45 million penalty against Bausch Health, formerly Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:BHC), for misleading disclosures.

Investing.com -- Under Armour (NYSE:UA) rose 5% after getting a slew of price target boosts from Stifel to Wedbush.
Stifel upgraded the stock to buy from hold, and bumped its price target to $17 from $11 on improved revenue expected ahead. The shares are currently trading around $12.71.
""Greater confidence stems from improved quality of revenue (DTC growth and off-price to 4% in 2020), sightlines to revenue inflection in 2021, gross margin drivers from mix and a streamlined expense base pointing to opportunity for earnings leverage,"" said analyst Jim Duffy. 
The divestiture of MyFitnessPal simplifies the business and results in a net cash position entering 2021, reducing risk. Duffy expects the company to profit next year.
On Oct. 30, Under Armour reported earnings per share of 26 cents, compared to the expected 3 cents, on sales of $1.43 billion, higher than the estimated $1.16 billion.

BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s $23 billion iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) had its worst week of outflows since the coronavirus-induced selloff in February, losing almost $3.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, the $6.5 billion Xtrackers USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYLB) posted its largest daily withdrawals on record.
The exodus comes as virus cases spike across the U.S. and Europe, prompting fears of renewed lockdowns that could imperil a fragile economic recovery. Investors across asset classes are bracing for a surge in volatility, fueled by a contentious American presidential election on Tuesday. Several borrowers in the high-yield market have shelved deals recently, while others have decided to sweeten the terms.
“It would be raising cash, it would be fear that you would see spreads widening, it would be fear of Covid pushing us into a lockdown or restrictions even if they were not federally mandated,” Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU), said, referring to the outflows from junk bonds.
 State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT).’s $11.8 billion SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) High Yield Bond ETF (JNK) has seen three straight weeks of outflows, totaling more than $1 billion.
Short interest on HYG -- a rough indicator of bearish bets -- is about 18% of shares outstanding, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. That’s up from less than 2% in August.
“Those assets are going to be more sensitive to the health of the recovery,” said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen, the investment arm of retirement-savings giant TIAA. “That’s some of what you were seeing, perhaps pre-election de-risking in combination with a little cloudier view of what the near-term pace of the economic recovery is going to look like.”

Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (NYSE:PEI) and CBL & Associates Properties Inc. sought protection from creditors Sunday, citing pandemic-induced pressures on their tenants and, in turn, themselves. Together the two REITs account for some 87 million square feet of real estate across the U.S., according to court papers.
The pandemic worsened an already dire situation for brick-and-mortar retailers, with a steady stream of chains falling victim as their customers shifted to online shopping. J.C. Penney Co., J. Crew Group and the owner of Ann Taylor are among the dozens of chains that have sought court protection since Covid-19 lockdowns throttled in-store shopping this year.
That’s an even bigger problem for the likes of PREIT and CBL, which own less productive malls than rivals such as Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) and  Macerich Co  (NYSE:MAC)., according Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lindsay Dutch.
“There’s too much retail real estate in the U.S.,” said Dutch, a REIT equity analyst. “Retailers continue to reduce their store footprints, and while brick and mortar is here to stay, the focus is on high-quality locations.”The Chapter 11 filing doesn’t necessarily mean the malls are closing. Instead, it gives their owners time to work out a plan to turn the business around and repay creditors.
CBL, based in Chattanooga, counts 107 properties in 26 states in its portfolio, including enclosed malls, outlets and open-air retail centers, according to a company statement. Philadelphia-based PREIT owns malls in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland and Michigan, according to its website.
Many of their properties are known in the industry parlance as B-class malls, which bring in fewer sales per square foot than their better-placed peers. They may be located outside major metropolitan areas or upscale regions, making them vulnerable as middle-class customers struggle to make ends meet, and they were hit hard by the pullback of anchor stores like J.C. Penney and Sears.
The mall owners drummed up support from creditors for restructuring plans prior to their bankruptcy filings, possibly shortening their trips through bankruptcy. PREIT’s plan would, pending court approval, push out debt maturities and bring in $150 million of additional capital. CBL’s plan would slash debt by $1.5 billion and also extend certain maturities.

After being overweight tech for almost two years, strategists led by Mislav Matejka slashed to neutral the sector that has driven the recovery rally since March and raised their recommendation on banking and insurance stocks to overweight. Their call comes after the Nasdaq 100 Index has tumbled nearly 9% since Oct. 12.
“We believe the markets are primed for a broadening in leadership, having seen record-ever bifurcation so far year-to-date,” write JPMorgan strategists, including Prabhav Bhadani and Nitya Saldanha, in a Monday note. “The sector and style rotation is likely to get underway irrespective of the U.S. elections winner, while the regional rotation would be more dependent on the actual election outcome.”
U.S. tech giants have been leading the market recovery from March lows as investors viewed them as key winners from lockdowns. However, the Nasdaq 100 Index has fallen since reaching a peak in September on concerns about frothy valuations. Last week saw its worst selloff in seven months after Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s iPhone sales and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR).’s user growth both missed estimates.
The rotation in market leadership would stem from an economic recovery and possible positive news on the pandemic, according to JPMorgan. The strategists said tech’s outperformance could stall if bond yields start rising next year, even though their earnings and balance sheet fundamentals remain supportive. Banks and insurance stocks would in turn benefit from a pick-up in bond yields.
Election Outcomes
A clear outcome for the election would be a positive for equity investors, according to JPMorgan, as the market could then focus on fiscal stimulus measures. A contested result would lead to selling, they say, while recommending buying any weakness on a three-to-six-month horizon.
And although a “blue wave” of Democratic wins and concerns over unfriendly market policies could also pressure stocks, the strategists say, they would see this as a chance to add to portfolios on bets of increased fiscal stimulus, a weaker U.S. dollar, steeper yield curve and easing trade uncertainty. While Matejka’s team is overweight U.S. and China stocks, which have outperformed Europe and emerging markets this year, they see this trend possibly changing in 2021.
“U.S. leadership has been consistent with growth outperforming value, and tech outperforming banks. This might not continue in 2021,” they write.

342,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 08:55AM ET</span>",UK aviation needs government support for new lockdown pain: airport boss,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's airports and airlines need urgent support to survive the ""very bleak future"" posed by a new lockdown in England, warned the boss of one of the country's biggest airport groups. 
Very low levels of travel in recent months have put airlines and airports under renewed financial strain after they were effectively shut during Britain's first lockdown, and they now face another month without income during its second. 
""An urgent package of support must materialise,"" said Manchester Airport Group's (MAG) chief executive Charlie Cornish in a statement on Monday. 
He said the new lockdown for England, due to start on Thursday and which bans international leisure travel, will make parts of the aviation sector unsustainable. 
Before the pandemic, Britain had a thriving aviation sector. Air transport and related supply chain activity plus tourist arrivals supported 1.6 million jobs and accounted for 4.5% of UK GDP according to an IATA study. 
But more than 20,000 jobs have now been lost at UK airlines like British Airways (L:ICAG) and easyJet (L:EZJ), and Heathrow, once the busiest airport in Europe, has lost its crown to Paris.
Industry executives blame the UK government's 14-day quarantine rules, and the comparatively slow adoption of allowing testing to replace the need for isolation, for exacerbating the pain. 
Industry bodies Airlines UK and the Airport Operators Association called on the government to bring in business rates relief for airports, waive the air passenger duty tax, and quickly bring in a testing regime to save jobs.
On top of job support schemes, Britain has provided extra help to train and bus operators and the hospitality sector during the crisis, but aviation has been ignored say bosses, despite promises made by the finance minister in March.
""Government has neglected UK aviation and the role it plays in our economy from day one of this pandemic,"" said Cornish, whose MAG owns Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports.

343,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 08:20AM ET</span>",Analysis: Sustainable investing advocates hope for friendlier U.S. rules if Biden wins,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Ross Kerber
NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Progressive (NYSE:PGR) groups and investors hope Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden can win on Tuesday and quickly end Trump administration rules that stifle their ability to pick stocks using environmental, social or governance factors, setting up a renewed fight with corporate groups that backed the changes.
More than a dozen lobbyists, investors and policy experts said a Biden win could boost U.S. growth of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing which lags far behind Europe, and which has been further stymied as Trump-appointed officials have crafted financial rules targeting shareholder voting and pension fund allocations.
ESG investing is winning more investor cash, boosted by studies showing superior performance. 
But Trump's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Labor Department rules put the United States at odds with major investors and further behind European funds, which held 82% of the global total of $1.26 trillion of ESG assets in the third quarter of 2020, according to Morningstar. U.S. funds held 14%.
Democrats favor so-called ESG investing strategies as a way to pressure companies to address climate change, wealth inequality and racial justice problems. If Biden takes the White House, investors expect him to prioritize aggressive reforms.
""The Trump administration and his regulators have been ideologically anti-ESG and climate from the start,"" said Dennis Kelleher, president of progressive think tank Better Markets. 
""This will change significantly if Biden wins. His administration will prioritize addressing climate change and will also boost ESG disclosure and promotion.""
In July, the SEC imposed new restrictions on proxy advisory firms that recommend how investors should vote in corporate elections. Critics of these firms said they had amassed too much power over the voting process and needed to be reined in.
In September, the SEC raised stock ownership requirements for submitting shareholder proposals, making it harder for advocates to get motions onto corporate ballots. The agency said the rules needed to be modernized.
On Friday, the Labor Department finalized a rule limiting some fund managers from investing in companies based on environmental or social factors, unless they could show an economic reason to do so. A similar rule on proxy voting is pending. The proposals cover trillions of dollars in retirement accounts. [nL1N2HL2DZ]
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country's most powerful business group, said in a memo last month that the rules showed its campaign for policies that benefit shareholders while opposing special interest activists was ""bearing fruit.""
But investors and labor unions have blasted the changes. 
Together, they put “limits on investors’ ability to hold companies accountable,"" said Kyle Seeley, corporate governance officer for pension funds overseen by the New York State Comptroller. 
If Democrats win the U.S. Senate, they could rescind the measures using a law that allows a new Congress to overturn freshly inked rules. If the Republicans retain their Senate majority, Biden could pick new agency heads who would revisit the rules or introduce countervailing measures, said policy experts.
Chief among those would be new rules requiring companies to issue ESG reports and disclosures, which Democratic SEC commissioner Allison Lee has argued for. Lee, who opposed the SEC changes, is likely to be SEC acting chair if Biden wins. 
Mindy Lubber, chief executive of sustainability advocacy group Ceres, said her group has spoken with the Biden campaign about introducing such disclosures, as well as regulations requiring banks to stress-test their balance sheets for climate-related risks. She added that she expected corporate groups would fight any effort to rescind the SEC and Labor Department changes. 
Lee and Biden's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
DEEP POCKETS
Since the 2009 financial crisis, top investors have focused more on executive compensation and environmental issues, sparking a backlash from oil majors including ExxonMobil Corp (N:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (CVX) which faced investor pressure to explain how climate change could hurt their businesses.
Oil companies have for years underperformed other industrial sectors and the S&P 500. 
The oil giants and other deep-pocketed groups, such as the Chamber and the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), pushed hard in Washington for the SEC rules for several years, according to three regulatory sources with knowledge of the matter, several lobbyists, and public records and letters. 
As the SEC began exploring the rule changes in 2018, for example, the Chamber and NAM launched a six-figure advertising and social media blitz saying proxy advisors harmed retirees and gave politically-motivated advice, claims those companies deny. 
The Chamber also pushed the Labor Department to make changes, according to three other sources and public letters. 
Exxon declined to comment. A Chevron spokesperson said limits on shareholder proposals are ""justified"" and that the company aims to be transparent and responsive on ESG issues. 
The Labor Department did not comment. 
An SEC spokesperson said its rules enhance transparency and the ""fiduciary duties and disclosure obligations owed to shareholders"" without materially changing their ability to access proxy advice or get proposals on the ballot.
The Chamber and manufacturers association said the SEC and Labor Department rules increase transparency around the investment process, and guard workers' pensions from the political whims of interest groups.
For those reasons, said Tom Quaadman, an executive at the Chamber, the rules resonate with both Republicans and Democrats. He said he expects some moderate Democrats to oppose an attempt to overhaul them.

""We will be prepared to defend the rules if they’re challenged,"" said Charles Crain, a director at NAM.

346,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 07:01AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Rise 440 Pts; Election Campaign Nears End,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening firmly higher Monday, bouncing back from October’s sharp selloff, as investors look forward to the conclusion of a contentious presidential election campaign with the earnings season still in full flow.
At 8:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 44 points, or 1.4%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 440 points, or 1.7%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 110 points, or 1%. 
Last week the major cash indices suffered their worst week since late March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell to its lowest level since July 31, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite endured their second straight negative month.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden enter the final full day of campaigning in their long and bitter race for the White House. Biden still has a comfortable lead in the national polls, according to a WSJ-NBC survey, but the polling in key swing states is a lot closer. 
If polls are correct and Biden wins in a “blue sweep” with Democrats securing both congressional chambers it would bolster the outlook for rapid and large-scale fiscal stimulus, according to many analysts,
“Should the election fail to deliver a clear result and recounts and legal challenges mean that there is a longer period of uncertainty, market angst would likely rise, particularly given sharply rising Covid-19 hospitalizations and the potential for more containment measures,” said analysts at ING in a research note.
The U.S. reported over 99,000 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, beating its previous record set only a day prior, according to Johns Hopkins University. A number of countries in Europe have already announced new curbs as infections surge and hospitals start to fill up.
Meanwhile, the third-quarter earnings season is past its halfway mark, and dozens more companies are due to report during the week. Monday sees Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ),  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) and Loews (NYSE:L) all report.
The main economic release Monday is the ISM manufacturing PMI number for October, and this follows on from healthy equivalent figures in China and Europe. 
However, the economic highlight of the week will be the Federal Reserve meeting. Its policy decision will be delivered a day later than usual given the election, on Thursday at 2 PM ET. Friday also sees the monthly jobs report, which is expected to show another small decline in the unemployment rate.
Oil prices slumped Monday, with more lockdowns in Europe adding to fears that global demand will be severely hit by the second wave of coronavirus cases across the northern hemisphere.
Add in uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election as well as the fact Libya’s oil production is rising rapidly toward one million barrels a day, and the outlook looks grim for the crude markets.
U.S. crude futures traded 2.9% lower at $34.77 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.3% to $37.08, hitting their lowest levels since May.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,889.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1652.

348,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",World shares look past lockdowns as U.S. election approaches,"By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - World shares recovered from one-month lows on Monday as strengthening factory data in China and Europe offset news of new virus lockdowns, while investors prepared for more volatility arising from the U.S. presidential election. 
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up 0.4% by 1047 GMT, following a strong performance in Asia after data showed Chinese factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in a decade.
A strong bounce in euro zone manufacturing in October also helped Europe leave behind a cautious start after the UK became the latest country in the region to announce a fresh lockdown to fight a second wave of COVID-19 infections. 
Italy was also set to approve new restrictions as early as Monday after moves in France and Germany last week caused a broad risk-off move across markets. 
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 (FTEU3) benchmark, which reached a five-month low last week, was last at its session high, up 1.1%, also supported by hopes the lockdowns wouldn't last as long as the previous round. 
""Europe is facing up to a harsh winter ahead,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid said in a note. ""The question to be asked to all the European countries is can they come out of these measures in some form towards the end of November/early December as is hoped or will they be extended further.""
The focus was increasingly shifting towards the U.S. election on Tuesday, although investors prepared for the chance that it could take a few days before the result becomes clear.
Republican President Donald Trump trails Democratic challenger Joe Biden in national opinion polls, but polls in the states that will decide the election show a closer race. 
""Given the likelihood that the outcome of the presidential election will be unclear on Wednesday, and possibly for much longer, volatility could easily pick up and it might become a severe roller-coaster ride,"" UniCredit strategists said.
Analysts are concerned that an uncertain outcome could cloud the prospects for fiscal stimulus in the world's largest economy. Also crucial for the size of a possible stimulus will be which party wins the Senate.
The VIX volatility index (VIX), which rose to its highest in four months last week, eased nearly 1 point to 37.3. U.S. stock index futures (ESc1) (NQc1) were more than 1% higher, suggesting a clear recovery on Wall Street at the open. 
Meanwhile, the fresh lockdowns in Europe and parts of the United States have raised concerns over the outlook for fuel consumption. Brent crude (LCOc1) prices fell to a low of $35.74 per barrel, a level not seen since late May. They were last down 2.4% at $37.05. U.S. crude went as low as $33.64. [O/R]
Global coronavirus cases surged last week with Europe crossing the bleak milestone of 10 million total infections. The UK is grappling with more than 20,000 new cases a day while a record surge in U.S. cases is killing up to 1,000 people a day.
In currencies, the British pound  was last 0.2% lower at $1.2916, hit by news of the national lockdown, while the euro (EUR=) slipped to $1.1640. 
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar  went below 70 U.S. cents for the first time since July before turning flat, while the Japanese yen  was higher at 104.72 per dollar. 
That left the index that measures the dollar against a basket of other currencies broadly unchanged at 94.06. (=USD). 
A risk-on revival after the U.S. election could see the dollar resume its slide from March's highs, analysts said. 

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said the market probably views a Biden win as ""short-term neutral"" but ""long-term negative"" as his expected tax policy outweighs the benefits from a large stimulus package.

349,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 06:41AM ET</span>",Potential stock winners and losers from Tuesday's U.S. election,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tuesday's presidential election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden could have dramatic effects on various stocks and sectors, and investors have spent months trying to identify potential winners and losers.
A group of stocks seen benefiting from Biden's Democratic policies has outperformed those seen benefiting from Republican Trump. Over a two-month period that ended Wednesday, a ""Biden basket"" of stocks created by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) head of U.S. equity strategy Dubravko Lakos gained 4.5% versus a 16% drop for a ""Trump basket.""
Here is a look at stocks that might fit best in a Biden or Trump portfolio:
BIDEN BASKET
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY: A strong ""green energy"" push expected under a Biden administration would support alternative energy stocks. Green energy stocks have already soared in anticipation of Biden and Democrats faring well on Tuesday. The Invesco Solar ETF (P:TAN) climbed about 40% from roughly mid September to mid October, but has pulled back more recently.

INFRASTRUCTURE: A Democratic sweep ""would likely mean a large scale infrastructure bill that should be placed at the forefront of restarting the U.S. economy,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) International Private Bank said in a recent report.
JP Morgan lists Vulcan Materials (N:VMC), Jacobs Engineering Group (N:J) and  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) among the infrastructure stocks in its ""Biden basket.""
ETFs to watch: iShares US Infrastructure ETF (N:IFRA), SPDR S&P Kensho Intelligent Structures ETF (N:SIMS), Global X US Infrastructure Development ETF (N:PAVE)
FISCAL BUMP: Analysts view a Democratic sweep as the surest path to a massive coronavirus relief package to help stimulate the economy. Such a package could especially benefit small-cap shares and finally fuel a long-awaited rotation into value stocks.
ETFs to watch: iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (P:IJR), iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (P:IWD)
TARIFF TENSIONS: A Biden administration is expected to ratchet down tensions in the U.S.-China tariff war.
""Improved trade would benefit exports, which would benefit many U.S. materials companies, including exporters of agricultural products and grains,"" Columbia Threadneedle Investments said in a recent presentation. 
ETFs to watch: iShares China Large-Cap ETF (N:FXI)
MARIJUANA: U.S.-listed shares of major cannabis producers surged after the vice presidential debate, when Biden's running mate Kamala Harris said marijuana would be decriminalized at the federal level under a Biden administration. That prospect has boosted stocks in the sector.

TRUMP TRADE
BANKS: Along with higher corporate taxes, banks could face concerns over more regulations under a Biden administration. Banks in a second Trump term, ""could see added tailwinds from a continued 'light touch' on regulation and a push to reduce taxes,"" Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) said in a report.
JP Morgan lists Bank of America (N:BAC),  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) and  Citigroup  (N:C) in its ""Trump basket"" of stocks.
Should Biden win, analysts do see a silver lining for banks because they could benefit from a hefty stimulus package and potentially steeper bond yields.

FOSSIL FUEL: A Trump win ""could lead to a friendlier tax and regulatory environment for the traditional energy industry,"" Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors said in a recent report.
While Biden has made green energy a key plank of his agenda, Columbia Threadneedle Investments said ""a ban on either new leases or new permits on federal lands for energy exploration would be a significant challenge for traditional U.S. oil and gas companies.""
ETFs to watch: SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (P:XOP)
BIG TECH: Both parties are expected to continue regulatory pressure on tech companies, but Deutsche Bank International Private Bank says the sector was ""one of the biggest benefactors"" of Trump's tax reform and ""is also likely to benefit from a softer stance on regulation and antitrust policies.""
According to Allianz, Democrats are ""more likely to pursue changes in 'Big Tech' including breakups and additional regulations."" 
ETFs to watch: Invesco QQQ ETF (O:QQQ), Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (P:XLK)
DEFENSE: A second-term Trump administration ""would likely continue to benefit aerospace & defense,"" Ameriprise said in a recent report, noting that Trump would likely continue to seek higher spending on defense. 
ETFs to watch: iShares US Aerospace & Defense (Z:ITA), SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (P:XAR) 
PHARMA AND BIOTECH: While both political parties have sounded off against high prescription drug prices, a Biden victory that in particular is coupled with Democrats winning the Senate could send a shudder through the highly regulated healthcare sector, so there could be some relief if Trump is re-elected.
""A Democratic sweep in November could increase the pressure on drug makers post-election,"" according to Ameriprise.

350,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>",Companies' future tax rates may hinge on election results,"By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has promised to push his own tax proposals on ""day one"" if he wins the election on Tuesday - including raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and doubling the rate to 21% on overseas profits from patents, copyrights and trademarks.
The higher rate on intellectual property would ""be a significant change for a lot of companies"" at a time when economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for employers is uncertain, said Daniel Bunn, vice president of global projects at the conservative Tax Foundation.
""It's really important to recognize how serious of a tax hike this will be for companies and how out of line it will put our tax system relative to other countries,"" Bunn said.
What Biden could actually accomplish may depend on whether Democrats take control of the Senate. Even then, many details could change during debate in Congress.
At the end of U.S. President Donald Trump's first year in office, the government cut the corporate federal income tax rate to 21% from 35%, requiring some companies to pay less to federal coffers. 
Even before that, giant tech firms including Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) had been maligned for lowering taxes by parking profits offshore. Consumer companies including retailers also used offshore havens. 
A snapshot of consumer companies over the last two decades shows a steady decline in tax rates that left several at or near their lowest in 2019 and 2020.
 Nike  Inc (N:NKE) paid its lowest effective tax rate in at least two decades in fiscal 2020 of 12.1%.
On Thursday,  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) reported a 20.1% effective tax rate for its fiscal 2020. That is only slightly higher than its 2019 rate of 19.5%, which was its lowest in 20 years.
Reuters reviewed annual reports going back to 1999 for seven U.S. multinational consumer companies in the S&P 100 that an October report from WalletHub said had the lowest 2019 overall tax rates.
Taco Bell parent Yum Brands Inc (N:YUM) also reported its lowest rate in 2019 of 5.7%. The  Coca-Cola Co 's (N:KO) effective tax rate was 16.7% last year, its lowest rate in two decades except for 2010, when it posted the same rate.
Nike and Yum did not respond to requests for comment.
Starbucks and Coca-Cola declined to comment on their low tax rates or Biden's proposals. 
Taxes for some companies have not fallen as steeply. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) effective tax rate for 2019 was 24.9%, lower than its average 31.67% rate over 20 years but not as dramatically.
Graphic: Select corporate effective tax rates 2019 - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/CORPORATETAX/yzdvxawkbpx/chart.png
""If anything resembling Joe Biden's tax plan gets enacted, companies like Nike will be less able to shift intangible profits into tax havens,"" said Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
""That's going to help bring an end to the offshore gamesmanship,"" Gardner said. 

According to media reports stemming from the ""Paradise Papers"" - documents from the law firm Appleby leaked to German reporters and made public in 2017 - officials in the Netherlands allegedly allowed Nike to shift profits from intellectual property rights from high-tax Europe to subsidiaries in low-tax Bermuda. The scheme is now under investigation by the European Commission.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China International Capital Corporation (CICC) (HK:3908) <601995.SS> has broken into the world's top two investment banks for new listings for the first time since the global financial crisis due to its role leading in fintech giant  Ant Group 's (HK:6688) (SS:688688) mega float, Dealogic figures show.
League tables published on Monday distributing credit for the Ant deal has pushed CICC into the top tier of investment banks working on IPOs and secondary listings around the world.
CICC, ranked fifth globally before Ant so far this year, is now second behind  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), according to the figures.
The market share figures came as CICC's stock started trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Monday after the bank raised $2 billion in a secondary listing.
CICC is a sponsor on both the Shanghai and Hong Kong legs of the Ant IPO, set to be the world's largest, that has raised up to $37 billion which includes an already exercised greenshoe option for the mainland portion of the deal.
Goldman Sachs (N:GS) is now ranked third on the global listings league table, followed by  Citigroup  (N:C) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), the data shows.
The Ant IPO has prompted a reshuffle of the bank rankings in Hong Kong.
CICC retained its top ranking but increased its market share to 11% from 9% while only two western banks remain in the top 10.
Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, two sponsors of Ant's Hong Kong legs, are ranked eighth and ninth, while the remaining top 10 spots are taken by Chinese institutions.
Ant Group will pay the 24 banks which underwrote the Hong Kong leg of the deal up to $198 million in fees, if the 15% greenshoe is exercised.

The fees equate to 1% of the IPO's proceeds which is considered low compared with most deals in the Asian financial hub.

The pilots' refusal to agree to the government's terms this weekend jeopardised the planned 3.4 billion euro ($4 billion)bail out needed to help KLM cope with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
""We want to talk to KLM and the Finance ministry to find a solution as soon as possible"", pilot union VNV chairman Willem Schmid told Dutch radio station BNR on Monday.
KLM did not comment on Schmid's remarks, while the Finance ministry has said it will only talk to the airline's board and not to individual unions.
The pilot union had earlier agreed to wage cuts for the period until March 2022, but the government on Friday demanded an immediate guarantee that wages would be frozen for at least three years after this period.
""This demand came out of nowhere"", Schmid said. ""We want to know what we are asked to sign for.""
KLM's works council on Monday called on all parties to reach an agreement. 
""You simply cannot let this issue endanger the future of the company"", works council head Dario Fucci told Reuters.
""That's not an acceptable outcome, not for the trade unions, not for the company and not for the government.""
Most unions representing ground and cabin crews have agreed to the extended wage freeze, which is set to last as long as the airline receives government support.

SINGAPORE/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Asia's retail traders are trimming exposure to China before Tuesday's U.S. election, lifting short bets on U.S. stocks and keeping cash on hand, brokerages say, as even some of the most risk-tolerant investors turn cautious.
Novices, who took up trading during lockdowns, have led aggressive buying this year when many Wall Street advisors urged caution.
UBS analysts reckon, at least in Southeast Asia, that they are now a big enough force to move markets. Their brokers say they are getting ready for short-term risks, despite a consensus favouring a Joe Biden victory and a market rally.
""People are positioning themselves according to what they believe an outcome may be,"" said Chris Brankin, chief executive at TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) in Singapore, who noted a ""hint of skepticism"" among his clients around polls putting Biden ahead.
""They're not mass exiting positions ... it's more of a risk pause,"" he said. ""And all eyes are on Tuesday.""
He said the chance of a Donald Trump win was partly reflected in a small reduction of exposure to Chinese companies and buying of oil major  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM).
Chinese companies are considered vulnerable to Sino-U.S. tension if the less-predictable Trump is re-elected. Energy companies could benefit from lower taxes.
Other brokers reported similar caution. In Australia, retail broker CommSec said there had been recent buying of Betashares' BEAR ETF (AX:BEAR), which gains when stocks fall, and of options protecting against falls. IG Markets said clients were long U.S. dollars in case a contested outcome caused market turmoil.
""Right now, I'm holding 30% in stocks and the rest in cash ready for investment,"" said Watchara Kaewsawang, a large Thai investor. ""I've delayed my investment to wait and see on the U.S. elections and our home politics.""
All that dry powder could mean that Asia's small investors are ready to swoop if uncertainty clears.
""This (risk reduction) had started probably late September, and is ongoing,"" said Adam Reynolds, Asia-Pacific CEO of Saxo Capital Markets in Singapore. ""I imagine that there will be a rush back in if we get a decisive election result.""

Investing.com -- European stock markets were acting out a well-rehearsed playbook on Monday, as the U.K. underperformed the rest of the continent after Prime Minister Boris Johnson became the latest government leader to announce a ‘lockdown lite’ in the hope of stemming the coronavirus tide.
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the FTSE 100 and the mid-cap, more domestic-focused FTSE 250 index were up 0.6% and down 0.4% respectively, on a morning when the continent’s other main indices were posting gains of 1% or more.
The positive broader performance represented a bounce from some heavy losses last week, driven largely by final purchasing managers indices that were for the most part revised up from preliminary readings.  The composite Eurozone manufacturing PMI hit a two-year high of 54.8 - a level that, with the tightening of restrictions across the continent over the last week, seems unlikely to be beaten in in the near term.
In the U.K. in particular, it was a familiar pattern of stay-at-home stocks outperforming and cyclical and travel-exposed stocks tanking again.
Discount airline EasyJet (LON:EZJ) fell by 2.3% after CEO Johan Lundgren told Reuters at the weekend that he wasn’t against asking for state aid for the company, a measure that would likely dilute existing shareholders dramatically. By contrast Ryanair (LON:RYA), whose CEO Michael O’Leary continues to fulminate against the repeated government bailouts of favored airlines, rose 1.3%, despite posting a net loss of 197 million euros ($230 million) for the first half of its fiscal year.
The most dramatic movement was, however, the 15% drop in SAS (CSE:SAS) stock as the shares issued through its recapitalization hit the market.
Other travel-exposed stocks suffered heavily again: SSP Group (LON:SSPG), which runs food outlets mainly located in U.K. rail stations, fell 6.7%, while WH Smith shares fell 1.9%. Elsewhere in retail, Primark owner ABF (LON:ABF) fell a relatively modest 0.2% after it reassured investors with a trading statement that included a health cash position.  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF), the owner of B&Q and Castorama, outperformed, rising 3.3% as the new restrictions reinforced the trend for home improvement.
However, the star performer was Ocado (LON:OCDO), as on so many other mornings when the virus has dominated headlines. The company whose technology drives supermarket fulfilment centers saw its stock rise 8.8% after it raised its profit guidance for the year and announced two acquisitions of robotic technology companies for a total of $287 million. The acquisitions promise to allow it to expand into non-grocery markets. Kindred Systems, the larger of the two companies Ocado is buying, has notable clients in the fashion retail sector such as Gap and American Eagle (NYSE:AEO)."

Mall operators in the U.S. have been strapped for cash amid the pandemic as people have stayed indoors and resorted to online shopping.
Retailers, including J.C. Penney Co Inc, one of CBL's biggest renter, already grappling with customers' abandonment of traditional stores for online shopping have also resorted to bankruptcy filings. 
CBL's filing follows that of Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment (NYSE:PEI) Trust earlier on Sunday, which filed a chapter 11 petition to execute a prepackaged financial restructuring plan.
The bankruptcy was earlier reported by Bloomberg, which said the process will give the company a chance to continue operating while reorganizing its finances and business. 
In a filing on the U.S. Bankruptcy court for the Southern District of Texas, CBL listed both estimated assets and liabilities in the range of about $1 billion to $10 billion.

CBL had announced in August that it had entered into a restructuring support agreement with a group of bondholders to allow it to strengthen its balance sheet and organization.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African pharmaceutical company Aspen Pharmacare (J:APNJ) said on Monday it had reached a preliminary agreement with Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) to commercially manufacture its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, sending its shares higher.
The country's biggest drugmaker said it had agreed to provide capacity required for the manufacture of J&J's vaccine candidate, which is still in clinical trials, at its Port Elizabeth facility.
The agreement with J&J will see Aspen perform formulation, filling and secondary packaging of the vaccine for the U.S. firm, the company said.
Aspen's shares rose more than 4% on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on the announcement.
The company said it had invested more than 3 billion rand ($184.2 million) in the Port Elizabeth facility.
""The production area where it is intended that the vaccine candidate will be manufactured has capacity to produce more than 300 million doses per annum,"" it added.
South Africa has recorded more than 726,000 coronavirus infections, the highest number on the African continent, and more than 19,400 deaths.
It is hosting at least four clinical trials of potential COVID-19 vaccines, including the J&J candidate.
The agreement between Aspen and J&J is subject to the completion of technology transfer activities and finalisation of certain commercial terms.
Last month South Africa's Biovac Institute - a joint venture between the government and private sector - said it was in talks to produce some of the vaccines the country needs to protect itself against COVID-19.

Investing.com - European stock markets largely weakened Monday, weighed by news of fresh lockdowns in the region and uncertainty over the U.S. election, overshadowing strong economic data from China.
At 4:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.2%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.1%.
The U.K. became the latest European country to reenter lockdown over the weekend, instituting a one-month stay-at-home policy for all of England to start Thursday, with the exception of schools, universities and essential stores, as the number of Covid-19 cases affecting its population surpassed one million. 
Germany and France imposed similar partial shutdowns last week, as European leaders desperately seek to halt the surge in the virus before the holiday season at the end of the year.
However, these new measures risk sending the region’s economy back into recession just as a recovery looked in sight. As such, the final Eurozone manufacturing PMI at 4 AM ET (0900 GMT) may represent an interim high point in the current cycle.
There has been some good news Monday, with data from China showing factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in a decade. The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index for October rose to 53.6, as the second-largest economy in the world recovered strongly from its virus-induced slowdown. The Spanish and French manufacturing PMIs also showed an improvement.
That said, trading ranges are likely to be tight Monday as the U.S. presidential election draws near. Democrat Joe Biden still maintains a comfortable lead over incumbent president Donald Trump in the national polls, but the polling in key swing states tends to be a lot closer, according to a WSJ-NBC poll. 
In corporate news, Ocado (LON:OCDO) stock rose 6.6% after the retailer lifted its guidance for the year and announced two tech acquisitions, moving beyond the grocery sector.
On the flip side, Ryanair (LON:RYA) stock fell 2.5% after the budget airline revealed it carried 80% fewer passengers over the first half of its financial year, while posting a loss for the period. 
Rival easyJet (LON:EZJ) stock fell 6.3%, with the industry hit hard by the new lockdowns in the region. CEO Johan Lundgren stated over the weekend that the airline was considering options to bolster its finances.
Oil prices slumped Monday, with more lockdowns in Europe adding to fears that global demand will be severely hit by the second wave of coronavirus cases hitting the northern hemisphere.
Add in uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election as well as the fact Libya’s oil production is rising rapidly toward one million barrels a day, and the outlook looks grim for the crude markets.
U.S. crude futures traded 3.8% lower at $34.42 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 3% to $36.78, hitting their lowest levels since May.

366,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 02:00AM ET</span>",Explainer: How mom-and-pop investors stumped up a record $3 trillion for Ant shares,"By Samuel Shen, Scott Murdoch and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Retail investors bid for a record $3 trillion worth of shares in Ant Group Co Ltd's dual listing, in an unprecedented show of interest from mom-and-pop savers betting on demand for its financial technology services in China.
The world's largest initial public offering (IPO) was split fairly evenly between Shanghai's STAR Market and Hong Kong, raising about $37 billion including the greenshoe option of the Shanghai leg. From retail investors alone, it attracted a bid value the equivalent of Britain's gross domestic product.
Here's how China and Hong Kong retail investors managed to reach that mammoth figure:
HOW MUCH RETAIL DEMAND DID ANT'S IPO GENERATE ON THE MAINLAND?
Chinese retail bids for Ant shares amounted to $2.8 trillion. That compared with the $19.8 billion the 16-year-old fintech giant raised in the entire Shanghai portion of its IPO, including the greenshoe - or overallotment - option.
Ant in a statement late on Thursday said it will allocate retail investors about 350 million shares，accounting for 18.3% of the Shanghai offering. That means a retail allocation worth 24.1 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) based on the IPO price of 68.8 yuan per share.
Successful bidders must pay for their shares by 4 pm Shanghai time on Monday or else the shares will be allocated to the sale's lead underwriter.
HOW DID MAINLAND RETAIL INVESTORS MANAGE TO PULL TOGETHER $2.8 TRILLION?
The retail demand total did not involve payment upfront. Moreover, local rules do not allow banks or brokerages to offer margin financing for IPOs.
Each mainland retail investor was allowed to bid for one unit, or 500 Ant shares, for every 5,000 yuan worth of other Chinese shares already owned, up to 317,000 Ant shares. No cash was needed to bid, and investors allotted shares following a lottery-like draw must have enough money to cover their bid.
The Shanghai portion of Ant's IPO was heavily skewed toward strategic and institutional investors. Retail investors' chance of buying Ant shares was further reduced by the participation of small hedge funds that were not qualified to participate in institutional bidding.
HOW DID RETAIL INVESTORS MANAGE TO STUMP UP $168 BILLION IN BIDS FOR THE HONG KONG LEG OF ANT'S IPO?
Unlike China, margin financing is a booming business in Hong Kong. Margin lending backed roughly half of the IPO's Hong Kong retail demand, local media reported, helped by significant liquidity and interest rates as low as 0.4% for short-term credit - roughly 10 days in such cases.
HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC said it set aside HK$150 billion ($19 billion) of loans to support retail investor interest in Ant's IPO, while BOC Hong Kong Holdings Ltd said it received over HK$100 billion in margin financing applications.
Some financial firms offered 20 to 30 times leverage to retail clients, banking industry insiders told Reuters.
HOW DO RETAIL INVESTORS USE MARGIN FINANCING AND HOW DOES IT WORK FOR LENDERS?
Retail investors in Hong Kong borrow heavily as larger bids boost the chance of share allocation, pinning their hopes of benefiting from a debut trading day pop. They pay back the loan soon after listing and pocket the gains.
Margin lending is lucrative for financial firms in Hong Kong as they earn interest on the loans irrespective of whether clients are allocated shares. They also benefit from opening new brokerage trading accounts.
Margin financing money gets locked up at a designated clearance bank. Given strong demand for Ant shares, the actual success rate for Hong Kong retail investors is relatively low, meaning brokers and banks will only have to lend a small portion of the margin financing applied for.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Embattled Australian wealth manager AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) on Monday said a conditional buyout offer from U.S.-based Ares Management Corp (N:ARES) had an implied value of A$6.36 billion ($4.47 billion), triggering a jump in its share price.
Shares in AMP, which is considering a potential sale or break-up following a string of scandals, rose 9.8% to A$1.68 on Monday, after the company revealed the price involved in Ares' proposal.
That was the highest since July, but below the A$1.85 per share in Ares' offer - which a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters was the only bid for the whole group so far - indicating investors see quite a bit of uncertainty on the deal.
Other parties have expressed interest in separate parts of the company, which has banking, fund management and financial planning units, said the person, who was not authorised to speak publicly on the matter and so declined to be identified.
Simon Mawhinney, chief investment officer of Allan Gray, AMP's second-largest shareholder, said the market reaction was somewhat surprising.
""We'll apply our minds to any offers for AMP in whole or in part when those offers are firmed up,"" Mawhinney said in an email to Reuters.
Ares' indicative offer price represents a premium of 21% to AMP's closing price of A$1.53 on Friday, when shares had already surged after AMP announced receipt of the offer earlier in the day.
In a brief update, the Sydney-based company said talks were at a preliminary stage between itself and the U.S. asset manager, and that there was no certainty on a deal eventuating at that price.
The veteran manager of Australian retirement savings has lost more than two-thirds of its value since a public inquiry in 2018 exposed systemic wrongdoing at the company including charging fees for advice that was never given, taking insurance premiums from the accounts of dead clients, and misleading a regulator.
The more than 160-year old wealth manager has also recently suffered multi-billion investment outflows following concerns about the conduct of the former chief executive of its funds management unit which led to his demotion.

Earlier this year, AMP ceded its position as Australia's largest wealth manager to IOOF Holdings Ltd (AX:IFL) after its rival bought National Australia Bank Ltd's (AX:NAB) financial advisory arm.

The deal, which was first flagged in September, will see the Wall Street bank edge closer to full ownership of the securities business in China as geopolitical relations between the United States and China remain fragile.
It will also position JPMorgan as the foreign bank with the highest ownership stake in a mainland Chinese securities joint venture.
JPMorgan's purchase was finalised just ahead of the Nov. 3 election in which the future of China's relationship with the United States has been a centrepiece of the campaign.
The stake was put up for sale by state-owned Shanghai Waigaoqiao FTZ, a filing on the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange in September showed.
JPMorgan was the only candidate that could raise its ownership with priority rights in the securities joint venture, the filing showed, as the remaining four shareholders had given up their rights to purchase the 20% stake.
A filing to the exchange on Monday showed JPMorgan paid 177 million yuan ($26.5 million) for the stake and the deal was completed on Oct. 23.
A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment on the transaction.
The securities joint venture houses investment banking, research, equities and fixed income businesses.
The U.S. bank planned to hire at least 12 equity research analysts in China this year, Reuters reported in May, in its first major mainland hiring push.
Major competitors like  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), Goldman Sachs (N:GX) and UBS (S:UBSG) hold 51% of their securities operations and most banks plan to move to full ownership.

GDS shares opened at HK$81 on Monday, just above its offering price of HK$80.88. They climbed to a high of HK$82.85 in morning trading. Shanghai-based GDS sold 160 million shares in its Hong Kong listing. Its Nasdaq-listed American depositary shares closed at $84.04 on Friday, which equates to about HK$81.5 with one GDS ADS representing 8 ordinary Hong Kong shares.
GDS is part of a growing cohort of U.S.-listed Chinese firms looking to sell shares in Hong Kong as part of efforts to expand its investor base. A Hong Kong listing also provides it with a hedge against any further deterioration in relations between Washington and Beijing. Tensions between the two have spilled over into the capital markets, with the U.S. threatening to delist Chinese companies on the grounds that American regulators don’t have access to their audit papers.
More than $15 billion has been raised this year through such secondary listings in Hong Kong, among them the blockbuster deals by e-commerce giant JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc., China’s second largest gaming company.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., China International Capital Corp. and Haitong International Securities Group Ltd. were joint sponsors of the listing.

370,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 01, 2020 09:28PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Up Over Chinese Data, But Volatility Remains Ahead of U.S. Election","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Monday morning, boosted by positive data from China but with investors jitters over the overall global economic recovery from COVID-19 and the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3 capping gains.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.27% by 10:19 PM ET (2:19 AM GMT), while the Shenzhen Componentwas up 0.88%. Data released earlier in the day showed that the Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for October rose to 53.6, ahead of the predicted 53 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com. The data follows the growth also seen in the manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs, released on Saturday, which rose to 51.4 and 56.2 respectively. The manufacturing PMI was slightly down from September’s reading of 51.5. The Caixin services PMI is due later in the week.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.39%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.41% and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.84%. In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.33%.
The U.K. became the latest country to announce restrictive measures, with a second lockdown to begin later in the week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday. The measures come as the U.K. sees more than 20,000 cases daily, with over 10 million cases in Europe alone.
Across the Atlantic, the U.S. saw a daily death toll of close to 1,000 people. The incessantly rising numbers of COVID-19 cases, uncertainty over a tight U.S. election, Congress’ failure to pass the latest stimulus measures ahead of Nov. 3, and the gloomy economic outlook are all dampening investors’ risk appetite.
Although opinion polls still show that Democrat candidate Joe Biden is ahead of incumbent president Donald Trump, some investors were wary of predicting the election outcome as a contested election could still be possible.
“It’s going to be a big week with the U.S. election on Tuesday being the main event … the U.S. election has tightened further over the last week, making it harder to call,” AMP (OTC:AMLTF) economist Shane Oliver told Reuters.
“The tightening is likely weighing on shares as it implies an increased risk of a contested election and less chance of substantial post-election fiscal stimulus to the extent that a blue wave that sees the Democrats win the presidency, control of the Senate and the House may be somewhat less likely,” he added.
Other investors agreed with Oliver.
“Whichever way you look at it, this coming week will be huge for U.S. and global markets … we see the potential for a sharp rise in volatility around these events, and all in the context of a still deteriorating COVID-19 situation across much of the U.S., Europe and elsewhere,” First Abu Dhabi Bank Pjsc. chief economist Simon Ballard told Bloomberg
Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve will hand down its policy decision on Thursday."

LONDON (Reuters) -  Lazard Ltd  has hired restructuring banker Sam Whittaker from PJT Partners (NYSE:PJT) to oversee negotiations between companies and their creditors across Europe, the Middle East and Africa as a second wave of COVID-19 leaves many businesses fighting for survival.
Whittaker, who started his banking career at Lazard (N:LAZ) in 2005 and then moved to fellow investment bank PJT in 2015, will re-join Lazard as a London-based managing director in its EMEA restructuring franchise.
The 45-year old Briton will work closely with David Burlison, who co-heads Lazard's EMEA restructuring practice, and Chris Mallon, who joined Lazard in April as a senior adviser.
""One of the many benefits of having Sam back is that he has an extensive network of relationships with banks, hedge funds and lawyers which clearly is a big plus for us,"" Burlison told Reuters.
The U.S. bank, which leads Refinitiv's league tables for this year's global restructurings ahead of PJT Partners and Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI), has also hired James Simpson as a director in October as part of a push to win business on behalf of companies with liquidity issues and their creditors.
Independent advisory firms with restructuring capability, such as Lazard and Houlihan Lokey, are in high demand as boardrooms seek to limit the damage of a new wave of lockdowns across Europe.
""The second wave of coronavirus has made capital requirements even more acute and exacerbated the need for a comprehensive debt restructuring,"" Burlison said.
""As household disposable income is increasingly reduced through the course of the pandemic, more companies are likely to run into trouble,"" he added.
Lazard's restructuring pipeline this year has been equally split between advising companies and their lenders. 
It has handled complex negotiations involving energy companies such as oil and gas producer Premier Oil and offshore oil drillers Valaris and Seadrill as well as hospital operator NMC Health.
The 172-year old bank - founded in New Orleans by French brothers Alexandre, Lazare and Simon Lazard as a dry goods merchant dubbed Lazard Frères & Co - is also close to a number of European companies, such as Spanish renewable energy firm Abengoa, that have used Chapter 11 in the United States as a conduit for restructuring their debt.
Burlison said restructuring mandates are the result of cooperation between various parts of the bank, including debt and equity capital markets as well as M&A advisory.

""We all work in unison to provide a full spectrum of solutions to clients facing difficult times or periods of stress,"" he said.

373,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>",Emerging-Market Traders Brace for Chaos as U.S. Election Looms,"(Bloomberg) -- The risks across emerging markets would be enough to occupy the minds of traders even in a normal week -- from debt sustainability and increased fiscal pressures to rising Covid-19 infection rates and geopolitical tensions.
But none of these will come close to capturing their attention as much as the result and aftermath of Tuesday’s U.S. election and what it means for global risk appetite.
Gauges of developing-nation stocks, currencies and local bonds had their worst weekly performance in more than a month in the five days through Friday as concerns over an unclear or contested outcome grew amid a surge in Covid-19 infections and record early voting. Investors have already positioned for a Democratic sweep of both the White House and Congress which will allow them to pass significant fiscal stimulus, lifting developing-nation currencies to a fifth month of gains in October, the best streak since 2017.
“As general nervousness levels rise -- absent a blue wave or Democratic sweep -- the prospect of a contested election is real,” said Ehsan Khoman, the head of Middle Eastern research at MUFG Bank in Dubai. “Such an outcome, which is far from a tail risk and, critically, how to hedge against this prospect, is top of the mind for emerging-market investors.”
Last week’s selloff in technology stocks and fresh coronavirus-related lockdowns across Europe are also adding to investors’ caution. Underscoring those anxieties, a measure of implied volatility for emerging-market stocks last week reached the highest level since June.
For some bulls though, any pullback in the market would offer a buying opportunity as they wager on an economic recovery and the prospect of a Covid-19 vaccine next year.
“The U.S. election is obviously a big event risk, but irrespective of the outcome, global fiscal taps are wide open and a Covid vaccine is not far,” said Nader Naeimi, head of dynamic markets at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney. “Further weakness in emerging-market stocks is likely, but that will be a once-in-a-generation opportunity to get on board the markets and sectors that have been left behind.”
Investors will also turn to central-bank decisions this week for clues on the next phase. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold fire on any additional stimulus measures in the midst of the election. Elsewhere, central banks in Malaysia, Poland and the Czech Republic will also decide on policy.

France entered its second national lockdown on Friday to try to contain a surge in infections. The curbs imposed under it include the closure of non-essential stores.
A spokeswoman for Amazon (O:AMZN) said the group had agreed to halt its radio advertising campaign around pre-Black Friday sales. 
A page with discounted items under the header ""Black Friday ahead of time"" was live on its French website on Saturday, however.
Junior Economy Minister Agnes Pannier-Runchaer said she had asked Amazon to suspend the campaign. It was ""not at all appropriate at a time when 200,000 businesses will have to shut their doors,"" she told Europe 1 radio on Saturday. 
A discount shopping day that takes place worldwide, Black Friday usually coincides with the Friday of the U.S. Thanksgiving Weekend.
Amazon's French campaign was due to run between Oct. 26 and Nov. 19. 
The online retailer had to shut some of its warehouses in France during the country's first lockdown this spring, after clashing with unions over sanitary conditions there. 
Pannier-Runacher, asked if Amazon would be allowed to maintain a campaign for Black Friday sales this year, said it was not yet clear. ""It's a matter we will have to work on with all retailers,"" she said. 
French restaurants, cafes and shops not selling essential goods will have to close for at least the next two weeks. 
The restrictions sparked an outcry across the country over bookstores in particular, with opposition politicians and literary figures calling for them to remain open. 

Fnac Darty (PA:FNAC), which sells books as well as electronic goods, said on Friday it would shut down its culture section in coming weeks out of solidarity, after chain stores came under fire as some will remain open.

KLM had been due to receive a 3.4 billion euro ($4.0 billion) package, including 1 billion euros in direct loans. from the government to help it cope with the damage from the coronavirus pandemic. 
""I find it very disappointing, but this way we cannot move forward with the loan now,"" Hoekstra told journalists.
The pilots' union argued that it had already agreed to a freeze until March 2022, and could not now change that agreement at the last minute.
Ahead of the government announcement, KLM CEO Pieter Elbers had said that ""without this loan, KLM will not make it through these challenging times"".
In a statement, he said KLM would not immediately go bankrupt but that its reserves ""cannot last more than a few months"".
In a letter to parliament, Hoekstra left the door open for the bailout if all KLM employees agreed to the five-year wage freeze.
""It is up to KLM and the unions to ensure that they meet the government's demands after all,"" he said, adding that the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic had changed expectations about how soon airlines could bounce back.
""The outlook is sombre, that makes it all the more important to have a good restructuring programme in place to work towards KLM's long-term recovery,"" he wrote. 
Unions representing ground and cabin crews have agreed to the extended wage freeze, which is set to last as long as the airline receives government support. 

Air France-KLM on Friday reported a 67% drop in third-quarter revenue to 2.52 billion euros, just as a new COVID-19 surge poses further threats to an industry devastated by the pandemic and the ensuing collapse in long-haul travel. The airline's net debt rose by 3 billion euros to 9 billion euros.

Investing.com -- Boomer Naturals started out in 2019 making healthy living products that provided the same treatment as CBD products, without the marijuana. What happened next, no one could have predicted.
In April, as the Covid-19 pandemic upended business as usual, Las Vegas-based Boomer Naturals dropped everything and started churning out face masks. And thanks to earlier talks with the drug store giant CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), it now sells those masks in some 8,000 stores, of more than 9,900 locations. The first shipment went out in July.""The reception's been very good, with a lot of repeat orders and planning for additional orders,"" said Chief Executive Officer Mike Quaid in a phone interview with Investing.com. He declined to provide exact sales figures. ""We sell quite a bit of masks daily in all of these stores so the volume is very good""”
Boomer Naturals is talking to national chains in Canada and Mexico to enter those markets.  
""We're able to supply over a million masks a week right now,"" Quaid said. ""We're in a great position to help out anybody and everybody.""
The rewards are looking to be handsome. Sales for the quarter that ended Oct. 31 are expected to come at between $30 million and $35 million, more than three times the previous quarter's sales, which totaled $9.5 million. That's in large part thanks to CVS. 
""We're very excited about having been able to get involved in this new industry; unfortunately, it came at the cost of a lot of folks getting sick and people dying,"" Quaid told Investing.com. ""We are hopeful we are making a nice impact and saving lives.""
The masks it sells are produced in Vietnam, where Quaid sees a world of opportunity amid the U.S.-China trade war to make goods of all kinds currently produced in China.
""We've been introduced to the manufacturing world in Vietnam,"" Quaid said. ""Given the geo-political environment and consumer opinion and where they want their products to come from, China is in disfavor to a certain degree.""
Boomer Naturals, which started trading over the counter earlier this year, turned to Vietnam on the suggestion of a Vietnamese executive within the company familiar with nano-silver masks popular in the country. The company secured exclusive rights at three manufacturers to produce masks for the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control-approved masks are reusable and well-priced, according to Quaid.
""We haven't seen anything less than $25; ours are $9.99 and $7.99,"" Quaid said. That said, Boomer masks are among the premium CVS offerings. 
""We feel like we kinda have the premium tech sector in the masks world locked up to a certain degree,"" Quaid said, in part because of exclusivity with its Vietnamese partners.
Talks with CVS had originated over the company's original CB5 products, which target the body’s endocannabinoid system (ECS), but don't contain any CBD. Anything with the marijuana-derived ingredient is restricted by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission, and Boomer saw an opportunity to sell a similar product but one able to be advertised and sold freely. 
The products had begun to make headway in the world of golf, chiropractors and through a deal with Tommy Bahama. Then came Covid-19. CVS didn't pick up Boomer's CB5 line, but the contact proved fruitful anyway.
Boomer Naturals has been approached by several companies looking to move sourcing away from China, Quaid said, including hospitals needing gowns and bedding. Even clothing sold at CVS could be an opportunity, he said. 
""The sky's the limit,"" said Quaid. ""We've got our people out looking at various types of products.'’

Investing.com -- The U.S.-China trade war doesn't much scare off Danton Goei. The portfolio manager for the Davis Funds sees Chinese consumer companies growing regardless of tariffs as the population urbanizes. 
And that's why they are among the top holdings of the exchange-traded funds Davis Select Worldwide (NASDAQ:DWLD) and Davis Select International (NASDAQ:DINT), Goei said in an ETF Think Tank webinar on Oct. 27 with Dan Weiskopf, lead ETF strategist at the organization.  
""Today we think there is a huge opportunity in part because of the U.S.-China tension,"" Goei said, citing the dramatic drop in shares for companies like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and New Oriental Education & Technology (NYSE:EDU) in late 2018, when the war started. 
Chinese consumer companies are expected to benefit from a population that is increasingly moving to cities and becoming consumer spenders, Goei said. The ETFs are limited to about 30 companies versus, say, the almost 3,000 in the MSCI ACWI Index. 
""We don't think there are 3,000 great or even good companies out there,"" Goei said. ""Focusing on 20 or 30 of these great businesses is the way to go for the long term.""
DINT, with $238 million of assets, is up 8% for the year, while DWLD, with $287 million assets, rose more than 4%. Both, however, have recovered more than 58% since slipping in March along with the rest of the market. 
As of Sept. 30, Alibaba, New Oriental and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com are among the top three holdings for both DWLD and DINT, the former of which is global and the latter of which is global ex-U.S., according to data from the Davis website.
New Oriental Education & Technology ""is a leader in after-school tutoring,"" Goei said. In Chinese culture, education is very important, and the country is becoming more of a value-added economy with the number of students currently using after-school services at 30% versus neighbor North Korea, which is closer to 80% and 90%. They have invested deeply in online learning -- before the pandemic -- and they pay teachers 20% higher than others, attracting the best, Goei said.   
""They have a huge competitive advantage, they're taking share every year,"" he said. 
Alibaba's another big bet, one that Davis bought into at the initial public offering and has added ownership since. 
Setting 2020 aside, Goei travels every summer to Asia or Europe, and spends a lot of time with the companies he invests in. He likes financials in well-run countries like Norway, as well as Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) as its semiconductor bet. But China's truly where his attention seems set.
The ""middle class consumer companies have so little to do with tariffs,"" Goei said.

381,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 31, 2020 09:29AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: The Case for Eli Lilly,"By Christiana Sciaudone and Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Eli Lilly disappointed investors with its third-quarter earnings report on Tuesday but despite that it may be worth it for long-term investors to consider buying shares of the drugmaker, particularly at current levels. Investing.com's Christiana Sciaudone argues the bull case for Eli Lilly, while Geoffrey Smith explains why there are better value stocks to buy now. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bull Case
Don't let this week's earnings dissuade you from buying Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). 
Guidance did take a hit for 2020. It was lowered to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.40 on a reported basis from $6.48 to $6.68. And, yes, third quarter earnings did miss estimates, with earnings per share of $1.54 comparing to the estimated $1.71 on sales of $5.74 billion, versus the expected $5.87 billion.
But as JPMorgan points out, most of the factors contributing to that disappointment are one-offs, like operating expenses that increased 9%, driven by higher marketing and research and development investments, including $125 million to develop potential Covid-19 therapies.
“Our favorable view on LLY’s fundamental business remains largely unchanged and we continue to see the company as one of the best positioned names in our coverage,” JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts led by Chris Schott wrote in a note after earnings were published. “We highlight healthy volume momentum across the base portfolio (as seen with strong volume growth of 7% in 3Q), a range of next-generation pipeline assets (tirzepatide, mirikizumab, Loxo-305, several Alzheimer’s call options) as well as a significant margin expansion story (we continue to anticipate high 30s% range over time).” The stock is trading at about 16.9 times JPMorgan’s 2021 estimated EPS, with shares flat for the year at the time the report was published, which is a “great entry point ahead of several significant catalysts over the next few quarters,"" the firm said.
Note, too, that results were actually not bad: Revenue in the third quarter increased 5% driven by volume growth of 9%, while on a year-to-date basis revenue rose 6% driven by volume growth of 12%.
JPMorgan raised its estimates for the fourth quarter, and maintained its overweight rating on Eli Lilly.
Analysts in general are pretty solid on the stock, which has seven buys, two holds and not a sell in sight. 
And then you have the U.S. government giving Eli Lilly a helping hand. 
This week, the company announced that the U.S. government will pay Eli Lilly $375 million to supply 300,000 doses of its experimental antibody drug to treat the coronavirus. The deal is for delivery over the two months following an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. The U.S. government also has the option to purchase 650,000 more doses through June 30.
""The U.S. is experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases and associated hospitalizations, and we believe bamlanivimab could be an important therapeutic option that can bring value to the overall healthcare system, as it has shown a potential benefit in clinical outcomes with a reduction in viral load and rates of symptoms and hospitalizations,"" said Chief Executive Officer David A. Ricks in a statement.
If an emergency authorization is granted, the U.S. said patients will have no out-of-pocket costs. It is developing an allocation program for bamlanivimab. As part of the program, Lilly is partnering with Operation Warp Speed and a national distributor to finalize distribution plans and shipping preparations.
Lilly anticipates manufacturing up to one million doses of bamlanivimab 700 mg by the end of the year – with 100,000 doses ready to ship within days of authorization. The supply of Lilly's antibody therapy is expected to increase substantially beginning in the first quarter of 2021 as it adds manufacturing resources.    
There is more brewing: The company entered into an agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, as part of the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, to facilitate access to future Lilly therapeutic antibodies under development for the potential prevention and treatment of Covid-19 to benefit low- and middle-income countries.
And then there's Lilly's baricitinib combined with President Donald Trump's favorite, remdesivir. Lilly and Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) Corporation presented data showing together the drugs reduced time to recovery and improved clinical outcomes for patients with Covid-19 infection compared with remdesivir. 
All signs point to a YES on LLY.
The Bear Case
The bear case for Eli Lilly is a variant on the old adage of not trying to catch a falling knife. It may not be the next  Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY) or Wirecard, but there is no glossing over the fact that bamlanivimab is not the drug that will make the difference between dying of Covid-19 and not dying of it.
A look at the share price tells you how much this matters. From a high of over $169 in July, the stock has fallen 23% and now trades at a seven-month low.
True, the U.S. government has dished out a $375 million consolation prize which more than covers development spend, but Lilly had built up hopes that it could treat advanced cases of the coronavirus, and trial evidence suggests that it only has an effect on milder cases. In other words, not the kind of drug that health systems will break the bank for to get their hands on.
Nor should this week’s earnings miss be glossed over. Marketing and R&D are not ‘one-off’ mishaps, they are part and parcel of the pharma business, and Lilly will face comparable challenges in every future quarter. The cost overruns warrant skepticism.
The near-term outlook is not the brightest either. In a conference call after this week’s earnings release, management guided for a decline of up 10% in average prices for its suite of other drugs in 2021. High unemployment, a healthcare system still focused on getting the pandemic under control, and – in all likelihood – a Democratic administration looking to squeeze drug prices harder to narrow the record deficit it will inherit will all generate headwinds next year.
It’s true that, if Covid-19 can be tackled by throwing billions of dollars to some other company whose drug has more tangibly positive effects, the rest of Lilly’s business, especially its new drug for type 2 diabetes should be able to enjoy the benefits of a positive secular outlook. But if that happy scenario materializes, then there is better value to be found elsewhere, rather than in a stock that still trades at over 21 times trailing earnings.

""We have a number of options of financing. We are reviewing that all the time,"" Lundgren told Reuters in an interview ahead of the opening of a new airport in the German capital.
""I am not against state aid,"" he said. ""It is very clear that the crisis has been to that extent that you can't expect the industry and its players to cope with it all by themselves.""
With travel across Europe at very low levels, most airlines are bleeding cash, but easyJet's finances have come under particular scrutiny amid media reports that it has signalled to the UK government it may need more financial support.
The airline has warned it will make an annual loss of as much as 845 million pounds ($1.09 billion) for the 12 months that ended in September.
To survive the impact of the pandemic, it has raised more than 900 million pounds from the sale and leaseback of aircraft, taken a 600 million pound loan from the government, cut 4,500 jobs and tapped shareholders for 419 million pounds.

Tightening coronavirus restrictions across Europe mean that easyJet, which before the pandemic was the fifth biggest airline in Europe by passenger numbers, is planning to fly just 25% of capacity for the rest of 2020.

The deal was widely expected after the three banks announced a strategic alliance in May. It marks a new chapter in the shake-up of a banking system that has seen local players gain influence under nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
The state will have a 30.35% stake in the new group, to be called Magyar Bankholding, according to a statement by minister Andrea Mager posted on MTI. The owners of MKB Bank will hold 31.96% and Takarekbank will have 37.69%.
The value of the new banking group will exceed 740 billion forints ($2.35 billion), the minister said.
The government had for years sought a buyer for BudapestBank, which it bought from  General Electric  (N:GE) for $700 million in 2015.
Under the new setup, for which central bank approval is still pending, the state's ownership in Budapest Bank will cease, the minister said.
MKB, which focuses mostly on corporate and private banking, exited a European Union restructuring process at the end of 2019, which had banned it from acquisitions and imposed limits on the size of its balance sheet.
Hungary's market leader is OTP Bank (BU:OTPB), centralEurope's largest independent lender.

The startup, which operates in more than 300 cities in 50 countries and saw revenue crumble as the pandemic halted air travel earlier this year, now takes customers from their offices or homes directly to the cities they used to fly to. 
""Our bread and butter business was the airport transfer, often at both destinations,"" said Chief Executive Jens Wohltorf. ""In April, revenues slumped to 1%, and since then we have started to reinvent ourselves, roll up our sleeves and fight our way out."" 
Blacklane advertises its intercity rides, which are currently available in Britain and Germany, with a safety promise and fair prices. 
""You are alone (in the car), you have the social distance, you know it is much more comfortable,"" Wohltorf said.
A one-way trip in a limousine from Berlin to Frankfurt costs from around 50 euros ($59), to Hamburg from around 180 euros and to Munich from around 350 euros. This compares with train ticket prices to Frankfurt, for instance, of 23-200 euros. 
Revenue is now back between 30% and 50% of pre-crisis levels depending on the cities, the group, which had initially planned to break even this year, said. 
It will take time to reach last year's revenue of around 100 million euros, but the company still hopes for fresh money from investors and a future stock market listing.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services said on Friday that CoreLogic Inc (N:CLGX) shareholders should elect three of investor group  Cannae  Holdings (N:CNNE) and Senator Investment Group's nominees as more bidders try to buy the company.
ISS backed the dissident group's nominees Steve Albrecht, Wendy Lane and Henry Winship, citing their independence, expertise in evaluating mergers and acquisitions, and ability to contribute better governance at the U.S. property data and analytics group. They should replace CoreLogic's three longest-serving directors on its 12-member board at the Nov. 17 meeting, the report said.
ISS issued its recommendation only days after  CoStar Group  (NASDAQ:CSGP) and a private equity consortium led by Warburg Pincus and GTCR emerged as bidders to purchase CoreLogic four months after Cannae and Senator first proposed to buy it.
New directors could monitor a sales process after suitors this week submitted expressions of interest for more than $80 a share, far above Cannae and Senator's $66 a share offer.
CoreLogic's shares closed at $76.93 on Friday and have climbed 12% in the last five days.
""Shareholders would benefit from the presence of new directors to ensure that the engagement with potential acquirers is managed to maximize value, especially considering the auspicious timing of the new indications of interest and the dissidents' apparent role in encouraging other bidders to emerge,"" the ISS report said.
The battle between CoreLogic and Cannae and Senator is becoming one of the season's most hotly contested with the investor group criticizing the company's financial performance and stewardship while the company said the investors' takeover bid is too low.
Cannae and Senator propose to replace nine board members and pointed to recent exits by top 10 CoreLogic shareholders as evidence that investors expect a sale of the company.
ISS criticized CoreLogic's ""substantial"" underperformance and worried that the board ""has yet to demonstrate a commitment to running a fair process.""
It also frowned on Chairman Paul Folino's ""stutter steps in the board's handling of recent inbound interest,"" but stopped short of recommending that shareholders remove him.
Folino said ISS ""reached the wrong conclusion in its recommendation for three Senator/Cannae nominees."" Current directors have created value for shareholders and the board is engaging with potential bidders for the company, he said, urging shareholders to reject Cannae/Senator nominees so that current directors can continue ""ongoing efforts to maximize shareholder value.""

(Reuters) - Inspire Brands Inc will buy Dunkin' Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN) Group Inc for $8.76 billion, the two companies said late on Friday, bringing chains like Arby's and Dunkin' Donuts under the same umbrella in one of the largest restaurant deals.
Inspire Brands, which owns Arby's, Buffalo Wild Wings and Sonic Drive-In, said its all-cash deal to take the owner of Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins chains private would value it at $106.50 a share. That represents a nearly 20% premium over Dunkin's last closing share price on Oct. 23, before the New York Times first reported the deal talks.
Including debt, the deal is valued at about $11.3 billion, the companies said.
Sales at Dunkin' and Baskin-Robbins have improved from their lockdown lows in recent weeks, boosted by strong demand for its curbside pickup, drive-thru and delivery options.
Dunkin' and Baskin-Robbins on Thursday posted a surprise rise in U.S. comparable sales in the third quarter.
Dunkin' and Baskin-Robbins will operate as distinct brands within Inspire, the companies said.
""We are excited to bring meaningful value to shareholders who ... believe that Inspire Brands ... will continue to drive growth for our franchisees while remaining true to all that is unique and special about the Dunkin’ and Baskin-Robbins brands,"" Dunkin' Brands Chief Executive Officer Dave Hoffmann said.
Dunkin' Brands operates 12,900 Dunkin' restaurants and more than 8,000 Baskin-Robbins stores around the world. Inspire Brands, which was formed in 2018 by private equity firm Roark Capital as a holding company, has a portfolio of more than 11,000 restaurants.
""They will strengthen Inspire through their scaled international platform and robust consumer packaged goods licensing infrastructure, as well as add more than 15 million loyalty members,"" Paul Brown, chief executive officer of Inspire Brands, said.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the confirmation of deal.

 Barclays  (LON:BARC) was the financial adviser to Inspire, while BofA Securities advised Dunkin’ Brands.

387,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 08:30PM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: Big tech stocks may face post-election headwinds, no matter who wins","By David Randall and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors are betting the technology and communications stocks that drove a massive rebound in U.S. markets this year will face a tougher slog in coming months, no matter whether Republican President Donald Trump or Democratic challenger Joe Biden wins Tuesday's election. 
Betting against big technology has been a risky proposition over the last decade, as stocks like Amazon, Google and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) have shot higher at the expense of so-called value and cyclical stocks such as banks and energy companies. 
Recently, however, some fund managers say they are growing alarmed by what they see as a consensus in Washington to tighten regulations, and prospects that another large stimulus bill would bolster a rotation out of tech and into other sectors including economically sensitive value stocks. 
""There will be a shift and it is starting, but it will take time,"" said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors, which cut its exposure to large-cap tech in September to neutral from overweight. 
Should Biden win as polls suggest, technology companies could face higher tax rates and tax-motivated selling as well as increased regulation, investors said. 
Both Trump and Biden have criticized large tech companies but stopped short of explicitly calling for them to be broken up. Trump has said “there is something going on in terms of monopoly” when asked about big tech firms. 
Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) now make up approximately 23% of the total weight of the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, giving their gyrations an outsized impact on broader markets.
Hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, a longtime tech bear, told clients in a letter this week that tech stocks were in the middle of an “enormous bubble” that popped when the S&P 500 hit its record high on Sept. 2, 2020. 
Technology stocks tumbled in the past week's selloff, though earnings results from companies like Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon have shown how the tech giants expanded their businesses this year. 
""It has become more difficult for mega-cap tech to surprise on the upside,"" analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management said in a note Friday.
Some investors pointed to recent hearings in Washington as a sign that increased regulations will come to the sector no matter which party takes control in Washington. 
The Justice Department’s lawsuit against Google in late October marked the first time the U.S. government has cracked down on a major tech company since it sued Microsoft Corp MSFT.O for anti-competitive practices in 1998. 
""This may be the only bi-partisan issue out there,"" Pacific Life's Gokhman said.
An expected $2 trillion stimulus package by Biden, who leads Trump in national polls by 10 percentage points, could enhance the appeal of out-of-favor stocks like construction equipment and materials companies, investors said.
A shift to value stocks ""is increasingly likely over the next 12 months,"" said Eduardo Costa, who runs hedge fund Calixto Global Investors, LP. 
Calixto, which invests largely in technology, media, and telecom stocks, has returned 30% since January, an investor said.
Potentially higher taxes under a Biden administration are another worry. Biden has proposed increasing the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, potentially weighing on companies' earnings. 
A separate proposal to tax capital gains and dividends as ordinary income could prompt some investors to sell winners in order to lock in lower tax rates, analysts said.
Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management, said his firm has been underweighting the Nasdaq Composite and is moving more of its portfolios into cyclical stocks with more compelling valuations, especially industrials. 

""We've done some scenario analysis and thinking through various permutations of who controls Congress and the White House and our general view is that it might not matter all that much,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of business leaders and public policy experts is launching a new body to grapple with thorny questions surrounding the future of transportation including self-driving and electric vehicles.
The Commission on the Future of Mobility, reported earlier by Reuters, was formally unveiled on Friday. The group plans to propose a new regulatory framework to address a global transportation sector ""on the cusp of a worldwide transition driven by shared, connected, autonomous, and electric technologies.""
Alisyn Malek, the commission's executive director, told Reuters the goal is to tackle tough problems and improve safety.
""Let's bring everybody together to talk about how do we want the movement of people and goods to actually work,"" Malek said in an interview.
Autonomous cars and delivery trucks, package-carrying drones, air taxis, connected vehicles and Hyperloop systems are among transit advances that could revolutionize travel. 
Traffic crashes remain a major problem. The World Health Organization estimates 1.35 million people die and 20 to 50 million are injured annually in vehicle crashes.
The commission will be co-chaired by Jared Cohon, president emeritus of Carnegie Mellon University, former Ford Motor (N:F) CEO Jim Hackett and Transdev Group CEO Thierry Mallet.
""Progress can only continue if we modernize the way policy and regulation work,"" Hackett said.
Governments, including the United States, have struggled to adopt regulations to allow for wide-scale adoption of next-generation transportation like self-driving cars amid safety concerns.
Regulators are hiking fuel efficiency requirements, while California and many European countries want to end new gasoline-powered passenger vehicle sales by 2035.
The commission says in an overview document that ""current regulatory requirements governing fuel economy standards and vehicle safety fail to reflect the transformation occurring in powertrains, autonomy, and models of mobility.""
The group wants to recommend in 2022 ""a framework for regulations in the American, European, and Asian markets post-2025 that reflects and facilitates the technological transformation taking place"" for emissions and safety regulations.
 Goodyear Tire  & Rubber (O:GT) CEO Richard Kramer, FedEx (N:FDX) CEO Fred Smith and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) CEO Steven Mollenkopf will be on the commission, as will  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) Chief Operating Officer José Muñoz. It expects to add members before its February kickoff.
The commission is housed within SAFE, a nonpartisan organization focusing on energy security issues.

SAFE CEO Robbie Diamond said the goal is to rethink everything. ""If you had to rewrite regulations and policy from scratch knowing what we know about technology today ... what you would do differently?"" he asked. ""We want to think big.""

The U.S. Justice Department sued Google on Oct. 20, accusing the $1 trillion company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals in the biggest challenge to the power and influence of Big Tech in decades.
The federal government alleges that Google acted unlawfully to maintain its position in search as well as search advertising. Google has denied any wrongdoing.
In a status conference on Friday, John Schmidtlein, who represents Google, agreed to tell the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by Nov. 13 if the search and advertising giant planned to ask for the case to be thrown out on summary judgment.
Following a bit of sparring between lawyers for the government and Google, Judge Mehta said the two sides should make initial disclosures about potential witnesses and evidence that may be used at trial by Nov. 20. 
The judge asked the two sides to produce by Nov. 6 a status report on a protective order, which would protect third parties like Google customers who provide evidence for the government.
The next status conference was set for Nov. 18.
The judge, who was randomly selected, also disclosed personal links to Google, including a cousin who worked for the company and a friend who had been an executive there.
Mehta said he did not know his cousin's role at Google. ""I will confess to you I don't know what he does,"" the judge said.
Google declined to confirm the cousin's identity or specify his role.
Antitrust experts have said Mehta, who was nominated to the Washington court by President Barack Obama, was a good pick for the government because he is not seen as pro-business.
Judges' familial connections sometimes are challenged by parties in a lawsuit when seeking a different judge. It is unclear whether Google, or the government, would try to get Mehta to recuse himself.

U.S. law requires a judge disqualify ""himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned."" The law cites situations such as where ""a person within the third degree of relationship"" to the judge or the judge's spouse is an officer or director of the company, a potential material witness or someone who could be ""substantially affected"" by the case.

The Defiance Next Gen SPAC Derived ETF (SPAK), which primarily tracks companies that raise money for buying businesses, has plunged more than 14% since its October debut. Online sports-betting company DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc. has tumbled about 40% this month, while Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc. -- a developer of space vehicles -- is down about 9%.
Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, have become a hot area of the market as a way for purchasers to avoid the costly and time-consuming initial public offering process. Instead, they sell shares of a company that has no operations, promising to use the money within two years to buy a private one. But after a giant rally in 2020, those stocks were engulfed in the market rout, and extended losses on Friday as volatility remained elevated heading into next week’s presidential vote.

395,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>",Big-Tech Earnings Provoke Deeper Scrutiny of Lofty Valuations,"(Bloomberg) -- The latest batch of technology earnings is stoking concern that the stocks largely responsible for the market’s rebound from the depths of the coronavirus-driven selloff may have reached an inflection point.
Technology and internet stocks tumbled on Friday, extending a recent downtrend, after results from the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). failed to live up to investors’ expectations. While all three reported results that beat estimates by some measures, they weren’t seen as strong enough to justify the lofty valuations that the shares have reached.
“After pandemic-linked growth gains so far this year, we think that it has become more difficult for megacap tech to surprise on the upside,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a research note. Valuations for large-cap technology companies appear “fair at current levels given expected earnings growth,” he said.
Megacap technology stocks have been the standouts in the S&P 500 Index this year, rallying more than 20% in the best showing among 11 main industry groups, while the broader market rose less than 1%. Even as much of the economy struggled against shutdowns and broad economic weakness, big tech thrived as the pandemic accelerated longstanding shifts toward online retail, cloud computing and digital advertising.
Gina Martin Adams, Bloomberg Intelligence’s chief equity strategist, points out that technology stocks have been “derating relative to the S&P 500 since early September,” which she says has been driven by fundamental trends that are likely to continue to pressure them.
The price-to-earnings premium for tech stocks relative to the S&P 500 is 20%. And even excluding the largest companies, the sector trades more than two standard deviations above average, according to BI’s analysis.
“This is fine when tech is producing much stronger earnings growth than the S&P 500, as it has this year, but things could change in 2021,” Adams wrote on Friday. “Tech is expected to produce about 16% EPS growth, vs. 25% for the S&P 500 -- a differential that could continue to work against tech stocks.”
Earlier this week, investor David Einhorn wrote that tech stocks are in an “enormous” bubble, one that “has already popped,” with the September peak serving as the top. The head of hedge fund Greenlight Capital cited lofty valuations, market concentration in a small group of stocks, and mania in IPOs as signs of a bubble.

Investing.com-- Chegg (NYSE:CHGG) reported stellar results this week, but the numbers either weren't good enough or investors were ready to take profits. 
Shares of the online education company have fallen about 14% since it reported earnings on Monday, which included revenue that grew 64% year-over-year and profit of 17 cents a share, beating the 10-cent estimate. It guided revenue of about $775 million for 2021, up from an expected $626 million to $628 million for 2020. 
""It's a little bit of a head-scratcher, for us,"" said Chief Financial Officer Andy Brown. ""We had strong third quarter earnings and a nice guide up for the fourth quarter, and we guided for 2021 which nobody I'm aware of has done. Our biggest shareholders are also scratching their heads."" Chegg, a beneficiary of the pandemic that sent college students home in March, rose about 218% to hit a record in August. The stock is currently trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of 58 times, according to Yahoo Finance. That compares to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s 35 times. Brown doesn't begrudge profit-takers, and says because of the nature of the company, it's value is no surprise. 
""We've defined a category, we're clearly the leader in the category,"" Brown said in a video interview. When that happens, ""you typically get a premium valuation.""
The company's not resting on its laurels, though, and Brown sees the moment as just the beginning, in the U.S. and abroad.
While the U.S. continues to be a healthy growth area, the pandemic showed that there is heavy demand from non-English speaking countries, which hadn't been on their radar before, Brown said. 
""We're starting to see subscriptions coming from countries we never imagined 12 months ago,"" Brown said. Among the 190 countries identified are Turkey, South Korea and Saudi Arabia. ""That to us is super exciting and we've essentially leaned into that growth.""
Chegg is making incremental investments in technology, content and marketing to support that growth and is targeting 15 to 20 countries that could become highly relevant. 
The company also accelerated investing into preventing password sharing and appears to have eliminated some 85% of the problem that had begun to plague the system. 
And growth won't just come organically. Skills-based learning is a newer area for the company and expected to expand.
""Are we acquisitive? The answer is yes,"" Brown said. Chegg has acquired about a company a year, and may seek out smaller competitors to snap up. ""Could I imagine us acquiring more in the skills space? The answer is yes.""

PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (N:BA) is unlikely to launch a new plane in the near future but its options will depend in part on how successfully its grounded 737 MAX regains its position in the market, the head of one of its engine suppliers said on Friday.
The MAX is expected to win safety approval within weeks following a 19-month grounding in the wake of two crashes,  Safran  (PA:SAF) Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin said.
""We are doing everything with Boeing to put the MAX back in service in the best possible conditions,"" he told reporters.
Boeing, suppliers and leasing companies - all of whom invested heavily in the MAX - have pushed back against the idea of replacing it despite mounting cancellations.
But Boeing is expected to try to capture eye-catching orders to recover some of the share lost to Airbus (PA:AIR), especially the increasingly dominant A321neo.
If airlines stop buying the MAX or fail to reabsorb it into their fleets, there has been speculation Boeing could obliquely begin the process of replacing it by first developing a replacement for the out-of-production 757.
This is a slightly larger single-aisle jet occupying a spot in the market overlapping with the MAX and A321neo family. 
It is therefore seen as a possible starting point for a design that could eventually pivot to a full MAX replacement.
Petitcolin said the 737 MAX was likely to stay in service until 2035, implying development of a successor would not start until 2027 with pre-marketing starting in 2025.
If the MAX failed to reassert itself in the market, Boeing could theoretically be tempted to bring that forward to 2022-23.
""The success or otherwise of the return to service of the MAX could - I am speaking hypothetically - influence Boeing's decision whether to launch a plane earlier,"" he said.
A new model is ""in the realm of possibilities even if today it is not the solution or option that we consider the most probable,"" Petitcolin told reporters.
Boeing, which has repeatedly said it is focusing solely on the MAX, was not immediately available for comment.
Reuters first reported in April that Boeing had been studying a possible 757 replacement to thwart the A321neo, though plans for this and a potential revamped 767 cargo jet had been placed on a back-burner during the crisis.
Fresh reports pushed up Boeing shares earlier this week. Senior industry sources said Boeing would not launch a new jet soon, though some analysts have urged it to do so.

Boeing is meanwhile studying refinements of larger MAX variants including the MAX 9, they said. The Air Current reported this week that Boeing was looking at updating the MAX 10.

NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Large Wall Street banks have been running ""war game"" drills in their trading businesses and preparing clients for unexpected scenarios around the U.S. election next week, hoping to avoid liquidity crunches or technical errors as markets react to news of who will be running the White House and Congress, industry sources said.
There is more confidence now than a few weeks ago that there will be a clear presidential winner, because Democrat Joe Biden has moved up in polls against incumbent Republican President Donald Trump. However, the two men are tied in some key states, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, suggesting it may not be a slam dunk.
Traders, bankers and wary fund managers told Reuters they are preparing for a wide range of outcomes.
One bank's equities desk has been running drills across major trading hubs in New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong for a variety of scenarios to make sure systems can handle enormous volatility, an executive there told Reuters.
That bank has been reaching out to top customers to get a sense of how much they expect to trade and ask whether they need margin limits increased, and to suggest they send orders through approved electronic systems rather than calling, to avoid inadvertent mistakes, the person said.
Another global lender hired its own polling firm to check popular assumptions and prepare for unforeseen possibilities, an executive there said. The polling firm's work underscored the common assumption that Biden is likely to win, but the bank is preparing for other scenarios anyway, said the executive who, like some others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss non-public internal planning.
Only the most daring investors are going into Nov. 3 with large trading positions, several sources said. Most do not want to be forced sellers if they get things wrong. Plus, even those who bet correctly risk the chance of a drawn-out election battle where markets flip back and forth for weeks or months.
""I don't think anybody is willing to bet on any particular outcome,"" said Peter Kraus, a former executive at Wall Street banks including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) who founded asset management firm Aperture Investors in 2018. ""The rational thing to do is to take your risk down.""
If Kraus were running a trading desk at a major bank today, he would tell traders to take as neutral a position as possible, he said. 
""I would much rather be coming into the election with a set of flat positions and liquidity and, if the worst happened, I would be able to service the trading volume,"" he said.
Since banks began preparing for the election, polls and circumstances have shifted several times – making lenders more jittery about any assumptions, even days before the event. In late September, bankers told Reuters they were prepping for a situation with no clear winner. 
Volatility has already begun to pick up in equity and currency markets over rising coronavirus statistics, giving some traders and bankers a queasy feeling about the days ahead. 
Contingency planning around major events is not unusual for major global banks, which face regulatory stress tests each year to ensure they have enough capital and liquidity to survive extreme scenarios. Big trading firms conduct similar trials, as do exchanges that have been planning for soaring volumes and technical glitches, as Reuters reported on Thursday.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes tumbled on Friday, dragged down by a slide in shares of tech heavyweights following their quarterly results, with a record rise in coronavirus cases and nerves over the presidential election adding to a downbeat mood.
The three main indexes were on course for their worst week since March on prospects of wider COVID-19 restrictions in Europe, while surging cases in the United States pushed hospitals to the brink of capacity.
The CBOE volatility index held at a 20-week high ahead of the final weekend before Election Day on Tuesday.
""We're two market days away from Election Day and people want to make sure that they're not completely caught off guard,"" said Pete Santoro, a Boston-based equity portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) tumbled about 5.5% after it posted the steepest drop in quarterly iPhone sales in two years due to the late launch of new 5G phones.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell 4.7% after it forecast a jump in costs related to COVID-19, while  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) shed 5.7% as it warned of a tougher 2021.
Tech and consumer discretionary sectors posted the steepest percentage declines.
Communication services got a boost from a 4.4% jump in shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc after the Google parent beat estimates for quarterly sales as businesses resumed advertising.
""There is a big selloff in those big tech names because they didn't live up to the hype and people are really worried about next week's election,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh.
President Donald Trump has consistently trailed Democratic challenger Biden in national polls for months, but polls in the most competitive states have shown a closer race.
At 12:32 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 239.82 points, or 0.90% to 26,419.29, the S&P 500 lost 41.73 points, or 1.26% to 3,268.38 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 237.30 points or 2.12% to 10,948.30. 
The third-quarter earnings season is past its halfway mark, with about 86.2% of S&P 500 companies topping earnings estimates, according to Refinitiv data. Overall, profit is expected to fall 10.3% from a year earlier.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) slumped about 20% after the micro-blogging site added fewer users than expected and warned the U.S. election could impact ad revenue.
 AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) gained 4.3% after the drugmaker raised its full-year profit forecast, bolstered by signs of recovery in demand for its Botox injection.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.3-to-1 ratio, while on Nasdaq, a 0.4-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

400,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>","Chevron, Exxon shrink spending as coronavirus cuts demand","By Jennifer Hiller, Arathy S Nair and Shariq Khan
(Reuters) - U.S. oil majors  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) cut spending aggressively in the third quarter in a race to offset weak trends in fuel demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, though the former managed a slim profit. 
Exxon posted its third straight quarter of losses on Friday and reduced spending plans for the coming year. 
In common with others in the sector, the two are laying off a substantial portion of their workforce and expect to cut costs further as they try to reverse years of weak stock performance, worsened by the impact of movement restrictions.
U.S. oil prices (CLc1) have dropped 41% this year as the coronavirus forced billions of people into lockdowns. Demand recovered in the late northern hemisphere summer, but nations including Germany, India and the United States are again tackling a surge in infections, dampening demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. 
The outlook for energy consumption ""depends on when the world - this country and other countries - get control of the pandemic and those activities resume. We don't know when that's going to be,"" said Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber.
Exxon shares were down 1.2% to $32.56 on Friday afternoon. Chevron shares gained 1.8% to $70.50. Exxon shares have lost half of their value this year; Chevron's are down 40%.
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil producer by production, earned $201 million in the most recent quarter, compared with a profit of $2.9 billion for the year-earlier period. Exxon posted a loss of $680 million, its third straight quarterly loss.
Exxon came into the year with an ambitious spending plan driven by investments in shale and offshore discoveries, particularly off the coast of Guyana. It originally planned to spend $33 billion in capital and exploration investment in 2020, though through three quarters it has instead spent just $16.6 billion.
SHAREHOLDER PAYOUT
Now, however, Exxon is focused on preserving its dividend.
Earlier this week, it announced plans to cut its workforce by about 15% but kept its fourth-quarter dividend at 87 cents a share, making 2020 the first year since 1982 that it has not raised its shareholder payout. 
""While we see the dividend as safe over the next 12 months, the cash flow outspend is massive under current conditions,"" analysts at Raymond James wrote.
The largest U.S. oil producer, which has slashed costs aggressively, is also evaluating whether to hold on to other North American assets. It could write down natural gas assets valued between $25 billion to $30 billion, and possibly part of its Canadian business, Imperial Oil (TO:IMO), it said.
""It is significant that Exxon is explicitly guiding to maintaining the dividend having reduced capex and potentially adding more divestments,"" said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at London-based Palissy Advisors.
Next year, Exxon said capital spending would be between $16 billion to $19 billion, versus an adjusted plan to spend around $23 billion this year.
The company, once the most valuable in the United States by market capitalization, was this month surpassed in value by wind and solar provider NextEra.
In the top U.S. oil field, the Permian Basin shale field, Chevron expects oil and gas output to dip to around 550,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, from 565,000 boepd this quarter, Breber said. It is likely to maintain that level until the global economy recovers.

Exxon's Permian output was around 401,000 boepd in the third quarter, up from the previous quarter, and it said its costs there had dropped 20%.

402,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>",Factbox: What impact would a Biden presidency have on the auto industry?,"(Reuters) - A central piece of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's bid for the White House is a drastic change in U.S. environmental policy.
Here is a detailed look at Biden proposals that would impact automakers should he defeat Republican President Donald Trump on Tuesday:
VEHICLE EMISSIONS
Biden's climate plan includes the promise to reinstate and advance more stringent fuel economy standards that were implemented during the Obama administration but rolled back by Trump.
Under the 2012 Obama rules, automakers had to reduce carbon dioxide emissions for passenger and light-duty vehicles by 3.5% annually from 2017 to 2021 and by 5% per year from 2022 to 2025. California has been allowed to set its own, stricter zero-emissions standards, which are followed by 12 other U.S. states.
Voicing concerns over the standards' cost to manufacturers, Trump in April finalized rules that lowered year-over-year emissions reductions to 1.5% through 2026. The administration also withdrew California's waiver to set stricter standards, sparking a legal battle and forcing automakers to pick a side in the fight.
Automakers said the policy reversal saved them at least $1 billion in annual compliance costs but left the industry divided. 
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Honda Motor Co (T:7267), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and others reached a compromise with California on emissions requirements, while General Motors Co (N:GM), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) sided with Trump in an effort to freeze out California and roll back emissions requirements.
Biden's plan states he will work on fuel economy standards that go beyond those set up under the Obama administration, but has not provided additional details. A June plan by the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives proposes reductions of at least 6% per year, starting in 2026.
ELECTRIC VEHICLES
Biden has promised $400 billion in public investment to transition to clean energy, including advanced battery technology and electric vehicles.
Under Biden's plan, the federal government will support states and local officials to build 500,000 new electric vehicle charging outlets by the end of 2030.
That would mark a significant increase from the United States' current charging infrastructure, which counts 87,600 charging outlets, according to U.S. Energy Department data. The European Union, by comparison, currently has 192,000 charging outlets, according to the European Alternative Fuels Observatory. 
CONSUMER EV INCENTIVES
Biden has said he wants to encourage consumers to buy electric cars through tax credits. The U.S. federal government is currently subsidizing electric cars with a $7,500 consumer tax break for the first 200,000 vehicles an automaker sells.
So far, only Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and General Motors have hit the cap. Subsidies for Tesla finished at the end of 2019, while those for GM ran out on March 31.
Congress at the end of 2019 declined to extend the cap to 600,000 electric vehicles per carmaker.
Biden has said he wants the tax credit to benefit middle-class consumers and prioritize the purchase of vehicles made in America. 
That could pose a challenge to some automakers other than Tesla. Ford plans to build many of its future electric vehicles in Mexico and Canada. GM is planning premium-priced electric Cadillac and Hummer models costing more than $100,000.
Biden has also said he wants to set up a ""cash for clunkers"" rebate program that would encourage Americans to trade their older, polluting cars for new electric vehicles.
That plan could be modeled after a $450 billion program introduced by U.S. Senate Democrats last year, aimed at replacing 63 million gas-powered cars with electric vehicles within 10 years. Under the plan, consumers would receive a rebate of at least $3,000 for trading in their car.
JOBS AND WORKERS
Biden has said his climate plan aims to create 1 million new jobs across the auto industry, from suppliers to manufacturers and infrastructure.
He has also said his policies should benefit union workers and create more unionized jobs. 
The United Auto Workers (UAW) union, representing more than 400,000 active members, in April reliably endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate. But nearly a third of UAW members defied their union's recommendation in the 2016 election by voting for Trump. Many auto workers are concerned that a switch to electric vehicles will destroy their jobs.
TRADE AND CHINA
It is not clear how Biden would wind down the trade war with China, which has restricted the flow of U.S. exports of vehicles and auto parts. The Biden team has said he would ""re-evaluate"" tariffs on imports of Chinese-made vehicles, parts and materials. 
Since those tariffs were levied, prices have risen on materials such as steel and aluminum, while manufacturing jobs have declined, according to the Federal Reserve.
Biden would likely take a multilateral approach with allied countries to blunt China's economic clout through stronger support for the World Trade Organization (WTO) and enforcement of existing trade rules, according to the Center for Automotive Research.

Biden is also expected to seek membership for the United States in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).

Investing.com -- Twitter sank almost 20% after adding fewer users than expected and forecasting a rise in costs.  
MDAUs, or monetizable daily active users, grew 1% to 187 million, below the consensus of 195 million, according to StreetInsider. The company also said it expects costs and expenses to increase about 20% year-over-year in the current quarter.  
Still, the company beat estimates, with earnings per share of 19 cents compared to the estimated 6 cents, on sales of $936 million, higher than the expected $769 million.
Despite the poor market reception, analysts from  Barclays  (LON:BARC) to Mizuho bumped up their price targets on the stock, according to StreetInsider. 
The company said ad revenue grew 15% from a year earlier to $808 million. While many brands slowed advertising in the second quarter amid U.S. civil unrest, they increased spending quickly thereafter, and Twitter expects September revenue trends to continue or improve. 
Susquehanna reiterated a positive rating on the stock, agreeing that momentum should continue through the current quarter.
""MDAUs were a little light of very elevated consensus expectations, but still extremely strong at 29% y/y growth,"" analyst Shyam Patil wrote in a note, according to StreetInsider. ""We remain buyers.""
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said it also sees a strong recovery in brand ads continuing through the end of the year, reiterating a neutral rating.

406,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 10:50AM ET</span>",Analysis: Dueling pre-election bets playing out in U.S. Treasury market,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The $20 trillion U.S. Treasury market is showing signs of life after months of sleepy trading, as opposing bets on how the economy will perform clash amid fresh worries over COVID-19 and jitters over Tuesday’s presidential election. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and UBS are among those that believe the recent rally in Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, may run a bit further, driven by expectations that lawmakers will eventually deliver a second round of fiscal stimulus to help the economy out of its coronavirus-induced slump. Net bets on lower prices for 30-year Treasuries by leveraged investors stood at record levels in futures markets as of last week.
Still, BlackRock thinks any further rise in yields would be limited, with the Federal Reserve likely to step in to support markets. In recent days, other investors are also betting that a COVID-19 resurgence and the possibility of a closer-than-expected presidential race may pull yields lower, especially if the election produces a split government, where continued political wrangling could reduce or delay a stimulus package. 
The moves illustrate how diverging views on future U.S. economic performance have reintroduced a measure of volatility into the market for U.S. government bonds. 
Expectations of record-low interest rates for years to come had largely suppressed market gyrations following a sharp coronavirus-fueled drop in yields in March. Some of that volatility has crept back into the market in recent weeks, with the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA MOVE Index (MOVE), which tracks traders' expectations of swings in the Treasury market, near its highest level since June. 
Graphic: Bond gyrations https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbpgwmxepq/Pasted%20image%201603821224747.png
Hugo Rogers (NYSE:ROG), chief investment officer at private bank Deltec International Group, has recently added to positions in longer-dated Treasuries, in part on expectations that a failure by Democrats to win a ""blue sweep"" in next week's elections will cause prices to rally.
The rally in yields ""is another false dawn,"" he said. ""It's a bet on a clean Democratic sweep, and honestly, some of these Senate races are looking very close.""
Exchange traded funds have reflected shifting bets on Treasuries, as yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury edged lower in the beginning of the week but rallied to close at 0.83% on Thursday.
The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond exchange traded fund (O:TLT), one way investors play moves in the Treasury market, saw some of the largest inflows among ETFs earlier this week but was hit with outflows on Thursday, according to Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.
In options markets, skew, which gauges demand for put options in relation to call options, has been shifting risk of a sharp move toward TLT rising and yields falling, Murphy said. Skew was near two-year highs at the beginning of the month, driven by expectations of rising yields. 
Options investors also put on straddle trades earlier this week that would benefit from 10-year yields remaining between 0.65% and 0.85%, said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at broker-dealer Incapital.
While a ""decent amount of the fast money community is thinking of the 'blue wave' scenario and large fiscal stimulus, that’s been only one part of the trade,"" said Haider Ali, head of U.S. Treasury trading at RBC Capital Markets. 
Real money accounts, a term often used to describe asset managers such as insurance companies and pension funds, ""are not buying into the narrative that this reflation trade is going to take hold and they are positioning accordingly,"" he said.
Graphic: Treasurys - CFTC net positions https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxagwdvx/Pasted%20image%201603918076608.png
How the rally plays out could ultimately depend on whether the Fed - which concludes its monetary policy meeting on Nov. 5, a day after the Treasury Department releases its quarterly refunding statement - will allow yields to continue rising in coming months.

""The market knows that there is a level that would cause (the Fed) to act,"" Leary said. Ten-year yields ""would be comfortably above 1.0% if the prospects of Fed purchases were not waiting in the wings.""

407,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Goldman money funds' liquidity buffer swells before U.S. election,"By Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - Two  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) money-market funds, whipsawed in March by billions of dollars of investor withdrawals, have steadily amassed a liquidity cushion much larger than rivals, as the $4.35 trillion industry braces for the outcome of the U.S. presidential election and another global surge in coronavirus cases. 
The funds’ weekly liquidity - a barometer of how quickly investments can convert to cash in a week - rose to 85% of total assets this week, according to disclosures https://www.gsam.com/content/gsam/us/en/advisors/fund-center/fund-finder/gs-financial-square-prime-obligations-fund.html#activeTab=holdings by the bank. That is about double the level when Goldman Sachs in March injected nearly $2 billion of the bank’s own capital into the funds to prevent them from falling below the regulatory weekly liquidity threshold of 30%.
“We actively manage liquidity in our funds as dictated by the market environment,” Goldman said in an email statement.
Average weekly liquidity at about 111 U.S. prime institutional money-market funds, like the Goldman funds, was 66% at the end of September, up from 54% in the year-ago period, a Reuters analysis of U.S. regulatory filings show. Those 111 funds hold about $300 billion in assets, or 9% of the $4.35 trillion in money funds.
Although they are among the tamest investment vehicles, prime funds can be riskier than money-market portfolios that primarily hold U.S. government bonds. The upside is they may offer more yield from holding short-term debt issued by an array of top-rated global banks, for example.
Despite regulatory efforts to make institutional prime money-market funds more resilient in times of stress, they remain vulnerable to massive withdrawals, especially by clients who need cash immediately to meet their own obligations. A U.S. official recently warned that decade-old reforms to the industry may not be enough to avert major outflows during a future crisis.
Stocks have swung significantly in recent days and more volatility is expected in the wake of the U.S. election.
Under new rules put in place after the 2008-2009 financial crisis, prime institutional money-market funds have discretion to block redemptions or to impose fees when weekly liquidity falls below 30%. These funds are susceptible to big, rapid-fire withdrawals by corporations, pensions, sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds, said money fund expert Pete Crane, president of research firm Crane Data.
“These types of investors move quickly,” Crane said.
Meanwhile, the 30% liquidity threshold's link to redemption gates has become an area of concern in the money fund industry. Investors see it as a bright line for slowing or blocking withdrawals, even though no fund boards used redemption gates or fees during the height of the March crisis.
A  Northern Trust  Corp (O:NTRS) prime fund twice fell below the 30% threshold, but redemptions were not blocked. The bank, however, liquidated the fund in May.
“The standard of 30 percent weekly liquidity became a new hair trigger,” Investment Company Institute President Paul Stevens said this week at a money-market symposium.
And that is what happened during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. Investors pulled a net $8.1 billion from the GS Financial Square Prime Obligations Fund  and the GS Financial Square Money Market Fund , according to Goldman fund disclosures. Weekly liquidity at the GS Financial Square Fund, for example, dropped to 34%, and was poised to fall more, before Goldman stepped in with capital support.
Over the two-week period from March 11 to March 24, net redemptions from publicly-offered prime institutional funds totaled 30 percent of the funds’ assets, or about $100 billion, according to an October report released by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
American households who parked their cash in retail prime funds were less twitchy, the SEC says. Withdrawals totaled $33 billion in March, or 7% of assets.
In the months after the first wave of coronavirus cases, some of the biggest players in the U.S. money market industry pulled the plug on prime institutional funds. The preference for funds primarily holding government debt, by institutions and households, has become clear, as assets in these portfolios topped $4 trillion this year.

Boston-based Fidelity Investments, for example, shut down two prime funds in August, even though their liquidity cushion was never threatened, citing the risk of large and frequent redemptions in times of market stress.

408,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 10:06AM ET</span>","Under Armour expects demand for sneakers, face masks to drive annual revenue","(Reuters) -  Under Armour  Inc (N:UA) (N:UAA) forecast its annual revenue above Wall Street expectations on Friday, as a pandemic-driven trend to exercise outdoors resulted in a surge in demand for running shoes and face masks.
The Baltimore-based company's shares rose as much as 11.6%, after it also decided to sell its MyFitnessPal health tracking platform for $345 million to private equity firm Francisco Partners.
As gym attendance drops due to the chance of the coronavirus spreading more in confined spaces, more people have opted to go running or biking outdoors, driving up sales of Under Armour's HOVR line of training shoes and other fitness gear.
The company's footwear revenue rose 19% to nearly $300 million in the third quarter. Accessories revenue rose 23% to $145 million, which Under Armour said was driven by sale of athlete-focused ""sports masks"". 
Like bigger rival  Nike  Inc (N:NKE), a large chunk of Under Armour's new demand was coming from its website and app, which pushed its e-commerce business up more than 50%. 
Overall quarterly revenue was largely flat at $1.43 billion in the quarter, pressured by a drop in demand at North American department stores and a 6% fall in apparel revenue, but was above expectations of $1.16 billion.
Excluding certain items, Under Armour earned 26 cents per share, beating expectations of 3 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.
The company said the sale of MyFitnessPal, which it bought in 2015 for $475 million, gives it more investment firepower and simplifies its larger digital fitness business. 
It forecast full-year revenue to fall by a high-teen percentage, compared with estimates of a 25.7% drop.

The company said it expects an annual adjusted loss of 47 cents to 49 cents per share, smaller than the 72 cents per share loss estimated by analysts.

409,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 09:54AM ET</span>",Volatility Markets Flash Signs of Distress After Turbulent Week,"(Bloomberg) -- Between a fresh surge in coronavirus cases and disappointment over Big Tech’s earnings, there are suddenly a lot of reasons for investors to be fearful.
The volatility curve is flashing a sign of distress last seen in April, and exchange-traded funds that bet on turbulence saw heavy trading in the pre-market this morning. Systematic strategies that use volatility as a trigger are poised to sell more, which could potentially add more pressure on the market, according to analysts at  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc.
After global shares surged to all-time highs less than two months ago, investors are now grappling with a reality check. European authorities have imposed strict lockdowns, U.S. virus cases hit a record and tech giants from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). are declining. For the S&P 500, it’s shaping up to be the worst week since March.
The equity benchmark dropped 0.5% as of 9:30 a.m. in New York. Among the most-traded ETFs before the opening bell was a product that shorts U.S. mega-cap tech stocks and another betting on higher short-term volatility.
In the options market, the curve of futures tied to the Cboe Volatility Index has remained in backwardation, or a downward sloping shape that typically only appears when market anxiety is high. In terms of the gap between one- and six-month contracts, the curve has not been in such an anomalous state since April, according to Evercore ISI.
“Election Day risk pricing has rebounded and likely reflects both event and virus uncertainty,” Stuart Kaiser, a strategist at UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) wrote in a note. “A drawn-out election outcome is still possible, and persistent growth and virus risks put a floor under the VIX near term.”
The VVIX, a measure of the implied volatility of the VIX, has spiked on strong demand for options on Wall Street’s fear gauge. More than $12 million was traded yesterday on calls expiring Nov. 18 that benefit if the VIX rises in the next two weeks.
Giant Trade Shakes Up VIX Options, Then Disappears: Taking Stock
Analysts are also drawing comparisons between VIX metrics now and four years ago.
On the Friday before the 2016 election, the volatility risk premium for the S&P 500 was near the highest level in the past decade, according to analysts at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA. The premium, a measure of the difference between realized and expected swings in the equity gauge, is similarly elevated now.
Some volatility strategies will likely have to de-risk after the recent bout of market turmoil, according to Nomura’s Charlie McElligott. He estimates that Wednesday’s rout prompted about $20 billion of selling in the futures market from algorithmic traders using volatility-sensitive strategies.
“Positions (in light of volatility) are now too large and have to be sized-down,” McElligott wrote on Thursday.

410,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 09:46AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Lower on Tech Disappointment; Dow Down 100 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower again on Friday, on course for their worst week since March, on disappointment at quarterly earnings reports from Big Tech and continued unease about both the coronavirus pandemic and next week's presidential election.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 102 points, or 0.4% at 26,557, while the S&P 500 was down 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.0%.
Among the biggest losers in early trading were Twitter stock, down 16.4% after its user growth slowed to a trickle in the third quarter, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, down 4.9% after reporting its steepest quarterly drop in iPhone sales in two years, although quarterly revenue and profit beat expectations.
At the other end of the scale, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock rose 5.8% to its highest in nearly two months after the Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) owner reported a sharp rebound in advertising revenue and promised to break out the results of its Cloud-hosting business.  Life sciences company AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) also rose 5.6% after reporting that the summer lull in the pandemic allowed its other businesses to flourish again. 
Markets weren't  noticeably reassured by data released earlier showing that U.S. personal spending and income both outstripped expectations in September. Incomes rose 0.9% on the month while spending rose 1.4%. 
Big Oil stocks appeared to stop the rot with their quarterly earnings released earlier.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 0.3% after reporting a third-straight loss that was at least narrower than expected, while  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) rose 0.9% after posting an unexpected profit.
Policy toward the oil and gas sector has helped to revive uncertainty over the election outcome this week, with indications that Democratic Party reservations about fracking are hurting the party's chances in key swing states such as Pennsylvania and also preventing any further advances for it in Texas, which had appeared to be 'in play' earlier in the campaign. While Democratic nominee Joe Biden is still widely projected by polling firms and prediction markets to win the White House, a narrower margin of victory raises the risk of the result being contested by President Donald Trump, who has already indicated he won't accept the result of the poll if he loses.
Elsewhere, Altria (NYSE:MO), the owner of Marlboro and other tobacco brands, saw its stock drop 1.8% after The Wall Street Journal reported that unlisted vaping company Juul Labs had written down its valuation to $10 billion. Altria had bought a 35% stake in the group at an overall valuation of $38 billion. "

(Reuters) - Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) shares fell nearly 5% in premarket trading after the world's most valuable public company reported a steep fall in iPhone sales in China, hurt by the delay of its new model due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Customers put off buying new devices in the second half of September, leading the company to report its steepest quarterly drop in iPhone sales in at least three years.
""We think this was most blatant in China, where 5G service is more accessible, with sales in the region declining 29% - also a bigger decline than we anticipated,"" Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research said on Thursday.
Analysts also noted that the iPhone represents a larger portion of revenue in China than any other region, making the company more dependent on the business in the region.
In recent years, Apple has worked on diversifying its revenue streams to lessen its dependence on the iPhone, but Wall Street still keeps a close eye on the flagship business.
Macs, iPads and services businesses helped the company beat estimates and register its biggest fourth quarter.
Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters he was ""optimistic"" about the iPhone 12 cycle based on the first five days of shipping data.
However, the company did not provide a specific forecast for the crucial holiday shopping quarter, disappointing some investors.

Twenty-seven brokerages rate the stock ""buy"" or higher, 10 ""hold"" and three ""sell"" or lower, with the median price target on stock is at $133.

412,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 08:51AM ET</span>",Brace for take off: Berlin's much-delayed airport to open in industry crisis,"By Kirsti Knolle
BERLIN (Reuters) - After 14 years of construction and six delayed openings, Berlin's new airport is due to welcome its first passengers on Saturday. But the timing could not be worse.
The COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the global aviation industry into its deepest ever crisis, and recovery is not expected for at least a couple of years.
That has left the new airport, originally called Berlin Brandenburg Airport but now known by its code BER, looking for extra funds to help pay its debts. 
Built on the site of Schoenefeld airport in former East Berlin, BER has been beset by problems. The construction planning company went bankrupt; fire doors, cabling and sprinklers had faults; and costs ballooned to 6 billion euros ($7.1 billion) from an initial budget of 2 billion.
The setbacks further dented Germany's reputation for efficiency following long delays on other high-profile projects, such as the Elbphilharmonie concert hall in Hamburg. 
Economists have come to describe Berlin's state-owned airport operator, Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH (FBB), as a financial black hole.
""The FBB will not be able to earn the money it needs to pay its debt in the foreseeable future,"" said Hansrudi Lenz of Wuerzburg University.
At the end of 2019, FBB owed banks and its owners - the German federal government and the states of Berlin and Brandenburg - 4.1 billion euros.
That compares with 416 million euros of revenues in 2019 from Schoenefeld and Tegel, Berlin's existing two airports.
Even before the pandemic, BER wasn't expected to deliver a big revenue boost, as it mainly replaces the two older airports.
But because of the COVID-19 crisis, BER Chief Executive Engelbert Luetke Daldrup expects just 10 million passengers at Berlin's airports this year, compared with 36 million last year and BER's current capacity of 40 million. 
""We have a serious situation,"" FBB supervisory board chief Rainer Bretschneider said this week, adding the group was in talks with its owners about fresh financial support.
Economists say FBB will need grants, restructuring, a strategic investor, equity from its owners - or a combination of these - to put it on a solid financial footing.
Finding investors could be tough, though, as Berlin is not an international hub and other airport operators, also hammered by the crisis, are not in a position to think about deals, said Mainfirst analyst Johannes Braun said. 
FBB's Bretschneider said the priority for now was getting through the pandemic. 

""We need to get out of the crisis and need to ... dress up the bride, then we can talk about a sale or a stake sale,"" he said.

(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) said on Thursday it had issued the largest-ever private-sector social bond for affordable housing, part of a more than $1 billion initiative announced earlier this year to combat racial inequality.
The transaction, consisting of a $2.5 billion 4-year non-call, 3-year fixed to floating rate note issuance, adds to a surge in social bond announcements made during the coronavirus pandemic.
""This transaction represents an important next step in expanding Citi’s commitment to ensuring that all families have access to safe and affordable housing,"" Chief Executive Mike Corbat said. 
Citi, the third-largest U.S. bank, unveiled its billion-dollar initiative to support communities of color over the summer, including a significant push to increase homeownership among racial minorities.
The bank partnered with women, veteran and minority-owned firms to execute the deal.
Social bonds, a type of debt that channels proceeds to specific socially beneficial projects, have become more popular this year as interest in ethical investments surged during the global COVID-19 pandemic. 
Issuance of the debt securities has jumped to $85 billion this year so far from $10.6 billion in the same period of 2019, according to Refinitiv data.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) issued a $1 billion bond in May, the proceeds of which will be lent to not-for-profit hospitals, nursing homes and manufacturers of healthcare equipment. 

It separately issued a $2 billion sustainability bond, aimed at providing more affordable finance to Black and Hispanic-Latino communities.

418,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 08:10AM ET</span>",Funds favor bonds over stocks in run-up to U.S. election: Reuters poll,"By Rahul Karunakar and Tushar Goenka
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global fund managers recommended the lowest exposure to equities and the highest share of bonds in portfolios in over a decade this month, citing risks posed by the U.S. election and economic fears stoked by resurgent coronavirus pandemic, a Reuters poll found.
The run-up to the Nov. 3 presidential election, new national lockdowns in Europe's biggest economies, and record daily U.S. coronavirus infections triggered the worst global stocks selloff in months. Nearly $2 trillion in value was wiped out on Wednesday alone.
Since the pandemic began, fund managers with over $4 trillion in assets under management whom Reuters regularly polls, cited the second wave of infections now underway as a top risk and have remained cautious throughout the year.
Keeping with that strategy, the Oct. 15-29 poll of 33 wealth managers and chief investment officers in Japan, continental Europe, Britain and the United States showed recommended bond holdings have risen over 5 percentage points since January this year to average 45.5% this month.
That is up from 44.7% in the previous month, already the highest since comparable polling began over a decade ago.
At the same time, overall equity exposure in the global balanced model portfolio fell further in October to average 41.4% from 42.7% in September, the lowest since early 2010. 
That average has plunged more than 8 percentage points since the start of the year.
""There are not many reasons for us to be bullish on stocks. All the upcoming events point plainly to more pain for equity markets,"" said a chief investment officer at a large U.S. fund management company. ""There is a high risk to the already fragile economic recovery from the resurgent COVID-19 pandemic,"" he said. 
""Forget a V-shaped recovery, the W-shaped scenario for major world economies has become the consensus in the market.""
That echoes the findings of a separate Reuters poll of roughly 500 economists who saw the new wave of coronavirus cases posing a high risk of halting the current global economic recovery as early as this year. [ECILT/WRAP]
In the latest poll, fund managers once again chose the pandemic as the top risk in response to an additional question.
""Equities have priced in a COVID-19 vaccine later this year, but if that is significantly delayed, exhibits low clinical efficacy or significant side-effects then we could see a substantial market correction,"" said Benjamin Suess, director at UBS Asset Management in Zurich. 
But more than half of the 21 fund managers, who answered a question about the biggest driver for the stock market, said further U.S. fiscal stimulus would be the top factor for the remainder of the year, with many predicting a buying opportunity for equities if it passes.
""One can view the outcome of the U.S. election as a trigger for markets rather than a driver,"" said Craig Hoyda, senior quantitative analyst at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh. ""Once the outcome is certain, markets - in their role as forward discounting mechanisms - will price in the expected path of fiscal policy.""
Still, 18 out of 21 fund managers who responded to a question about a potential impact of a delayed or contentious U.S. election outcome, said it would prompt a significant sell-off in the immediate aftermath.
""Anything is still a possibility should the result be close. U.S. stimulus negotiations would become even more tricky if there is an unclear election outcome and tip markets back into the sort of chaos endured earlier this year,"" added the U.S.-based global fund manager.
A deep selloff in March wiped a third off the value of U.S. stock indexes as the pandemic slammed markets and locked down economies.

Now, with less than a week to go before the U.S. presidential vote, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases is bringing new curbs and financial markets jitters.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Friday, as investors digest underwhelming earnings from some of the technology heavyweights while uncertainty over the presidential election prompts caution.
At 7:10 AM ET (1210 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 28 points, or 0.9%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 233 points, or 0.9%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 121 points, or 1.1%. 
The major cash indices are on pace to post their worst weekly performance in months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 5.9% week to date, on pace for its worst week since March 20. The S&P 500 has fallen 4.5% this week, headed for its worst week since June 12, while the Nasdaq Composite has dropped 3.1%, its worst week for over a month.
A number of the tech giants reported third-quarter earnings late Thursday, and although they largely reported solid earnings growth this was not enough to keep investors enamored with the stocks that have largely driven the strong overall market gains since March.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) both reported strong rises in advertising sales and some caution about the future, while Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone sales missed estimates. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported a record quarterly profit, but it also forecast a jump in costs related to Covid-19. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) was the big loser, after reporting fewer new users than had been expected.
Earnings Friday come from oil majors  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), as well as pharma AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), conglomerate Honeywell (NYSE:HON), cigarette-maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL).
Confidence is fragile as the presidential election looms large. President Donald Trump has consistently trailed Democratic challenger Joe Biden in national polls, but surveys in the most competitive states have shown a closer race.
Given the heated nature of the political debate, there are concerns that the result of the election may not be willingly accepted by sections of the country. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) announced Thursday that it has removed guns and ammunition from display in thousands of its stores in the United States, citing concerns of ""civil unrest"".
At the same time, the United States broke its single-day record for new coronavirus infections on Thursday, reporting over 90,000 new cases, as 21 states reported their highest daily number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients since the pandemic started, according to a Reuters tally.
Economic numbers include personal income and spending reports, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), while the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number is due at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT).
Oil prices continued to weaken Friday, on track for a second consecutive monthly fall as traders worried about the effect the surge of coronavirus cases, and subsequent lockdowns, is having on global demand.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $36.03 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.7% to $38.01, falling to levels last seen in May.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,878.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded flat at 1.1674.

420,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>",AbbVie raises 2020 profit forecast as COVID-19 hit eases,"(Reuters) - Drugmaker  AbbVie Inc  (N:ABBV) posted better-than-expected quarterly sales and raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast on Friday, as demand for its Botox and other treatments showed signs of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic hit. 
Lockdowns and pandemic fears had forced people to delay non-essential surgeries earlier this year, but with restrictions easing, demand for treatments and procedures have picked up.
Botox, which AbbVie gained through its $64 billion acquisition of Allergan (NYSE:AGN) in May, suffered an initial hit during the peak of the health crisis, but demand has since improved.
Third-quarter sales for its cosmetic use only fell 2.2% year-on-year to $393 million, recovering from a 43.1% plunge in the second quarter, and beat analysts' estimate of $364.4 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
AbbVie's portfolio of aesthetic medicines such as Botox was showing a ""V-shaped recovery,"" Chief Executive Officer Richard Gonzalez said in a statement. 
The company's other treatments, including rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world's best-selling drug, and new psoriasis therapy, Skyrizi, also outperformed Wall Street estimates in the third quarter. 
This comes even as Humira has come under pressure from cheaper rivals in Europe and faces patent expiration in the United States, its biggest market, in 2023.
Humira brought in sales of $5.14 billion and AbbVie's newer psoriasis medicine Skyrizi generated $435 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30.
In September, Oxford University said it would study whether Humira was an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients.
AbbVie forecast a combined company 2020 adjusted earnings of $10.47 to $10.49 per share, compared with $10.35 to $10.45 per share forecast earlier.
Net earnings jumped 22.5% to $2.31 billion in the reported quarter, due to the addition of Allergan's business. 
Total sales rose 52.2% to $12.90 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $12.72 billion.

421,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 07:54AM ET</span>",Exxon’s Historic Losing Streak Adds Urgency to CEO’s Overhaul,"(Bloomberg) --  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). posted a loss for a third straight quarter, a day after the the oil giant announced it will cut 15% of its workforce in an attempt to shield its dividend.
Exxon is confronting one of its biggest crises since Saudi Arabia began nationalizing its oilfields in the 1970s. The company lost $680 million, or 15 cents a share, during the third quarter, compared with the 25-cent per-share loss forecast in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. The company’s crude-refining business was hit particularly hard by weak fuel demand and prices.
Blindsided by the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods abruptly ditched an ambitious rebuilding effort and imposed widespread job cuts that are unprecedented in Exxon’s modern history.
The firings and layoffs, announced less than 24 hours after Exxon declared a $3.7 billion payout to shareholders, will affect 1,900 U.S. workers and thousands more around the world. Pandemic-induced lockdowns have crushed demand for oil, natural gas and chemicals, sending Exxon’s finances into a tailspin. Prior to 2020, the company hadn’t posted a quarterly loss in at least three decades.
Although third-quarter results outperformed expectations, the company is still struggling to generate enough cash to fund dividend payments and capital projects.
Exxon’s cash flow has all but evaporated, Woods’s aggressive rebuilding plan has ground to a halt, and criticism is growing over the company’s climate strategy. The most immediate question for investors is how long the $15 billion-a-year in dividends survive.
Exxon follows rivals  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX), BP (NYSE:BP) Plc and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc is disclosing just how trying the third quarter proved. Chevron disclosed a surprise profit after slashing capital spending almost in half. Meanwhile, BP narrowly avoided a loss but warned that any recovery will be a long, slow slog.
Shell, for its part, exceeded all analysts’ forecasts by posting almost $1 billion in adjusted profit. The Anglo-Dutch giant also dangled the promise of fattening the dividend that’s dwindled to less than half of its year-ago value. Total SE also surpassed estimates.
Exxon has plunged about 50% this year, lagging U.S. rival Chevron Corp. but ahead of Shell and BP. The drop has sent Exxon’s dividend yield soaring to more than 10%, a level that indicates investors expect the payout to be cut.
To defend the dividend and appease investors, Woods is implementing an extensive internal cost-cutting drive. Exxon cut $10 billion in capital spending in April and delayed some marquee projects. That slowdown is translating into job cuts, Woods said in a recent email to staff, adding to layoffs in Europe and Australia.
As if its financial performance wasn’t enough to worry about, Exxon is under pressure from critics to reset its climate strategy. Its European rivals have all committed to some form of carbon neutrality by mid-century but earlier this month Woods underscored his faith in fossil fuels. Oil and gas will still make up about half the global energy mix in 2040 and provide the most cost-effective pathway to development in poor countries, Woods told employees in the email.
Exxon is scheduled to host a conference call with analysts and investors at 9:30 a.m. New York time. Andrew Swiger and Jack Williams (NYSE:WMB), both senior vice presidents and members of Woods’s inner circle, will speak during the call.

Juul's valuation has nosedived over the last two years due to increased regulatory scrutiny following a rise in teenage vaping and a ban on the sale of popular flavors.
The company was valued at $38 billion in December 2018, when the Marlboro maker took a 35% stake, but it has taken several charges on its investment since. The value of Altria's investment in Juul was $1.6 billion as of Sept. 30.
""Altria performed a valuation analysis on its investment in Juul, which considered both Juul's international prospects and current U.S. e-vapor category dynamics,"" the company said.

Reuters had on Thursday reported citing an internal memo that the e-cigarette maker, which recently decided to quit certain markets, had cut its valuation to about $10 billion from $12 billion at the end of last year.

424,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Investor group says Apollo director overseeing Epstein review is not independent,"By Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group representing U.S. pension funds says the head of an Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc committee overseeing the investigation of CEO Leon Black's ties to late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is not independent.
The group told Reuters that the chairman of the committee, Michael Ducey, was not independent because of his previous dealings with the buyout firm. 
Ducey was on the board of printing paper manufacturer Verso (NYSE:VRS) Paper Corp, which was controlled by Apollo, from May 2006 until July 2016, according to corporate disclosures. 
The head of the Council of Institutional Investors (CII), which represents pension funds, said it disagreed with Apollo's characterization of Ducey as an independent board director, because he was on the board of a company owned by the private equity firm less than five years ago. 
""CII believes a five-year look-back helps avoid conflicts or the appearance of a conflict of interest,"" executive director Amy Borrus said in an email.
CII, whose members include investors in Apollo's funds, does not keep track of how many companies adhere to its guidance. It states on its website that its guidelines are not binding on its members or corporations.
The New York Stock Exchange, where Apollo is listed, asks companies to consider business relationships going back three years when assessing independence, rather than five as CII recommends. 
An Apollo spokeswoman said Ducey met the requirements to serve as an independent director set by the New York Stock Exchange as well as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
""We are confident that our practices for director independence are consistent with best practices followed generally by publicly listed companies, including companies in our industry,"" the spokeswoman said. Ducey and a spokeswoman for Black did not respond to requests for comment.
Black controls Apollo, which he co-founded in 1990 and turned into one of the world's largest private equity firms. Last week, he asked Ducey and two other Apollo board directors to independently verify that he had not engaged in any wrongdoing. The three directors, who comprise Apollo's so-called 'conflicts committee', hired law firm Dechert LLP to help them with their review.
Black said earlier this month that he regretted payments to Epstein of between $50 million and $75 million over the last decade for what he called ""professional services."" He was responding to a story in the New York Times, which revealed the payments.
The outcome of the probe could determine whether Black continues to lead Apollo. On the firm's third-quarter earnings call on Thursday, executives said some investors had paused their commitments to Apollo's funds as they waited for the findings of the review. 
""I would have concerns about those ties between the director and Apollo. But the proof will be in how directors handle themselves,"" said Nell Minow, vice chair of corporate governance consultant ValueEdge Advisors.
Black said on Thursday that in 2012, three years after Epstein got out of jail following his conviction in Florida on soliciting prostitution from a minor, he retained Epstein for ""personal estate planning, tax structuring and philanthropic advice."" He called this decision a ""terrible mistake"" that he regretted.
Epstein was found hanged at age 66 in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges for allegedly abusing women and girls in Manhattan and Florida from 2002 to 2005. He had pleaded not guilty.
CII is an association representing the interests of pensions funds, foundations and endowments with total assets under management of approximately $4 trillion. 
Borrus said CII engages with companies to convey shareholder worries, and it had not yet contacted Apollo about its concerns. No Apollo shareholder has spoken out against the firm's handling of Black's relationship with Epstein, although some investors in the New York-based firm's funds have expressed concerns. 

The Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System (PSERS) said last week it would not consider any new investments in Apollo's funds in the wake of the investigation.

426,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>",World stocks take fresh dip as COVID infection rate weighs,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks fell further and oil headed for a double-digit weekly slide on Friday as jitters over a rising global COVID-19 infection rate and next week's U.S. presidential election more than offset strong euro zone quarterly growth data.
A strong central bank-fuelled bounce back from the initial pandemic slide earlier in the year has faltered this week, with concerns about an even worse second wave of infections, particularly in Europe, taking the froth off markets.
""The US election, the extent of further lockdown measures, Brexit negotiations and vaccine news all present both upside and downside risks over the coming weeks and it is understandable that investors may want to proceed with caution,"" said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management.
World stocks (MIWD00000PUS) were down 0.3% at 0925 GMT, tracking weakness in Asia, while U.S. stock futures (ESc1) (NQc1) were down 1% to 1.3%. Gold rose, with spot prices climbing 0.3% to $1,873 an ounce.
In Europe, the blue-chip EuroSTOXX 50 (STOXX50E) was down 0.7% to take its weekly loss to 6.9% and leaving it at levels last seen in late May. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) closed down 1.2% for a 2.2% weekly loss, breaking four straight weeks of gains.
""New lockdowns across Europe are being harshly repriced by markets,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) equity strategist Emmanuel Cau said in a note to clients.
""With complacency going fast, this dip could end up offering another good entry point, but a lot depends on the election outcome and timing of the results.""
European government bond yields rose in response to fresh COVID restrictions across the continent, with Italian, Spanish and German 10-year debt yields all up between 1 and 2 basis points. 
While Brent crude (LCOc1) enjoyed something of a bounce approaching midday in London - up 0.5% and broadly in line with its U.S. peer (CLc1) - it still remains down sharply on the week, facing losses of nearly 10%.
That in turn led to a broad sell-off of commodity linked currencies including the Russian rouble , Norwegian crown  and Canadian dollar , which was facing its worst week since April.
Graphic: Stocks, oil vs coronavirus cases https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprxdzope/Pasted%20image%201604051261032.png
The weak sentiment dragging Europe lower came despite a strong showing in euro zone quarterly GDP figures - up 12.7% -, one day after the European Central Bank pledged more help for the economy when it next meets in December to help counter the potential economic hit from the pandemic.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) FX analyst Kit Juckes said that given the recent imposition of a fresh lock-down in France, the positive growth data there - an 18.2% quarter-on-quarter jump - was not enough to outweigh the virus concerns.
This week has seen global coronavirus cases rose by over 500,000 for the first time, with France and Germany prepping fresh lockdowns.
In response, analysts expect an expansion and extension of the ECB's Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, a lower deposit facility rate, and even more generous lending terms for banks in December.
The announcement sent the euro (EUR=) sliding to a four-week low of $0.1648 before recovering slightly on Friday to trade at $1.1679, down around 0.4% since the start of the month.

The dollar index (=USD), meanwhile, held steady, bolstered by a solid session on Wall Street overnight after some strong tech sector earnings and data showing the U.S. economy grew at a record annualised pace of 33.1% in the third quarter.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) said on Friday its after-tax distributable earnings rose 6% year-on-year in the third quarter, driven by growth in management fees and transaction fees from its capital markets business.
After-tax distributable earnings (DE) – the cash available for paying dividends to shareholders – rose to $410.4 million, up from $388.8 million a year earlier. This translated to DE per share of 48 cents, which exceeded the average Wall Street analyst forecast of 40 cents, according to data from Refinitiv.
KKR said the value of its private equity portfolio appreciated by 16% during the quarter, while real estate and infrastructure funds rose 6% and 10% respectively. Its leveraged credit funds rose by 5%.
On Wednesday, rival Blackstone Group (N:BX) said its third-quarter distributable earnings rose 9%, while its private equity funds appreciated by 12.2%. 
 Carlyle Group  Inc (O:CG) reported a smaller-than-expected 6% drop in its third-quarter distributable earnings on Thursday, with its overall fund portfolio rising 5%. Apollo Global Management (N:APO) said its private equity portfolio rose 8%, although distributable earnings fell 8% during the quarter.
KKR said its net income under generally accepted accounting principles rose to $1.1 billion, from $241.2 million a year earlier, driven by income from capital allocated out of its balance sheet. The strength in its capital markets business offset a decline in profits from asset sales.

Total asset management was $233.8 billion at the end of September, up from $221.8 billion from three months earlier. KKR closed the quarter with $67.1 billion in unspent capital and declared its regular dividend of $0.135 per share.

434,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 06:24AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Solid Earnings Stabilize European Markets After Grim Week,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- A rotten week for European stocks is ending with a semblance of stabilization, as some positive-looking updates from cyclical companies in particular restore a little hope to markets battered by the second wave of the pandemic.
By 6:25 AM ET (1025 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down a relatively modest 0.2%, after falling some 5.7% over the four previous sessions as Germany and France, the region’s two biggest economies, both tightened restrictions on economic and social life. 
The measures have cemented widespread expectations that Europe will have to repeat its full lockdown measures from the spring in order to flatten the infection curve, even though the measures announced this week leave schools, factories and, in the case of Germany, almost all retail open.
Markets got a moderate degree of support from better-than-expected results from cyclicals such as Total, which rose 3.1% after the French oil and gas major again kept its dividend unchanged from pre-pandemic levels. Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and Equinor had raised their payouts on Thursday, confident that their restructuring measures had strengthened their balance sheets enough to justify the move.
In addition, French aero engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) stock rose 2.8% after confirming its guidance for the year. German rival MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn) also said its margin before interest and taxes will be at the top end of its forecast 9%-10% range. MTU stock still slid 0.3%, however.
Germany’s DAX index continued to underperform with a 0.4% decline, due in part to weakness in growth and momentum stocks. That was an echo of the reaction to Big Tech’s earnings on Thursday, in which investors reacted negatively to the lack of optimistic guidance, even though earnings from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and especially Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) beat expectations.
For most of the year, investors have been content to buy into a halfway-convincing growth story at any price, driving such stocks to valuation multiples last seen during the tech bubble in 1999.
Delivery Hero and stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn), two of the four best-performing stocks in the DAX this year, led the losers with declines of over 2%. Delivery Hero, which has never turned a profit, currently trades at 10 times its expected revenue this year.
Better-than-expected growth figures for the third quarter, while welcome, did little to change an overall gloomy mood. Eurostat reported Eurozone gross domestic product rebounded 12.7% in the third quarter, considerably more than the 9.4% expected. As with the U.S. figures released on Thursday, the rebound still leaves GDP considerably below pre-pandemic levels and down 4.7% from a year earlier.
GDP figures are always backward-looking, but this particular quarter’s had been rendered obsolete by the European Central Bank on Thursday, whose President Christine Lagarde said all the data point to “a significant softening in economic activity in the final quarter of the year.”
Lagarde succeeded on Thursday in anchoring bond yields with a promise of fresh monetary stimulus in December. That has helped support bank stocks, which continue to report quarterly results broadly ahead of expectations. Spain’s BBVA (MC:BBVA) was the latest to do so, pushing its stock up 2.8%. In the U.K., NatWest Group  (LON:NWG), formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS_old_old), rose 5.8% after it said its provisions this year will be at the lower end of the forecast range."
435,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>","European stocks steady, but head for worst week since March","By Sruthi Shankar
(Reuters) - European stocks inched up on Friday but were on track for their sharpest weekly decline since a brutal selloff in March, as a new round of coronavirus lockdowns dampened prospects for a sustained economic recovery.
An underwhelming response to Wall Street's big tech earnings overnight also weighed, with Europe's tech sector (SXTP) slipping.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers ASM International (AS:ASMI), Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) and STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) fell between 0.8% and 1.6% after the late launch of new 5G iPhones caused customers to put off buying new devices.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) inched up 0.1% after opening lower, set for a more than 6% weekly loss in what could be its worst such decline since an 18% plunge in mid-March.
Spain, one of Europe's worst COVID-19 hot spots, will be under a state of emergency until early May.
Germany, France and other European countries have also reimposed tight restrictions in the recent weeks to curb the spread of the virus, pushing investors to look past data that showed a strong rebound in euro zone economies in the third-quarter.
""This week saw the return of fear, with equities selling off hard as the reality that surging virus cases and ever tightening restrictions in Europe will knock near-term economic prospects,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC)' European equity strategist Emmanuel Cau wrote in a note.
""While significant, we think the damage should be less this time around, with many businesses and, importantly, schools remaining open.""
However, Spain's blue-chip IBEX (IBEX) was supported by better-than-expected earnings from lenders Banco Sabadell (MC:SABE), BBVA (MC:BBVA) and Caixabank (MC:CABK). 
Third-quarter earnings season has been largely supportive, with 74% of the nearly half the STOXX 600 companies that reported so far topping profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. 
French oil and gas producer  Total  (PA:TOTF) rose 2.4% after it maintained its dividend despite a sharp drop in third-quarter net profit.
Construction materials group Saint-Gobain (PA:SGOB) rose 4.2% after improved full-year earnings forecast.
But Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) fell 3.3% after it unveiled a 1.05 billion-euro ($1.24 billion) quarterly operating loss and warned of worse to come as a resurgent coronavirus brings new travel curbs.

British Airways-owner IAG (L:ICAG) rose 0.9% after it said it was driving down its cost base to survive the deepening travel slump.

PARIS (Reuters) - In the world of corporate mega mergers, a $425 million discount on a $16 billion deal is small change.
But for LVMH boss and French billionaire Bernard Arnault, every penny counted to end a bitter legal dispute with U.S. jeweller Tiffany and clinch a new takeover deal at a slightly lower price, according to interviews with five people close to the deal.
For the 71-year old Arnault, dubbed ""the wolf in cashmere"" for his aggressive business tactics even in his earliest deals, getting a discount in itself would have been worth it, several people who know him said, even if it amounted to less than 3% of the original price.
""He did this out of principle. A franc is a franc for him,"" one of the people, who is familiar with the latest discussions around the deal, noted. ""He doesn't overpay for things, because he is Bernard Arnault."" 
The takeover, the luxury industry's biggest-ever deal and a major feather in LVMH's cap, was struck before the coronavirus pandemic forced the industry to temporarily shut shops and idle manufacturing sites. 
LVMH said last month it could no longer complete the deal by the Nov. 24 deadline, citing a letter by the French foreign minister asking it to delay the purchase because of the threat of new U.S. tariffs on French products.
Government sources have since insisted that the letter was not binding, and the foreign minister has said it followed an enquiry from the French luxury goods group, leading Tiffany to accuse LVMH of using it as a pretext to walk away from the deal.
Several sources close to the matter told Reuters that Arnault was particularly irked by Tiffany's decision to pay regular quarterly dividends of $0.58 per share in May and August, at a time when other luxury groups suspended or cut their dividend payout because of the health crisis.
It was then that he became hell-bent on not doing the deal under the original terms, the sources said. 
""The price discount is ridiculous, but you have to look at it from Arnault's perspective,"" a banking source familiar with the deal said. ""He's the kind of penny-pinching billionaire."" 
In legal filings by LVMH, which countersued Tiffany in a Delaware court in September, the French conglomerate emphasised the financial argument, alleging the U.S. jeweller's management of the pandemic was ""catastrophic"" and its prospects ""dismal.""
The dividend payments, totalling around $70 million per quarter, were allowed by the original deal and Tiffany says it only acted in the best interest of its shareholders. 
The revised takeover agreement allows the U.S. group to declare another dividend in November, bringing the total payout for this year to $280 million, which is less than the money Arnault has saved by getting Tiffany back to the negotiating table. 
""I think Arnault wanted to make the point that he doesn't like being taken for a ride just because he is a billionaire, and pay for things that he does not think he should be paying for, such as Tiffany's dividends,"" said Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein.
Settling now also keeps a lid on mounting legal fees, which could have grown to about $50 million for both companies if the Delaware court battle had gone all the way, according to one banking source. 
Tiffany declined to comment on the legal costs. The French conglomerate LVMH had no comment on Arnault's motivations. 
BLOWBACK
Still, Arnault went to extraordinary lengths to renegotiate the deal, and some industry observers say the whole saga could dent his reputation.
""If he were the kind of person who cared about public image, he would realise it probably wasn't worth it for the amount of money saved,"" a former LVMH insider said. 
Though he is France's richest man, and owns newspapers including financial daily Les Echos, Arnault keeps a relatively low profile, rarely making appearances at conferences or giving interviews. 
Scrutiny in France surrounding the Aug. 31 letter sent by the foreign ministry to LVMH, which led to speculation Arnault had pulled strings to obtain, took on proportions the group had not expected, people familiar with the matter said. 
Reuters reported on Sept. 22 that French President Emmanuel Macron had asked the foreign ministry to send the letter. 
Pressure to reach a settlement arose on several fronts, due to the legal tussle and as the COVID-19 pandemic worsened. Had the Delaware court case gone ahead, Arnault could have been called to testify next month. Two people close to the matter said Arnault was keen to avoid this step, though a third source close to LVMH said this was a ""wacky hypothesis.""
Some observers said Arnault's determination to win a discount from his pre-Covid offer price may cost LVMH, which has built an empire now comprising 76 brands, the ability to court future takeover targets in a highly fragmented sector boasting a large percentage of family-controlled companies.
Others however disagreed, saying Arnault - who is betting the French giant can restore Tiffany's lustre by investing in stores and new collections - had still managed to get what he wanted. Tiffany also did not want to get bogged down in a potentially drawn-out judicial process whose outcome remained uncertain. 

""It's love between LVMH and Tiffany again,"" one person close to the situation said, adding that a settlement now meant Tiffany ""could sell diamonds at Christmas rather than spending it talking to lawyers.""

437,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>",First wave of ships explore green hydrogen as route to net zero,"By Jonathan Saul and Nina Chestney
LONDON (Reuters) - Developers across the world are for the first time testing the use of hydrogen to power ships as the maritime industry races to find technologies to cut emissions and confidence grows the fuel is safe to use commercially. 
To reach goals for the shipping industry set by the United Nations, industry leaders say the first net-zero ships must enter the global fleet by 2030. Ships powered by green hydrogen could help meet the target.
Made from electrolysis to split water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity from renewable energy, green hydrogen is emissions free.
Oil major Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) last month reiterated its commitment to hydrogen, which it saw as ""advantaged over other potential zero-emissions fuels for shipping"".
While hydrogen's green credentials make it attractive to industrial users, including ship owners and oil majors, it is far less dense than other fuels, meaning more onboard fuel storage capacity is needed. That makes it more feasible, for now, for use in vessels on short voyages. 
Swiss-headquartered technology group ABB is working on hydrogen fuel cell systems, including for passenger and cargo ships. One of its projects involves developing a fuel cell-based power and propulsion system for a new-build river vessel along France's Rhone river. 
""ABB sees short-distance shipping as the first adopters of the fuel cell technology,"" said Juha Koskela, division president, ABB Marine & Ports. 
FUEL SYSTEM PILOTS 
Green hydrogen fuel costs around 4-8 times the price of very low sulphur fuel oil, estimates by risk management firm DNV GL find.
Other types of hydrogen are cheaper, but that is because they are produced using fossil fuel, which means they are not emissions free.
Green hydrogen is expected to fall in price over the next couple of decades as the cost of renewable energy and electrolysers falls.
For companies to invest en masse, however, the associated infrastructure for refuelling and transportation, including electrolysers, compressors, storage, tanks and pipelines, must also be in place.
Christos Chryssakis, of DNV GL, said it took around 20 years to establish liquefied natural gas refuelling infrastructure. He said the process could be quicker for hydrogen, but industry estimates find many billions in investment would be needed.
In Norway, regulations could accelerate the process.
Cruise ships and ferries sailing through the country's heritage-protected fjords must be emissions-free by 2026, which is prompting shipping companies to consider fuel combinations including hydrogen.
Norwegian-headquartered ship designer and ship yard Ulstein is working on building a support ship for the offshore oil sector that would use hydrogen as one power option. 
""Rather than wait for hydrogen bunker infrastructure to be matured, we went for a hybrid design using a containerised solution for the hydrogen storage tanks,"" Ulstein's Nick Wessels said.
The company is also working on a separate hydrogen project for wind installation turbine vessels, he said. 
Municipalities in Norway have launched a tender process, which includes the development of hydrogen-powered, high-speed vessels by 2022, officials say.
Other countries are also making strides.
Belgium's Compagnie Maritime Belge (CMB) built its first hydrogen-powered passenger shuttle boat, which hit the waters in 2017 in Belgium. It will provide a hydrogen ferry for Japan by April next year - the first hydrogen ferry in Asia - and is involved in a tug boat project with the port of Antwerp, CMB's chief executive Alexander Saverys said. 
Other ports are working on hydrogen options at terminals. 
The Spanish port of Valencia said it will deploy prototype machinery, including for box container handling operations, early in 2021, while Britain's Felixstowe port is looking into hydrogen, based on its proximity to offshore windfarms and a nuclear power plant. 
SHORT TRIPS VERSUS OCEAN TRADE 
The shipping industry, which is responsible for 2.89% of global CO2 emissions, is in the midst of a transition to fuels that would reduce those emissions by 50% by 2050 from 2008 levels. 
A study by the non-profit Global Maritime Forum (GMF), which mapped out 66 projects looking at zero emissions in shipping, showed 19 of the 21 initiatives relating to fuel production used hydrogen in some form. 
The majority of these anticipated using hydrogen to make other products, such as ammonia, methanol or ethanol, to improve the schemes' viability. Seven are pure hydrogen projects.
Some in the shipping industry remain unconvinced hydrogen is safe as a power source for larger vessels carrying large amounts of fuel onboard.
But for many, the bigger question is economics.
""The big challenge using hydrogen for deep sea shipping is the cargo volume you would lose to have enough hydrogen stored for long voyages, which could be a commercial killer,"" Kasper Søgaard, GMF head of research, said.
Ulstein's Wessels expects the need for backup fuel options will persist until there leap in technology and infrastructure. 

""I don’t think you can build a completely hydrogen-powered vessel of large size at this point in time. There will still need to be another accessible power source like diesel,"" he said.

438,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 05:18AM ET</span>",ECB’s Holzmann Says Right to Assume Lagarde Signaled Stimulus,"(Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank policy maker Robert Holzmann said it is right to assume that President Christine Lagarde signaled more monetary stimulus is coming, though not until December.
The Austrian governor, typically among the most-hawkish of policy makers, also said new policy instruments may be developed by then to complement the existing bond-buying and bank-lending programs. He said he doesn’t see much point in an interest-rate cut.
“We put a lot of money on the table, but inflation hardly moved so there is rising recognition that quantity by itself doesn’t do the trick,” Holzmann said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “We have to look more into the structure and to see how this could be fine-tuned.”
With coronavirus infections surging and governments imposing new lockdowns, Lagarde said Thursday that policy makers agreed to “recalibrate” their monetary support to help counter the economic damage. The euro zone’s strong summer rebound -- reflected in data on Friday -- looks like turning into a fourth-quarter contraction and a possible double-dip recession.
Holzmann played down the risk of a double-dip, and pushed back against Lagarde’s suggestion that Governing Council could act even before its Dec. 10 meeting if the situation deteriorates.
“What we have decided is to make preparations, to go through our portfolio and see in what area we need to recalibrate to be ready for December, but the decision will be based on December data,” he said. “It’s very clear we’ll use December projections and the information in December to make our decisions.”"
439,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 05:15AM ET</span>","Analysis: As China's yuan becomes a Biden election play, PBOC pushes back","By Tom Westbrook and Andrew Galbraith
SINGAPORE/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Speculative bets that Joe Biden will win the White House on Nov. 3 and bring a steadier tone to rocky Sino-U.S. relations have turbocharged the strongest yuan rally in years, and Chinese authorities have started pushing back.
In recent weeks, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has cut the cost of shorting the currency and tweaked how it sets its trading range to remove barriers to declines. Chinese state banks have been selling yuan late at night.
Those efforts follow five straight months of yuan gains, driven by resilient exports and foreign capital inflows into China's cheap bonds and surging stocks. The yuan  is up almost 7.5% against the dollar since lows in late May.
Yet, alongside the rising odds of a Biden win and yuan bets premised on a view he will be less likely than President Donald Trump to re-open a trade war, the PBOC's discomfort with the pace of gains has grown.
""Most central banks don't want their currencies to appreciate too quickly,"" said Sunil Kalra, a portfolio manager at multi-asset LC Beacon Global Fund in Singapore. 
""If Trump loses and the dollar comes under more pressure, the PBOC doesn't want the starting point of the next rally to be a much lower level of dollar/yuan.""
The PBOC's moves, which help exporters who suffer when the currency rises, have coincided with Biden's firming poll numbers and analysts' conviction that his big-spending promises and multi-lateral instincts would lift yuan at the dollar's expense.
""I think the dollar weakness as a whole is a Biden story ... so yuan strength also is part of this Biden story,"" said Alex Wong, director at Ample Finance Group in Hong Kong.
But Wong said the yuan trade had attracted more attention than other currencies gaining on the dollar in part because of Donald Trump's focus on China, and because of a quick rebound in the world's second-largest economy even as a new round of COVID-19 lockdowns threatens the recovery in Europe.
On Oct. 10, China scrapped a requirement for banks to hold reserves against yuan forward contracts, effectively removing a guard against depreciation. 
Then it asked banks to remove another dampener on depreciation by suspending their ""counter-cyclical factor,"" a tool routinely used to massage the value of the yuan's daily mid-point to prevent it from falling too far.
Traders, meanwhile, told Reuters that state banks were selling yuan and using currency swaps to make borrowing it more expensive.
""The PBOC has been successful in dissuading short-term traders from adding positions as they have made it clear they are not happy with large one-way moves,"" said Kalra.
PACE, NOT PATH
Most of the betting has been through options trades on the offshore yuan  as short-term investors bet massively through cheap derivative structures. 
That has caused implied volatility on the yuan to soar, with the cost of insuring against one-week moves doubling to a five-year high when the contract rolled over to include U.S. polling day on Nov. 3.
The yuan, meanwhile, has reversed direction this week, albeit giving up just a fraction of its gains.[CNY/]
""It's just a hint (from the PBOC). Get out, because we're not going to let it rally for the foreseeable future,"" said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at brokerage Axi. ""When the PBOC starts hinting at a pushback, it's time to get out.""
To be sure, not all investors are quitting bets that a Biden win will further lift the yuan, and even fewer think the PBOC's moves are going to reverse the upward trajectory, given China's economic strength in a world laid low by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Sameer Goel says Biden's comments show he will neither seek to, nor possibly have the space to materially reverse the direction of U.S.-China relations. 

""To the extent though that this is done via a more multilateral engagement, rather than tit-for-tat tariffs, the battle over trade or technology need no longer be fought in currency markets.""

A letter of intent signed by the two firms covers the delivery of an alkaline electrolyser plant with 40-50 megawatt capacity in the industrial town of Mo i Rana, which will use renewable electricity supplied by Statkraft to generate hydrogen.
The project is reliant on external funding, and the partners had applied for European Union support, Nel's Chief Executive Jon Andre Loekke told Reuters. He did not give a timeline for that application to be approved. 
The green hydrogen produced would be used by the local Celsa steel plant as an alternative to fossil fuels, lowering the carbon footprint of the process, the firms added.
Building a large-scale project forms part of Nel's plans to boost its electrolyser programme, Loekke said in the statement. Electrolysers use electricity to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen. 
Statkraft was already discussing expanding the use of green hydrogen with Celsa and the local industry park in Mo i Rana by 2023, which could cut the annual 100,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions from reinforced steel production at the site by 60%. 
Electrolyser capacity there could be stepped up further by 2030 to include other industrial processes, it added.
State-owned utility Statkraft is Norway's biggest electricity producer, with output stemming predominantly from hydropower plants.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Friday, ending the week with confidence at a low ebb given fears of more economic damage from fresh Covid-inspired lockdowns while the earnings deluge continues.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.2%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.2%.
This week's announcement of fresh restrictions on social gatherings and economic activity to combat a second wave of Covid-19 cases in Europe have prompted concerns the region could suffer a double-dip recession. Such fears are overshadowing a set of third-quarter gross domestic product data that have beaten expectations in Germany, Spain and France.
The French government downgraded its forecast for 2020 economic growth to adjust for the latest lockdowns, with the euro zone’s second largest economy now set to contract by 11%, instead of the 10% fall previously seen. This comes despite growth in the third quarter jumping 18.2%. 
The European Central Bank, at its meeting on Thursday, noted that the economic outlook had darkened notably, with President Christine Lagarde sending out strong signals that further easing was on its way in December.
In corporate news, Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) stock fell 2.8% after the airline revealed a large quarterly operating loss and warned of worse to come, cutting its winter capacity given the new travel curbs.
 Glencore  (LON:GLEN) stock fell 1.1% after the world’s biggest shipper of coal reduced its production target for the third time this year, hit by an extended strike at a key Colombian mine.
The tech sector was also weaker, weighed by the lack of optimistic guidance and sharp rises in input costs at the likes of U.S. giants Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) overnight.
On the flip side,  Total  (PA:TOTF) stock rose 1.8% after the French oil major maintained its dividend despite a fall in its third-quarter profit.
The main economic release Friday will be the third quarter GDP number for the euro zone later in the session. This is expected to show a rebound from the previous quarter’s drop of 11.8%.
Over in the U.S., Democrat Joe Biden maintains a comfortable lead over incumbent president Donald Trump in the polls, uncertainty over the outcome of next Tuesday's election remains, including whether the result will be accepted without legal challenge.
Oil prices continued to head south Friday, on track for a second consecutive monthly fall as traders worried about the effect the surge of coronavirus cases, and subsequent lockdowns, is having on global demand.
The focus is turning onto the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, with pressure mounting for these producers to maintain the current supply cuts when they next meet at the end of November.

“Lagarde surprised with more dovishness and determination than expected, posing the only question if the ECB agrees on the need to act in December, why didn't they act already today? Here is the answer: Had the ECB meeting taken place not one day but one week after the lockdown announcements in France and Germany, the outcome of the meeting would probably have been different,” said Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING, in a research note.
The main economic release Friday will be the third quarter GDP number for the euro zone later in the session. This is expected to show a rebound from the previous quarter’s drop of 11.8%, and follows the French economy showing record growth of 18.2% in the previous quarter.
Over in the U.S., Democrat Joe Biden maintains a comfortable lead over incumbent president Donald Trump in the polls, but a great deal of uncertainty over the outcome remains, including whether the result will be accepted without legal challenge.
In corporate news, Spanish bank BBVA's (MC:BBVA) third-quarter net profit fell by much less than had been expected, continuing the recent trend of European banks outperforming, admittedly weak, expectations.
The tech sector will also also be in the spotlight after corporate behemoths Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) all released results after the U.S. close Thursday. While all of them beat consensus forecasts, the lack of optimistic guidance and sharp rises in input costs at the likes of Facebook and Amazon made for a gloomy after-hours trading session.
Oil prices continued to head south Friday, on track for a second consecutive monthly fall as traders worried about the effect the surge of coronavirus cases, and subsequent lockdowns, is having on global demand.
The focus is turning onto the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, with pressure mounting for these producers to maintain the current supply cuts when they next meet at the end of November.
U.S. crude futures traded 1% lower at $35.81 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.1% to $37.84, falling to levels last seen in May.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,868.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded flat at 1.1673."

(Reuters) - At least six people were killed in the southeast of the United States and more than two million people were without power on Thursday after Hurricane Zeta slammed into the Gulf Coast and moved northeast.
The first confirmed death from Zeta was a 55-year-old man in New Orleans, who was electrocuted by a downed power line, the Louisiana Department of Health told Reuters. 
This was followed by four deaths in Alabama and Georgia from trees crashing down on homes, according to Gwinnett County fire officials. A 58-year-old man in Mississippi drowned when he was trapped in rising seawater after taking video of the storm.
Zeta spun up in the Caribbean Sea and went from a tropical storm to a damaging, Category 2 hurricane in less than four days. It struck Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and raced across the Gulf of Mexico to hit the U.S. coast late on Wednesday.
It is the fifth named storm to strike Louisiana this year and the 27th named storm this season, one less than the record set in 2005. 
Hurricanes are getting stronger and spinning slower, as they pick up energy from heat in the oceans due to climate change. 
The eight named storms that have entered the Gulf of Mexico since June have caused repeated offshore evacuations and cut millions of barrels of U.S. oil and gas output.
Crews began returning to Gulf of Mexico offshore facilities on Thursday.  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc said they were redeploying personnel and ramping up and restoring production at their platforms.

The hurricane Zeta cut 4 million barrels over four days this week, halting up to 85% of daily offshore Gulf of Mexico oil production and nearly 58% of its natural gas output.

447,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 02:54AM ET</span>",Megacap Tech Disappoints Market Where Nothing’s Good Enough,"(Bloomberg) -- Solid quarterly earnings from America’s biggest tech firms weren’t enough to keep investors from selling late Thursday, the latest sign sentiment is turning against ultra-expensive digital megacaps.
Futures on the S&P 500 tumbled 2% and Nasdaq 100 contracts were down 2.3% as of 6:45 a.m. in London. Stocks had rebounded from the worst selloff in four months during the cash session ahead of the slate of megacap results.
The slide follows a red-hot run this year that saw the tech giants help haul U.S. equities to new highs amid a rampant pandemic and severe economic downturn.
“As we’ve seen in reactions from some of the earnings from these large companies even beats are not strong enough to satisfy this market, which I think speaks to how fully valued a lot of these stocks are,” said Evan Brown, head of multi-asset strategy at UBS Asset Management.
The quartet of reports comes after a wild two days for megacap tech. The Nasdaq 100 plunged 3.5% for the biggest rout in four months Wednesday before rebounding almost 2% in Thursday’s cash session.
While the companies continue to deliver strong earnings, investors have turned their focus to whether a slower-growing economy will enable profit growth that justifies sky-high valuations.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was little changed even after sales topped estimates when it warned of continued uncertainty due to Covid next year and said plans to spend heavily on employees and new technology. The social network makes up more than 4% of QQQ’s holdings.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street estimates after record sales of Macs and services made up for a delayed iPhone 12 launch. But its shares dropped almost 5% after the firm revealed iPhone revenue missed the average of analysts’ estimates.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) lost more than 1% after it said it planned to spend more than analysts estimated related to Covid-19. Otherwise, the online retailer projected a steep jump in sales in the current quarter, topping analysts’ estimates, indicating it expects the surge in online shopping during the pandemic to extend through the holiday season.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). also reported Thursday and its shares got hammered on concern about its user growth. Third-quarter sales exceeded estimates and results were boosted by a return of advertisers who had fled or pulled back from the website during the early stages of the pandemic. The stock lost 14%.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a bright spot, rallying 8% after it returned to growth in the third quarter after a decline in the previous period, fueled by digital advertising. The Google parent reported third-quarter revenue, minus the cost of distribution deals for its search engine, rose 15% to $38 billion.
The results failed to soothe concern that the rally in tech shares has gone too far, too fast. Optimism that their ability to cater for stay-at-home demand would help insulate the industry from a broad profit slump during the pandemic has sent their shares up 24% as a group since the start of the year, about 10 times as big as the S&P 500.
“It tells us that even though these stocks are below their late-summer highs, they’re still expensive,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. “So unless they beat expectations in a significant way, investors are taking further profits. Who can blame them, given that the capital gains tax is going to rise if Biden wins next week?”
This earnings season has been particularly harsh for internet and software companies. Broadly, better-than-expected results got no rewards, but tech fared the worst among major S&P 500 industries, with shares of those reported falling an average 3% the next day post results, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.
Since the reporting season started two weeks ago, tech stocks in the S&P 500 have dropped more than 7%, the worst performance this far into an earnings cycle in more than a decade.
“The last thing investors needed amid rising Covid cases and the upcoming election was to see weak tech earnings drain sentiment from the market’s main area of support,” said Adam Phillips, director of portfolio strategy at EP Wealth Advisors."

""We awarded the prime contract to Mitsubishi Heavy,"" a ministry of defence spokesman said.
The fighter jet project, which is expected to cost about $40 billion, comes at an opportune time for MHI, as the company is pulling back from plans to build its SpaceJet regional passenger aircraft as coronavirus travel curbs leave airlines with little cash to buy new planes. 
The decision was expected because MHI is Japan's only jet fighter manufacturer, and no other company bid for the contract. Other suppliers and partners will most likely be identified by the end of the year.
U.S. firms that have expressed interest in joining the project include F-35 stealth fighter maker  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT), F-18 Super Hornet builder  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC) from the United States. British companies include BAE Systems Plc (L:BAES) and jet engine maker Rolls Royce Holdings Plc (L:RR).
In its budget request for the year starting in April, Japan's defence ministry has asked for about $730 million to fund research and development of the proposed fighter jet, referred to as the F-X or F-3.

Japan's air force flies about 200 Boeing F-15 jets and is replacing squadrons of decades-old F-4 fighters with F-35s. The new plane will succeed the F-2, a derivative of the F-16 Fighting Falcon jointly developed by MHI and Lockheed Martin more than two decades ago.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down Friday, ending the week on a downward trend with jitters over the results of the U.S. presidential election and persistent fears over the global economic recovery from COVID-19.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.64% by 11:32 PM ET (3:32 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI slid 1.10%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.22%. Data released earlier in the day showed that the third quarter Producer Price Index (PPI) grew 0.4% quarter on quarter, better than the previous month’s 1.2% contraction. The PPI remained unchanged year-on-year, contracting 0.4%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged down 0.17%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.10% and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.60%. The Chinese Communist Party wrapped up a plenum to draw up economic plans for the country over the next five and fifteen years. The country is expected to release data, including October's manufacturing and non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), on Saturday.
Global shares are set to see their worst weekly decline since June, with the election on Nov. 3 only a few days away. Democrat Joe Biden maintains a comfortable lead over incumbent president Donald Trump in the polls, but uncertainty over the outcome remains as Americans cast their votes.
“There is going to be more volatility ahead of the election … over the weekend folks are going to be focused on Pennsylvania to see whether or not Biden is gaining there. The concern is if he gains a little bit, that may be one where you could actually look to a contested election,” Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU). chief market strategist Quincy Krosby told Bloomberg.
Congress’ failure to pass the latest stimulus measures ahead of the election also dampened investor sentiment.
On the COVID-19 front, fresh lockdowns in France and Germany to combat a second wave of COVID-19 cases in Europe are set to begin on Friday and Monday respectively. The European Central Bank also handed down its monetary policy on Thursday, which included a commitment to further action in December to help European Union countries through the second wave.
The commitments widely expected by investors in December include an expansion and extension of the ECB Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, a lower deposit facility rate, and even more generous lending terms for banks.
The U.S. is also dealing with record number of cases in 41 out of 50 states, including Midwest states such as Kansas, Iowa and South Dakota, as well as New York.
However, some investors remained optimistic despite the trend.
“For a crisis of this scale, Asian equities have performed remarkably well. Within the region, markets with a higher weighting of technology stocks or where the recovery has become more entrenched have outperformed,” Citi analysts wrote in a note.
“This solid performance can continue, in our view. Valuations are reasonable for an early stage of a recovery while liquidity is generous. There has also been a perceptible drop in volatility in recent months,” the note added."
450,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 10:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Julius Baer plans wealth management joint venture in China - sources,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
HONG KONG/Zurich (Reuters) - Swiss private bank  Julius Baer  Gruppe AG (S:BAER) plans to set up business in China in partnership with a local financial firm as part of its strategy to boost growth in Asia, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Julius Baer aims to establish a majority-owned joint venture to tap the rapidly growing wealth in the world's second-largest economy and has started looking for a partner, said the people.
The plan comes as China, the world's second-largest country by number of billionaires, has been rapidly opening up its financial sector for bigger foreign participation.
If successful, Julius Baer will be the first major private bank to set up a wealth management joint venture in China. Its plan to establish onshore presence is reported here for the first time.
Booming stock markets and a flurry of new listings have created five new dollar billionaires in China each week for the past year, according to the Hurun China Rich List 2020 released earlier this month.
China's wealth management industry is the fastest-growing in the world but has historically been linked to the sale of high-risk, illiquid investment products and lax regulatory oversight.
That made offshore business - where banks help Chinese clients manage their riches in locations such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Zurich - the preferred route for most global wealth management firms.
In the past year, however, Chinese authorities have cracked down on dubious practices in the domestic wealth management industry as part of a broader push to reduce debt and limit the sale of risky products. They have also made it easier for foreigners to set up wealth management joint ventures.
Julius Baer, Switzerland's third-largest listed lender, will likely take a decision on its Chinese partner next year before starting the formal license application process, said the people.
The people declined to be identified as the bank's plans are confidential. A spokesman for Julius Baer in Zurich declined to comment on the matter.
'BIG PRIZE'
An onshore presence in China will significantly bolster Julius Baer's position in Asia, where it competes with compatriots UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) and  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) as well as a host of other regional and global wealth managers.
""Mainland China of course is always the big prize,"" Julius Baer Chief Executive Philipp Rickenbacher said at a conference in Zurich last month.
""But we've seen that, by being present locally, many firms have lost a lot of money in recent years ... Is it impossible? No, and we're working intensely on continuously exploring these possibilities.""
The China business plans come as the bank is also weighing re-establishing presence in the United States to help its Latin American clients book assets.
The bank saw rapid growth over recent years following a period of takeovers and buoyant hiring. 
But a money laundering sanction by Switzerland's finance watchdog earlier this year barring Julius Baer from making large and complex acquisitions - as well as a cost-cutting exercise which started last year - have complicated its path to growth.

It has been looking to emerging markets, as well as a build-out of some of its European operations to bring in fresh assets.

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) was hit on Thursday with a potentially multi-billion-dollar lawsuit by Black franchise owners who accused the fast-food giant of racial discrimination for steering them to underperforming stores.
The proposed class action led by James and Darrell Byrd, brothers with four McDonald's restaurants in Tennessee, was filed by the law firm representing 52 Black former franchisees who filed a similar lawsuit on Aug. 31.
McDonald's was accused of placing Black franchisees in undesirable inner-city locations with high security and insurance costs and below-average sales, and driving many away by failing to support them as debts rise and profits fall short.
Jim Ferraro, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, estimated that McDonald's has 186 Black franchisees in the United States, down from a peak of 377 in 1998, who own ""700-plus"" stores.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Chicago, where McDonald's is headquartered, seeks damages of $4 million to $5 million per store, potentially totaling more than $3 billion.
In a statement, McDonald's USA said it has an ""obvious interest"" in the franchisees' success, and invested significantly in the Byrds' franchises after they encountered difficulties. McDonald's said it will defend against the lawsuit.
McDonald's has taken steps this year to address concerns about its workplace culture, including updating its corporate values for the first time since 2008.
It has denied treating Black franchisees differently, while acknowledging it wants its franchisee ranks to become more diverse. McDonald's has also denied racial discrimination claims in a lawsuit filed in January by two Black executives.
""They've been on a massive PR campaign to clean up their image,"" Ferraro told reporters on a conference call. ""This is actually a good thing, at some level, but not a good enough thing.""
McDonald's sought last week to dismiss the lawsuit by the former franchisees, which seeks up to $1 billion in damages, saying it disclosed the risks of owning stores and did not set anyone up for failure.

The case is Byrd et al v McDonald's USA LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 20-06447.

(Reuters) - Alphabet (O:GOOGL) rallied, Apple (O:AAPL) sank and Twitter (N:TWTR) tumbled on Thursday after a mixed bag of quarterly reports from top-tier technology companies that investors have relied on this year to power a stock market rally through the coronavirus pandemic.
Share swings following the reports from the tech heavyweights after the bell sent exchange-traded funds tracking the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (IXIC) down about 1% each, suggesting Wall Street may open weaker on Friday. 
Mostly upbeat results from Facebook (O:FB), Google-parent Alphabet and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), along with Microsoft's (O:MSFT) strong report earlier this week, show how the largest U.S. companies have expanded their businesses and outperformed smaller rivals this year as the pandemic accelerates trends toward online shopping, video streaming and other technologies.
Alphabet and Facebook both reported strong rises in advertising sales and some caution about the future. Facebook, which often is conservative with forecasts, said that pandemic-related uncertainty could make for a difficult 2021. 
Facebook's stock fell 1%, while Alphabet surged 7%. 
""These results are testament to the incredible strength of the Google franchise,"" said Nicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). ""Where other marketing driven businesses are struggling as advertisers become more cost conscious, it seems some of the cash is in fact finding its way to the internet search giant."" 
Apple fell over 5% after its iPhone sales missed estimates, although its quarterly revenue and profit beat analysts' expectations. That wiped $100 billion from Apple's stock market value.
Analysts expect aggregate S&P 500 earnings to drop 13% this quarter, compared to an increase of 4.5% in the tech sector, which includes Apple, Microsoft and many other of the index's largest companies, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Twitter reported fewer new users than Wall Street expected, sending its shares 17% lower. If Twitter falls that much in Friday's trading session it will have been its deepest one-day drop since March, when fear related to the pandemic sent global stock markets into a deep selloff.
Amazon reported a record quarterly profit and forecast a jump in holiday sales, but its shares fell almost 2% after it forecast a jump in costs related to COVID-19.
GRAPHIC: Big Tech's soaring market value - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakvenrnapr/Pasted%20image%201603991077530.png

Without Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix (O:NFLX) and Alphabet - the so-called FAANG stocks - the S&P 500 would be down about 4% in 2020, compared with the index's 2% year-to-date rise, according to a research note from Bespoke Investment Group on Thursday. 

""Due to both the huge weight of these stocks and their outperformance, the market has become more reliant on them than ever before for its gains,"" according to Bespoke.

454,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 07:55PM ET</span>",Apple's late iPhone launch temporarily wiped $100 billion off its stock value,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - The late launch of new 5G phones caused Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) customers to put off buying new devices, leading the company on Thursday to report the steepest quarterly drop in iPhone sales in two years.
Apple fell over 5% at one point in after-hours trade, wiping $100 billion from its stock market value. 
Since 2013, Apple has delivered new iPhones each September like clockwork. But pandemic-induced delays pushed the announcement back a month, with some devices still yet to ship.
Even as booming sales of Macs and AirPods boosted overall revenue and profit above what analysts had expected, iPhone sales dropped 20.7% to $26.4 billion. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/3ecmgCG)
Investors anticipated lower sales from the Cupertino, California company's bestselling product, but the hold-back was worse than expected, especially in China, where more consumers have access to 5G than in the United States or Europe. 
Apple has mostly beaten sales expectations this year and released a slew of new products and services that its customers have embraced while largely homebound during the pandemic.
Apple said revenue and profits for the fiscal fourth quarter ended on Sept. 26 was $64.7 billion and 73 cents per share, compared with analyst estimates of $63.7 billion and 70 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
But the flagship iPhone 12's announcement was delayed until Oct. 13, several weeks later than usual, meaning no opening-weekend iPhone sales are included in the fourth-quarter results. 
In an interview with Reuters, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said that he was ""optimistic"" about the iPhone 12 cycle based on the first five days of shipping data. 
""5G is a once-in-a-decade kind of opportunity. And we could not be more excited to hit the market exactly when we did,"" Cook said. ""At least in the U.S., the carriers are being very aggressive."" 
The iPhone 12 release timing drove down sales in Greater China by 28.5% to $7.95 billion. Cook said he expects the new 5G devices to help iPhone sales recover in China.
""What we're seeing in the early going in the first five days gives us a lot of confidence that China will return to growth in our fiscal Q1,"" Cook told Reuters.
Apple did not provide a revenue growth forecast, but Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said revenue from services and non-iPhone products would grow by double-digit percentages in the fiscal first quarter, in line with analyst expectations. He said iPhone revenue would also grow, implying the rate would be in the single digits. Analysts expect iPhone revenue to rise 6.45% to $59.56 billion in the first quarter, according to Refinitiv data.
Logan Purk, an analyst with Edward Jones, said that ""while iPhone sales will grow this cycle, it will be disappointing compared to elevated expectations, as we do not believe the 5G presents a compelling reason for a wave of upgrades.""
Apple has offset volatile iPhone sales in recent years with steady growth in its services segment, which includes streaming music and television. Services revenue rose 16.3% to $14.5 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $14 billion. Cook told Reuters that Apple One, a bundle of Apple's paid services, will launch on Friday.
Cook told Reuters that Apple has 585 million paying subscribers across its platforms, up from 550 million the previous quarter and closer to the goal of 600 million subscribers that the company set out for the end of calendar 2020.
Apple's shares have soared in the past two years as it has diversified its revenue streams to lessen its dependence on the iPhone. The share tumble on Thursday raises the question of whether Apple is still more dependent on iPhone sales than some investors had hoped. 
""Apple needs to be able to keep the upgrade cycle going or the share price will wobble because there’s no real room for forgiveness in the current valuation,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).

Apple said revenue from its accessories segment was up 20.8% to $7.9 billion, compared with analyst estimates of a 13.5% rise to $7.4 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Mac and iPad sales rose to $9.0 billion and $6.8 billion, compared with estimates of $7.92 billion and $6.12 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

455,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 07:55PM ET</span>",Facebook anticipates tougher 2021 even as pandemic boosts ad revenue,"By Katie Paul and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) on Thursday warned of a tougher 2021 despite beating analysts' estimates for quarterly revenue as businesses adjusting to the global coronavirus pandemic continued to rely on the company's digital ad tools.
The world's biggest social media company said in its outlook that it faced ""a significant amount of uncertainty,"" citing impending privacy changes by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and a possible reversal in the pandemic-prompted shift to online commerce.
""Considering that online commerce is our largest ad vertical, a change in this trend could serve as a headwind to our 2021 ad revenue growth,"" it said.
Shares of the company were flat in extended trading.
Facebook's financial results and those of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) demonstrate how resilient tech giants have been even as the pandemic devastated other parts of the economy.
The success has earned them extra scrutiny in Washington, where the companies face multiple antitrust investigations.
Facebook's total revenue, which primarily consists of ad sales, rose 22% to $21.47 billion from $17.65 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, beating analysts' estimates of a 12% rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
A July ad boycott over Facebook's handling of hate speech, which saw some of the social media giant's biggest individual spenders press pause, barely made a dent in its sales, which mostly come from small businesses.
Revenue growth at Facebook, the world's second-biggest seller of online ads after Google, has been cooling steadily as its business matures, although it came in at more than 20% throughout 2019.
Still, compared to expectations, the company has had a bumper year due to surging use of its platforms by users stuck at home amid virus-related lockdowns, which cushioned online ad sales even as broader economic activity suffered.
USER BASE GROWTH
Facebook continued to expand its user base, with monthly active users rising to 2.74 billion, compared with estimates of 2.70 billion according to the IBES data, although user numbers declined in North America compared to the second quarter.
The company projected that trend would continue for the rest of the year, with user numbers either flat or slightly down in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.
""It appears that investors are disappointed that despite user growth jumping across most regions during the quarter, the social media platform reported a decrease in users in North America, which covers the U.S. and Canada - its most lucrative ad market,"" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.
Total expenses increased 28% to $13.43 billion, with costs continuing to grow as Facebook tries to build out its non-ad businesses and quell criticism that its handling of user privacy and abusive content is lax.
Facebook CFO Dave Wehner said on an earnings conference call that expenses would rise due to the costs of returning work-from-home staff to offices as well as increased headcount, product investments and higher legal expenses.
He said the company was expecting a margin decline as a result, although he did not give specific revenue guidance.
The company has been under especially strong pressure ahead of next week's U.S. presidential election and is aiming to avoid a repeat of 2016, when Russia used its platforms to spread election-related misinformation.
EMarketer principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson said Facebook remains ""a go-to for advertisers"" seeking to reach a broad set of consumers, despite its content moderation issues, but said that may change in 2021.
""We expect that more advertisers will take a hard look at their reliance on Facebook and will ask themselves whether the environment is safe for their brands,"" she said.

Net income came in at $7.85 billion, or $2.71 per share, compared with $6.09 billion, or $2.12 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.90 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) on Thursday added fewer users than Wall Street had expected and said a rise in expenses would accelerate in the fourth quarter, sending its shares tumbling 16%.
The San Francisco-based social media company said it expected expenses to increase by close to 20% in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago due to an increase in investments.
The company also cautioned that it was hard to predict how advertisers would react as the U.S. presidential election nears on Nov. 3.
Shares of Twitter fell to $44.00 in after-market trading.
Twitter said many companies paused ad spending during the second quarter due to widespread protests after the death of George Floyd in May and said there could be a similar dynamic with the U.S. election. 
Twitter said it had 187 million monetizable daily active users (mDAU) during the third quarter, missing consensus analyst expectations of 195.2 million users, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The figure stood at 186 million in the previous quarter.
Still, total revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $936 million during the quarter ended Sept. 30, beating analyst estimates of $777.15 million.
The growth was helped by updated advertising formats, improved ad measurement and the return of events that had been paused due to the pandemic, said Twitter Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal during an earnings call with analysts.
The company said outside of the election period, it expected revenue trends could continue or even improve in the current quarter.
Ad revenue in the third quarter grew 15% to $808 million from the same period a year ago, surpassing estimates of $645.95 million.
The company said it would delay the launch of a new advertising product until 2021 as it worked to integrate new mobile phone data privacy requirements.

457,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 07:05PM ET</span>",Analysis: Creeping funding costs skew China Evergrande's deleverage drive,"By Clare Jim and Zhang Yan
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) has taken to seeking loans at above-average interest rates in the shadow banking market, where caution even there over its cash flow hints at an increasingly fraught effort to reduce the property sector's biggest debt.
The developer, which owed 835.5 billion yuan ($125 billion) at June-end, has been shopping around for cash among small banks and private trusts at high rates to fund developments, as proposed limits to the permitted size of real estate debt stymie big-bank lending.
At the same time, China's second-biggest developer by sales, after  Country Garden  Holdings Co Ltd (HK:2007), has had to quell concern about its cash flow after a document - which it called fake - showed it had sought government support.
Its situation is the culmination of a decade of developers binging on cheap debt, fuelling a property boom. The firm owns China's largest land bank at 240 million square meters (59,305 acres) - equivalent to the size of the Cook Islands - yet is the most indebted developer in the country's most leveraged sector.
With the government now trying to slow property price rises and tightening mortgage availability - to restrain household debt in a pandemic-hit economy - the health of large, heavily indebted developers has come under increased scrutiny.
""The main problem with Evergrande is over-expansion and over-banking from too many different institutions,"" said a risk control official at a major state-owned bank, who was not authorised to speak to media and so declined to be identified.
In the past few months, Evergrande has offered to issue debt with annual interest of over 15% privately to at least one onshore and two offshore trust companies, said employees at those companies, who were also not allowed to speak with media.
Trust companies pool money from wealthy individuals and firms to extend loans, and are part of China and Hong Kong's informal, unregulated and opaque shadow banking system.
The rates were higher than Hong Kong's low-teen average, where Evergrande offered debt last year, the employees said.
Of the three trust companies, one offshore one previously lent money to Evergrande. This time, none did due to concern about the developer's high debt level, the employees said.
Shenzhen-based Evergrande did not respond to a request for comment.
Onshore, Evergrande has so far this year offered retail trust products at rates of 6.6% to 9%, little changed from the same period last year, showed Reuters calculations based on data from Usetrust.com, which tracks the majority of trust products.
That compared with developers' average fundraising cost of 7.9%, down from 8.3% from a year earlier, the data showed, as base rates fall due to government policies aimed at easing the business impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
DELEVERAGE DELAY
Lenders and analysts have said the risk of default or operational impact is relatively small for Evergrande given its multiple funding channels and vast land bank. However, higher borrowing costs could hit profit and delay deleveraging.
The firm in March pledged to cut 150 billion yuan in debt annually over three years. Still, its trust loans surged in the first half, with short-term debt rising 6% to 396 billion yuan, according to S&P Global Ratings. The credit-rating firm last month downgraded its outlook for Evergrande to negative.
In one retail product issued via AVIC Trust this month to raise up to 1.2 billion yuan for a residential project, Evergrande offered annual interest of 8.5% for 2 years. In comparison, smaller peer Seazen Holdings Co Ltd (SS:601155) offered 7.5%.
Evergrande is also paying higher rates in the onshore bond market. Last week, it sold 2 billion yuan worth of corporate bonds with a 5.8% coupon. While the rate was the same as its September issuance, it was higher than the benchmark 4.02%.
""The only way out is to speed up property sales and get as much pay-back to ease the liquidity crunch,"" said a project manager at Shanghai Trust Co. ""Otherwise an expected jump in fundraising costs will only delay debt reduction efforts.""

458,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 07:00PM ET</span>",U.S. Sanctions Eight Companies Over Iran’s Petrochemical Sales,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration announced sanctions on eight companies involved in the sale of Iranian petrochemicals and said previous seizures of Iranian petroleum bound for Venezuela brought the U.S. $40 million that will be given to American victims of terrorism.
The actions announced on Thursday gave the administration a chance to highlight President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran less than a week before the Nov. 3 election. His supporters have touted Trump’s tough action on Iran as a promise kept after he vowed in 2016 to restore sanctions and quit the Obama-era deal constraining the country’s nuclear program.
As part of the coordinated actions on Thursday, the Treasury Department announced new sanctions against petrochemical firms and trading companies in Iran, Singapore and Hong Kong. The department said those trades were worth tens of millions of dollars and went through a broker named Triliance Petrochemical Company Ltd., which was sanctioned in January.
Petrochemical sales are a key source of revenue for Iran, and the U.S. alleges that the government uses it to finance a “destabilizing agenda” in the Middle East and Venezuela, Treasury said in a statement.
“The United States remains committed to targeting any revenue source the Iranian regime uses to fund terrorist groups and oppress the Iranian people,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement. The agency says that Triliance uses front companies to continue selling and purchasing products from Iran.
At the same time, the Justice Department unsealed two earlier complaints: One detailing how the U.S. had seized two shipments of antitank missiles and other weapons from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that it says were intended for Yemen’s Houthi rebels; and the other highlighting the U.S. seizure of the petroleum that was bound for Venezuela.
“The two forfeiture complaints allege sophisticated schemes by the IRGC to secretly ship weapons to Yemen and fuel to Venezuela, countries that pose grave threats to the security and stability of their regions,” John Demers, head of the department’s national security division, told reporters on a conference call.
The Justice Department said the U.S. had sold off the petroleum and the $40 million would go to the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund.
The officials denied any political motivation for Thursday’s announcements. But Elliott Abrams, the State Department’s special representative on Iran and Venezuela, said the sanctions actions -- which brought this week’s total of oil and petrochemical actions to 41 -- had given the U.S. leverage to bring Iran back to the table for a better deal than the one President Barack Obama’s administration signed. He implied Democrat Joe Biden might squander it if he wins the presidency.
“We’re building up a lot of leverage and our hope is it will be used and used wisely and not simply discarded,” Abrams said. “That would be foolish and tragic.”

459,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 07:00PM ET</span>",World’s Top Electric-Car Battery Maker Faces Showdown in Seoul,"(Bloomberg) -- A plan by South Korea’s LG Chem Ltd. to hive off its superstar business may need overseas investors to get it across the line.
The world’s biggest maker of electric-car batteries will hold an extraordinary general meeting in Seoul on Friday to vote on a proposal that would see the unit that supplies batteries to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. and others split out from the main company. LG Chem will own 100% of the division for the time being but is planning an initial share sale that would float between 20% and 30% of the unit.
However, LG Chem’s second-biggest shareholder, the powerful National Pension Service with a 10.3% stake, flagged earlier this week it plans to oppose the move. It views the split as unfavorable because it may lessen the company’s value. To succeed, LG Chem needs the help of overseas investors, which control around 40%.
“It’s come down to how foreign shareholders will vote,” said Lee Ji-yeon, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. in Seoul. “If you just look at the business, spinning it off is the best option because it will need more funds for expansion. But the way this was handled has angered many investors,” she said, with reference to the legions of retail shareholders who are also disgruntled.
Splitting out LG Chem’s battery business will cement the unit’s status as a key challenger to China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. as global demand for electric-powered cars rises. It’s also better positioned than many rivals for the industry’s growth in Europe, where sales have surged in 2020, and in the U.S., where an election victory for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is seen spurring the push to electrify transport.
World No. 1
Retail shareholders are upset that LG Chem is taking away the battery unit without offering any stock in it as compensation. Individual investors will have to subscribe to any IPO, which may take around a year to complete. LG Corp., LG Group’s holding company, owns 30% of LG Chem.
Shareholder lobby group Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. has recommended the split be approved and Calvert Research & Management, an institutional firm with a focus on responsible investing, has said it will vote for the plan.
LG Chem edged ahead of competitors to become the largest supplier of lithium-ion batteries to automakers in the first eight months of 2020, lifting its market share to about 25% from around 11% a year ago, according to SNE Research Inc.
The supplier’s ascent has been aided by its early move to target the auto sector, a wide network of relationships with carmakers and strong technical capability -- including in-house expertise on the production of battery cathodes, the most expensive component, according to Mark Newman, a Hong Kong-based senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
“Their position is very, very strong. They have some geographical dominance in Europe and the U.S., and some strong relationships with major carmakers outside of China,” Newman said. “Compared to their Korean neighbors they were a bit earlier to move into EV batteries.”
A standalone battery business would have major appeal to investors, particularly those focused on environmental, social and corporate governance. Some in that category aren’t currently able to hold LG Chem stock because of its petrochemical products, according to Newman.
“Even though they’ve got this world-beating, strong battery business -- currently the No. 1 in the world -- they don’t get the benefit, because the petrochemical business is effectively a negative on the stock,” Newman said. LG Chem’s market capitalization of about $40 billion compares to battery sector rival CATL’s value of about $83 billion.
Electric-car makers and associated businesses have also been welcomed with open arms by investors this year. Shares in Chinese EV manufacturer NIO Inc. are up almost 600% since January while Xpeng Inc. and Li Auto Inc. have also had stellar debuts.
Investors are watching closely for a potential LG Chem battery unit IPO “because that’s going to be the hot one that everyone wants to get hold of,” Newman said.
Hiving off the battery unit should also improve the division’s access to capital and help accelerate expansion efforts, according to BloombergNEF analyst Daixin Li. LG Chem, which currently has the largest manufacturing capacity, is aiming to more than double that volume to about 260 gigawatt hours by 2023 from an estimated 120 gigawatt hours this year, by adding facilities in China, Poland and the U.S.
By 2024, annual sales are forecast to increase to more than 30 trillion won ($26.5 billion) from an estimated 18 trillion won in 2021.
LG Chem’s “current plant scale-up heavily relies on revenue from other business units such as petrochemicals and materials,” Li said in a note last month. “Greater access to outside capital will facilitate capacity additions.”
Another funding option could be through one or more automakers taking minority stakes in the battery unit, Bernstein’s Newman said. In addition to Tesla, LG Chem has long-term contracts with manufacturers including Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and Hyundai Motor Group, alongside joint venture projects with General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and Geely Automobile Holdings (OTC:GELYF) Ltd.’s unit Shanghai Maple Guorun Automobile Co.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc removed firearms and ammunition from U.S. store floors this week to protect customers and employees as tensions across the country have been rising, the world's largest retailer said on Thursday.
The move comes days before the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3, with many worried that the result could be contested or spark violence.
""We have seen some isolated civil unrest and as we have done on several occasions over the last few years, we have moved our firearms and ammunition off the sales floor as a precaution for the safety of our associates and customers,"" a Walmart spokesman said. The company does not have a date for when it will place the guns and ammunition back on the shelves, he added. 
The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer, which sells firearms in approximately half of its more than 5,000 U.S. stores, will still sell the items upon request, it said.
Retailers have been on edge after raiders earlier this year smashed windows, stole merchandise and, at times, set stores ablaze in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Portland and other U.S. cities. In an another trend that has fed concern, gun sales in the United States this year have reached record highs, and more first-time buyers have purchased firearms recent months.
In June, Walmart pulled firearms and ammunition from some U.S. sales stores amid nationwide protests over the death of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in late May.
Last year, the retailer stopped selling ammunition for handguns and some assault-style rifles in all its U.S. stores. It has also in the past called for a strengthening of background checks for gun buyers and action to take guns out of the hands of those who pose a risk of violence.

Shares of the retailer were trading roughly flat after the bell.

Apple announced earnings per share of $0.73 on revenue of $64.70B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.71 on revenue of $63.98B.
iPhone revenue, which makes up about half of total revenue, fell to $26.4 billion from $33.4 billion a year earlier, missing estimates of $27.93 billion. The lower-than-expected figure comes as consumers are expected to have waited to buy the iPhone 12, which was launched last month. 
Revenue from Apple’s service business including Apple News, Apple TV+ and iCloud, grew to $14.55 billion from $12.5 billion, beating estimates of $14.12 billion.

Alphabet A announced earnings per share of $16.4 on revenue of $46.17B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $11.28 on revenue of $42.76B.
The beat was led by strong ad revenue that boosted performance in its biggest business, Google Search & other, and supported its Youtube business.

Google search & other increased revenue 6.5% to $26.34 billion for the quarter year-on-year, while YouTube ads jumped 32.4% ot $5.04 billion.
Cloud revenue surged 44.5% to $3.44 billion for the quarter year-on-year, and YouTube rose 31%.

The Dow recovered from a rocky start to the day, ending higher thanks to tech. Ford showed strength with strong results, and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) ended up after saying it would raise prices in the U.S. 
Sentiment on stocks was supported by a bigger-than-expected gain in economic growth in the third quarter and signs the labor market remains somewhat resilient.

(Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) said on Thursday it could cut its global workforce by about 15%, including deep white-collar staff reductions in the United States, as the COVID-19 pandemic batters energy demand and prices.
Exxon and other oil producers have been slashing costs due to a collapse in oil demand and ill-timed bets on new projects. The top U.S. oil company earlier outlined more than $10 billion in budget cuts this year. 
""The impact of COVID-19 on the demand for Exxon Mobil's products has increased the urgency of the ongoing efficiency work,"" the company said in a statement.
An estimated 14,000 employees globally, or 15%, could lose jobs, including contractors, spokesman Casey Norton said. The figure will include loses from restructurings, retirements and performance-based exits. Exxon had about 88,300 workers, including 13,300 contractors, at the end of last year.
The company is not targeting a fixed number of jobs but does expect the result of its ongoing business review to eliminate about 15% of its current staffing. 
Exxon, which has struggled in recent years to regain footing after misplaced bets on shale gas and Russia exploration, lost nearly $1.7 billion in the first six months of the year. It is expected to report a record-setting third straight quarterly loss on Friday, and its third-quarter loss could reach $1.19 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
Exxon said the 1,900 U.S. job cuts will come mainly from its Houston-area campus, the headquarters for its U.S. oil and gas businesses.
Earlier this month, Exxon said it would cut 1,600 jobs in Europe. It has announced cuts in Australia.
Exxon shares were trading 4% higher at $32.85 on Thursday.
Prior to the pandemic, Chief Executive Darren Woods pursued an ambitious spending plan to boost oil output in the belief a growing global middle class would demand more of its products.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) and  BP  Plc (L:BP) also have outlined up to 15% workforce cuts.  Chevron  Corp’s (N:CVX) planned cuts of 10%-15% would imply a reduction of between 4,500 and 6,750 jobs. It will also cut roughly another 570 positions as part of its acquisition of  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL).

Juul was valued at $38 billion in December 2018, when Marlboro maker  Altria Group  Inc (N:MO) took a 35% stake in the company. 
The company's new valuation was influenced by recent decisions to exit certain markets and related restructuring costs, according to the memo sent to Juul employees by chief executive officer K.C. Crosthwaite.
""Today's valuation does not surprise me, and I expect other investors to also arrive at lower valuation marks that factor in our recent restructuring,"" he said.
Juul has been pummeled over the last two years due to increased regulatory scrutiny following a rise in teenage vaping and a ban on the sale of popular flavors have hit demand.

In September, the company said it would make a significant cut to its global workforce and explore pulling out of some European and Asia-Pacific markets to save cash.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks must not discriminate between men and women in awarding bonuses for the same activity, the European Union's banking watchdog proposed on Thursday.
""Remuneration policies must be gender neutral and respect the principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value,"" the European Banking Authority (EBA) said in proposed revisions to its 5-year old guidelines on sound remuneration policies.
The EBA said that senior management representation and diversity within the management bodies and shortcomings regarding equal opportunities for staff of different gender still exist.
""The EBA will follow up on institutions’ practices with a report to be published within two years after the publication of the final guidelines,"" the watchdog said in a statement.
The guidelines were first introduced to cap banker bonuses in response to public anger over lenders being bailed out in the financial crisis a decade ago.
The EBA said it was also clarifying severance pay, retention bonuses and discretionary pension benefits to avoid such payments being used to circumvent the cap on bonuses.
It is also introducing more flexibility for smaller banks with assets of up to 15 billion euros or bankers that only receive a modest bonus, to be exempt from parts of the guidelines.
Bankers must receive a portion of their bonus in shares that ""vest"" over time, but small banks are often unlisted, thereby creating an administrative headache.
The EBA has put out the proposed revisions to public consultation, with final changes published in the first half of 2021.

The New York-based credit card issuer said it has achieved 100% pay equity for its employees and would continue to do so, as well as promote practices to hire and retain underrepresented colleagues, including Black, Latinx and female colleagues.
The company also said it intends to double its spending on diverse and minority-owned suppliers in the United States to $750 million annually, as well as provide grants to non-profit organizations by the end of 2024.
Several U.S. companies, including large banks and financial firms, had pledged billions of dollars to promote racial equality after the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis police sparked protests across the country earlier in the year.
Earlier in October, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) said it would commit $30 billion to address racial inequality over the next five years, marking one of the largest corporate pledges related to race since the death of Floyd.

Other companies that have rushed to take a stand include  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD), Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) and  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO). JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) recently made a $30 billion commitment over the next five years.

 The cruise ship operator on Thursday posted a billion-dollar net loss for the third straight quarter...
And it expects to lose more money this quarter as it anticipates burning through up to $290 million in cash every month. 
Royal Caribbean is expecting its costs to rise as it gets ships ready to sail again and be in compliance with new health safety rules. 
It expects to start sailing one ship from Singapore at the end of the year. 
The cruise industry as a whole has pretty much come to a standstill after COVID-19 outbreaks on several ships halted voyages this spring, and some operators are now facing passenger lawsuits. 
In order to convince customers to book a cruise again, Royal Caribbean has jointly spearheaded an industry effort to put new practices in place including testing, use of face coverings and enhanced sanitation procedures...

483,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 12:54PM ET</span>","Exxon to Cut 14,000 From Global Workforce After Energy Slump","(Bloomberg) --  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). will slash its global workforce by 15% over the next two years, an unprecedented culling by North America’s biggest oil explorer as it struggles to preserve dividends.
The cuts will include 1,900 U.S. jobs, mostly in Houston, as well as reductions in contractors and layoffs previously announced in Europe and Australia. Personnel reductions are Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods’s latest effort to curtail spending and halt the worst string of quarterly losses since Exxon assumed its modern form with the 1999 takeover of Mobil Corp.
“These actions will improve the company’s long-term cost competitiveness and ensure the company manages through the current unprecedented market conditions,” the company said in a statement on Thursday.
Exxon rose 3% to $32.51 at 12:34 p.m. in New York and was the day’s best-performing exploration stock in the S&P 500 Index.
Exxon’s total reduction will affect about 14,000 people, split between employees and contractors, spokesman Casey Norton said by email. The cuts will come through attrition, targeted redundancy programs in 2021, and scaled-back hiring in some countries.
Exxon’s Big Oil rivals are also cutting thousands of jobs in response to the pandemic-induced demand slump. BP (NYSE:BP) Plc plans to slash 10,000 jobs, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc will cut as many as 9,000 roles and  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) has announced around 6,000 reductions.
Exxon’s workforce stood at about 88,000 people, including 75,000 in-house employees and the rest comprised of contractors, as of year-end 2019, Norton said.
Suburban Campus
In the U.S., the pain will be particularly acute at the suburban Houston location where Exxon opened a sprawling, glass-walled campus in 2014 to house 9,000 employees from exploration, chemicals and other units that had previously been dispersed throughout the metro area. The company’s corporate headquarters remains in the Dallas area.
The fact that Exxon is cutting at all is a sign of its weakened financial position compared to its former status as the S&P 500 Index’s biggest company less than a decade ago and a profit powerhouse used to riding out oil-price cycles.
This year’s downturn has been particularly damaging because it affected refining, usually a cushion in times of low oil prices, and because it came at a time when Exxon was already increasing borrowing to fund a large expansion program. The company was forced to retreat on these plans in April, reducing capital spending by $10 billion and delaying or scaling back most of major projects.
The stock has plunged more than 50% this year. Its dividend yield is now more than 10%, indicating that investors are anticipating a cut. Exxon maintained the quarterly payout on Wednesday, and is expected to post its third consecutive quarterly loss when it reports earnings tomorrow.

491,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 11:31AM ET</span>",Ant Group's Shanghai retail book for $34.4 billion listing 872 times oversubscribed,"By Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The domestic retail book of   Ant Group  Co Ltd 's $34.4 billion dual listing was 872 times oversubscribed as individual investors in China scrambled for a slice of the world's largest initial public offering (IPO), a company filing showed.
Ant (HK:6688) (SS:688688) is poised to raise about $17.2 billion on Shanghai's STAR Market and roughly the same in Hong Kong, shattering the record set by Saudi Arabian Oil Co ( Saudi Aramco ) (SE:2222) with its $29.4 billion listing last December.
Investors are rushing to buy into the fast-growing Chinese fintech firm, which operates the country's biggest payments platform and other financial services, despite risks of greater scrutiny at home and abroad.
Hangzhou-based Ant, backed by e-commerce behemoth  Alibaba  (N:BABA), has decided to exercise a so-called greenshoe option for a 15% overallotment of shares, now selling 1.92 billion shares on the Nasdaq-style STAR Market, according to Ant's filing with the Shanghai exchange on Thursday. 
After the greenshoe, the oversubscription equates to retail investment interest of about 19 trillion yuan ($2.83 trillion).
The company on Monday set the price of the Shanghai leg at 68.8 yuan ($10.27) per share. Before the greenshoe, it was offering 4% of the initial 1.67 billion shares to mainly retail investors across the country, having earmarked 80% of the domestic offering to 29 strategic investors who will be locked up for at least one year.
The remaining 16% of the Shanghai leg had been allotted to non-strategic institutional investors who subscribed for about 76 billion shares, roughly 284 times the initial tranche, according to Ant's filing on Monday. 
The enthusiastic retail investor sentiment towards Ant's record-setting float has triggered a clawback mechanism where heavy oversubscription from small investors can result in them receiving a greater share, Ant said in the latest filing.
After the greenshoe and clawback, the final allocation of the deal is about 70% to strategic investors and the remainder split 12-18% between institutional and retail investors, instead of 16%–4% as originally planned, as per the latest filing.
Ant opened books for the Shanghai float for one day on Thursday.
Investor demand is also strong for the Hong Kong leg, with Ant closing institutional order books one day earlier than planned. 
The book was oversubscribed just one hour after launch on Monday, with the float stoking heavy demand for local currency and sending Hong Kong money market rates to five-month highs.
Strong demand is also expected for the 41.76 million shares, being offered to retail investors in Hong Kong, representing 2.5% of shares being offered locally. 

The prospectus shows the total amount will be increased to 167.1 million shares, or 10% of the Hong Kong offering, if the initial retail allocation is more than 20 times oversubscribed.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) is planning to make further hires under former Bank of America (N:BAC) investment banking chief Christian Meissner as it kickstarts its new investment banking advisory unit for wealthy clients, Chief Financial Officer David Mathers told Reuters on Thursday.
""We've hired Christian Meissner to lead this new unit that will step up the offer we have for large ultra-high net worth clients in the investment banking space. He's really driving the provision of investment banking services to some of our major wealth management customers,"" Mathers told Reuters in an interview following the bank's third-quarter earnings.
Credit Suisse is looking to a new investment bank advisory group to increase its business with wealthy entrepreneurs on corporate deals and bond and equity issuance to help its stand-alone wealth division grow profits by 10% annually from next year.
""There will be more hires,"" Mathers said, adding these might be expected to fall in the magnitude of several tens. ""We will hire to staff it up, and I think you can expect us to hire more relationship managers as we continue to grow our wealth management business.""
The bank is seeking to grow other teams in its international wealth management division, which executives contend must look to higher lending and more transaction-based activity after struggling with low interest rates and negative currency pressures in the third quarter, following record asset-gathering. 
""We've collected 11 billion (Swiss francs) in net new assets this quarter, so we obviously want that to continue into 2021,"" Mathers said.

It will also seek to make some hires in the investment bank, he said.

More than 11% of households surveyed said they plan to move, implying U.S. migration rates will be three to four times higher than normal, according to Upwork, which polled 20,000 people for their report. These Americans are likely to move within the next year, said Adam Ozimek, Upwork’s chief economist.
The coronavirus pandemic has dramatically disrupted cities across the U.S. and highlighted the risks of transmitting the disease in crowded places. With so many Americans working from home, a recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas found there’s less demand for housing in or near dense cities.
The housing market, a bright spot in the U.S. economy, has surged as more Americans seek homes in smaller and cheaper locations. More than 52% of Americans are looking to buy a new home that costs 10% less than their current one, according to Upwork, which also stands to benefit from the rise in telework.
The surge in relocation could have lasting economic consequences for large cities, Ozimek said.
“This is an early indicator of the much larger impacts that remote work could have,” said Ozimek. “Expensive places used to have a monopoly on the access to their valuable labor markets, and as work goes remote, they no longer do.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dan Elwell, the No. 2 official at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) who oversaw the agency during the initial phase of the Boeing 737 MAX crisis, plans to step down, he told Reuters.
Deputy FAA Administrator Elwell, who was acting administrator from January 2018 through August 2019, made the decision in March 2019 to ground  Boeing Co 's (N:BA) 737 MAX after the second fatal crash in five months.
""It's looking very, very likely that the MAX is at the end of its travails,"" Elwell said in an interview. ""We're getting to the latter steps."" An FAA spokeswoman said Elwell plans to leave near the end of November.
FAA officials speaking on the condition of anonymity previously told Reuters the agency could unground the plane around mid-November, but Elwell emphasized again the agency does not have a specific timetable to unground the MAX.
""I am confident the job will get done,"" Elwell said. ""That's a good time for me to go.""
Elwell said the agency has spent thousands of hours intensively scrutinizing the MAX. The FAA is requiring new significant safeguards and simulator training before it allows the plane to resume commercial flights.
""I have absolutely not one molecule of doubt that this airplane will come back into service. We have crossed every t, dotted every i,"" Elwell said. ""There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that it will be as safe or safer than any airplane in service today."" 
Some critics said the FAA should have moved faster to ground the MAX, which came behind most other aviation regulators. Elwell has defended the grounding decision as one based on a review of available data.
Elwell had planned to leave about a year ago, but the 737 MAX review ended up lasting longer than initially expected. 
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said Elwell's ""steady hand, determination, and expertise over the past three years have helped improve aviation safety, address future challenges, and increase aviation safety standards around the world.""
Elwell has been involved with the White House coronavirus task force as the FAA representative and part of an international working group on the safe resumption of international air travel.
The international group is working on new detailed guidance to countries on testing, quarantines and other measures.
""We can’t create a regime for the whole world,"" Elwell said, saying individual countries will have to reach agreements on how to resume travel.

The goal is to facilitate ""safe and healthy international travel"" and give ""confidence to the traveling public that travel is possible.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - An association of Chilean food suppliers has sued the local unit of U.S. retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, alleging that the store owner abused its dominant position in the market to impose contracts on providers and set arbitrary prices.
The suit, dated Oct. 22 but recently uploaded on the website of Chile's antitrust court, said the AGIP supplier union had made the allegations against Walmart, which operates Líder, Acuenta and Central Mayorista markets in Chile.
Walmart ""exploited in an abusive manner its dominant position in the supermarket supply market, by imposing on its suppliers the contracting of certain services and establishing arbitrary values ​​associated with them,"" the lawsuit said.
It added Walmart's actions had hurt free competition.
Walmart Chile said in a statement sent to Reuters on Thursday that it had not been informed of the lawsuit, adding it was always concerned about forging a ""virtuous and long-term relationship"" with suppliers.

""We believe that relations with our suppliers should be governed by the principles of respect for free competition, for which we work to establish transparent objectives, terms and conditions known in advance by both parties,"" it added.
The AGIP union, including names like Coca Cola, Nestlé, Unilever (NYSE:UL) and  Pepsico  (NASDAQ:PEP), asked the Tribunal for the Defense of Free Competition (TDLC) to give suppliers the right to choose between their own replacement services and that of the supermarket.
AGIP also said that Walmart had failed to comply with two conciliations approved by the antitrust body and requested a fine equivalent to about $12 million.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Thursday, with investors refusing to be carried away by data showing the economy grew at a record pace in the third quarter as it rebounded from the Covid-19 lockdowns of spring.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 212 points, or 0.8%, at 26,308 points, extending the losses of Wednesday, which was its worst day in four months. The S&P 500 was down 0.3% while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%, ahead of a big day for tech earnings. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter are all due to report later. 
Earlier, the Commerce Department had said that gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 33.1% in the third quarter, somewhat above forecasts but still not enough to bring GDP back to its pre--pandemic level. The number of initial jobless claims last week, meanwhile, fell by more than expected, but pointed to a continued high rate of layoffs at 751,000. 
Elsewhere, pending home sales data confirmed a weakening in housing market trends in September, falling 2.2% on the month. New home sales had also weakened from multiyear highs earlier in the week.
Among the early gainers was Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) stock, which rose 31% after the social media company posted strong revenue and user growth in its third-quarter earnings, helped by an increase in spend from advertisers that boycotted Facebook throughout the summer.
Less dramatic but also impressive was Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stock, which rose 1.2% after the telecommunications conglomerate beat expectations for subscriber growth both in its high-speed internet service and its new Peacock streaming service.
However, tech stocks which failed to live up to elevated expectations were punished harder than usual against a backdrop of nagging concerns about valuations. eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock fell 9.0% after reporting a sharp slowdown in gross merchandise value growth on its marketplace, and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) stock fell 8.6% after reporting a wider-than-expected loss for the quarter (despite adding more subscribers than it had guided for).
Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) and Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), two stocks that have generally outperformed as restrictions on social and economic life have been tightened, also fell 2.4% and 4.4%, respectively."
499,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",The Biggest IPO in World History Is Stoking an Investor Frenzy,"(Bloomberg) -- Chen Wu frantically clicked the order button on his online brokerage account as the clock struck noon.
Like thousands of individual investors in Hong Kong and across China, the 35-year-old software developer was desperate for a piece of Ant Group Co.'s (HK:6688) initial public offering. His brokerage was allowing a small number of clients to supercharge their bets on Ant using 33 times leverage, and the offer was only available on a first-come, first-served basis. Wu had to act fast.
“When it was released at noon, I refreshed my page again and again, clicked and clicked,” he said on Tuesday after securing a HK$5.7 million ($735,322) block of Ant shares, equivalent to more than 80% of his existing equity portfolio. “I got it around 12:01 p.m. and the quota ran out within minutes. I was lucky.”
Ant may not be a household name in most of the world, but the Chinese fintech behemoth controlled by Jack Ma has set off an investor frenzy for the history books. Brokers in Hong Kong say the IPO is generating unprecedented client interest, with one firm’s order system briefly shutting down on Tuesday after becoming overwhelmed by subscription requests. Bids for the retail portion of Ant’s concurrent listing in Shanghai totaled a record 19.05 trillion yuan ($2.8 trillion) on Thursday, exceeding supply by more than 870 times.
The stampede is fueling to predictions of a first-day pop when Ant is due to start trading on Nov. 5, even though skeptics warn of risks including the U.S. election, tightening regulations in China and rising Covid-19 infections worldwide.

Whether Ant surges or not, its record-breaking $35 billion IPO represents a major vote of confidence in a company that could end up shaping the future of global finance. It also underscores China Inc.’s ability to marshal huge amounts of capital without tapping American markets, a win for Beijing as it tries to reduce its vulnerability to the threat of U.S. financial sanctions.
Ant is no doubt benefiting from the unusually buoyant mood among retail investors globally, but it’s not just the mom-and-pop crowd driving demand. Big-name money managers including Temasek Holdings Pte, T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and UBS Asset Management are also angling for allocations. Institutions and strategic investors may take up about 96% of the offering in Shanghai and 97.5% in Hong Kong, according to Ant’s prospectus, although the figures may change due to clawback and greenshoe provisions.
Retail investors are still likely to have a significant impact once trading begins -- particularly in Shanghai where individuals drive the vast majority of daily turnover. About 5.16 million retail accounts subscribed for Ant shares on the city’s Star market, where traders are required to have a minimum 500,000 yuan in their accounts.
Meanwhile in Hong Kong, investors are taking advantage of historically low interest rates to amplify their bets with borrowed money. Futu Securities, the brokerage that suffered a brief outage due to a flood of orders on Tuesday, said its margin quota for Ant was used up in about 20 minutes. Banks and brokerages in the city have so far provided about HK$420 billion of margin loans to retail punters, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported on Thursday.
“There has been unprecedented investor interest,” said Jasper Chan, assistant manager of corporate finance at Phillip Securities, which allocated all of the HK$20 billion it set aside for Ant margin loans on the first day they became available. Chan said demand for the IPO has been more broad-based than usual because of the small minimum lot size of 50 shares, which equates to about HK$4,040.
Yuki Chung, a 30-year-old university teaching assistant in Hong Kong, said she’s planning to bid for HK$500,000 of Ant shares, 90% of which will be funded with borrowed money. “Margin rates offered by banks can be less than 1%, which is definitely very attractive,” she said. “Everyone is taking part in the IPO, so I feel like I should too. I don’t want to lose out.”
Others are wary of placing too much faith in a rally. Elle Lam, a 28-year-old media professional who has invested in several Hong Kong IPOs this year, plans to order just one 50-share lot of Ant, using the rest of her available cash to bid on the Hong Kong government’s upcoming issuance of inflation-linked bonds.
“People are certainly too hyped up,” Lam said. “I think Ant’s valuation is too expensive, so the gain on the debut day could be limited.”
The IPO price translates into a multiple of about 36 times estimated 2021 earnings, surpassing average valuations for both global payments companies and large Hong Kong-listed tech stocks, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.
Still, rich valuations haven’t been a deterrent for Hong Kong IPOs of late. Bottled water giant Nongfu Spring Co., which debuted in the city last month after receiving orders for 1,148 times the amount of shares it initially set aside for retail investors, is now valued at about 55 times estimated earnings after soaring 65% from its offering price.
“I think Ant can rise 30%-40% in the first day,” said Wu, the software developer who took on debt to buy shares. “I’m not too worried about the performance.”

500,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 08:35AM ET</span>",AB InBev CEO dismisses speculation he is stepping down soon,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) -  Anheuser-Busch InBev 's (BR:ABI) long-time Chief Executive Carlos Brito dismissed speculation about an imminent departure, telling Reuters on Thursday that he expected to be leading the world's largest brewer for some time to come.
The Financial Times reported in September that the company had started searching for a replacement for Brito and that he was involved in the process and planned to step down at some point next year.
Brito, who has been in charge for 16 years, told Reuters he expected to remain chief executive for ""many quarters"" to come.
""There's a whole bunch of rumours. We didn't confirm any of that, so just rumours like any others,"" he said in a phone interview after the company's third-quarter results. 
""The two of us are going to continue to talk about results for the next many quarters. So don't worry about that. You're not going to get rid of me.""
Brito said the company looked into ""succession planning"" every year and had stepped up its efforts in light of the pandemic, such as contingency planning in case top executives were laid up for a month or more in hospital with COVID-19.
""We do this exercise all the time, including for my position. We do that normally in October. This year we did it in March and April because of COVID. Any responsible company would do that to be ready for possible events,"" he said. ""This year we did it twice because of the COVID event."" 

AB InBev reported on Thursday a drop in third-quarter profit and scrapped its interim dividend after a shift to drinking at home pushed up its costs.

501,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 08:27AM ET</span>",Stock Rout Pushes Tech ETFs Toward Worst Outflow Since May 2019,"(Bloomberg) -- Whether it’s election jitters, virus concerns or old-fashioned bubble fears, the invincible halo surrounding American tech stocks this year is finally fading.
Investors are on course to pull the most money out of technology-focused exchange-traded funds since May last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. More than $1.5 billion has exited so far in October.
Tech names were among the hardest hit on Wednesday as the S&P 500 dropped the most since June amid growing fears the resurgent coronavirus will derail an economic rebound. Futures on Thursday pointed to a small bounce for the Nasdaq 100, nowhere near enough to erase miserable losses this week.
“They’ve been seen as this sector set apart from the rest of the economy because the profits have kept coming in,” said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer of Exencial Wealth Advisors. “That will start to be tested if this continues to drag on and consumer spending doesn’t get back to where it was.”
While the U.S. benchmark gauge fell 3.5% to close at the lowest in five weeks on Wednesday, tech shares in the index sank 4.3% overall and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). both tumbled more than 5%.
Against that backdrop, Invesco’s QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF (QQQ) saw $434 million of withdrawals. It’s leading October outflows with $1.3 billion, while its tripled-leveraged peer TQQQ is also on track for a loss.
Of course, the depth and speed of cash in this corner of the market mean tech ETF outflows could reverse in the final two trading days of the month. Sentiment surrounding the sector can change fast, and options activity has been booming. QQQ in particular has recently seen outsized flows in both directions.
Key to a reversal could be the earnings of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Facebook and Alphabet, all of which report on Thursday after the close. Even solid results may not be enough to turn the tide --  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).’s third-quarter profit beat expectations on Tuesday, but its stock plunged almost 5% in the next session.
“This is a temporary setback for tech,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. “Once the election is behind us and interest rates have found their new levels and stimulus is back on the table, the market will find its footing, and we’ll see some of the old trends reassert themselves.”

503,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 08:25AM ET</span>",Taco Bell online growth helps Yum beat comparable sales estimates,"(Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc (N:YUM) posted a smaller-than-expected drop in comparable sales and beat profit estimates on Thursday, helped by strong online sales at its Taco Bell chain as COVID-19 pandemic fears kept customers at home.
Fast-food restaurants, including rivals McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (N:CMG), have benefited from earlier digital investments, especially when dining rooms were closed at the height of the health crisis.
""For the second consecutive quarter, digital sales increased by more than $1 billion over the prior year and set a single quarter record of $4 billion,"" Chief Executive Officer David Gibbs said.
Net income rose about 11% to $283 million in the third quarter, as Yum recorded $8 million of pre-tax income due to the change in fair value of its investment in food delivery firm  Grubhub Inc  (N:GRUB). 
Yum said it sold its Grubhub stake for $206 million in the reported quarter, more than two years after the company made a $200 million investment to improve its delivery services. 
Grubhub is expected to be bought by European online food-ordering company Just Eat Takeaway.com NV (AS:TKWY) for $6.9 billion in the first half of 2021, pending approval from its shareholders and regulators. 
Comparable sales fell 2% for the KFC owner in the quarter ended Sept. 30, but beat the average analyst estimate of a 3.74% slide, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Taco Bell posted comparable sales growth of 3%, well above the estimate of a 1.75% rise.
At Pizza Hut, Yum's pizza chain that has long been grappling with stiff competition from Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) and others, comparable sales were down 3% and slipped 4% at KFC. 
Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.01 per share, compared with the estimate of 80 cents. 

Total revenue rose about 8% to $1.45 billion.

The luxury apparel retailer said it expects third quarter and full year earnings to continue to be adversely affected by the pandemic that has dulled consumer demand. 
Net revenue fell about 30% to $1.19 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 26, missing analysts' average estimate of $1.21 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The company reported a net loss of $39.1 million, or 53 cents per share, compared with a profit of $182.1 million, or $2.34 per share, a year earlier.

The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company has signed deals with the U.S. government and several other countries, and is in talks with a WHO-led group for supply of the vaccine, which is in large, late-stage human trials.
While the company did not give a clear timeline on the release of data from these trials on Thursday, it has said that early data is expected in the coming weeks, depending on the number of infections seen in its 30,000-volunteer study.
Moderna, which has no approved products on the market yet, is one of the handful of companies in final trials for the vaccine, along with large drugmakers like Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE).
""I believe that if we launch our COVID-19 vaccine, 2021 could be the most important inflection year in Moderna’s history,"" said Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel.

The company said it was in talks with the World Health Organization-backed COVAX facility on a tiered pricing proposal for its vaccine.

506,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Mixed; Earnings and Q3 GDP in Focus,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen mixed Thursday, amid caution after the hefty selloff of the previous session as the earnings season continues at a hectic pace, with a key gauge of economic growth set to be released later.
At 6:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.2%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 111 points, or 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 34 points, or 0.3%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 3.4% lower Wednesday, at a three-month low, while the S&P 500 index lost 3.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 3.7%, both to one-month lows. The Dow has closed lower four days in a row, its longest losing streak since February, and these indices are on course for their worst week in seven months. 
Confidence is fragile with five days to go before the presidential election, amid worries over rising numbers of coronavirus infections and tougher lockdowns with little chance of a new stimulus package in the near future.
Investors looking for positive catalysts will look to the ongoing earnings season, with a total of 70 companies from the S&P 500 due to report Thursday.
The oil sector has had a dreadful time during the pandemic. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is due to report before the bell, after European rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) raised its dividend earlier Thursday as it reported a larger-than-expected profit for the third quarter. 
A number of the big tech giants are scheduled to report earnings after Thursday’s closing bell, including Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Investors will also be looking for some good news from the preliminary estimate of U.S. third quarter GDP, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Forecasts are calling for a record rebound of 31.9% after a historic 31.4% plunge in the second quarter as the coronavirus pandemic caused the economy to slump.
The weekly report on initial jobless claims will also be closely watched amid concerns that the recovery in the labor market is slowing.
Oil prices retreated Thursday, as traders returned to fretting about the outlook for global demand in the wake of the new Covid-driven restrictions in Europe after the impact of Hurricane Zeta weakened.
Additionally, U.S. Energy Information Administration data Wednesday showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 4.3 million barrels last week, adding to worries about a potential supply glut.
U.S. crude futures traded 4.3% lower at $35.80 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract was down 3.9% at $38.06. Both contracts fell around 5% on Wednesday.
Elsewhere, gold futures were down 0.4% at $1,871.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1705.

The number of shares falling on the New York Stock Exchange exceeded those rising by 1,957 at the height of the selloff, sending the NYSE TICK Index to the second-lowest level since June. The gauge registered its most extreme reading ever that month, and has come close six times since then.
The resurgent pandemic, lack of new U.S. stimulus and looming presidential election are all contributing to investor nervousness. Combined with this year’s equity rebound and elevated volatility, it is leaving traders ready to hit the “sell” button.
Wednesday was the worst day for the U.S benchmark equity gauge since the TICK Index hit the record in June. The S&P 500 slumped 3.5% as all but 15 companies finished in the red.
On Thursday, U.S. equity futures were pointing to a small rebound, with S&P 500 contracts up 0.4% as of 7:11 a.m. in New York.

New York-based Blue Apron, which went public in 2017, said in February it is considering options including going private and a sale of the company or some of its assets, following rising competition.
""Since late March 2020, Blue Apron has experienced increased demand for its meal kits reflecting, in part, changes to consumer behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the company said.
Blue Apron in August completed an underwritten public offering, generating about $33 million, before entering into a new $35 million senior secured term loan earlier this month.
The company on Thursday posted a 13% increase in third-quarter net sales, as customers, now avoiding venturing out to restaurants due to fears of contracting the new coronavirus, ordered more of its meal kits.

Blue Apron also projected its fourth-quarter net revenue to grow about 15% to 19% from a year earlier.

510,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 07:34AM ET</span>","GDP, Jobless Claims, ECB and Big Tech Earnings - What's up in Markets","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Big Tech reports in the shape of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB); the U.S. will publish third-quarter GDP figures that will break records but not bring GDP back to where it was before the pandemic; weekly jobless claims will give a more up-to-date look at the state of the economy; the European Central Bank meets a day after France and Germany tightened their public health measures to stop the coronavirus, and central banks became net sellers of gold for the first time in a decade in the third quarter. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, October 29th.
1. Big Tech Earnings
It’s peak earnings season, with Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet all reporting after the close. The earnings again come only a day after some of their CEOs were in Congress, the timing thus sparing them the embarrassment of having to defend their monopoly profits at a time of widespread hardship across the economy.   
The sell-off in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock after it beat expectations on Tuesday night has generated some caution among analysts, amid signs that investors are starting to worry about sky-high valuations for a bunch of Big Tech names that have been seen by many as a safe haven from the rout elsewhere in the market this year.
Of interest to Apple may be news overnight that rival Samsung (KS:005930) posted its biggest profit in 18 months, thanks to a rebound in smartphone sales and strong demand for memory chips. The company is also positioning itself to substitute for Huawei in parts of the wireless networks business.
2. Q3 GDP, jobless claims due
The U.S. will report gross domestic product figures for the third quarter at 8:30 AM ET, along with the weekly jobless claims report.
Of the two, there’s no question which is the more important as regards the current dynamic of the economy: the weekly jobless numbers are much more up to date and have a more direct impact on consumer and voter sentiment with less than a week to go before the elections.
However, it’s the GDP figures that will likely grab more attention, if only because of the exaggerated numbers generated by annualizing the numbers. Analysts expect an annualized increase of 31% that, while unprecedented in superficial terms, still won’t bring actual GDP back up to its pre-pandemic level.
If anyone still has attention to spare after that, pending home sales data are due at 10 AM ET.
3. Stocks set for weak bounce; old economy updates supportive
U.S. stocks are set to open with the weakest of bounces after their worst day in four months on Wednesday, helped by some reassuring corporate updates overnight but still overshadowed by the spread of the Covid-19 virus across the U.S. and Europe.
By 7:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), Dow 30 futures were up 63 points, or 0.2%, while S&P 500 Futures were up 0.4% and NASDAQ Futures were up 0.7%.
Even before the Big Tech earnings-fest this evening, there are plenty of updates to grab the attention: Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) beat expectations thanks in part to a strong debut for its Peacock streaming service, while Anheuser Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD) rose 3.2% in Europe after reporting strong sales in the U.S. and Brazil that overshadowed a dividend cut. Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) meanwhile raised its dividend, only six months after an epoch-making cut.
Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) also reported stronger-than-expected sales for the quarter, while Tiffany's (NYSE:TIF) deal with LVMH (OTC:LVMUY) will go ahead after the two sides agreed a modest cut in LVMH’s offer price.
4. ECB set to meet as BoJ cuts growth forecast
The European Central Bank meets in Frankfurt, with the big question being whether it will react immediately to the tightening of restrictions on economic and social life in Germany and France that was announced on Wednesday.
Consensus is still that the ECB will wait until December to announce any new moves. But to keep markets happy, Christine Lagarde may signal an increase in bond purchases through the 1.35 trillion euro ($1.5 trillion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program at her press conference, which begins at 9:30 AM ET (1330 GMT).
Overnight, the Bank of Japan made no change to its monetary policy, but said the Japanese economy will shrink by 5.5% in the year through March, more than the 4.7% contraction it had previously forecast.
5. Central banks sell gold for first time in a decade
Central banks were net sellers of gold in the third quarter for the first time in over a decade, cashing in on the record high prices created by investor demand for hedging against pandemic risks.
According to the World Gold Council, the central banks of Turkey and Uzbekistan – both of which face intense balance of payments challenges – were the biggest sellers.
Central banks had fueled the rally in gold between 2014 and 2018, bolstering their reserves as confidence in the world economy led the previous rally in bullion to unwind. The other main pillar of demand for physical gold, from jewelry buyers in China and India, has also weakened markedly in recent months as prices have soared, the WGC said. Indian jewelry demand, in particular, was down by around 50%."

(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) on Thursday reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue, as strong sign-ups for broadband offset pandemic-related weakness in its theme park and filmed entertainment businesses.
The media giant gained 633,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, beating analysts’ average estimate of 534,000 net additions, according to research firm FactSet.
Comcast has taken a financial hit from the pandemic, which has wiped out movie ticket sales and hurt television advertising. But coronavirus restrictions have also given a big lift to services - like broadband and streaming video - that are in high demand due to people working from and staying at home.
The company's NBCUniversal segment, which includes NBC Entertainment and Universal Pictures, reported revenue of $6.72 billion, down 18.9% from a year earlier. Revenue at the filmed entertainment unit fell 25% from a year earlier due to shuttered movie theaters. Theme park revenue plummeted 80.9%.
Comcast said it had 22 million signups to its Peacock streaming service, launched nationwide on July 15.
Broadcast TV advertising revenue was down 11.5% and ad revenue at Comcast’s cable networks fell 2.1%.
Comcast lost 273,000 video customers in the quarter, fewer than the 466,000 loss estimated by FactSet and fewer than the 477,000 video customers it lost in the second quarter.
The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 65 cents, down 17.7% from the same period a year ago.

Comcast reported third-quarter revenue of $25.53 billion, beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of $24.74 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Chicago-based United said the program would give  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT)' rapid molecular ID Now tests, which take about 15 to 20 minutes, to all passengers above age 2.
The program will run from Nov. 16 through Dec. 11 on three evening flights a week from Newark Liberty International Airport to London's Heathrow Airport.
Global airlines are backing COVID-19 testing to replace or reduce 14-day quarantines and other restrictions that have battered demand. Airline trade group International Air Transport Association (IATA) in September forecasted a 66% decline in overall 2020 air traffic because of the pandemic.
United passengers from Newark, New Jersey, with a negative test would still be subject to U.K. quarantine requirements, the carrier said. 
But customers would have the assurance of flying on a plane where all travelers have tested negative and the program would strengthen the carrier's case to relax quarantines with passenger testing, a company spokesman said
""They (governments) have to make a decision that is rooted in safety and so what we are trying to do is to demonstrate that it is, in fact, safe,"" Josh Earnest, United's chief communication officer, told reporters.
Since United introduced testing on its San Francisco to Hawaii flights around two weeks ago, the number of people traveling has nearly doubled compared with the two-week period before the test was available, he said.
The test would be provided by appointment at an on-site testing facility at Newark airport.
Abbott Laboratories said this month its ID NOW COVID-19 rapid test showed 96.2% sensitivity and 99.5% specificity compared to lab-based molecular PCR tests, according to interim data from a study.

521,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>",Trump's stock market: A wild four years,"By Noel Randewich and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
(Reuters) - The Trump rally, a trade war, and then a crippling pandemic: The four years since President Donald Trump's 2016 election victory have been a period like no other for the U.S. stock market. 
Hours after Trump's unexpected win on Nov. 8, 2016, expectations of massive tax cuts and financial deregulation kicked off a stock rally that saw the S&P 500 (SPX) surge 5% in a month. Wall Street continued its path higher through a trade war and impeachment, going on to new record highs following a deep slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic that continues to cripple the global economy.

The Republican president has claimed credit for the rise, tweeting over 150 times about the stock market since he was elected, often when stocks were climbing. 
Graphic: Trump tweets as Wall St climbs https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/TRUMP/xklvymjrxvg/chart.png 
Despite recent volatility, the stock market has risen strongly during Trump's term, with the S&P 500 up over 50% since the November 2016 election, more than in the four years following Democrat Barack Obama's first election win in 2008. 
The technology sector has surged over 150% since Nov. 8, 2016, by far the strongest performer during that time, while the energy sector, which Trump has championed, has lost over half of its value. In the four years following Obama's 2008 win, consumer discretionary led, up 103%, while financials dropped 2%.

The S&P 500's performance since Trump's 2016 election has also been above average for presidents since the 1980s. Overall, the strongest stock market performance since the 1980s was under Democratic President Bill Clinton, while the weakest was under Republican President George W. Bush. However, stock market performance over the past four decades reflects no obvious benefit from Republican versus Democratic presidents.
Graphic: U.S. stocks under different Presidents https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/ELECTION/yxmvjjbjnvr/chart.png 
While Trump's presidency has been a wild ride for investors, other presidential terms have seen greater volatility. Stock market volatility since the start of the 1980s hit a high during the four years after Obama's first victory, before settling down in his second four years. It did rise moderately again under Trump.
For those looking for stronger gains ahead, a Trump win may be a favored outcome. Suggesting that investors favor the certainty of presidents they are already familiar with, the S&P 500 since 1950 has on average risen 9.6% in the year after presidents win re-election, compared with an average rise of 4.8% in the year following the election of new presidents, according to LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA).
The S&P 500's performance might predict the next president. 
Going back to 1944, incumbent presidents, or presidents from incumbent parties, won elections 82% of the time when the S&P 500 was positive in the three calendar months prior to Election Day, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA in New York. The S&P 500 is up less than 1% from July 31, with that historical pattern barely favoring Trump winning the upcoming vote.
However, with the coronavirus pandemic, the crippled economy and pandemic relief discussions front and center on Wall Street, the S&P 500’s recent gains may be a less accurate reflection of investors' view of the election outcome this time around. The S&P 500 tumbled over 3% on Wednesday, with investors blaming a global surge in coronavirus cases.
""If the market's focus is on the recovery from COVID, then that may take precedence over retaining the current administration,"" Stovall said.

522,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",Most Cathay Pacific pilots and cabin crew accept permanent pay cuts,"By Jamie Freed
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) said on Thursday that a majority of pilots and flight attendants had signed new contracts that will result in permanent pay cuts.
Cathay last week announced plans to cut 5,900 jobs to help it weather the pandemic, including nearly all of the positions at its regional airline Cathay Dragon, which it has shut down.
It is also seeking changes to contracts with pilots and cabin crew as part of a restructuring that would cost HK$2.2 billion ($284 million).
""We are very grateful that a majority of our pilots and cabin crew have already signed up to the new conditions of service,"" the airline said in a statement.
""We would like each and every one of our pilots and cabin crew to join us and be part of Cathay Pacific's future.""
The employees have until Nov. 4 to sign new contracts but they will receive one year of transitional benefits like housing allowances for pilots rather than the two years offered for those that signed up by Wednesday evening.
The airline has told them if they do not agree to the new contracts by next week, they face termination, according to unions representing pilots and flight attendants.
The pilot contracts, which are broadly in line with those given to new hires since 2018, will result in permanent salary reductions of up to 58%, the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association (HKAOA) said on Tuesday.
HKAOA General Secretary Chris Beebe last week told Reuters the decision to force pilots on to lower-paid contracts was ""draconian"" and ""short-sighted"".
Staff at many airlines around the world including rival Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) have agreed to temporary pay cuts to help their companies get through the COVID-19 crisis, but the Cathay reduction is permanent.
Cathay Chairman Patrick Healy told reporters last week that the terms of the new contracts were ""highly competitive"" with those of global peers.

Investing.com -- When Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) cut its dividend for the first time since the Second World War earlier this year, the move appeared highly symbolic – an acknowledgement that the Covid-19 pandemic had changed the outlook for Big Oil not just for the current cycle, but forever.
But fast forward six months, and – lo, and behold! – Western Europe’s biggest oil and gas major is hiking its dividend again, with promises of more to come in future years.  The payout was raised by 4% to 16.65 cents for the quarter, and CEO Ben van Beurden promised further increases in future.
Talking to Bloomberg TV, van Beurden touted the move as evidence of a successful ‘reset’, which has seen the company slash it capital spending budget from over $25 billion to less than $19 billion and pare back operating costs with similar aggression.
With costs reset at a lower level, van Beurden argued that the company can still pay a higher dividend and cut net debt, which had leaped in the second quarter. In the three months through September, net debt fell to $73.5 billion, while gearing, which tracks debt against equity levels, fell to 31.4% from 32.7%.
The company reckons a net debt level of around $65 billion is commensurate with an AA debt rating that would allow it to borrow at rock-bottom rates for the foreseeable future, so evidence of progress to that level is clearly important.
But is it sustainable? Two arguments that suggest it is are that the company remains convinced of the future of liquefied natural gas, where it is one of the world’s dominant players, and which it sees growing at 3%-4%. Another is the progress it has made reorienting its downstream activities away from sub-scale refineries in Europe and other slow-growth regions. Van Beurden said that the handful of refineries that it keeps will be fully integrated into more viable product lines such as biofuels and petrochemicals.
Another reason for optimism is the – so far clear – determination of OPEC and its allies to risk a rerun of the debacle in the spring. While it hasn’t yet confirmed the move, the latest tightening of public health measures in Germany, France and much of the rest of Europe make it all but certain that the increase of 2 million barrels a day of output, scheduled for the start of next year, will be pushed back, supporting crude prices.
Last but not least – it’s not just Shell that is taking such action. Equinor, the Norwegian state-controlled major that is absolutely nobody’s idea of a red-blooded capitalist machine hell-bent on maximizing short-term returns, also said it would raise its dividend on Thursday, despite a decline in quarterly profit.
Even so, it’s hard to rid oneself of the suspicion that the move smacks of desperation. The record profit on fuel sales was due to exceptional weakness in crude prices in spring, and that will be hard to replicate. Moreover, global fuel demand is still running 15% below year-earlier levels (according to BP (NYSE:BP)), and global demand is set to peak much earlier than was expected before the pandemic. Even gas will find it increasingly hard to compete with renewables in the power space as technological improvements reduce its current price advantage.
Shell’s fall from grace with dividend investors in the third quarter was brutal, and the stock is still down 60% this year despite a 2% rebound on Thursday.  At the new level, the dividend yield is an implicit 4.74%. That’s still well below where it was pre-Covid, but at least back up to a level that institutional investors could see as a good entry point - if they can bring themselves to forgive van Beurden for the earlier carnage."

526,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",TikTok owner ByteDance launches education technology brand Dali for China,"By Yingzhi Yang and Brenda Goh
BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing-based ByteDance announced a standalone education technology (edtech) brand Dali for the Chinese market on Thursday, becoming another major tech player looking to capitalise on the sector's boom driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Dali, meaning “forceful strength” in Chinese, will host all the education business of ByteDance and already has 10,000 employees, Dali Chief Executive Chen Lin told a press conference in Beijing. 
ByteDance founder and chief executive Zhang Yiming said in a statement: “We started to develop interests in the education industry very early on. The brand independence of Dali Education is just the beginning of a long journey.” 
Demand for education technology grew during the coronavirus pandemic as widespread lockdowns in China and school closures forced students to take online classes from home for many months.
ByteDance entered into the education sector in 2016 by investing in edtech startups and also developing education products on its own. The company operates a number of education-related apps, from English tutoring to live courses. 
On Thursday it also launched a product with an artificial intelligence-based camera that can help parents tutor their kids. Priced between 799 yuan ($119) and 1,099 yuan, it is currently only available in China. 
ByteDance has made education technology one of its top priorities this year alongside short video app TikTok, which is facing pressure to be divested from its owner amid Washington’s concerns that Beijing could force the company to turn over user data.
Eight-year-old ByteDance’s revenue mainly comes from its Chinese short video app Douyin and news aggregator Jinri Toutiao. Chen said in July that the education business won’t look to become profitable for three years.
The company is a late entrant to China’s online education market, as industry leader Yuanfudao was founded in 2012 and Baidu-backed (BIDU.O) Zuoyebang started up in 2013. Yuanfudao completed three rounds of financing this year, with social media and gaming giant Tencent (0700.HK) leading in two rounds, bringing Yuanfudao's valuation to $15.5 billion.

528,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>",Democrats prefer 'scalpel' over 'jackhammer' to reform key U.S. internet law,"By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Big Tech's decisions to block some posts and videos while letting other content viewed as inflammatory proliferate have drawn the ire of Republicans and Democrats alike, raising the prospect that a 24-year-old U.S. law that fostered the internet's explosion will be pared back.
While many Republicans call for the repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, Democrats would prefer targeted, surgical revision of the law protecting Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter from being sued for content posted by users.
President Donald Trump and top Republicans, angered by what they allege is tech companies' censorship of conservative ideas, say the legal shield has outlived its usefulness. That thinking was on full display at a hearing held to discuss the law on Wednesday.
Democrats have also taken aim at the law because they claim it fails to tackle widespread misinformation and hate. But they argue the law is important to free speech online and want a more deliberate and moderate approach to reform. 
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has called for ""revoking"" the law, but many believe he will be more receptive to ideas from congressional Democrats if he wins the election.
Multiple Democratic lawmakers said in interviews that they oppose repeal of Section 230, which allows companies to take down or leave material on their platforms without the risk of facing lawsuits.
""Repealing it outright is not viable,"" Representative Anna Eshoo, a Democrat from California said. She has introduced legislation to remove tech companies' liability protections if their algorithms amplify harmful, radicalizing content that leads to offline violence. She advocated using ""a scalpel instead of a jackhammer to reform the critical statute.""
The approach has also found support from Virginia's Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, according to a staffer. Manchin's bill, which is co-sponsored by Republican John Cornyn, aims to stop the sale of opioids and illicit drugs online by amending 230 protections. It requires companies to report suspicious activity to law enforcement or be held liable for that failure. 
An aide to Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon who originally co-authored Section 230, said the senator urges caution on steps that could limit free speech online. ""He isn't saying no one can ever change a word of Section 230, but that politicians need to be very careful when it comes to tinkering with foundational laws around speech and the internet,"" the aide said.
Meanwhile tech trade groups over the past year began an aggressive lobbying effort against changing the law and view calls for repeal as draconian.
""I do expect the more extreme statements on wanting a full repeal to die down... the Democrats are walking that kind of rhetoric back,"" said Carl Szabo, general counsel for Netchoice - a trade group that counts Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook and Twitter among its members.
A MODERATE APPROACH
There is an array of proposals on Capitol Hill. Most of the bills that have found Democratic sponsors seek to change protections for harmful conduct on online platforms like crime, rather than on user speech.
Legislation from Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) goes after online child pornography. Companies that do not detect such images would lose their 230 immunity. The legislation, however, has been criticized by civil rights groups as infringing privacy of ordinary users. https://reut.rs/3munhZA
Democratic Senator Brian Schatz and Senate No. 2 Republican John Thune propose another bill that would require platforms to explain their content screening practices in everyday language, notify users of content rejection within 14 days and allow appeals.
Matt Perault, director at the Duke University's Center for Science and Technology Policy, said the U.S. election has given momentum to calls for revoking Section 230, which would radically alter the nature of online expression.

""No matter the outcome of the election, I think Section 230 reform will be on the agenda next Congress,"" Representative Eshoo said.

(Reuters) - Industrial materials maker DuPont (N:DD) on Thursday forecast full-year profit above Wall Street expectations as it kept a tight check on costs and benefited from a recovery in the automotive industry, one of it biggest markets.
The company, which makes everything from brake fluid to fabric used in protective garments, has been cutting costs to battle weak demand in several industries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
DuPont is heavily exposed to the auto industry, which has picked up momentum with car makers seeing a revival in sales after relaxation of lockdowns in several economies.
The company said its third-quarter sales in transportation and industrial business fell 14%, but rose 20% from the prior quarter. 
Sales in its electronics and imaging business rose 7%, helped by builds in semiconductor technologies ahead of the launch of some premium smartphones. 
Meanwhile, the industrial giant further raised its target to cut expenses by $280 million for the year, $100 million more than its previous forecast.
It forecast full-year profit of $3.17 to $3.21 per share, well above estimates of $3.03, according to Refinitiv data.

The company's adjusted profit, however, fell about 10% to $645 million, or 88 cents per share, as lower demand hit volumes in the nutrition, transportation and construction businesses.

531,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>","Analysis: U.S. drugmakers, bracing for price cuts, shift election support toward Democrats","By Carl O'Donnell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. pharmaceutical industry, long a supporter of Republicans, is giving almost half its political donations to Democratic candidates in this year’s election, as companies look to fend off a threat to drug prices if Democrats gain power.
So far this year, industry-run political action committees (PACs) have divided about $13 million between the two major U.S. political parties, with 54% to Republicans and 46% to Democrats, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) reviewed by Reuters.
That is a stark shift from 2016, when nearly two thirds of industry campaign donations went to Republicans. The industry moved less dramatically toward Democrats in 2018 during the congressional elections.
Senior pharmaceutical executives lean Republican, while workers' donations skew toward Democrats and largely supported Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden, data shows. Biden leads Republican President Donald Trump in national opinion polls in the last week before next Tuesday's election.
The industry-level shift, based on support from non-profit political action committees affiliated with drug companies, funded by employees and directed by executives and staff, reflects a consensus that Democrats will expand their hold on the House of Representatives and may gain control of the Senate. 
Pharma companies aim to build close relationships with politicians who are likely to be in power, and usually avoid presidential races and close congressional campaigns, said an industry executive who was not authorized to speak publicly.
He and other industry sources said drugmakers were aiming to head off efforts by Democrats to slash drug prices paid by Medicare, a government-run health insurance program for seniors, industry sources said.
“They are interested in funding whoever they think might win,” said David  Gartner  (NYSE:IT), professor of law at Arizona State University who focuses on U.S. healthcare policy.
That may mean contributing to lawmakers who disagree with the industry. 
A plan earlier this year that was stymied by Senate Republicans would have reduced pharma revenues from Medicare by more than $300 billion by the end of the decade, the Congressional Budget Office calculated.
Trump, in a departure from his party, has issued several executive orders meant to cut drug prices, but experts say their impact will be limited by legal and other problems and that a Democratic Congress could mount a more serious challenge.
SHIFT IN SUPPORT
The biggest pharma PAC donations so far this year have come from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE),  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN), Abbvie Inc and Johnson & Johnson, which all shifted support toward Democrats between 2016 and 2020, records show. Pfizer’s change was the most dramatic, giving 63% of its funds to Republicans in 2016 and 51% in 2020.
In the 2018 election cycle, in which Democrats took control of the House, some 57% of the industry’s more than $17 million in donations went to Republicans. Industry PACs leaned Republican during each federal election in the past eight years by varying margins, political donation data shows.
Pharma industry employees, who are concentrated in Democratic-leaning hubs including California, Massachusetts and New York, consistently tilt Democratic. They are supporting Biden at a rate of about 4 to 1 or roughly $6 million to $1.5 million in donations, data show.
Top executives, however, lean Republican. A Reuters review of top pharma executives showed a nearly 2-1 split in favor of Republicans, with more than $150,000 going to Republicans and around $75,000 to Democrats. Individual donations tend to reflect personal political leanings, experts said.
A broader measure of individual donations that covers the entire healthcare industry and includes donations to super PACs, which can take unlimited funds and often attract wealthy donors, shows Trump receiving about $60 million to Biden's $54 million, according to CRP data. 
There are broad concerns that the Trump administration is inserting political issues into regulatory decisions, which could indirectly hurt the drug industry's reputation. 

But Aaron Kesselheim, a Harvard Medical School specialist in U.S. healthcare policy, said: “I don’t really think that has much to do with political donations, which are trying to curry favor with the party that seems to be ascendant.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Buyout firm  Carlyle Group  Inc (O:CG) reported on Thursday a smaller-than-expected 6% drop in third quarter distributable earnings as growth in its private equity and credit businesses partly offset a decline in asset sales from its real estate and energy divisions.
Carlyle said distributable earnings (DE) - the cash available for paying dividends - fell to $151.8 million from $160.7 million a year earlier. This translated to DE per share of 40 cents, which surpassed the Wall Street consensus average of 36 cents, according to data from Refinitiv.
The Washington, D.C.-based firm said its overall fund portfolio rose by 5% during the quarter, driven by private equity funds, which climbed 5%, while credit funds appreciated by 4%. Its real estate and energy funds rose 3% and 1% respectively.
By contrast, Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX), the world's largest private equity firm, said its private equity portfolio appreciated 12.2% in the quarter, while opportunistic and core real estate funds rose 6.4% and 3.5% respectively. 
Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Carlyle reported a net income of $295.5 million, driven by a steep rise in investment income.
The firm said its total assets under management totaled $230 billion at the end of September, up from $221 billion three months earlier. It also closed the quarter with $74 billion in unspent capital.
Carlyle declared a quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share.

534,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>","Analysis: Exchanges, retail brokers, say they are ready for any post-U.S. election volatility","By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exchanges and retail brokers, under scrutiny after recent outages within their industries, have spent months planning for Election Day. Now their preparations, for what could be a highly volatile trading period, are about to be put to the test.
Earlier this month, glitches at  Euronext  (PA:ENX) impacted trading in several European countries and a hardware failure at the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TOPX) caused the worst-ever outage for the world's third-largest equity market. In August, cyberattacks hit New Zealand's stock exchange (NZ:NZX), and in July, a Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) trading platform was briefly hobbled for the second time since April.
Market malfunctions - there have been many https://www.reuters.com/article/us-euronext-stocks-outages-factbox/factbox-from-hungry-squirrels-to-cyberattacks-exchange-outages-roil-markets-idUSKBN274229 in recent years - can erode investor confidence, and exchange operators say they have taken measures to ensure they can handle a potential election-related spike in volatility. 
""This thing could take days, weeks, months, so we embarked on a journey of increasing our capacity by multiple times,"" Kevin Kennedy, head of U.S. options at Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ), said of the potential for drawn-out election results and his firm's preparations.
Nasdaq executives began looking ahead to the Nov. 3 election in March after the coronavirus pandemic whipsawed markets and sent trading volumes soaring, he said. 
The decision to boost capacity came after the number of stock trades at Nasdaq in March soared to two-and-a-half times their 2019 peaks, while options volumes tripled, said Tal Cohen, head of the exchange operator's North American markets. 
Nasdaq's systems performed without a hitch during the March trading surge, he added.
That was not the case across the industry.
Robinhood, the fintech startup credited with helping introduce a new generation of investors to trading through its app, has experienced several outages since early March, particularly on high-volume days.
The Silicon Valley-based brokerage said its priority is to ensure its platform performs as its customers need and expect it to, when asked what steps it has taken ahead of the election.
""This year, our engineering teams have worked diligently to further harden our infrastructure, improve reliability, and increase capacity,"" said a Robinhood spokeswoman.
Retail broker TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD), which had an outage on its desktop platform in August, and its new parent company,  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW), both said they are ready for a potentially volatile period in the markets. 
""We're lining up all available client service resources to be available to assist on the phones. In addition, we are communicating with clients about our election-related education and commentary,"" said a Schwab spokeswoman.
Exchange operator Cboe Global Markets (NYSE:CBOE), which had no issues during the coronavirus-driven volume surge, said its testing has shown it is ready to handle ""anticipated increased volatility around the U.S. presidential election.""
Still, Cboe said it increased the size of its Chicago-based trading floor to accommodate additional market makers and brokers.
""This was done to ensure adequate liquidity and broker coverage in anticipation of potential expanded volumes and volatility around the election,"" said a Cboe spokeswoman.
Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (N:ICE) New York Stock Exchange said it does regular testing but has not taken any special election-related measures.
Unrelated to the election, exchanges, along with banks, large brokers and market utilities, held an industrywide business continuity and disaster recovery plan test this past weekend to show they could operate from their backup sites in the case of an emergency. 
Overseas, Deutsche Boerse said its systems have enough capacity to handle heavy transaction loads, and that it has not put in place any new measures prior to the U.S. elections.

Euronext said its recent outage was due to a ""technical issue affecting a third-party component,"" and that its systems handled the high volumes earlier this year without incident.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Activists called on pharmaceutical companies on Thursday to be transparent about the costs and terms of providing COVID-19 vaccines, saying they must be available and affordable for all.
French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) said on Wednesday they would supply 200 million doses of their COVID-19 candidate vaccine to the global COVAX vaccine facility backed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the GAVI vaccine alliance.
Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) demanded the two companies provide details around price, supply and distribution of any vaccine proven safe and effective.
""Pharmaceutical corporations Sanofi and GSK must sell their vaccines at-cost and open their books to show the public exactly how much it costs to make the vaccine,"" said Kate Elder, senior vaccines policy adviser at MSF's Access Campaign.
""There is no room for secrets during a pandemic and past experience tells us that we can’t take pharma at their word without data to back up their claims,"" she said in a statement.
Sanofi and GSK could not immediately be reached for comment. 
No company has shared information on research and development, clinical trials or manufacturing costs of potential COVID-19 vaccines, MSF said, adding this was vital for the public to assess prices set.
More than half of the expected volume of doses of leading candidate vaccines has been bought up by 13% of the world, mainly high-income countries, the medical charity said.
Human Rights Watch, in a separate report, said governments funding vaccines with public money should be transparent about terms and conditions attached.
The New York-based group urged states to back a proposal by India and South Africa to wave some aspects of intellectual property (IP) rules on patents to enable large-scale manufacturing and affordability. 
A temporary IP waiver was debated this month in the World Trade Organization (WTO), but was opposed by the United States, European Union, Britain, Switzerland and others.
""Since the beginning of the pandemic our priority has been to ensure that all people enjoy the fruits of science ... In these difficult times the best health technologies and discoveries cannot be reserved only for a few, they must be available to all,"" WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a UNESCO event on ""Open Science"" on Tuesday.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's LVMH (PA:LVMH) will pay slightly less to acquire U.S. jeweler  Tiffany & Co  (N:TIF) after the two companies agreed to end a bitter dispute triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and salvage the luxury sector's biggest-ever deal. 
The new takeover price was set at $131.5 a share, down from $135 in the original deal, the companies said in a statement on Thursday, bringing the total price tag to about $15.8 billion. 
That represents an overall discount of $425 million for LVMH, which is led by billionaire businessman Bernard Arnault, a consummate dealmaker who is betting the French giant can restore Tiffany's lustre by investing in stores and new collections. 
""We are as convinced as ever of the formidable potential of the Tiffany brand and believe that LVMH is the right home for Tiffany and its employees during this exciting next chapter,"" Arnault said in the statement. 
Other key terms of the deal, initially agreed last November, remain unchanged, the companies added. 
The transaction, which has received regulatory clearance, is expected to close in early 2021, subject to Tiffany shareholder approval. Under the revised deal, Tiffany will pay its regular quarterly dividend of $0.58 per share on Nov. 19.
""Tiffany and LVMH have also agreed to settle their pending litigation in the Delaware Chancery Court,"" the statement from the companies said.
LUXURY WAR OF WORDS
The new deal, whose main details emerged on Wednesday, brings to an end an acrimonious and public war of words between two of the luxury industry's best known groups.
The initial deal ran into trouble last month when Louis Vuitton owner LVMH said it could no longer complete the transaction by a Nov. 24 deadline.
It cited a French political intervention asking it to delay completing the acquisition until Jan. 6 due to a threat of new U.S. tariffs on French products, and also decried the jeweller's ""dismal"" performance during the coronavirus crisis.
Tiffany in return sued LVMH in a Delaware court, seeking to force it to honour the original deal. The case had been scheduled to be heard in early January.
However, a source close to the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that Tiffany had recently approached LVMH with a more conciliatory tone. 
This source said the worsening pandemic in Europe and the United States also played a role in bringing the two sides back to the negotiating table as business conditions deteriorate, and that discussions over Tiffany's management under LVMH had been left for a later date.
""We are very pleased to have reached an agreement with LVMH at an attractive price and to now be able to proceed with the merger, said Tiffany Chairman Roger Farah.
""The board concluded it was in the best interests of all of our stakeholders to achieve certainty of closing.""
BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S
Some analysts have questioned why LVMH had sparked such a bitter dispute with Tiffany for what ended up being a relatively modest price cut, though ending the spat allows the French group to save on potentially costly legal fees.
The deal is designed to boost LVMH's smallest business, the jewellery and watch division that is already home to Bulgari and Tag Heuer, and help it expand in one of the fastest-growing industry segments while also strengthening its U.S. presence.

New York-based Tiffany, immortalised in the 1961 movie Breakfast at Tiffany's starring Audrey Hepburn and known for its signature pale blue boxes, retains a resonance as the go-to purveyor of engagement rings that only a handful of rivals can match.

541,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: AirAsia X to revise $15.3 billion debt reform plan to expedite talks with creditors - sources,"By Liz Lee
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's  AirAsia X Bhd  (KL:AIRX) plans to drop a local airport operator from its $15.3 billion debt restructuring plan to expedite discussions with creditors as its cash is running out fast, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The budget carrier is seeking to reconstitute the $15.3 billion of unsecured debt into a principal amount of 200 million ringgit ($48 million) and have the rest waived.
But Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) (KL:MAHB) filed a lawsuit last week to claim 78 million ringgit ($18.74 million) owed by AirAsia X and a separate application to be excluded from the restructuring scheme, arguing that its debts were secured.
A source, who was not authorised to speak publicly about the plans, told Reuters the legal action against the airline could delay its plan to restructure debt to stave off liquidation. 
The source said AirAsia X, the long-haul arm of AirAsia Group Bhd (KL:AIRA), has less than six months of cash left and has been looking to convene a meeting of creditors to vote on the scheme. 
""It needs to move on and have that meeting as soon as possible,"" the person said.
""Fundraising is expected to take a couple of months at least so it's imperative for the company to complete restructuring by January or February.""
AirAsia X declined to comment.
Airport operator MAHB said on Sunday its attempt to recover debt from AirAsia X would not derail the airline's scheme. But the legal suit follows similar action taken by another creditor. Aircraft lessor BOC Aviation Ltd (HK:2588) filed a lawsuit against AirAsia X and its subsidiary in August to claim $23 million in debt and this month applied to intervene in the airline's court application for its scheme.
The airline's restructuring proposal needs approval from creditors holding at least 75% of the total value of the debts, and the source said that the bulk of the figure is linked to future aircraft orders and it gives Airbus SE (PA:AIR) nearly 75% on its own.
""No creditor will want to make a decision if they don't know what the outcome with MAHB is,"" another source said, adding that MAHB could have the financial stamina for a legal battle but AirAsia X did not.
The sources said that the airline was hoping there would be no other new legal action that might impede the proposed creditors' meeting. 
Post restructuring, the airline plans to raise up to 500 million ringgit to restart the company, it said on Monday.

542,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse profit slides as wealth management fees fall,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) on Thursday posted a steeper-than-expected slide in third-quarter profit, as a surge in investment banking failed to offset a slowdown in wealth management and other headwinds it chalked up to exceptional circumstances.
Profit slid 38% during the quarter to 546 million Swiss francs ($602 million) as CS contended with its strongest foreign currency adversities in nearly a decade, along with higher credit loss provisioning and a one-off boost which had flattered last year's numbers.
That compared with a median forecast of 572 million francs from 17 analysts compiled by the Swiss bank.
A year earlier, Credit Suisse received a 327 million franc revenue boost from the sale of its InvestLab fund platform.
Despite the fall in profits the bank followed rival UBS (S:UBSG) in offering more to shareholders, scheduling up to 1.5 billion francs in share buybacks next year and a 5% rise in the 2020 dividend. 
Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein in July announced a round of cost cuts, including merging the global markets trading division and advisory-focused investment banking and capital markets unit, as his first major strategic stamp on the bank.
The newly merged investment banking unit saw pretax profit rise to 370 million francs, with increased trading helping equity and fixed income sales and trading surge 5% and 10%, while capital markets and advisory revenue rose 33%.
A drop in revenue at its international wealth management unit, a sore point in the second quarter, was more pronounced than analysts had anticipated.
Shares fell more than 5% in early trade, hitting a five-month low, as analysts noted disappointing wealth management revenue.
SORE SPOT
UBS last week posted a doubling of third-quarter profit as ultra-rich clients scrambled to trade and seal deals amid a boom in markets. Smaller peer  Julius Baer  (S:BAER) also reported strong client inflows.
Unlike Credit Suisse, UBS derives a large portion of revenue from private banking in the United States, a major market which has seen solid growth yet is absent from CS's otherwise largely global presence.
At Credit Suisse, wealth management suffered from foreign currency moves and lacked one-off items such as the prior year's InvestLab sale, without which revenue would have risen 5%.
In international wealth management, covering clients outside Switzerland and Asia, bumper trading which has buoyed wealth managers throughout the pandemic failed to offset lower recurring commissions and fees, and falling net interest income.
On conference calls executives conceded lower interest rates and a depressed dollar meant the unit would be more reliant on transaction revenues and higher lending to grow in coming quarters.
The bank aims to grow profit by 10% annually in its international wealth division from next year, particularly through tighter collaboration with its investment bank and greater lending efforts. It earlier this month announced the hiring of former Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) investment bank chief Christian Meissner to co-lead the unit's advisory efforts.
In its home market, where it is closing roughly a quarter of its branches, Credit Suisse saw adjusted revenue rise 1% during the quarter, recording similar gains in both its corporate business as with retail and private banking clients due to strong transaction activity.
It hopes the introduction of a digital banking app challenging fintechs like Revolut will help grow its retail market share while saving on costs.
Shares in CS have so far this year lost more than a quarter of their value, falling twice as much as those of UBS, but staying ahead of the European banking sector as a whole (SX7P).

(Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) returned to profit in the third quarter as surging Chinese demand for luxury cars helped offset a 1.1% drop in vehicle deliveries due to the ongoing global COVID-19 crisis.
VW's return to profitability comes amid spiking coronavirus cases in Europe that lead to the French and German governments ordering their countries back into strict national lockdowns on Wednesday.
""The coronavirus remains a central problem,"" VW Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter said in a conference call with reporters. ""This situation now is anything but relaxed.""
The German automaker reiterated it expects to post a profit for the full year, saying that its business ""recovered noticeably"" in the quarter as sales in China of its premium vehicles, including Audi and Porsche sportscars, rose 3%.
Witter said that because of market volatility the car maker would not issue a more specific full-year profit forecast.
During the third quarter, VW's performance was aided by a series of cost-cutting measures launched earlier this year. 
VW said its net liquidity rose to 24.8 billion euros from 18.7 billion at the end of the second quarter.
Excluding one-time items, its third-quarter operating profit was 3.2 billion euros ($3.78 billion), down from 4.8 billion euros a year earlier.
VW reported a 5.4% adjusted operating return on sales in its automotive division, rebounding from minus 5.8% in the second quarter though below the 7.4% it recorded a year earlier.
Revenue fell 3.4% to 59.36 billion euros.
It said while its full-year 2020 profit would still be ""severely lower"" than in 2019, it would still be in ""positive territory"" after a second-quarter loss of 1.7 billion euros.
In a note to clients, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Philippe Houchois described VW's results as a ""solid performance with strong cash but relatively muted in the context of the (auto) sector recovery."" 
The auto industry has rebounded well from lockdowns that closed production plants and dealerships. 
Last week  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) reported a record 24% jump in Chinese demand for its Mercedes-Benz cars, boosting its margins in the third quarter.
Italian-American car maker  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) and  Peugeot  (OTC:PUGOY) manufacturer PSA Group (PA:PEUP) both posted solid results this week ahead of their planned merger next year.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Thursday, bouncing off Wednesday’s sharp losses, helped by some positive corporate news and ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting.
At 3:35 AM ET (0835 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.1%.
The announcement of additional measures to try and combat the new surge in Covid-19 cases, with France closing all non-essential businesses and Germany shutting its hospitality industry for a month, hit European stock markets hard Wednesday, with the DAX, for example, closing 4.2% lower.
But positive corporate updates have helped to steady the ship on Thursday. 
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) stock rose 3.3% after the oil major reported a larger-than-expected profit for the third quarter and raised its dividend, just six months after slashing it for the first time since the Second World War.
Lloyds (LON:LLOY) stock rose 2% after the U.K. bank blew expectations away with its third quarter profit, after receiving its biggest quarterly increase in mortgage applications since 2008. 
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stock rose 1.9% after the German car manufacturer returned to profit in the third quarter, helped by surging Chinese demand for luxury cars, while Anheuser Busch Inbev (BR:ABI) gained 2.7% as the world’s largest brewer reported impressive earnings on the back of strong demand in the U.S. and Brazil.
It wasn’t all good news though, as Nokia (NYSE:NOK) stock fell over 12% after the Finnish telecom network equipment maker reported disappointing third-quarter underlying profits in its first earnings report under new Chief Executive Pekka Lundmark.
Later in the session, investors will look to the European Central Bank for guidance after its governing council meeting. 
“The ECB is moving closer towards more action, but it is too early to do so this month. While we look for a dovish bias and hints at more asset purchases (to come in December) this should not catch markets off guard,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Also of interest later in the session will be a reading of how the U.S. economy, the world’s largest, performed in the third quarter, as well as earnings from tech giants Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Oil prices retreated Thursday, as traders returned to fretting about the outlook for global demand in the wake of the new Covid-driven restrictions in Europe after Hurricane Zeta hit the coast of Louisiana and weakened.
Additionally, U.S. Energy Information Administration data Wednesday showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 4.3 million barrels last week, adding to worries about a potential supply glut.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $37.10 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract was down 0.7% at $39.36. Both contracts fell around 5% on Wednesday.

546,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 04:00AM ET</span>","Airbus sets quarterly cash goal, takes heavy restructuring charge","By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) said on Thursday it expected to reach cash breakeven in the fourth quarter, giving investors the first glimpse of future performance since the start of the coronavirus crisis after halting the bleeding of cash in the third quarter.
The European planemaker, which is slashing jobs to cope with collapsing air travel demand, also took a 1.2-billion-euro ($1.42 billion) restructuring charge that drove it to a loss despite better-than-expected underlying operating profit.
Underlying or adjusted operating profit of 820 million euros marked a 49% drop from the same period last year, while revenues fell 27% to 11.2 billion euros. 
Analysts were expecting quarterly adjusted operating profit of 708 million euros on revenues of 11.439 billion, according to a company-compiled consensus.
Airbus said it had contained cash outflows in the third quarter as it narrowed a gap between production and deliveries to airlines, which had slumped at the outset of the crisis.
However, the announcement came as France and Germany, where Airbus has its main factories, announced new restrictions to try to contain a resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic.
Airbus has been saddled with a backlog of some 145 aircraft that airlines have postponed absorbing into their fleets as they struggle to survive the crisis. It said that this overhang of undelivered jets had shrunk to 135 planes by end-September.
The company has shored up deliveries partly by striking storage agreements with airlines unable to put jets directly into service. But some industry sources said a new lockdown in France raised new questions about its ability to deliver jets.
Airbus has said its planning reflects talks with customers.
The company said its new restructuring charge may have to be reassessed depending on ongoing talks with unions over 15,000 job cuts, though it said these had ""advanced well"".
Chief Executive Guillaume Faury warned staff last month that cuts could include the first compulsory redundancies at Airbus as air travel failed to rebound as quickly as hoped.
Airbus also shed more light on a recent effort to smooth a long-running trade row with Boeing (NYSE:BA) and the United States over aircraft subsidies by resetting the terms of French and Spanish government loans, saying it had cost 236 million euros.

The loans have been ruled illegal by the World Trade Organization, leading to U.S. tariffs on European goods. The European Union this week formally won the right to put its own tariffs on U.S. goods over aid for Boeing that the WTO found illegal. Both sides claim to have withdrawn illegal support.

547,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 03:50AM ET</span>",StanChart flags improved loan loss outlook after quarterly profit beats estimates,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Lawrence White
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) -   Standard Chartered   (L:STAN) posted a smaller-than-expected 40% slide in third-quarter profit as it lowered its loan loss expectations linked to the coronavirus pandemic, adding that it believes client demand will increase next year.
Underscoring its improved earnings outlook, StanChart also said it may resume dividend payments when it releases full-year results in February.
Credit impairment charges came in at $358 million for the three months ended Sept. 30, up 27% from the same period last year, but well below the preceding quarter's $611 million and a consensus estimate of $614 million.
StanChart said the results reinforced its view that credit impairments would be lower in the second half of the year than the first, as lenders worldwide report loan losses stabilising.
The key question now facing analysts and investors is whether various government support measures such as emergency loans and furlough schemes have genuinely mitigated losses, or merely pushed them back into next year.
""Given the extreme economic pressures relating to the persistence of COVID-19, partially addressed through the efficacy of government support measures, it is not possible to reliably predict the quantum or timing of future impairments,"" StanChart said.
Lower provisions helped it report an underlying pretax profit of $745 million, above the $502 million average of analysts' forecasts compiled by the bank.
StanChart, which is focused on Asia, Africa and the Middle East, also struck a positive note when forecasting client demand, saying it expected improvement next year on the back of a faster-than-expected economic recovery in key markets including China and India.
""Lower interest rates continue to impact income but we remain well-positioned to meet our financial targets, albeit with some delay,"" Chief Executive Bill Winters said in an earnings statement.
StanChart's Hong Kong-listed shares (HK:2888) were down 1.8% after the results, underperforming the broader market.
The pandemic has brought on a perfect storm for many global banks, propelling them to cut costs and restructure further as bad loans mount, lending margins are squeezed and interest rates hit rock-bottom or even turn negative.
StanChart announced last month it would merge several businesses and cut its number of senior executives.
Both StanChart and rival HSBC (L:HSBA), whose shares have nearly halved in value this year, are also grappling with political uncertainty in Hong Kong - a key market for both of them.
StanChart said the lender was focusing on generating more fee-based income, particularly from financial markets and wealth management businesses, where it was seeing increased client demand, to offset the impact of low interest rate.

HSBC said on Tuesday it would embark on a pandemic-induced overhaul of its business model, seeking to flip its main source of income from interest rate to fee-based businesses.

Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc raised its dividend and pledged to grow the payout steadily, just six months after slashing it for the first time since the Second World War.
Amid a painful year for Big Oil, the Anglo-Dutch energy giant offered investors some good news. It also reported a larger-than-expected profit for the third quarter, even as most of its divisions continued to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Shell’s dividend will grow by 4% to 16.65 cents a share for the quarter, and increase annually thereafter, the company said in a statement on Thursday.
“Our sector-leading cash flows will enable us to grow our businesses of the future while increasing shareholder distributions, making us a compelling investment case,” Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said in the statement.
Shell’s adjusted net income was $955 million in the third quarter, down 80% from the same period a year ago, but better than even the highest analyst estimate.

551,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 03:25AM ET</span>",Banks roll out robots as pandemic shakes up IT plans,"By Iain Withers and Anna Irrera
LONDON (Reuters) - When banks were flooded with loan requests from businesses struggling with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, hastily built robots helped several lenders cope with the deluge.
The bots were one of many quick technology changes deployed across the industry during the crisis, a contrast to the slow progress it's made in the past two decades to improve technology in the face of increasing competition from fintech rivals.
Now the jolt from the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the process even though banks globally are having to cut IT spending this year for the first time since 2009, based on data from research company IDC. 
""Bots allowed us to process a much higher volume of applications than we would have been able to do before. It meant the timelines didn't get longer with the massive volume,"" said Simon McNamara, chief administrative officer at Britain's NatWest (L:NWG), which has granted more than 13 billion pounds ($16.90 billion) of state-backed loans. 
It is a pattern that has played out across banks globally, where technology changes that would usually take months were done in a matter of days. 
At  Citigroup  (N:C), there was a 300% rise from a year earlier in the number of new accounts opened digitally by corporate or fund clients during March, while the number of those clients using its online and app services rose 25%.
""We were seeing this trend pre-COVID but it accelerated during COVID,"" Naveed Sultan, Citi's (N:C) global head of transaction banking, said.
""The traditional ways of working became almost non-existent.""
But as banks have to budget for a pick-up in loan losses due to the pandemic, some projects, such as large-scale customer data mining to offer more personalised services may have to be shelved, IDC research showed.
Global IT spend by banks is set to shrink by 1.7% this year to $200 billion, down from $203.5 billion in 2019, based on IDC data. Growth is then forecast to resume over the next three years, albeit at a slower pace.
(Graphic: Bank tech spending link: https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/oakpenyojvr/chart.png)
CRISIS LOANS
Banks have prioritised process automation in the face of spiking workloads as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, based on IDC surveys of bank executives.
Santander's (MC:SAN) UK division rolled out data analytics tools to speed up loan application processing and credit checking as borrowers came under strain.
""We had prepared but the volume was higher than expected,"" Santander UK's chief technology officer Carlos Selonke told Reuters. ""It's a huge focus for us, making changes to increase our velocity.""
Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG) developed six bots within three days which assisted client advisers in handling the immense inflow of coronavirus crisis loan requests from businesses in Switzerland, said Mike Dargan, global head of group technology at UBS.
Banks have also been prioritising shifting data to the cloud to speed up response times and allow more staff to work from home, while also bolstering defences against the growing threat of cyber attacks.
""We had four main focus areas, remote working to enable the employees at UBS, system stability, as we saw a lot of volatility, cyber security, and operations continuity,"" UBS's Dargan told Reuters. 
'MOONSHOTS' ON HOLD
On the flip side, bank spending on consumer-facing technologies for branches and online services is forecast to grow more slowly, increasing from $31 billion in 2020 to $40 billion in 2024, according to IDC.
Other less urgent projects such as systems overhauls and longer term so-called ""moonshot"" digital ventures are being shelved.
""Banks are struggling to deploy new software,"" David Buxton, chief executive of Arachnys, a startup that sells compliance technology to banks. Many employees are still working remotely which means they may not have the tools needed for new and more ambitious IT projects, he said. 
NatWest ditched its fledgling digital savings brand Bó early into the pandemic.
McNamara said the pandemic was a factor in the decision as there was strong demand for the bank's existing mobile app, which has added 700,000 users since the pandemic started.
Although banks have reined in IT spending overall this year to cope with the initial pandemic fallout, IDC predicted growth will resume from next year, with overall spending forecast to jump by a quarter to $250 billion in 2024.
Industry experts say the pandemic has focused bank executives' minds when it comes to IT spend and more digitally savvy lenders will steal a march on competitors.
""There is a digital divide,"" Jerry Silva, global banking research director at IDC said. ""Sometimes I call it the predatory gap, because those banks are going to be able to steal market share from those that weren't prepared prior to 2020.""

552,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 03:02AM ET</span>",European Stocks Seen Higher; Lockdowns Put Pressure on ECB,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Thursday, bouncing after Wednesday’s sharp losses, as investors look to the European Central Bank for help.
At 2:20 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. were flat. 
The major European indices post hefty losses Wednesday, with the DAX ending down 4.2%, while the CAC 40 fell 3.4% and the FTSE 100 were down 2.6%. The news on Wall Street wasn’t much better, with the S&P 500, for example, closing 3.5% lower, its biggest drop since June 11.
The prime reason behind these losses was the announcement of additional measures to try and combat the new surge in Covid-19 cases, as France closed all non-essential businesses and Germany shut its hospitality industry for a month and banned most social gatherings. Italy and Spain have already imposed partial lockdowns.
With this in mind, investors will look to the European Central Bank for guidance after its governing council meeting later in the day. 
“The ECB is moving closer towards more action, but it is too early to do so this month. While we look for a dovish bias and hints at more asset purchases (to come in December) this should not catch markets off guard,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
That said, this decision has become more difficult as the continent-wide lockdowns will not only threaten another severe economic slump and will also put already stretched government budgets under more strain.
In corporate news, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) is likely to be in focus after the Finnish telecom network equipment maker reported disappointing third-quarter underlying profits in its first earnings report under new Chief Executive Pekka Lundmark.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) returned to a profit in the third quarter, reporting better-than-expected sales in the period, helped by robust demand in China, while Anheuser Busch Inbev (BR:ABI), the world’s largest brewer, reported impressive earnings on the back of strong demand in the U.S. and Brazil.
Oil prices edged higher Thursday, rebounding to a degree after the sharp falls from the previous session, helped by the shuttering of a large percentage of U.S. output in the Gulf of Mexico as Hurricane Zeta hit the coast of Louisiana.
However, Hurricane Zeta’s impact is likely to be short-lived, and the market will likely soon return to fretting about the surge in coronavirus cases and its impact on demand. U.S. Energy Information Administration data Wednesday showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 4.3 million barrels last week.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $37.44 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract was flat at $39.64. Both contracts fell around 5% on Wednesday.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,882.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1746.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asia's stock markets fell on Thursday, but without the panic selling seen in Europe and the United States, while U.S. futures jumped as investors tried to get a grip on fears that fresh lockdowns could derail a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.6%, with the heaviest drops in Australia, down 1.6%, and South Korea, down 1%.
Japan's Nikkei fell just 0.3%, Chinese blue chips rose 0.5% and the yuan led a gentle bounce in Asian currencies against the greenback. 
That was a far cry from the biggest falls on Wall Street and in Europe in months on Wednesday, highlighting Asia's emergence from a pandemic that has the rest of the world still mired.
Traders lifted S&P 500 futures 1% with the mood, and on hopes that spiking volatility might mean a swift rebound. European futures rose half a percent and FTSE futures rose 0.3%.
""Asia is not really partaking in this second or third wave story because it's got its COVID largely under control,"" said Rob Carnell, chief economist in Asia at Dutch bank ING.
""As a result, domestic economies look reasonable.""
As if to illustrate, Taiwan, which boasts Asia's best-performing currency, marked its 200th straight day without local transmission on Thursday, while France and Germany prepared for lockdowns and as the virus sweeps across the U.S. Midwest. 
Oil also steadied on Thursday, with Brent futures up 0.2% at $39.20 a barrel, after dropping 5% on Wednesday. 
Still, for the week so far the commodity, often regarded as a proxy for global energy demand and growth, is down 6.2% and world stocks down 4.7%, as the pandemic worsens and a U.S. election looms.
""Until yesterday the market was travelling with the hope the improvement of health care services in dealing with the pandemic would prevent the introduction of severe lockdowns,"" National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) FX strategist Rodrigo Catril said in a note.
""At least in Europe, this dynamic has now changed ... the question now is whether U.S. states will follow.""
FUNDAMENTALS
Economic data and a European Central Bank meeting are the main focus later on Thursday, with gathering uncertainty about Tuesday's U.S. election also keeping investors on edge.
The Bank of Japan made no changes to monetary policy settings, as expected, though trimmed its growth forecasts to reflect sluggish service spending during summer.
Investors expect the European Central Bank to similarly hold off on new measures, but to instead hint at action in December, which is likely to keep a lid on the euro.
The common currency hit a 10-day low on the dollar and a hundred-day low on the yen on Wednesday, before recovering slightly. It last bought $1.1752.
German unemployment and inflation data, European confidence surveys and advance U.S. GDP figures will also be closely watched - with the U.S. figure likely to show record growth, but still leave the economy behind where it began 2020. 
""Any disappointment in these numbers may have a magnified market impact, given the current weakness,"" said CMC Markets' Sydney-based strategist, Michael McCarthy.
Investors are also increasingly wary of a contested U.S. election result that could unleash a wave of risk-asset selling.
Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" the Cboe Volatility Index surged on Wednesday to its highest level since June and implied currency volatility indicates that a wild ride is expected.
The U.S. bond market, however, was somnolent as investors looked past polling day and figured huge government borrowing for coronavirus relief spending will happen no matter who wins.

Benchmark U.S. 10-year yields rose overnight and added about half a basis point on Thursday to 0.7877%.

554,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 01:06AM ET</span>",Next crop of COVID-19 vaccine developers take more traditional route,"By Julie Steenhuysen and Caroline Copley
CHICAGO/BERLIN (Reuters) - The handful of drugmakers dominating the global coronavirus vaccine race are pushing the boundaries of vaccine technology. The next crop under development feature more conventional, proven designs.
The world will need several different vaccines to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, given the sheer size of global need, variations in effects on different populations, and possible limits of effectiveness in the first crop.
Many leading candidates now in final-stage testing are based on new, largely unproven technology platforms designed to produce vaccines at speed. They include messenger RNA (mRNA) technology used by  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) and  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) with partner BioNTech SE (F:22UAy), and inactivated cold virus platforms used by Oxford University/AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN), Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and CanSino Biologics (HK:6185), whose vaccine has been approved for military use in China.
 Merck & Co  (N:MRK) in September started testing a COVID-19 vaccine based on a weakened measles virus that delivers genes from the new coronavirus into the body to stimulate an immune response to the coronavirus.
Of these, only the technology offered by J&J and CanSino that use cold viruses as vectors to deliver coronavirus genetic material have ever produced a licensed vaccine - for Ebola.
The next set of candidates - with late-stage trial results expected in the first half of 2021 - are heavily skewed toward approaches that have produced successful vaccines.
Conventional methods include using a killed or inactivated version of the pathogen that causes a disease to provoke an immune response, such as those used to make flu, polio and rabies vaccines. 
Also more common are protein-based vaccines that use purified pieces of the virus to spur an immune response. Vaccines against whooping cough, or pertussis, and shingles employ this approach.
French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) is developing a protein-based COVID-19 vaccine employing the same approach it uses for its Flublok seasonal flu vaccine. Sanofi expects to start the final phase of testing in early December, with approval targeted in the first half of 2021.
While  Novavax  Inc (O:NVAX) has not yet produced a licensed vaccine, it is using similar purified protein technology and expects to start a late-stage U.S. trial involving 30,000 volunteers in late November.
""Those are more traditional approaches, so we can feel more comfortable that we have a lot of experience with them,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
Offit also sees promise in some of the inactivated virus vaccines being developed by Chinese researchers, including Sinopharm's China National Biotec Group (CNBG), one of the few first-crop developers using a traditional technique.
Other second-wave developers are making vaccines based on virus-like particles (VLPs), which mimic the structure of the coronavirus but contain no genetic material from it.
VLP vaccines can be produced in a variety of different types of cells, including mammal, bacterial, insect, yeast and plant cells. This approach has been used to develop vaccines for hepatitis B and human papillomavirus.
Quebec's Medicago is testing a VLP COVID-19 vaccine grown in tobacco plants with the backing of tobacco company Philip Morris (N:PM). 
Medicago has yet to produce an approved vaccine, but has completed large-scale testing for a seasonal flu vaccine using this approach. It plans to begin mid-stage trials of its COVID-19 vaccine next month and aims to make up to 1 billion doses a year by 2023.
Others are looking at alternative delivery methods, such as the nasal spray vaccine being developed by a team at Xiamen University, Hong Kong University and Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise, which is based on a modified flu virus.
CHALLENGES AHEAD
The second crop, however, could face problems completing large studies if the current leaders bring their vaccines over the finish line in the coming months.
""If we get a super vaccine in December, from company x, which is on the market, it will be difficult to recruit participants into other studies,"" said Peter Kremsner from the University Hospital in Tuebingen, Germany.
""Then everyone will say, if the vaccine exists, I will get vaccinated now with this vaccine. This will definitely prove a problem for recruitment,” added Kremsner, who is testing CureVac's (O:CVAC) mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in early clinical trials with backing from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

On the flip side, it is easier and faster to prove efficacy when community spread of the virus is rampant as is happening again in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, a potential advantage for companies starting large-scale vaccine trials in the near future.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Thursday morning, following European and U.S. shares’ lead as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise and fresh lockdowns increased worries about the economic impact. However, Asian shares saw more modest losses compared to the overnight U.S. session.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.72% by 11:02 PM ET (3:02 AM GMT). The Bank of Japan is due to hand down its monetary policy decision, widely expected to be little changed from the one currently in place.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.09% and the Shenzhen Component edged down 0.15%. Plenty of action is due from China, with nearly 1,000 companies due to release third-quarter earnings later in the day. The Chinese Communist Party is also due to release 5-year and 15-year plans mapping the country’s economic path as it concludes its closed-door plenum later in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.38%.
South Korea’s KOSPI slid 1.77%, with the government leading a push to close clubs in Seoul over the Halloween holiday to curb the spread of the virus. In Australia, the ASX 200 tumble 1.71%.
France and Germany saw fresh lockdowns introduced by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday. Investors are looking to the European Central Bank’s lead as it announces its monetary decision later in the day.
With the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election less than a week away, the conspicuous absence of any economic relief in the short term as Congress failed to pass the latest stimulus measures, alongside the uncertainty surrounding the election, also damped investor risk appetite. The U.S. also saw an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases.
“Risk sentiment took a nosedive on Wednesday amid more concern around the spread of COVID-19 and renewed restrictions in Europe … this was seen alongside ongoing concerns about failure to agree on U.S. fiscal aid before the election next week, adding to a weak economic picture,” ANZ analysts said in a note.
Adding to the gloom was an MSCI gauge of global equities tumbling almost 5% over the past week as the number of COVID-19 cases ticked upwards. Italy, Spain and the U.K. all reported record numbers of cases on Wednesday.
“We’ve got the election hanging over our heads. Then obviously COVID-19 accelerating to the degree that it has both here in the U.S. as well as in Europe … and then you’ve got the lack of stimulus, which in our estimation is still necessary to get us through this period until we get an ultimate medical solution,”  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors deputy global chief investment officer Lori Heinel told Bloomberg.

S&P 500 futures contracts expiring in December were up 1% as of 10:41 a.m. in Tokyo. Contracts on the Nasdaq 100 rose 0.8% while those on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1%.
The S&P 500 Index fell 3.5% Wednesday, the biggest drop since June 11, amid a surge in Covid-19 hospitalizations, especially in the Midwest. European stocks also tumbled, as France imposed a new nationwide lockdown and Germany moved to implement one-month partial restrictions.
Asian stocks emerged less scathed as trading opened Thursday, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Index falling 0.6% as U.S. futures turned higher.
With news about Europe’s stricter virus measures “digested,” the market “will switch back to the election,” said Ben Emons, head of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors. “The blue wave remains priced in, which means the market will refocus on stimulus.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she hopes the current selloff in U.S. stocks will prompt President Donald Trump to agree to Democratic demands in stalled stimulus talks and end a three-month stalemate that has added to tension ahead of the Nov. 3 vote. Polls predict Trump will be defeated by Joe Biden, whose Democratic Party is also expected to win control of Congress.
Positive news from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN).’s late-stage trial of an antibody cocktail therapy for Covid-19 and possible measures from the European Central Bank should add “positive momentum” heading into the U.S. equity market open Thursday, according to Medley’s Emons.

557,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 09:10PM ET</span>",Exxon Mobil to keep dividend flat for first time since 1982,"By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) on Wednesday kept its fourth-quarter dividend flat at 87 cents a share, signaling 2020 will be the first year since 1982 that the U.S. oil producer has not raised its shareholder payout.
The largest U.S. oil producer by volume was caught off guard by the sharp decline in energy prices and demand this year. U.S. prices are off 39% since the start of the year and globally demand has tumbled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Exxon has pledged cost and jobs cuts that could be announced as early as Friday. The decision to retain the quarterly dividend could indicate it expects margin improvements from cost-cutting will allow it to continue making the hefty payout.
At $3.48 per share, the annual dividend is equal to 10.6% of its share price.
The company posted its first back-to-back quarterly losses this year and is projected to report a full-year $2 billion loss, Refinitiv estimates show, excluding asset sales or write downs. It reports third-quarter financial results on Friday.
Exxon has a ""narrow path"" to maintain the dividend without borrowing more, said Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov. Even with U.S. oil prices trading around $45 per barrel, the dividend would deplete the company's cash balance by the end of 2021, he said.
 BP  PLC (L:BP), Equinor ASA (OL:EQNR) and Royal Dutch Shell PLC (L:RDSa) earlier this year cut their shareholder payouts by at least half. 
Four years ago, Exxon stopped buying back its own shares, giving greater prominence to the dividend, which reached $14.7 billion last year. Officials said in July they were committed to maintaining the dividend.
""We have doubts about the sanctity of the dividend longer-term,"" said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones. ""There is greater potential for a dividend reduction in 2021 if demand doesn't fully recover.""

Exxon shares traded at $31.57 on Wednesday, down 3.8%, and at the lowest point in more than two decades. The dividend announcement came after market close.

The company plans to lay off 250 employees at the 160,000-barrel-a-day plant and halt fuel production as a result of low demand, according to a letter to employees seen by Bloomberg.
“The move was prompted by unanticipated, extended demand destruction for transportation fuels related to Covid-19 policies,” the letter from Chief Executive Officer Tom Nimbley said.
The nationwide decline in fuel demand that has resulted from lockdowns and less travel have already forced at least five refineries to shut or be repurposed in the past six months. Gasoline demand plunged in the late spring and summer and remains stuck about 8% below the five-year average, according to government data.
The Paulsboro plant will be taken out of service and preserved for a possible reopening in the future, according to the company’s letter. If the refinery is reopened, it will only produce partially refined feedstocks that will be sent to the company’s Delaware City refinery, the letter showed. Paulsboro would make lubricants and asphalt.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - An expected rebound in capital expenditures for U.S. companies could be more at risk, as concerns over the economic recovery and a possible contested U.S. election mount.
A resurgence in coronavirus cases both in the United States and in Europe has underscored concern about the impact on global growth which has been struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels.
Next week's U.S. presidential election could remove some of the uncertainty for expenditures, although a contested election would add to concerns, investors and strategists said.
Analysts expect capital expenditures for S&P 500 (SPX) companies to rise by 6.3% in 2021 after dropping 11.4% this year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""Is it going to rebound in 2021? Probably, though there's a lot of uncertainty out there,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
""You have the election, you have COVID and its impact on the economy around the world, and whether we're going to see additional stimulus spending in the United States.""
Election uncertainty compounded by the failure of lawmakers to approve new fiscal stimulus helped push U.S. stocks down sharply on Wednesday, with the Dow (DJI) closing at lows last seen in late July.
French and German leaders ordered their countries back into lockdown as a second wave of the virus swept Europe.
In recent commentary, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists said their forecast for a 10% rebound in S&P 500 capex, excluding energy, in 2021 assumes a ""sharp recovery in economic and sales growth,"" but also assumes ""that policy uncertainty declines from its currently elevated levels"" as questions around a vaccine for the virus and the election are resolved.
Investors are focusing on the possibility of prolonged economic weakness, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.
""That will hold back capital investments and things of that nature. It could be very negative going forward.""
One silver lining for capital spending has been technology as companies in the industry grow and others invest in better equipment and software.
The only S&P 500 sectors forecast to see increases in capex spending in 2020 are information technology (SPLRCT) and communication services (SPLRCL), Refinitiv's data shows.
Technology capex is expected to increase by 4.9% over 2019 while communication services is slated to grow by 1.3%.
""Technology is the beneficiary increasingly of capex,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
That ""has been going on for many years, but it has increased as the digital world has expanded and you add an acceptance that remote working may last longer than initially planned.""
Research and development spending by healthcare companies also is likely to increase as they continue to research and test treatments for the coronavirus. 
But for other sectors such as industrials and energy, the forecast looks more grim. Capital spending by the industrials sector (SPLRCI) is estimated to drop 20.8% this year, while materials (SPLRCM) spending is expected to fall by 27% and energy (SPNY) by 35%.
""The combination of falling oil prices and the pandemic recession have led to a collapse in energy profitability,"" Goldman strategists wrote.
Many companies are still reluctant to post guidance, a sign that they may be hesitant to decide on more capital spending.
On Wednesday,  United Parcel  Service's (N:UPS) shares fell sharply despite its stronger-than-expected results, and the company said it was not providing revenue and earnings guidance due to uncertainty about the economy.

""That has to affect the company's plans as far as capital spending well into next year,"" Tuz said.

Investors will be paid 87 cents a share for the current quarter, matching the level of the last six periods, the Irving, Texas-based company said in a statement. The oil giant trails only  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and AT&T Inc. among S&P 500 companies in payouts to shareholders over the past 12 months, according to Bloomberg data.
The plunge in crude prices and demand for petroleum products caused by the pandemic sent shock waves through the world’s energy markets this year and came at a bad time for Exxon, which was in the middle of a costly upgrade of its oil and gas assets. Exxon is now consistently funding the payout with borrowed money for the first time in decades.
Executives pledged a “great commitment” to the dividend in July, and vowed to row back growth plans, capital spending and cut jobs to defend it. But investors aren’t yet convinced. The stock’s dividend yield has risen to more than 10% for most of the past five weeks.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - IKEA's shopping malls business, one of the world's biggest, said its expansion plans remained on track with visitors quickly returning to its premises after the lifting of coronavirus-related lockdowns which had forced stores to close. 
Ingka Centres, which has 45 malls anchored by IKEA stores across Europe, Russia and China and plans to enter the United States in 2021, said footfall in the 12 months through August had fallen by almost a quarter and tenant sales had dropped 16% to 5.4 billion euros ($6.4 billion). 
""Our results this year represent a robust performance under the circumstances we have witnessed,"" Managing Director Gerard Groener told Reuters. ""The pandemic is not over yet, and we are likely to face more near-term challenges. But we believe we are well placed to handle these.""
Malls closed fully or partially for a few weeks in 13 of 15 markets early in the pandemic. 
The company said in an emailed statement that occupancy was stable at 95% in the fiscal year, and Groener said work to nearly double the number of malls in the coming years was on track. 
Alongside IKEA, Ingka Centres is shifting focus from out-of-town to smaller inner-city locations as it adapts to digitalisation and changing consumer behaviours. It is hunting for property in some 40 major cities, and in 2020 inked its first acquisitions, in London and San Francisco.
""Whatever the so-called 'new normal' looks like, retail and leisure is adaptable and human society is geared to socialise,"" Groener said. 
He said after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted in the spring, visitors quickly returned to the company's malls, which it refers to as meeting places. 
Malls had a roughly unchanged total leasable area of 4 million square metres in the year, with 7,000 stores.
""The vast majority of our tenants are committed to our meeting places,"" Groener said. 
However, the move towards smaller urban malls, and a shift toward uses other than retail - ranging from playgrounds to community event spaces - will mean fewer stores, he noted. 
Many retail chains are looking to reduce their overall net store count as their customers increasingly shop online. 
Ingka Centres however said Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), H&M and Inditex-owned Zara were among brands adding stores in its malls during the year. In all, around 500 stores opened.
Ingka Centres is owned by Ingka Group which also owns most IKEA stores. The malls operate under brands such as MEGA in biggest market Russia, and LIVAT in China.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" is on track for its biggest weekly jump since March as investors worried about rising U.S. and European coronavirus cases, the lack of fiscal stimulus and uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election outcome.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) surged on Wednesday to its highest level since June, ending at 40.28. At the same time, the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) stock index fell 3.5%. 
The VIX had climbed on Monday amid concerns about a tightening U.S. presidential race. With Wednesday's jump, the index has surged nearly 13 points this week.
Along with the pandemic, concerns about stalled efforts in Washington toward further fiscal stimulus measures and the outcome of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election have helped maintain high volatility in U.S. stocks. The VIX is now pricing in daily moves of more than 2%.
""Markets are confronting a perfect storm,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Some investors have been preparing for bigger market gyrations for weeks. Assets under management in exchange-traded products that investors use to guard against a drop in U.S. stocks have steadily grown since mid-September. 
Over the last month, the combined assets of the ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (O:UVXY) and the  Barclays  (LON:BARC) iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (P:VXX) have grown to $2.85 billion, a 20% gain, according to data from YCharts.
VIX futures, which have long reflected expectations for higher volatility toward year-end, have also risen. November futures, which capture the weeks following the election, were trading above 35 on Wednesday.
Even so, the VIX itself is trading at a higher level than the futures, an indication that immediate concerns about the coronavirus have dwarfed worries further out on the calendar.
Some investors, in fact, are readying for a somewhat calmer market at year-end and in early 2021. Since the beginning of the month, trading volume in VIX puts - options used to position for declines in the index - has outpaced that for VIX calls, used to protect against outsized market moves.

""Surprises are the thing that really get volatility going,"" said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. ""This next wave of coronavirus seems to have caught the market off guard a bit.""

(Reuters) -  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD) on Wednesday cut its 2020 revenue forecast, citing lower-than-expected demand and difficulty in predicting sales of remdesivir, the only treatment approved in the United States for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
Remdesivir brought in $873 million in the quarter, below analysts' estimates of $960 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Gilead Chief Commercial Officer Johanna Mercier said that although the United States saw a surge in COVID-19 cases over the summer, many were younger people and hospitalization rates actually dropped. ""Our assumption is in light of the surge this fall both in Europe and the U.S., those numbers will pop back up,"" she said.
Gilead lowered the top end of its full-year sales outlook to $23.5 billion, which is below Wall Street estimates of $24.1 billion. The company had previously forecast 2020 sales as high as $25 billion.
""The revision in guidance is tied, not entirely, but almost entirely to expectations around Veklury,"" Gilead Chief Financial Officer Andrew Dickinson said, using the brand name for remdesivir. ""There was less demand in the third quarter than expected.""
Remdesivir is authorized or approved for use in more than 50 other countries around the world. It was one of the treatments given to U.S. President Donald Trump during his recent bout with COVID-19. 
Gilead said some sales recorded in the third quarter are being held in inventory for use in the fourth quarter, and the volume of remdesivir purchased for government stockpiling purposes fell short of what the company had projected.
Remdesivir has become the standard of care for patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, but many U.S. doctors remain wary of using it in patients with less severe illness.
""There is still uncertainty about the pandemic and still lingering questions about the visibility of remdesivir with antibodies coming,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee said, referring to experimental antibody drugs designed to treat COVID-19.
Gilead shares, which closed down 2%, fell another 1.5% in extended trading.
Third-quarter revenue of $6.6 billion beat the average analysts' estimate of $6.31 billion. The company posted adjusted earnings per share of $2.11, topping Wall Street expectations by 21 cents.
Sales of the company's flagship HIV drugs rose 8% from a year earlier to $4.55 billion, as patient demand normalized following disruption related to the pandemic.
Remdesivir was granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May after it was shown to shorten hospital stays for COVID-19 patients in a government-run clinical trial.
Commercial sales began in July and the FDA formally approved the drug this month, despite recent results from a World Health Organization-sponsored trial showing remdesivir did not improve patient outcomes.

(Reuters) - Image-sharing company  Pinterest Inc  (N:PINS) projected a 60% sales growth for the current quarter, off the back of a healthy rebound in ad spending by businesses after the early months of COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc in the industry.
The forecast, which the company termed an 'informal' one, compares to a 35% growth modeled by Wall Street analysts, according to Refinitiv data.
Shares of the company, which also beat third-quarter sales estimates, jumped 28% to $63.05 in extended trading.
Pinterest said it benefited as advertisers redirected spending to its platform following a social media ad boycott campaign that began in July.
A long list of companies have pulled advertising from  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), in support of a campaign that called out the social media giant for not doing enough to stop hate speech on its platforms. Some companies have returned since.
""Advertisers tell us that Pinterest is brand safe relative to other consumer internet platforms,"" Chief Financial Officer Todd Morgenfeld said. 
That boost may wane after the U.S. election cycle is over in November, Morgenfeld cautioned.
Pinterest also noted it gained four million monthly active users (MAUs) in late September as younger users turned to the platform to get design ideas for customized wallpapers for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s new iOS version for iPhones.
""We expect these 4 million MAUs are more likely to churn in Q4,"" Morgenfeld said.
Monthly active users jumped 37% to 442 million during the third quarter.
Revenue in the United States, the company's largest market, jumped 49% to $374 million. It reported average revenue of $1.03 per user, above FactSet estimates of 90 cents.

Pinterest's total revenue jumped 58% to $443 million, well ahead of analysts' estimates of $383.5 million.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co on Wednesday posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on strong U.S. demand for pickups and SUVs, and forecast a full-year pretax profit instead of a loss, boosting shares in after-hours trading.
Ford CEO Jim Farley, who took over on Oct. 1, is tasked with completing the No. 2 U.S. automaker's $11 billion restructuring begun under his predecessor, Jim Hackett, and has promised greater urgency.
He has also said he is keen to expand Ford's operations into related technology fields, including software, data, fleet management and electric vehicle charging.
Ford reported net income in the third quarter of $2.4 billion, or 60 cents a share, compared with $400 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, Ford's profit was $3.6 billion, or 65 cents a share, topping the 19 cents analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected.
The company said it now anticipates better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, as well as a full-year pretax profit of between $600 million and $1.1 billion.
Ford said in July that it expected a pretax profit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion in the third quarter and a loss for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year. 
In a conference call on Wednesday, Farley said: ""We haven't fixed the issues that have held us back in our automotive business."" But he added that his leadership team has ""a clear turnaround plan.""
The automaker fully repaid $15 billion in revolving credit loans and ended the quarter with nearly $30 billion in cash and more than $45 billion of liquidity.
The company's adjusted EBIT margin in the quarter was 9.7%, with a full-year target of 8%. Ford's net margin in the period was 6.4%.
Ford began building the redesigned F-150 and the new Mustang Mach-E and Bronco Sport this month. The new full-size truck goes on sale next month, and along with the commercial business is key to Ford's growth strategy. 
Farley said electric vehicles, including battery-powered variants of the F-150 pickup and Transit van, were ""fundamental"" to the company's future, including the Lincoln line and Ford's commercial vehicle business.
Ford shares were up 3.8% at $8.00 in extended trading, paring gains from an initial rise of 7% after hours.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Dan Levy in an earnings note said, ""We expect the stock to outperform near-term; indeed, we believe Jim Farley will drive incremental urgency and accountability at Ford.""

""We saw much higher demand than we expected,"" Chief Financial Officer John Lawler told reporters on the conference call. ""We also saw higher net pricing, particularly in North America.""

(Reuters) - U.S. swimming pool supplies retailer Leslie's Inc (O:LESL) on Wednesday priced its initial public offering (IPO) at $17 a share, above its target range, to sell $680 million in stock, according to people familiar with the matter.
Leslie's, which is backed by private equity firm L Catterton and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, aimed to sell 40 million shares between $14 and $16 apiece. 
The IPO values Phoenix, Arizona-based Leslie's at $3.17 billion.
The sources requested anonymity as the pricing was not yet public. A representative for Leslie's declined to comment. 
The IPO comes amid a surge in demand for backyard pools as consumers living under lockdown look for more at-home leisure activities.
Rival  Pool Corp  (O:POOL) earlier this month reported record net sales for the third quarter and has seen its share price surge around 70% so far this year, far outpacing the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index (SPX).
L Catterton led a buyout group for Phoenix, Arizona-based Leslie's in 2017. Leslie's has over 900 store locations and its products include above-ground pools, saunas and pool chemicals.
Leslie's shares are due to begin trading on Nasdaq on Thursday under the symbol ""LESL.""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and BofA Securities are the lead underwriters for Leslie's IPO.

(Reuters) - Financial stocks have lagged the broader equity market since the start of the year and since the late March crisis-low. But not all stocks are created equal in the S&P index that tracks the industry, which is down 23% year-to-date. 
In fact, so far in 2020, the lead performers of the S&P 500 Financial sector (SPSY) have even outperformed the high-flying Nasdaq (IXIC), which is up almost 23% year-to-date. The S&P 500 is up 1%, and the Dow is down 7% for the year so far.
The sector's wide performance disparity stems partly from low interest rates exposure versus trading exposure in a market that has risen sharply since March. 
Stocks that have performed well include exchanges, index companies or banks with trading desks or M&A advisory businesses and some insurance companies, said Aaron Dunn, co-director of value equities and portfolio manager at  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV). 
""The ones relying on the yield curve and the short rates to make money have been more challenged,"" Dunn said, referring to banks that are mostly dependent on a steep yield curve to boost profits from their loan business. 
While many stocks in the sector are relatively cheap, some investors are wary of economic uncertainty because of the coronavirus pandemic and the Federal Reserve's suggestion it will keep rates low for a long time. 
""If you expect the economy to grow and interest rates to start to rise, then banks are very compelling,"" said Fred Cannon, head of research at Keefe Bruyette & Woods. ""If the economy continues to grow and the Fed is successful at keeping rates very low you probably would be better off in exchanges and the banks that don't earn all their income from spread lending.""
The leader of the financials pack is trading platform Marketaxess (O:MKTX) up 46% year-to-date, followed by MSCI (K:MSCI), up 32%, and then insurer Progressive (N:PGR), up 26%. 
In all, eight stocks in the index, which has more than 60 stocks, have shown double-digit percentage gains so far in 2020. Other outperformers include investment managers Blackrock Inc (N:BLK) and T Rowe Price (O:TROW) and stock exchanges, Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) and Intercontinental Exchange (N:ICE). Like MSCI, stock index company S&P Global Inc (N:SPGI) has also been in favor. 
On the other end of the spectrum,  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) was leading losses down 60%, followed by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s more than 48% year-to-date decline and Lincoln Nationals (N:LNC) roughly 44% drop.
In all, 47 of the index's stocks have shown declines in the double-digit percentage range.
Compared to the broader financial sector the bank subsector <.SPXBK> has fallen 37% so far this year while the insurance subsector <.SPXIN> has dropped 18%. 

While the financial index has risen almost 34% since the market's March 23 low, this gain compares with a 46% jump from the S&P 500, and an almost 43% gain for the Dow and a roughly 60% gain for Nasdaq.

(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) unveiled a fourth straight quarterly loss and deeper job cuts on Wednesday as the coronavirus pandemic and the lengthy grounding of its 737 MAX continued to hammer revenue.
The U.S. planemaker also said it was sticking with reduced production rates announced in July, and signaled it was ready to cut 787 production again if needed with 50 undelivered jets sitting outside its plants.
Shares in Boeing fell 4.6%, lagging weaker U.S. markets.
The COVID-19 pandemic has sharply reduced air travel, pushing some airlines to bankruptcy or forcing them to seek government aid and delay taking jets.
As a result, Boeing has slashed production and shed thousands of jobs while also working to emerge from a 19-month-old worldwide 737 MAX ban triggered by two crashes.
Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told employees Boeing now expects to eliminate some 30,000 jobs to reach a workforce around 130,000 by end-2021. That is 11,000 more than previously discussed, with 7,000 extra posts disappearing through increased voluntary or involuntary layoffs and the rest through attrition.
Calhoun predicted airline traffic would end the year at around 30% to 35% of 2019 levels, with a return to pre-pandemic levels in about three years.
He also raised the prospect that stricter certification rules following the 737 MAX grounding would further delay its new 400-seat 777X.
""As with any development program ... there are inherent risks that can affect schedule,"" Calhoun told analysts. 
""While we continue to drive towards entry into service in 2022, this timing will ultimately be influenced by certification requirements defined by the regulators."" 
Boeing said it still expects to win 737 MAX approval in time to resume deliveries in the fourth quarter. 
It reaffirmed plans to hit a build rate of 31 MAX jets a month in early 2022. Airbus is asking suppliers to be ready for potential production of 47 similar A320 jets a month by 2021.
Before it can produce more, Boeing must clear a significant slice of the 450 MAX jets it has built during the grounding.
Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said he expects about half of that stockpile will be delivered by the end of next year, with the majority of remaining jets handed over in 2022. 
AIRBUS RIVALRY
Calhoun acknowledged that ""without a doubt we lost some share"" of the crucial single-aisle market where the MAX sits to European rival Airbus (PA:AIR). 
He pledged to defend the Boeing's position against Airbus and insisted it was ""not out of the (jet) development business"" - though the company also stressed that repaying debts accumulated in recent months would be its priority.
""I am not sitting around sucking my thumb that we are disadvantaged with respect to our product offering,"" Calhoun told analysts.
Reuters reported in April that Boeing had been studying a possible 757 replacement to counter the popular Airbus A321neo, though plans for this and a potential revamped 767 cargo jet had been placed on a back-burner during the crisis.
Fresh reports of such a study pushed up Boeing shares earlier this week. Senior industry sources said Boeing would not launch a new model any time soon, however.
Free cash outflow rose to $5.08 billion in the quarter, from $2.89 billion a year earlier, while total debt jumped to $61 billion, from $19.2 billion.
Excluding items including a new charge on its troubled U.S. Air Force tanker program, Boeing lost $1.39 per share, less than forecasts of a $2.52 loss, according to Refinitiv data.

Revenue fell 29% to $14.14 billion but topped analysts' estimates of $13.90 billion.

EBay said it expects fourth-quarter revenue in the range of $2.64 billion to $2.71 billion, while analysts estimate $2.54 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
E-commerce firms and retailers with a strong online presence have witnessed a spike in demand as the COVID-19 pandemic has led more people to shop online. 
The company raised its full-year sales outlook to between $10.04 billion and $10.11 billion. The forecast excludes the classifieds business, which eBay in July agreed to sell to Norway's Adevinta (OL:ADEV) in a $9.2 billion deal. 
EBay, which has made its platform simpler to use through grouped listings and personal recommendations, said active buyers grew 5% to 183 million in the third quarter.
Net income from continuing operations rose to $621 million, or 88 cents per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $210 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding items, eBay earned 85 cents per share, above estimates of 77 cents per share.
Revenue rose about 25% to $2.61 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $2.48 billion. However, the company missed its prior revenue forecast of $2.64 billion to $2.71 billion.

Investing.com -  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) reported on Wednesday first quarter earnings  that beat analysts' forecasts and revenue that topped expectations.
Western Digital shares gained 3% in after-hours trade following the report.
Western Digital announced earnings per share of $0.65 on revenue of $3.92B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.55 on revenue of $3.84B.
The beat was led by strong performance in its client devices business, easing the blow from weaker performance in data center and client solutions business, which the company pinned on weakness in the global economy.
Client Devices increased 20% year-on-year to $1.95 billion in the quarter, while data center devices and solutions dropped 26% to $1.1 billion, and client solutions slipped 5% to $847 million.
""The decrease is largely attributable to the uncertainty associated with the global economic contraction and geopolitical headwinds, which resulted in shifts in customer buying patterns impacting data center devices & solutions and client solutions,"" the company said.
Western Digital shares are down 38% from the beginning of the year, still down 46.06% from its 52 week high of $72.00 set on January 23. They are under-performing the S&P 500 which is up 1.24% from the start of the year.
Looking ahead to the fiscal first quarter, the company guided revenue of $3.75-to-3.95 billion and earnings of $0.40-to-$0.60 a share, compared with estimates for $3.86 billion and $0.55 a share respectively.

(Reuters) -  Visa Inc  (N:V) missed Wall Street estimates for fourth quarter profit on Wednesday, as high unemployment due to the coronavirus-induced recession continued to weigh on consumer spending.
The payments processor said total spending decreased 10% on a constant dollar basis, and the number of processed transactions tumbled 13% from a year earlier.
Cross-border volume slid 47% as the continuing global pandemic continued to hurt travel demand.
Earlier on Wednesday, Mastercard Inc (N:MA) missed profit expectations and warned that travel-related spending will likely be a major headwind for the industry until COVID-19 vaccines are widely available. 
Visa's net income fell to $2.4 billion, or $1.07 per Class A share, for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, from $3.03 billion, or $1.34 per Class A share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis the company reported earnings of $1.06 per share. 
Net revenue fell 17% to $4.8 billion as consumer spending was limited due to the health crisis, which has triggered the worst economic downturn in decades and prompted massive layoffs. 
This is only the second time the company's quarterly revenue declined year-over-year since it went public in 2008.

Analysts polled by Refinitiv had been expecting an 18.5% slide in revenue and earnings of $1.09 per share.

Gilead rose 2% in after-hours trading.
The company cut its 2020 EPS to $6.25 to $6.60 from prior guidance of $6.25 to $7.65, and sales were expected to be between $23 billion to $23.5 billion, compared with a prior estimate of $23 billion to $25 billion.

(Reuters) -  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN) on Wednesday said its third-quarter adjusted profit rose 17% due to stronger sales of drugs including the osteoporosis treatment Prolia and recently-acquired psoriasis medication Otezla.
The higher-than-expected results were partially offset by lower drug prices and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The biotechnology company said that more patients had resumed interacting with their doctors in the third quarter than earlier in the health crisis, but prescribing volumes remained ""modestly below"" pre-pandemic levels.
The company raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to $15.80 to $16.15 per share, from a previous range of $15.10 to $15.75, and narrowed its revenue estimate. It now expects revenue of $25.1 billion to $25.5 billion versus it prior forecast of $25.0 billion to $25.6 billion.
Amgen also lowered its expected 2020 tax rate to 13% to 14% from 13.5% to 14.5%.
The company reported a third-quarter adjusted profit $4.37 per share, beating the average estimate of $3.81 per share, as compiled by Refinitiv.
Revenue for the quarter rose 12% to $6.4 billion, in line with analyst estimates of $6.38 billion.
Sales of Prolia rose 11% to $701 million, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $688 million.
Psoriasis drug Otezla, acquired from  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG) in November, had sales of $538 million for the quarter, falling short of analyst expectations of $587 million.
Sales of Amgen's older arthritis drug Enbrel fell 3% year-over-year to $1.3 billion as the drug continued to lose market share in the quarter. That still topped analysts' expectations of $1.26 billion.
Amgen's posted a net income of $2.02 billion, or $3.43 per share, compared with a profit of $1.97 billion, or $3.27 a share, a year ago.

(Reuters) - SoftBank Group (T:9984) CEO Masayoshi Son told the executive he tasked to turn around WeWork after its botched initial public offering to ""use whatever excuse"" to delay a $3 billion payout to the office-sharing startup's shareholders, a court transcript released on Wednesday showed. 
The transcript, part of a Delaware court filing, provides new details on the decision by SoftBank to scrap a $3 billion tender offer to repurchase stock from existing shareholders, including founder Adam Neumann and employees. 
A WeWork board committee that negotiated the tender offer sued SoftBank in April over that decision, accusing the Japanese company of ""buyer's remorse"" amid the coronavirus outbreak.
The transcript includes an undated text exchange between Son and Marcelo Claure, who he installed as WeWork's executive chairman last October.
Claure told Son that SoftBank Group Tokyo had ""made a late request"" to delay the tender offer payment until April 1, 2020 from Feb. 28, 2020.
Son replied: ""It's great to postpone the close of tender.... Use whatever excuse to make senses (sic).""
Claure responded: ""Ok. Will use antitrust. I am turning good at excuses like someone I know very well :)"" 
The court filing was made by Neumann and We Holdings LLC in an effort to compel SoftBank to produce documents they claim had been improperly withheld.
A SoftBank spokeswoman said in an email: ""Cherry-picking quotes from documents doesn't change the facts: under the terms of our agreement SoftBank had no obligation to complete the tender offer in which Mr. Neumann–the biggest beneficiary- sought to sell nearly $1 billion in stock.""
WeWork did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
SoftBank said earlier this year it would not complete the tender offer because several conditions had not been met.
Among the reasons it cited were U.S. criminal and civil investigations into WeWork, the failure to restructure a joint venture in China, and the pandemic.
SoftBank's decision frustrated WeWork shareholders expecting a payout. Neumann, who was replaced as WeWork CEO last year, was to have sold the bulk of the shares.
The tender offer was part of a nearly $10 billion rescue package for WeWork negotiated last October and which gave SoftBank control of the company. 

Since then, the pandemic has hurt WeWork's occupancy rates, as corporate clients in big cities escape shared workspaces and ask employees to work from home.

Investing.com – The Dow suffered its biggest one-day decline since July on Wednesday, as fears of renewed lockdown measures intensify. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.43%, or 940 points, its biggest one-day loss since July 31. The S&P 500 was down 3.52%, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 3.73%.
France and Germany announced new lockdown measures starting Friday and Monday, respectively, with bars and restaurants set to shut while schools will remain open, as both countries strive to curb a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections.
In the U.S., meanwhile, there are signs some areas are considering rolling back the easing of lockdown measures after Chicago prohibited indoor dining.
Global infections have topped 44 million, with more than 350,000 cases reported a day earlier.
The selling in the broader market was led by technology as stalwarts come under the spotlight on Capitol Hill ahead of key earnings reports from Amazon, Facebook, and Google.
The chief executives of Facebook, Twitter and Google are making their case to lawmakers to uphold section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that protects platforms against legal liability for content generated by its users.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) were deep in the red, closing 5% lower despite firmer quarterly results.
Wall Street, however, continued to give Microsoft their vote of confidence as its cloud business continued to grow.
""Overall, we believe Microsoft’s results (especially post SAP’s guide down) will assuage some investor concerns around the IT spending backdrop,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said after raising its price target on the stock to $235 from $225.
With the impact of the pandemic gathering pace, cyclical stocks – those linked to the economy - also played a meaningful role in the selloff, with consumer discretionary and energy among the biggest decliners.
Energy fell 4%, led by a sharp decline in oil prices as data showing a larger-than-expected weekly build in U.S. inventories exacerbated concerns about the demand outlook.
Industrials continued to bleed, led by fall in airlines, with United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) falling more than 4% despite the latter reporting a smaller than expected loss of $1.39 per share for the third quarter.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) sidestepped the selling, up 7% after reporting a surprise third-quarter profit.
Elsewhere on the earnings front,  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) fell 9% as a lack of guidance and higher costs overshadowed third-quarter results that topped analysts' estimates.
The sharp sell-off in the broader market was captured by a surge in the CBOE Volatility Index, or so-called fear index, to a more than four-month high. "

Investing.com -- Mounting fears that a surge in new coronavirus cases would derail the economic recovery weighed heavily on stocks on Wednesday, causing a more than 940-point rout in the Dow.
New infections in the U.S. have reached all-time highs this week as public health officials struggle to ring-fence the virus. Hot spots have spread across the country and hospitalizations are rising. Many fear new lockdowns, which would follow new restrictions imposed in Europe in a fresh wave of the pandemic there.
Selling was broad-based, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite each down more than 3%. 
The mood was darkened by the reality that stimulus was not forthcoming, at least not until after next week’s election. Without a new round of money injected into the economy to support spending, the economic recovery could be in peril, according to recent speeches by officials from the Federal Reserve.
The heavy selling pressure comes during a big week for corporate earnings reports. More are on tap for Thursday, especially big oil companies and four of the Fab 5 tech companies.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow:
1. Profits from the oil majors
Oil prices have plunged this week on worries that demand is not coming back, or is returning unevenly as the pandemic refuses to disappear. On Wednesday the government released data that showed inventories rose more than expected, to 4.3 million barrels last week. 
Oil majors are reporting earnings and analysts will be listening closely to what they say about the remainder of the year and their prospects for next year. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is expected to report a loss of 31 cents a share on revenue of $5.2 billion, while Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC ADR (NYSE:RDSa) is expected to eke out earnings per share of 4 cents on revenue of more than $46 billion.
2. Big tech storms Wall Street after hours
Most of the so-called FANG gang is reporting earnings at practically the same time after Thursday’s closing bell. 
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is expected to report earnings of $11.30 a share on revenue of $42.7 billion, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is expected to report EPS of $7.37 on revenue of $92.6 billion, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to report EPS of 71 cents a share on revenue of just under $64 billion, and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) is seen reporting $1.89 a share on revenue of $19.7 billion.
The estimates are based on analysts tracked by Investing.com.
3. Starbucks reveals how pandemic has altered coffee-drinking habits
Has the pandemic significantly altered coffee-drinking habits, or have people maintained their caffeine fixes despite inconveniences like not being able to camp out for hours with their laptops without ordering refills?
This is the question for Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), which is seen reporting earnings of 31 cents a share on revenue of $6 billion. The Seattle-based coffee selling giant was forced to make changes to its stores to encourage drive-up service and mobile ordering. Analysts will be listening to hear what the company says about foot traffic.

Deutsche Boerse said it was sticking to its target for adjusted net profit of 1.2 billion euros in 2020.
Over the summer, Deutsche Boerse bid to take over the Italian stock exchange but lost to Euronext.
It will brief investors about its new strategy on Nov. 18.

(Reuters) - JetBlue Airways (O:JBLU) will continue limiting the number of seats it sells on each flight into early next year, Chief Executive Robin Hayes told Reuters on Wednesday, citing the role the policy plays in customer confidence.
The decision sets it apart from low-cost peer Southwest Airlines (N:LUV), which last week said it would stop blocking middle seats on Dec. 1, referencing recent medical research showing that the risk of contracting the coronavirus on airplanes is very low.
""Our view is that over the course of time the seat caps will go, but right now it’s a very important issue for customer perception,"" Hayes said in an interview.
Hayes warned, however, that the policy is ""incredibly expensive, especially in an industry that's struggling.""
JetBlue posted on Tuesday a $393 million net loss in the third quarter as a slump in travel demand due to the pandemic hit revenues. Like other airlines it is burning millions of dollars of cash every day.
Hayes said he expects JetBlue's business to be ""largely recovered"" by the end of next year given the low-cost carrier's focus on domestic leisure travel, which is expected to recover before corporate and international travel.
Business travel accounts for less than 20% of JetBlue's flying, he said.
JetBlue, which is currently capping its seating capacity on flights at 70%, will review the policy in the first quarter of 2021, Hayes said.

Among other airlines, Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and Alaska Airlines (N:ALK) will continue restricting seating capacity on their planes through at least Jan. 6. Hawaiian Airlines (O:HA) is also blocking seats, while American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) are not.

Investing.com – The Dow nursed heavy losses Wednesday on growing worries about the recovery of the global economy as Covid-19 cases continued to spike, with parts of Europe set to resume lockdown measures.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.01%, or 825 points. The S&P 500 was down 2.98%, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 2.94%.
France is expected to impose a lockdown to stem a surge in infection in recent weeks, according to Reuters. Germany, the engine of the euro-area economy, said it would begin a one-month partial lockdown starting Monday.
In the U.S., meanwhile, there are signs some areas are considering rolling back the easing of lockdown measures after Chicago prohibited indoor dining.
Global infections have topped 44 million, with more than 350,000 cases reported a day earlier.
The selling in the broader market was led by technology as stalwarts come under the spotlight on Capitol Hill ahead of key earnings reports from Amazon, Facebook, and Google.
The chief executives of Facebook, Twitter and Google are making their case to lawmakers to uphold section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that protects platforms against legal liability for content generated by its users.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) were deep in the red, with latter down 4% despite firmer quarterly results.
Wall Street, however, continued to give Microsoft their vote of confidence as its cloud business continued to grow.
""Overall, we believe Microsoft’s results (especially post SAP’s guide down) will assuage some investor concerns around the IT spending backdrop,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said after raising its price target on the stock to $235 from $225.
With the impact of the pandemic gathering pace, cyclical stocks – those linked to the economy - also played a meaningful role in the selloff, with consumer discretionary and energy among the biggest decliners.
Energy fell nearly 3%, led by a sharp decline in oil prices as data showing a larger-than-expected weekly build in U.S. inventories exacerbated concerns about the demand outlook.
Industrials continued to bleed, led by fall in airlines, with United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) falling more than 3% despite the latter reporting a smaller than expected loss of $1.39 per share for the third quarter.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) sidestepped the selling, up 7% after reporting a surprise third-quarter profit.
Elsewhere on the earnings front,  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) fell 8% as a lack of guidance and higher costs overshadowed third-quarter results that topped analysts' estimates."
591,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 02:20PM ET</span>","LVMH, Tiffany agree on lower price in $16 billion takeover deal, sources say","By Greg Roumeliotis and Sarah White
NEW YORK/PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co has agreed with LVMH to slightly lower the price of its acquisition by the French luxury goods group, in a move set to end a legal dispute between the two, sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The sources told Reuters the two sides had agreed to lower the price of the $16 billion takeover to $131.5 per share from $135 per share, and that an announcement that the deal is therefore back on track could come on Thursday.
Representatives for LVMH and Tiffany declined to comment. 
The new terms would mean a discount of $425 million for LVMH, led by billionaire businessman Bernard Arnault, or less than 3% of the initial deal price. 
One of the sources said the new deal was likely to close in January, assuming it gains approval from Tiffany shareholders. Another source said that under the new agreement there would be no restrictions on Tiffany's ability to pay dividends until the deal closes. 
The initial deal ran into trouble last month when the French group said it could no longer complete the transaction by a Nov. 24 deadline.
It cited a French political intervention asking it to delay completing the acquisition until Jan. 6 due to a threat of new U.S. tariffs on French products, and also what it described as the jeweller's ""dismal"" performance during the coronavirus crisis.
The two companies have been facing off in a Delaware court, with Tiffany seeking to force LVMH to honour the original deal. The case is scheduled to be heard in early January.
SMALL DISCOUNT
The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the two parties were nearing an agreement to lower the takeover price to $131.5 per share, following weeks of acrimonious exchanges.
One of the sources told Reuters that Tiffany had recently approached LVMH with a more conciliatory tone. 
This source said the worsening pandemic in Europe and the United States also played a role in bringing the two sides back to the negotiating table as business risks increase, and that discussions over Tiffany's management under LVMH had been left for a later date. 
Some analysts said they were baffled by the fact that LVMH appeared to have gone to great lengths to achieve what seemed a small discount to the original deal, although one source said LVMH would save on potentially costly legal fees by ending the dispute now. 
""If confirmed, the magnitude of the price tweak would be odd. It is unclear to us why LVMH and its legal team would pursue the course of action they have done since early September to secure a minimal discount to the terms originally agreed,"" said Flavio Cereda at brokerage Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
Cereda added however that the business rationale behind the deal remained solid and that Tiffany was ""the perfect fit"" for Louis Vuitton owner LVMH. 
LVMH agreed to buy Tiffany last year in its biggest acquisition yet, betting it could restore the U.S. jeweller's lustre by investing in stores and new collections. 
The deal was designed to boost LVMH's smallest business, the jewellery and watch division that is already home to Bulgari and Tag Heuer, and help it expand in one of the fastest-growing industry segments while also strengthening its U.S. presence.

New York-based Tiffany, immortalised in the 1961 movie Breakfast at Tiffany's starring Audrey Hepburn and known for its signature pale blue boxes, retains a resonance as the go-to purveyor of engagement rings that only a handful of rivals can match.

(Reuters) - Shares of  Root Inc  (O:ROOT) fell nearly 4% in their market debut on Wednesday, marking a weak open for the automobile insurance startup after it raised about $724 million in its initial public offering.
The stock opened at $26, giving Root a valuation around $6.5 billion, compared to its IPO price of $27 per share. The company's shares were trading in line with the IPO price in afternoon trading.
Root's market debut comes against the backdrop of the S&P 500 and the Dow hitting their lowest levels since late-September on Wednesday, as coronavirus cases surged globally and fears of a contested U.S. presidential election added to worries.
The startup, which provides insurance to customers through mobile apps, is among several firms vying for a share in the online financial products market that has seen a boost due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""There will be some short-term noise from COVID - with less driving - but I think that will normalize,"" Alexander Timm, chief executive officer and co-founder of Root, said in an interview with Reuters.
Online insurance broker GoHealth (O:GOCO) and policy comparison website SelectQuote Inc (N:SLQT) had both marked strong market debuts earlier in the year.
Technology stocks have also seen increased interest in recent times, given the sector's resilience through the pandemic. For instance, the technology-heavy Nasdaq index (IXIC) has gained about 26% this year, outperforming its Wall Street peers on strength in major technology stocks.
U.S. automobile sales are also expected to pick up in October after a coronavirus-induced lull, thanks to pent-up demand and tighter inventories, two industry consultants said.
""You're going to see pretty large market-share shifts (in the automotive insurance industry), that are driven by competitors that have modern technology,"" Timm added.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities are the lead underwriters for Root's offering.

593,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>","Zeta Threatens to Hit New Orleans With Powerful Wind, Floods","(Bloomberg) -- Hurricane Zeta is strengthening as it whirls across the Gulf of Mexico, threatening to slam the Louisiana coast south of New Orleans tonight with 90-mile-per-hour winds, massive power outages and floods.
It’s expected to come ashore about 7 p.m. local time as a Category 1 storm, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in its latest forecast. Zeta, expected to cause as much as $3 billion in damages, will be the record fifth hurricane or tropical storm to hit Louisiana this year.
Earlier forecasts called for Zeta to make landfall as a Category 2 storm, with winds of 100 miles (161 kilometers) per hour. Even as a Category 1, it will still pack plenty of punch with “strong, damaging wind gusts, which could cause tree damage and power outages,” Richard Pasch, a meteorologists at the hurricane center wrote in his outlook.
Zeta, poised to become the record 11th named storm to hit the U.S. this year, is aiming to make landfall in the vast wetlands south of New Orleans. It comes 15 years after the city was ravaged by Hurricane Katrina but isn’t expected to be anywhere near as devastating as the 2005 storm. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards and New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell have both declared emergencies. Hurricane warnings extend from Morgan City, Louisiana, to the Mississippi-Alabama border.
After it makes landfall, Zeta is forecast to continue north where it may join a winter storm over the Great Plains and dump flooding rains across the eastern U.S. through the rest of the week.
Zeta is expected make landfall between the sites where hurricanes Delta and Laura came in, to the west, and Hurricane Sally struck in the east. The larger storms all missed the region, but it was struck by Tropical Storm Cristobal in June. The multiple strikes have left residual damage throughout the Gulf Coast.
“Any vulnerable structures -- specifically roofs or infrastructure that were lightly damaged from the past two storms and not repaired -- will be at risk,” said Lou Gritzo vice president and manager of research with FM Global, a commercial insurer. “Hurricane Sally was less than six weeks ago, so it’s not likely that the damage has been fully repaired.”
Zeta is the 27th named storm in a supercharged Atlantic hurricane season, just one short of the record reached in 2005. So many storms have formed this year that the hurricane center has run out of official names and is using Greek letters to designate systems.
 Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX), BP (NYSE:BP) Plc, Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) Inc., Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) and other companies are evacuating workers from Gulf installations.  Noble Corp  (OTC:NEBLQ). moved its Globetrotter II rig out of the way. More than 49% of oil production and 55% of offshore natural gas has been shut in, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.
Close to 24% of platforms have been evacuated and 30% of rigs, the agency said. Chevron has also begun preparations to shut a coastal Mississippi oil refinery, according to a person familiar with the operations, and a key seaport that serves deepwater oil installations is under a mandatory evacuation order.
Zeta’s track is shifting to the east and it’s continuing to strengthen, so it may cause as much as $3 billion in damages and losses as it makes landfall later Wednesday, up from earlier estimates of about $1 billion, said Chuck Watson, a damage modeler at Enki Research. Its stronger winds bring more dynamic pressure on everything it hits, and there are simply more targets in the way the closer to New Orleans it gets.
The storm surge, a wall of water that hurricanes drive into coast lines, could hit 9 feet (2.7 meters) in areas between the Pearl River in Louisiana to Dauphin Island, Alabama, the hurricane center said.
As Zeta comes ashore and moves across Mississippi, Alabama, and northern Georgia, it will interact with a winter storm that’s brought snow to Texas and is now moving east, Don Keeney, a meteorologist with commercial forecaster Maxar. The moisture from Zeta will enhance that storm, bringing heavy rains throughout the Midwest and eastern U.S.
Vast stretches of the eastern U.S. will be hit with heavy rain, and the U.S. Weather Prediction Center warned that as much as 5 to 7 inches may fall over the next few days. The confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, southern Appalachian Mountains and southern Mississippi may be hit hardest.
There are some indications a 28th storm could form in the Caribbean in the next week, however the forecast isn’t completely clear yet, said Phil Klotzbach, hurricane researcher with Colorado State University. That would tie the record set in 2005.

594,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 01:41PM ET</span>",'Who the hell elected you?' U.S. Senate tech hearing becomes political tussle,"By Nandita Bose and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate hearing to reform an internet law and hold tech companies accountable for how they moderate content quickly turned into a political scuffle as lawmakers not only went after the companies but also attacked each other.
Lawmakers are split on ways to hold Big Tech accountable under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - which protects companies from liability over content posted by users but also lets the firms shape political discourse.
The chief executives of  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google called the law crucial to free expression on the internet. 
A little over an hour into the hearing, the conversation turned into a heated exchange between senators of both parties. 
Senator Ted Cruz went after Twitter's Jack Dorsey after the CEO said Twitter has no influence over elections.
""Who the hell elected you and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the American people are allowed to hear,"" Cruz said. Ahead of the hearing, the senator released a picture on Twitter titled ""Free Speech showdown Cruz vs Dorsey"" that showed him and Twitter's Dorsey pitted against each other. 
Democratic Senator Brian Schatz said he did not have any questions, calling the hearing ""nonsense"". 
""This is bullying and it is for electoral purposes,"" he said. 
Top Democrat on the panel, Senator Maria Cantwell, said the hearing would have been better if held in January after the Nov. 3 election. The law has little chance of being acted upon by Congress this year.
President Donald Trump, who alleges the companies' stifle conservative voices, and Republican lawmakers sent a flurry of tweets as the hearing continued. ""Repeal Section 230!"" Trump tweeted. Separately, Senator Josh Hawley took a jab at Twitter's Dorsey. ""This level of idiocy confirms the widespread impression that Jack’s primary food source is weed.""
Twitter's global vice president of communications Brandon Borrman said: ""There's nothing in the (Hawley) tweet that deserves a response.""
Twitter's Dorsey warned the committee that eroding the foundation of Section 230 could significantly hurt how people communicate online. Pichai said Google operates without political bias and that doing otherwise would be against its business interests.
The committee was unable to establish contact with Facebook Inc's Zuckerberg and declared a short recess. He appeared shortly after and said: ""I was having a hard time connecting myself.""
Zuckerberg said he supports changing the law but also warned that tech platforms are likely to censor more to avoid legal risks if Section 230 is repealed.
All three CEOs agreed the companies should be held liable if the platforms act as a publisher. 
NO MORE ""FREE PASS""
Republican Senator Roger Wicker, who chairs the committee, said it was important to shield companies from liability without giving them the ability to censor content they dislike.
""The time has come for that free pass to end,"" he said.
Wicker also criticized the companies' decision to block stories from the New York Post that made claims about Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son. He and other senators such as Cory Gardner went after Twitter for not taking down tweets from world leaders that allegedly spread misinformation but going aggressively after Republican President Donald Trump's tweets. 
​Biden has expressed support for revoking the law.

U.S. lawmakers are not the only ones pushing for reform. The European Union's executive Commission is drafting a new Digital Services Act that, in addition to tackling market abuses by dominant platforms, would also address liability for harmful or illegal content. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager is due to unveil her proposals on Dec. 2.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP (N:BX) said on Wednesday its third-quarter distributable earnings rose 9% year-on-year, as the world's largest manager of alternative assets such as private equity and real estate took advantage of a rise in corporate valuations to cash out on some of its leverage buyout investments.
Distributable earnings - cash available for paying dividends to shareholders - totaled $772 million, up from $710 million a year earlier. This translated into distributable earnings per share of 63 cents, surpassing analysts' average estimate of 57 cents, according to data compiled by Refinitiv.
Blackstone said its private equity portfolio appreciated 12.2% in the quarter, compared with an 8.5% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index (SPX) over the same period. Opportunistic and core real estate funds rose 6.4% and 3.5% respectively. Blackstone's shares were down 2.9% in afternoon trading, in line with the broader market. 
Blackstone completed the $7 billion sale of  Cheniere Energy Partners  (A:CQP) to  Brookfield Asset Management  (TO:BAMa) and Blackstone Infrastructure Partners in the quarter, as well as the $625 million initial public offering of India's second real estate investment trust (REIT), Mindspace Business Parks.
""The record fee-related earnings and management fees is what investors focus on and kind of renewed momentum in deployments and realization shows the defensibility of the portfolio through this pandemic,"" said Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Gerald O'Hara.
Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Blackstone reported net income of $794.7 million as growth in investment income was partly offset by compensation expenses.
Total assets under management rose to $584.4 billion as of the end of September from $564.3 billion in the previous quarter, driven by strong fundraising. Blackstone had $152.4 billion of unspent capital as of the end of September.
Asked by analysts about the impact of a possible Democratic victory in the Nov. 3 U.S. election, Blackstone executives said they took account of likely future higher tax rates when the firm converted to a corporation last year. They said they expected any new tax changes to result in only a low-single digit reduction in earnings. 

Blackstone said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 54 cents per share.

LONDON (Reuters) - British luxury car maker  Aston Martin  (L:AML) is testing investor appetite for risky assets days before the U.S. election with a 840-million-pound ($1.1 billion) junk bond sale, one of the largest deals of its kind in Europe this year.
The company is looking to sell dollar and sterling bonds to help redeem existing senior secured debt, repay a government-guaranteed loan and put cash on the balance sheet, according to an investor announcement seen by Reuters. 
The sale started today and the book will be closed on Friday, when Aston Martin will announce the final price. 
The bond issue is the main tool behind a refinancing package that includes a 125-million-pound equity raise, a separate $335 million private placement of notes and an agreement that will see Mercedes-Benz (DE:DAIGn) lift its stake in Aston Martin to up to 20% by 2023.
""Yes, there is a risk involved (for investors) when there's a big part of the business plan that still needs executing,"" said a source familiar with the transaction. ""But it's senior secured debt with a strong brand, production facilities and a billion-pound market cap behind it."" 
Also on offer is a substantial yield at a time when unprecedented monetary stimulus is pushing rates to record lows. 
Both tranches are being marketed at the ""high 8%s-9%"", wording that usually suggests an offer yield of around 8.75%-9%. 
""It's unusual to see a listed business with a billion pounds of market cap offering yields at this level,"" said Steven Hunter, chief executive of high-yield analytics company 9fin. 
""What's also unusual is that it's a company with a negative EBITDA, so it's going to be expensive,"" he added, referring to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Aston Martin is rated Caa1 by Moody's (NYSE:MCO) rating agency. 
Investors have recently shown a willingness to take on risky assets in the bond market of late, with Jaguar Land Rover, Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) and British debt collector Lowell all accessing funds this month. 
JP Morgan and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) are global coordinators on Aston Martin's bond sale.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors pulled out of U.S. corporate bonds on Wednesday as the three major stock indexes sold off on reports of higher COVID-19 cases worldwide and on nerves about next week's U.S. presidential election.
Markit's North American High-Yield CDX Index - which tracks the cost to insure high-yield corporate debt and is a proxy for the junk market - fell in price to 103.695%, the lowest since Sept. 28, as investors sold the contract betting on credit deterioration.
Spreads on Markit's North American Investment Grade CDX Index widened as far as 63.84 basis points, the highest since Sept. 18, as investors there also bet on a rise in defaults.
Credit markets were moving in step with Wall Street's main indexes which briefly lost more than 3% as new cases and hospitalizations set records in the U.S. Midwest, while concerns about shutdowns in France and Germany sapped investor appetite for risk.
The riskiest U.S. corporate bonds were hit hardest.
""You've seen people exit high yield. That's causing spreads to widen out,"" said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance Securities. 
""There's some fear of additional closings in the U.S. and fears that some of the high yield issuers will not be able to pay."" 
Investor anxiety about the U.S. election also sent stocks lower. Financial markets are currently betting that Democratic challenger Joe Biden will defeat President Donald Trump, but because of high levels of mail-in voting, the contest may be fought out in the courts if there is no immediate definitive result.
On top of election outcome uncertainty, Brenner argued that the consequences of a Democratic Party victory - namely the expected increase in capital gains taxes - were dawning on the market.
""People are just assuming that whether it is a blue wave, a red wave, a blue tide, whatever it is, that markets are going to go up. And they’re now getting a rude awakening,"" he said, referring to the colors associated with the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively.

London-based Tabula Investment Management has debuted an exchange-traded fund this week holding both Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, which rise alongside price pressures, and breakevens, which reflect future expectations.
“Existing inflation ETFs force investors to choose between realised inflation and inflation expectations,” Tabula CEO Michael John Lytle said in a press release. “For many investors, both are important measures and a more efficient solution is to combine them.”
The fate of inflation has become a fierce debate in financial markets after the coronavirus struck, decimating consumer demand while at the same time disrupting supply chains. The launch of the new ETF is the latest hint that some expect a wave of stimulus after the U.S. presidential election could revive long-dormant price growth.
The Federal Reserve announced in August it would target an average inflation rate of 2% -- a level the central bank has consistently failed to hit -- after slashing interest rates to near-zero in March. Breakeven rates climbed for months, but they now appear stalled in the countdown to next week’s vote.

(Reuters) - Mastercard Inc (N:MA) said on Wednesday it does not expect a pickup in overall travel spending anytime soon, warning that a recovery in cross-border volumes would be tied to the timing and the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. 
The payments processor said the impact of the pandemic on international travel, especially outside Europe, remains significant. The comments echoed sentiments of  American Express  (N:AXP), which last week reported a 40% fall in quarterly profit and warned business travel would not recover before early 2022.
Mastercard's shares fell 7% to $295.45, while shares in rival  Visa Inc  (N:V), expected to report results after market close, were also lower.
""While we believe that cross-border will ultimately recover, it will take time for people to build their confidence in the safety of travel,"" Mastercard's finance chief Sachin Mehra told analysts on a conference call. 
""We believe that is tied to the broad availability of vaccines and therapeutics, likely towards the latter part of next year,"" he said.
The pandemic has forced companies to lay off workers by the millions, hurting their spending power, and the hit to air travel has also taken a toll on cross-border card transaction volumes. 
Mastercard reported a 36% drop in cross-border volumes on a local currency basis, with the first three weeks of the current quarter clocking declines of more than 30% each. 
Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga, however, pointed to ""some"" improvement in domestic travel in the quarter, including spending on lodging and sports.
Banga, who took charge just after the 2008-09 financial crisis, was speaking to analysts on his final earnings call before his transition to the role of executive chairman next year.
Mastercard's net income fell 28% to $1.5 billion, or $1.51 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Excluding items, profit was $1.60 per share, missing Street estimates of $1.66, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net revenue fell 14% to $3.8 billion, while gross dollar volume, the dollar value of transactions processed, rose 1% to $1.6 trillion. Purchase volumes rose 2%, returning to positive territory. (https:// 
The company forecast growth in U.S. retail sales excluding automotive and gas of 2.4% during the holiday season, with spending mainly on home furnishing, athleisure, clothing and electronics.

603,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",VIX Spikes to Highest Since June With Economy Threat Growing,"(Bloomberg) -- Volatility gripped financial markets with the coronavirus surging in the U.S. just days ahead of a crucial presidential election.
The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, surged to its highest level since mid-June as record virus cases, harsher lockdowns in Europe and a slowing U.S. labor-market recovery renewed fears of a deeper recession. Tensions had already been high with less than a week before the U.S. vote.
“Choppy markets are here for a while, and I think we’re going to continue to see them until we see a vaccine that is widely distributed and we can move past Covid,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank. “Every time we see a resurgence, you’re going to see additional restrictions, which impacts how people spend money.”
The VIX soared above 40 on Wednesday amid a stock rout that sent the S&P 500 Index to a plunge of about 3%. The CBOE NDX Volatility Index -- a measure of implied volatility for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index -- was on track for its highest close since April.
While bets on post-election calm had been growing earlier this week, the potential of reinstated virus lockdowns in the U.S. could keep volatility elevated after next week’s vote.
“Just because we hit election day, I don’t think that takes away the volatility,” Gaffney said. “There’s a lot of uncertainty in the markets even after election day.”

By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com --   Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) fell 8% as attendance plummeted amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Six Flags reported a loss per share of $1.37 compared to the expected loss of $1 on sales of $126 million, lower than the estimated $143 million. Attendance fell to 2.6 million guests, a decline of 11.4 million visitors from a year earlier. Nine of the company's 26 parks were closed in the third quarter because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and those that were open were subject to attendance limitations.
On the upside, in-park spending per capita in the third quarter increased due to a higher mix of single-day guests, who tend to spend more on a per visit basis.     
The company initiated a transformation plan in March to improve long-term profit growth, including revenue and productivity initiatives. The plan is centered on technology and providing more value for its guests’ time and money. Six Flags expects the transformation plan to generate an incremental $80 million to $110 million in annual run-rate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.     
 “We made substantial progress towards our goal of modernizing the guest experience as we become a more agile, consumer-centric, productive, and technology-savvy organization,"" said Chief Executive Officer Mike Spanos in a statement. ""We expect the transformation to enable significant profit growth once our plan is fully executed in a post-pandemic environment.”

Investing.com --  Better-than-expected results couldn't stop Denny's (NASDAQ:DENN) from getting slammed. 
Shares dropped 13% as the company said domestic same-store sales for 2020 are expected to reach no more than 75% of last year's results. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is estimated at at least $28 million.
Earnings per share of one penny beats the expected loss per share of 4 cents on sales of $71.6 million, higher than the estimated figure of $67.3 million. That compares to $124 million a year earlier. Denny's, like all restaurants, is getting hit as states and cities mandate shut downs to prevent the spread of Covid-19. More shutdowns may be on the horizon as infections tick higher.
While sales have recovered from a 76% dip in April, they were still down 28% in September compared to a year earlier. Same-store sales in the U.S. fell 34% for the third quarter. 
""I am encouraged by our sequential sales improvement over the course of the third quarter, despite the continued disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the full-service restaurant industry,"" said Chief Executive Officer John Miller in a statement. ""I am confident that Denny's is well-positioned to effectively navigate through the pandemic while preparing for future growth.""                    
Despite the rough year, Denny's has three buy ratings and one hold, according to data compiled by Investing.com.

608,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>",GE's shares soar as earnings recover from pandemic lows,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) on Wednesday unexpectedly reported a quarterly profit and a positive cash flow on the back of cost cuts and improvements in its power and renewable energy businesses, sending its shares 10% higher.
The Boston-based industrial conglomerate reported a free cash flow of $514 million from industrial operations in the third quarter, compared with an outflow of $2.1 billion in the previous quarter and Refinitiv's average analyst estimate of an outflow of $876 million.
GE said it expects industrial free cash flow to be at least $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter and positive in 2021.
Adjusted profit for the quarter came in at 6 cents per share compared with Refinitiv's average analyst estimate of a loss of 4 cents per share.
The company's shares, which have fallen about 40% since the beginning of 2020, were up about 10.3% at $7.83 in morning trading.
""We are managing through a still-difficult environment with better operational execution across our businesses,"" said Chief Executive Lawrence Culp.
Culp is trying to turn around the company by improving free cash flow and cutting debt. However, the coronavirus pandemic has hit those efforts by hammering GE's aviation unit, usually the company's most profitable and most cash-generative segment.
In response to the pandemic-induced turmoil, GE is cutting $2 billion in costs and aiming to generate $3 billion in cash savings. The company said it has, thus far, realized 75% of its target.
Chief Financial Officer Carolina Dybeck Happe told investors on an earnings call that the company has thus far reduced its headcount by more than 15,000 and aims to have 20,000 fewer employees by the end of 2020 as part of its cost-cut drive.
Revenue at both power and renewable energy businesses recovered from the last quarter even as orders saw a double-digit dip. Revenue at GE's aviation unit fell an annual 39% in the latest quarter.
Analysts at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors said the earnings report would ""reinforce the messaging that GE has fundamentally bottomed.""
However, a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases has raised the risk of prolonging the downturn in the aviation industry, which has led to a sharp cutback in maintenance spending by airlines, hitting both large and small suppliers.
This has compounded the troubles at GE's aviation unit, which makes engines for  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and had already been reeling from the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX planes.
Happe said aviation orders more than halved during the quarter, with a 60% decline in both commercial engines and commercial services. 
Boeing on Wednesday said it would take three years for passenger travel to return to pre-pandemic levels.
GE said an annual test of reserves in its legacy insurance business resulted in a ""small positive margin"" with no impact to earnings.
Mounting losses related to the company's run-off insurance operations - a portfolio of about 300,000 long-term care insurance policies it holds in its GE Capital unit - forced the company to take a $6.2 billion charge in 2018 and put aside $15 billion in reserves to shore it up.
The insurance charge also brought scrutiny from securities regulators. Earlier this month, GE warned that it could face a civil action for possible violations of securities laws over its accounting for the insurance business.

GE said it has reserved $100 million to cover potential penalties for all the accounting investigations. Happe said the amount was ""appropriate"" to cover the probes.

(Reuters) - Britain's GSK (L:GSK) cautioned full-year earnings would likely come in at the lower end of its forecast range after the COVID-19 pandemic took a toll on its vaccines unit, with people in the United States shunning visits to their physician for their shots. 
GSK shares were down 1% at 1,347.2 pence after the drugmaker's shingles vaccine Shingrix, the biggest driver of sales growth last year, saw quarterly revenue fall 30% from a year earlier to 374 million pounds ($487 million), some 18.5% below market expectations. 
While the pandemic has hit its businesses during the first nine months of 2020, GSK said on Wednesday it had lately seen a recovery in vaccination rates, with adult immunisations in the United States returning to prior-year levels towards the end of the quarter.
""What we saw through the quarter ... were definitely lower vaccination rates in July and August,"" GSK CEO Emma Walmsley said on a media call. ""In September and indeed through the early weeks of October, however, we are back at pre-pandemic levels."" 
For the drug industry as a whole the effects of COVID-19 on vaccination behaviour has been at times erratic and difficult to forecast.  Pfizer  (N:PFE) for instance said on Tuesday that while many people missed shots of its best-selling Prevnar 13 vaccine (against pneumonia-causing bacteria) during the second quarter, there had been a catch-up trend during the third quarter.
 Merck & Co  (N:MRK), for its part, said demand for its pneumonia vaccine Pneumovax 23 had increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.
GSK is one of many drugmakers involved in a race to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 but lags behind frontrunners like AstraZeneca (L:AZN) and Pfizer (N:PFE).
GSK is collaborating with Sanofi (PA:SASY) to develop a vaccine, with late-stage trials expected to start in December. 
The two companies have struck a deal to will supply 200 million doses of their COVID-19 candidate vaccine to a global inoculation scheme backed by the World Health Organization.
For the quarter, GSK reported adjusted earnings of 35.6 pence per share and sales of 8.67 billion pounds.
Analysts on average had expected adjusted earnings of 30.4 pence per share and sales of 8.77 billion pounds, according to a company-compiled consensus https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/investors/analyst-consensus/analyst-consensus of 16 analysts.

GSK said it expects 2020 profit to be at the lower end of its previous forecast of a drop of between 1% and 4%, which did not include any potential impact from the coronavirus crisis.

Adobe had expected that growth to happen over two years instead of a single year. Adobe said growth last year was 13%.
November and December will turn into ""Cyber Months,"" thanks to an early start to the promotional season, as opposed to the traditional ""Cyber Week,"" which is the highly promotional period around Thanksgiving, Adobe said in a report.
""We've seen a lot of new shoppers enter the landscape for online spending because of COVID-19,"" said Vivek Pandya, a senior manager at Adobe Digital Insights.
The firm measures transactions from 80 of the top 100 U.S. retailers and trillions of customer visits to U.S. retail sites.
Several retailers, including  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY), moved up winter holiday promotions to as early as October as the pandemic upended the industry. 
Even online giant Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) two-day ""Prime Day"" was pushed to earlier this month from July.
Adobe Analytics said it expects about $1 out of every $4 of total retail spending this holiday season to be from online shoppers. It has typically seen online retail spending account for $1 out of every $5 of total retail sales.
Overall retail sales during the holiday season, which sees retailers book an outsized portion of their annual sales and profits, are likely to increase between 1% and 1.5%, according to consultants Deloitte https:// Online sales will get an $11 billion boost - taking the growth to 47% - if  consumers receive another round of stimulus checks and physical stores shut down in large parts of the country, Adobe Analytics added.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell sharply at the opening on Wednesday, as the increasingly rapid spread of the Covid-19 virus across most of the northern hemisphere made the prospect of renewed lockdowns and all of the attendant negative effects on the economy more likely.
European stock markets had, for once, led the trend, with the German DAX falling over 4% on reports that Chancellor Angela Merkel had proposed shutting bars and restaurants for the month of November to break the trend of rising infections, hospital admissions and deaths. France is also reported to be planning to order a week-long national lockdown later Wednesday.
However, the U.S. figures too remain on a clearly negative path with hospital admissions and deaths both on an upward path for a month and now around the highest levels since August. Nor is the rising rate of new infections due principally to increased testing. The positivity rate - the proportion of tests that come back positive - has also risen to its highest since August, at 8.2% from less than 4% in late September.
""Overall, national hospitalizations remain on track to breach the first and second wave peaks by Thanksgiving,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note to clients.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 521 points, or 1.9%, at 26,942 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite, despite being buoyed by a greater concentration of relative winners from the pandemic, was down 1.9%.
Losses were particularly heavy in Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which fell over 4% on the back of a report that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is looking at developing its own search engine, afraid of the antitrust scrutiny its current deal with Google has attracted. The Department of Justice last week accused Google of abusing its dominant market position in search, specifically mentioning an agreement with Apple that makes Google' the default search engine on its iPhones.
The slump came on one of the busiest days of the current earnings season, which saw Boeing (NYSE:BA),  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and UPS all beat expectations for their bottom lines. GE stock rose 7.3% to test a four-month high, while Boeing outperformed slightly, falling only 1.2% after narrowing its quarterly loss sharply and announcing thousands more job cuts.
Stay-at-home stocks were among the few relative winners in the general rout, with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock rising 0.6% and Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) stock rising 0.2%."
616,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 09:05AM ET</span>","U.S. auto sales gain pace in October on strong demand: JD Power, LMC Automotive","(Reuters) - The pace of U.S. auto sales is expected to rise 3% in October, helped by a strong recovery in consumer demand and tighter inventories at dealerships, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Wednesday.
Retail sales of new vehicles are estimated to reach about 1.2 million units in October, a 3% increase from a year ago when adjusted for selling days, the consultancies said. 
This year, October had one additional selling day compared to last year. Without the adjustment, the increase would be 6.8% year over year.
""Two consecutive months of year-over-year retail sales increases demonstrates that consumer demand is showing remarkable strength,"" said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power.
Average incentive spending per unit in October fell $425 to $3,678 from a year ago, as lean inventories have allowed retailers to reduce the discounts they typically offer on new vehicles.
Incentive spending, which peaked at $4,953 per unit in April 2020, is below 9% for the first time since June 2016.
The shift towards more expensive trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) is expected to drive average transaction prices to an all-time high of $36,755 in the month of October.
The consultancies also estimate the seasonally adjusted annualized sales pace for new vehicles in October to be about 15.9 million vehicles, down just 0.8 million units from 2019.
LMC Automotive also expects total global light-vehicle sales for the year to be about 77 million units, a decline of 15% from 2019.

618,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 08:01AM ET</span>","Mastercard Q3 Profit, Revenue Fall as Pandemic Cuts Travel","Investing.com - Mastercard (NYSE:MA) reported on Wednesday a sharp drop in net profit in its third quarter earnings  release, as the coronavirus pandemic resulted in customers spending less on its cards.
Mastercard announced earnings per share of $1.6, down 26% from last year, on revenue of $3.84 billion, a drop of 14%. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.66 on revenue of $3.96 billion.
The drop in revenue was driven largely by travel declining sharply during the pandemic, with the company reporting a decline in cross-border volume of 36% on a local currency basis
The company's stock dropped 4.1% premarket, cutting into the 6% gain that the stock has made since the beginning of the year.
“Mastercard has been focused on helping merchants, banks, fintechs, governments and consumers with products and services to navigate the pandemic. We are seeing encouraging progress in the trajectory of domestic spending, while travel spending remains a challenge,” said Ajay Banga, Mastercard CEO. “Meanwhile, we are winning new business in core payments and are making real progress with our digital solutions, differentiated service offerings and multi-rail capabilities.”
During the third quarter of 2020, Mastercard repurchased approximately 6.5 million shares at a cost of $2.1 billion and paid $402 million in dividends.

619,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 07:31AM ET</span>","Boeing Narrows Loss Sharply in Q3, but Stays Coy on Outlook","Investing.com - Boeing (NYSE:BA) sharply reduced its operating and net losses in the three months through September after a disastrous second quarter of 2020, but warned that its commercial aircraft business in particular remained under severe pressure in the short term and expects lower growth rates in future.
The company reported a net loss per share on core operations of $1.39, better than expectations for a loss of $2.26 and down sharply from a loss of $4.79 in the second quarter, as deliveries of commercial aircraft picked up from rock-bottom levels and the company's 737 MAX edged closer to being cleared for take-off again after two fatal crashes last year.
Revenue fell just short of expectations at $14.1 billion, down 29% on the year, as the pandemic disrupted the company's service and defense operations too.
“The global pandemic continued to add pressure to our business this quarter, and we’re aligning to this new reality by closely managing our liquidity and transforming our enterprise to be sharper, more resilient and more sustainable for the long term,” said Boeing President and Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun.
Reports in August had suggested that the company plans to cut more than the 16,000 jobs or so that it originally announced back in April as demand from the airline business all but completely dried up.
The company gave no detailed guidance for the fourth quarter or the full year.
Boeing shares are down 52% from the beginning of the year, and down 59% from their 52 week high of $375.60 set on November 18, 2019. They are under-performing the S&P 500 which is up 5% from the start of the year.
Boeing stock had hit a one-month low on Tuesday on fears that a fresh wave of the Coronavirus pandemic would push back even further the day when commercial air travel recovers. However, they rose 1.3% in premarket trading on Wednesday after the report, sharply outperforming the broader market.
""There has been no shortage of bad news for Boeing stock,"" said Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar. ""It’s been caught up in the middle of geopolitical tension between the U.S. and China; its 737 MAX is still grounded, while there is little sign that air traffic is recovering after the pandemic-triggered collapse."" 
But all this bad news is already reflected in its stock price, Anwar said. ""From here, any positive news is going to improve investor perception.""

The Italian-American car maker on Wednesday said it posted adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 2.28 billion euros ($2.7 billion) in the July-September period. That topped a 1.152 billion euro forecast in an analyst poll compiled by Reuters.
""Our record results were driven by our team's tremendous performance in North America,"" Chief Executive Mike Manley said in a statement.
Milan-listed shares in FCA trimmed earlier losses after the results were released. By 1110 GMT they were down 3%.
FCA, which earlier this year withdrew its guidance for its full-year results, said it now forecast a 3-3.5 billion euro adjusted EBIT in 2020, but added that the new guidance was not assuming further significant disruptions from COVID-19.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening sharply lower Wednesday, weighed by fears of additional lockdowns as coronavirus cases surge, while the earnings season continues apace.
At 06:20 AM ET (1120 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 46 points, or 1.4%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 485 points, or 1.8%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 121 points, or 1.1%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is already down nearly 3% on the week, giving up all of its gains for October, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices sit at three-week lows.
The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has hit the northern hemisphere hard, with many countries in Europe posting record daily infection levels, while nearly half a million people in the United States have contracted the virus in the last seven days, according to a Reuters tally.
This has resulted in increased fears that fresh lockdowns will be reintroduced, something European countries are on the verge of implementing, potentially stifling the nascent economic recovery. 
In France, President Emmanuel Macron will give a televised address later Wednesday, amid local reports his government has been exploring a new, national lockdown from midnight on Thursday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to meet state premiers to discuss closing restaurants and bars, while the Belgian government will convene on Friday to decide on a potential new national lockdown. Spain has already announced a state of emergency for six months.
This comes as President Donald Trump acknowledged on Tuesday that a coronavirus economic relief deal wouldn’t arrive before the Nov. 3 election, with the two sides unable to bridge differences over the size and scope of the package.
The earnings season continues at a frantic pace Wednesday, with the likes of  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS),  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) reporting before the bell, and Ford (NYSE:F), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and remdesivir maker Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) after the close.
The tech sector will also be in focus after Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) healthy third-quarter numbers, helped by growth at its cloud computing business, while the CEOs of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) are expected to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee. 
Oil prices slumped Wednesday, as a jump in U.S. crude stocks, coupled with the potential damage to demand from the sharp increase in Covid-19 cases, raised worries about a supply glut.
Investors now await data from the Energy Information Administration, due later in the day, while the arrival of Hurricane Zeta, which is expected to make landfall in Louisiana later Wednesday, will also be in focus.
U.S. crude futures traded 4% lower at $38.00 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 3.2% to $40.30. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 1% to $1,892.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.5% lower at 1.1739.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on Thursday will announce its latest financial results, and Wall Street wants to know if it can keep up with shoppers' heightened demand during the coronavirus pandemic.
Just three months ago, the world's largest online retailer posted the biggest profit in its 26-year history. Governments' stay-at-home orders prompted consumers to shift purchases to web marketplaces such as Amazon, while brick-and-mortar rivals shuttered shops.
Amazon has reaped rewards from this but not without challenges. For a time, Amazon limited its warehousing services to essential goods. The company re-fashioned operations for COVID-19 precautions, though more than 19,000 workers caught the virus - and some demanded site closures. Customers experienced slower-than-usual deliveries.
Some analysts, including Colin Sebastian of Baird Equity Research, want to know if Amazon can manage such challenges while demand climbs with fourth-quarter holiday shopping. The company typically addresses such questions during an analyst call after its financial report.
""Do they have the logistics and delivery capacity to handle order volumes?"" Sebastian asked.
Michael Pachter, of Wedbush Securities, cited anecdotes about recent warehousing constraints for certain larger items. ""I think you're going to have a disastrous fourth quarter in terms of demand overwhelming them once again,"" he said.
Amazon has long worked to avoid a repeat of the 2013 season when delays left some without gifts on Christmas Day. The company now handles more deliveries in house, and this year it moved its marketing event Prime Day - usually in July - to October, letting shoppers place holiday orders early. 
Pachter said, ""They wanted us to start thinking 'holiday' now, before the crazy rush that begins Black Friday.""
The extra weeks of shopping may translate into additional sales, with higher-income households offsetting those with depressed budgets for holiday spending.

Analysts on average expect revenue of $92.7 billion for the just-ended third quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (N:GM) Super Cruise once again edged Tesla's (O:TSLA) Autopilot in an evaluation of 17 vehicles equipped with active driving assistance systems (ADAS) by Consumer Reports, the testing organization said on Wednesday.
A Tesla Model Y fitted with Autopilot finished ""a distant second,"" the group said, to a Cadillac CT6 equipped with Super Cruise, which GM is rolling out to more than 20 vehicles - including its new Hummer electric pickup truck - over the next three years.
Safety and insurance researchers have frequently warned of the risks of consumers overestimating ADAS systems' abilities, a misconception increased by some automakers calling their products Autopilot, ProPilot or Co-Pilot.
In 2018, the Cadillac CT6 with Super Cruise scored higher than a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot, in a Consumer Reports test of just four vehicles equipped with ADAS.
In the latest test, conducted this summer on a track and on public roads, the Cadillac scored 69 points out of a possible 100, while the Tesla scored 57. A Lincoln Corsair equipped with  Ford Motor Co 's (N:F) Co-Pilot 360 system, finished third with 52.
The critical difference in the Super Cruise system is a driver-facing infrared camera to make sure he or she is paying attention to the road and is ready to take over manual control when necessary, said Kelly Funkhouser, head of connected and automated vehicle testing at Consumer Reports.
The group noted that Autopilot can shut off abruptly in some situations, while Super Cruise did a better job of notifying the driver when the system is disengaging.

In recent European safety testing, a Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot placed sixth out of 10 systems, getting high marks for performance and ability to respond to emergencies, but falling short on its ability to maintain a driver’s focus on the road.

LONDON (Reuters) - London's Heathrow is no longer Europe's busiest airport, ceding its long-held crown to Paris during the pandemic and blaming government inaction for its passenger numbers plunging even more than rivals.
Heathrow said Paris Charles de Gaulle had overtaken it as Europe's busiest airport, dealing a blow to Britain's global trade ambitions as the country's current relationship with the European Union is due to end in two-months time.
The airport criticised the UK government for being slow to introduce an airport testing regime to replace 14-day quarantine rules, and said the delays were causing additional harm to the economy. 
Heathrow also cut its outlook for next year's passenger numbers saying it now expected 37 million passengers, 41% lower than a June forecast, as tightening coronavirus restrictions crush hopes for a recovery in travel demand. 
CEO John Holland-Kaye said Heathrow's slide down the rankings -- Amsterdam and Frankfurt could also overtake it based on passenger numbers -- should spur the government into action. 
""I hope the government will realise that if we sit on our hands then Britain will lose many of the things we take for granted like having the best connected airports in the world,"" he said in a telephone interview.
Passenger numbers at Heathrow have plunged, down 84% in the three months ended September, pushing it to a 1.5 billion pound loss over the first nine months of the year.
Britain has said it will announce shorter quarantines based on COVID-19 testing to revitalise travel by the beginning of December, but Holland-Kaye said he was also hopeful that there would also soon be progress with a plan to allow quarantine-free UK-U.S. travel. 
""There's at least a 50-50 chance,"" Holland-Kaye said when asked about the chances of this starting by late November. 
The plan would allow pre-departure and arrival testing on some London to U.S. routes. The United States is a key market for Heathrow, accounting for 20% of its usual traffic, with London to New York accounting for 5%. 
The airport is owned by Spain's Ferrovial (MC:FER), the Qatar Investment Authority and China Investment Corp, among others.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Earlier this year, a low-key biomedical firm briefly toppled Australia's biggest bank and miner to become the country's most expensive company and a household brand, thanks to its part in the race to produce a COVID-19 vaccine.
But while the coronavirus pandemic has lifted CSL Ltd's (AX:CSL) investment profile, virus anxieties are also hitting its most lucrative business: taking blood from donors and converting it into medical treatment.
That pressure comes on top of growing ethical concerns about the way CSL taps paid U.S. donors, which analysts and investors warn could hit earnings.
Until recently, Brandi Haun, 37, gave blood twice a week at a CSL collection centre in downtown Dallas, using the payments to top up her income as an online retailer.
But after a year and a half, she quit, citing social distancing requirements and worries the needles were causing nerve damage.
""I didn't feel it was worth it anymore,"" Haun told Reuters in an online chat.
The United States is one of the few countries where it is legal to pay for blood donations and is home to 94% of CSL's 277 plasma collection centres.
Investor concerns were heightened in April when a  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) report warned of CSL's regulatory and reputational risks, citing studies that linked frequent donations to poor health effects like iron deficiency and weaker bone density, and worries about compromised safety at collection centres.
Those risks could herald stricter U.S. rules that limit paid plasma donations to 33 a year, the European limit, from 104 currently, the report said.
While there are no immediate signs of a tightening in U.S. standards, Credit Suisse said such intervention could cut CSL's earnings by 10% permanently and urged investors to ""stress test"" the possibility of tighter limits.
A CSL spokeswoman declined to comment directly on the Credit Suisse report but said the company was ""committed to safe, effective, reliable therapies"" with many ""repeat donors who make a commitment to long-term donation because they recognise the life-saving benefits that these products provide.""
CSL adheres to donation limits, rejects donors who failed medical and laboratory tests and checks a donor database to stop excessive donations, she added.
""There is the potential for CSL's ethical issues to turn into investment issues,"" said Damien Klassen, head of investments at fund manager Nucleus Wealth, which has CSL shares.
""At current prices there is a lot of growth expected from CSL and it will be important to keep an eye out to make sure that CSL are not cutting regulatory corners to meet those expectations.""
VACCINE HALO
A promise to supply Australia's 25 million people with a coronavirus vaccine, if one becomes available, has boosted CSL's profile. That deal involves separate government-backed agreements to make vaccines being tested by Britain's AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) and Australia's University of Queensland.
Started as a government laboratory a century ago to supply vaccines during World War One, a series of acquisitions abroad since 2004 transformed CSL into the world's biggest maker of blood plasma products with operations from Germany to the United States.
Over the past three years, its market value tripled, briefly making it Australia's largest listed company in March.
While investor concerns raised in Credit Suisse's April report and resurgent mining stocks knocked it down to third place, lofty growth expectations have keep it ahead of Australia's biggest bank and only behind mega-miners BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) and Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO).
But a coronavirus vaccine may only contribute a short-term boost to CSL's profit, which most analysts say would be too small to put a figure on. CSL said it was too soon to calculate the financial effects of a coronavirus vaccine.
For now, CSL makes 90% of its profit from plasma-based treatments for people with immune diseases like haemophilia and hereditary angioedema. That relies on a steady supply of blood, from which it extracts the prized binding agent.
This month, CSL lifted its 2021 profit forecast due to demand for both plasma treatments and non-COVID influenza vaccines, which has spiked in the pandemic. At the same time, COVID-19 constraints have put ""raw material"" collection some way off last year's level, it said.
""To-date, we have been able to satisfy all of our supply obligations for all products in our portfolio,"" the CSL spokeswoman told Reuters this week. ""Nevertheless, the shortfall in plasma collection will likely impact (immunoglobulin) product supply in the coming months.""
Immunoglobulin is an antibody that accounts for more than half of CSL's plasma treatment sales.
While plasma supply issues caused by COVID-19 weigh on the earnings outlook, some analysts are less concerned about the longer-term prospects, even with the kinds of risks raised by Credit Suisse.
""The reality is that the plasma collected in the U.S. is saving tens of thousands of lives and it's very unlikely that the U.S. government would change that,"" said John Deakin-Bell, an analyst at Citi who covers CSL.
""These are products that you need human plasma to make.""

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell 2.4%, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) and France's CAC 40 (FCHI) both plunged 3.3% and UK's FTSE 100 (FTSE) dropped 2.2%. 
The French government has been exploring a new, national lockdown from midnight on Thursday, BFM TV reported, albeit a slightly more flexible one than the two-month shutdown that began in mid-March.
President Emmanuel Macron will give a televised address later in the evening, his office said. 
Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to close all restaurants and bars from Nov. 4 according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters, while the Telegraph newspaper reported British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure for a new lockdown.
""Global markets look incredibly nervous, the mix of rising COVID-19 cases and deaths and the potential full lockdown in France, add this to the uncertainty ahead of the U.S. elections and you have a very poor backdrop,"" said John Woolfitt, director of trading at Atlantic Capital Markets.
""I don't expect this to be long-term, but nervousness will continue until elections are done and some form of steadying in the COVID-19 numbers.""
Economically sensitive sectors such as automakers (SXAP), banks (SX7P) and insurers (SXIP) led declines, falling between 3.9% and 4.4%.
U.S. futures  also slid over 1% as investors stayed on the sidelines with no stimulus package in sight and just a week to go before the U.S. presidential election.
The downbeat mood overshadowed a batch of upbeat quarterly results from European companies. 
 Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) reported a surprise swing into quarterly net profit and upgraded the revenue outlook for its investment bank, but its shares fell 4.2%.
 Carrefour  (PA:CARR) delivered its strongest quarterly underlying sales growth for at least two decades. Shares of Europe's largest retailer, however, dropped 2.5%.

German online takeaway food company Delivery Hero (DE:DHER) was among the few gainers, up 4.1%, after it raised its guidance for 2020 sales for the second time this year.

636,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>","Sony raises full-year profit outlook after record second quarter on strong gaming, 'Demon Slayer'","By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) -  Sony  Corp (T:6758) raised its annual profit outlook on Wednesday after posting a record second-quarter profit, as its gaming business continued to capture ""nesting"" demand ahead of the launch of the next-generation PlayStation 5 (PS5) console next month.
The upward revision also reflects a robust start for Japanese animated film ""Demon Slayer"", co-distributed by Sony (NYSE:SNE)'s music unit, which has been shattering box-office records in Japan since its Oct. 16 release.
Higher revenue from gaming and entertainment content gives validation to Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida's strategy to increase recurring revenue streams that cushion the impact of volatile hardware sales cycles.
Sony is targeting PS5 console sales of 7.6 million units or more in the year through March, chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki said at a briefing, citing the sales achieved for the PS4 when it was launched seven years ago.
But Totoki also warned of major damage to its prized image sensor business from tighter U.S. curbs on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], which banned global suppliers from selling it chips - such as Sony's - made using U.S. technology without a special licence.
The Chinese smartphone maker was Sony's second-largest image sensor customer after Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), accounting for about 20% of its $10 billion in sensor revenue, according to analyst estimates.
Despite efforts to diversify customers, a full recovery in profitability at the image sensor business would come only in the year through March 2023, Totoki said.
""It will take considerable time until other customers adopt the trend of high-performance, large-sized sensors led by the Chinese customer,"" he said. 
Sony raised its annual profit forecast by 13% to 700 billion yen ($6.7 billion), after reporting a surprise increase in July-September profit to 317.76 billion yen, a second-quarter record.
The outlook is above the 672.33 billion yen consensus of 24 analysts compiled by Refinitiv.
The firm now forecasts its gaming division will post an annual profit of 300 billion yen, up from the previously estimated 240 billion yen.
Consumers' shift to gaming software downloads and online subscription services during coronavirus lockdowns boosted profits despite the PlayStation 4 console coming to the end of its lifecycle.
Such high-margin online revenue is likely to help Sony's gaming business stay profitable this year, outweighing massive marketing and production costs associated with the new console launch.
Sony pre-sold as many PS5 consoles in the first 12 hours in the United States as in the first 12 weeks for its predecessor PlayStation 4 device, Jim Ryan, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, said in an interview.
""The demand as expressed by the level of pre-order has been very, very considerable,"" Ryan told Reuters.

For its sensor business, Sony cut the profit outlook by 38% to 81 billion yen, further trimmed its three-year investment through March next year by 40 billion yen to 650 billion yen, and said it may slow a production ramp-up at a new plant in Nagasaki, southern Japan.

637,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 05:15AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Russia needs to boost its debt, VTB CEO says, bank ready to co-finance budget","By Tatiana Voronova and Katya Golubkova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia needs to increase its state debt to support economic growth and VTB (MM:VTBR), its second biggest bank, is ready to ramp up government bond purchases to help finance budget needs, Chief Executive Andrey Kostin told Reuters in an interview.
Russia, trying to spend its way out of the coronavirus crisis, has doubled its offering of state rouble bonds to 5 trillion roubles ($66 billion) this year. Foreign investors and state banks are the main buyers of the bonds, known as OFZs.
To increase debt, Moscow temporarily increased Russia's maximum spending ceiling, and Kostin said the time has come to start actively spending the National Wealth Fund, a rainy day $172 billion cushion, as well. 
""I am an advocate of an increase in state debt, this is important for economic development,"" Kostin told Reuters in remarks cleared for publication on Wednesday. ""VTB is ready to finance the budget, especially if there are refinancing tools."" 
The state-controlled VTB, which has a market capitalisation of nearly $6 billion, now holds 300 billion roubles in OFZ bonds and plans to double or even triple that amount, Kostin said.
He did not give the timeframe, but the bank later clarified it planned to increase its bond purchases by the end of this year. 
Russia's public debt is set to rise to 18.5% of gross domestic product this year from 12.3% a year before, softening an economic contraction to an overall fall of 4-5% in 2020 after an 8% slump in the second quarter.
Given that the Russian public debt is much lower than of most major economies, Moscow can affort to increase its debt further without accomulating risks, Kostin said. 
VTB, like its rivals, saw an increase in non-performing loans and has had to triple bad loan provisions by 180 billion roubles so far this year, Kostin said. 
He said that in a worst-case scenario, non-performing loans could reach around 7% of his bank's total loan portfolio compared with nearly 10% seen during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis - ""a non-crucial"" development for VTB. 
""We have passed the lowest point in regard to the economic contraction, and I can see from my clients that the situation is manageable,"" Kostin said. 
VTB, which has cut the 2019 dividend to 10% of net profit from a 50% target to beef up its capital, will return to the original target at some point, Kostin said, and may also issue subordinated debt to boost capital if needed. 
Asked what has changed for Kostin, 64, after he underwent a coronavirus treatment earlier this year, he said: ""We need to think now that the fight against pandemics, and ecology issues are of big importance... They should go on the global agenda in international relations, (and) be a priority at home."" 

""Diseases, environmental degradation are throwing us back... These are much more important things than 5G,"" he said, referring to the high-speed wireless technology now being rolled out.

638,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",Stocks tumble as lockdown fears grip investors,"By Tom Wilson
LONDON (Reuters) - Shares around the world tumbled on Wednesday as coronavirus infections grew rapidly in Europe and the United States, igniting fears of possible strict lockdown measures that could damage already fragile economic recoveries. 
European shares fell on reports of potential lockdowns in Germany and France, losing 2.5% to hit five-month lows, rattled by a media report that France might bring in a national lockdown from midnight on Thursday.
The Paris index was among the hardest hit, losing 3.5% to touch its lowest since May. 
German shares slumped 3.2% to their lowest since June, after a report Chancellor Angela Merkel wanted to close restaurants and bars to curb new infections.
In Europe, automakers and banks led the losses, falling 4.2% and 3.9% respectively. 
Wall Street futures lost 1.3-1.6%. 
The United States, Russia, France and others have seen record numbers of infections in recent days, with European governments introducing new curbs that investors fear could maul the already fragile recoveries.
""The appetite of the different countries' authorities to enforce new lockdowns - that's the point of discrimination between good market performance and bad market performance,"" said Alessia Berardi, senior economist at Amundi.
""The second wave is now clearly very strong in Europe."" 
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, fell 0.6%.
Asian shares lost ground after initially showing some resilience, in part due to more limited COVID-19 outbreaks and better recoveries in the region's major economies. 
MSCI's ex-Japan Asia index lost 0.1%, turning negative even after China and South Korea made gains.
The concerns over a second wave of infections played out in currency and bond markets, too, with the euro slumping 0.4% against the dollar. German government bond yields hit their lowest since March.
Wall Street saw a mixed day on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 losing 0.3% but the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbing 0.6%.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) report later this week, closely watched because they have been among the few winners from the pandemic.
ELECTION UNCERTAINTY 
Adding to the mood of uncertainty is the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election. 
Former Vice President Joe Biden has enjoyed a consistent lead over President Donald Trump, prompting investors to cautiously bet on his victory and possibly a ""blue wave"" outcome, where Democrats take back the Senate as well.
But Wall Street's volatility index, a measure of market expectations in share price swings, rose to 36.60, its highest since early September.
That is a product of wariness that the election outcome itself could be contested, some market players say. An unclear result could leave expectations of a U.S. fiscal stimulus package to counter the coronavirus pandemic in limbo.
""It is not yet clear that we will have a winner at this time (next week) as many State Secretaries and voting commissions are hedging their bets that they will indeed be able to project the winner by next Wednesday morning,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts wrote.
The uncertainty was apparent in currency markets, too: One-week implied volatility indicators for the euro and the yen rose to their highest in nearly seven months.

The same measure of volatility for the Chinese yuan also spiked, hitting its highest since January 2016.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar edged up 0.1%.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Wednesday, with investors concerned that the surge in Covid-19 cases will prompt a new wave of lockdowns, stifling the region’s already tepid recovery.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 3.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 3.1%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 2.1%.
Many European countries have reported soaring infection rates, as the second wave of the Covid-19 virus hits hard, aided by the onset of cold, damp winter weather. Restrictions have had a limited effect to date, prompting fears of more draconian measures.
French President Emmanuel Macron is set to give a televised address on Wednesday evening, with local media reporting that the government is considering imposing a lockdown from midnight on Thursday.
Similarly, the Belgian government will convene on Friday to decide on a potential new national lockdown, while Spain has already announced a state of emergency for six months.
In corporate news,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) returned to quarterly profit, helped by a strong performance from its investment banking arm. However, its stock fell 3.8%, swept up in the general Covid-induced malaise.
Puma (DE:PUMG) also reported positive news, with the German sports goods retailer reporting that its third-quarter sales and profit rose, but it declined to provide guidance for the year given the general uncertainty. Its stock fell 4%.
In the UK,  Next  (LON:NXT) upgraded its profit guidance for the year as its full price sales rose in the third quarter. Yet its stock still fell 0.6%.
LVMH (PA:LVMH) stock fell 2.8%, outperforming the wider sector following a report that the French luxury goods giant may have to pay less than originally agreed upon to buy U.S. jeweler Tiffany (NYSE:TIF).
Elsewhere, the travel sector was hard hit by the idea of further lockdowns, with Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) stock down 6.7%, Ryanair (LON:RYA) down 7.2% and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) 5.8% lower.
Oil prices slipped sharply Wednesday, as a jump in U.S. crude stocks, coupled with the potential damage to demand from the incessant increase in Covid-19 cases, raised worries about a supply glut.
Data from the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday showed a build of 4.577 million barrels for the week ending Oct. 23, more than the 1.2 million barrels expected, while gasoline inventories also rose. Government data are expected later Wednesday.
Traders will also keep an eye on the arrival of Hurricane Zeta, which is expected to make landfall in Louisiana later Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 3.7% lower at $38.09 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 3% to $40.38. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,904.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1761.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (T:7011) (MHI) said it has asked several other companies to temporarily employ idle workers from its factories in central Japan in a bid to cut costs and weather a downturn from the COVID-19 pandemic, two sources told Reuters. 
MHI has approached firms in Aichi Prefecture including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp-affiliated parts maker Toyoda Gosei (T:7282), about transferring dozens of workers for up to three years from January, the sources with knowledge of the plan said. 
They asked not to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to the media.
""We are adjusting workforce levels through secondments, but we don't disclose the details,"" a spokesmen for MHI said. A Toyoda Gosei spokesman said he was unable to immediately comment.
Japan's biggest heavy machinery maker will on Friday release results for the three months ended Sept 30, after posting a 71.3 billion yen ($680 million) operating loss in the first quarter.
Local media reports and sources say MHI may also announce a new business plan that will include freezing development of its SpaceJet regional jet as airlines, including launch customer ANA Holdings (T:9202), rein in costs to cope with a collapse in air travel. 
Encouraged by the Japanese government, MHI started the SpaceJet programme in a bid to become a global commercial plane maker. Technical problems, however, forced it to delay its first delivery to ANA six times from 2013 to the end of March 2022. 
MHI is also a key aircraft parts supplier to commercial aircraft builders  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus SE (PA:AIR), which have also been hurt as airlines struggle to survive.

ANA, Japan's biggest carrier, on Tuesday said it plans to send more than 400 people to work elsewhere after it forecast an operating loss of 505 billion yen in the year to March 31.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The family of late Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) chairman Lee Kun-hee held a funeral ceremony on Wednesday for the patriarch, whose death on Sunday threw into question the control of the chipmaker and the country's largest conglomerate. 
The focus is now on Lee's son Jay Y. Lee, the 52-year-old vice chairman, to see what kind of leadership he will display as he faces serious legal risks from two trials seen stemming from efforts to ensure he succeeded his father. 
After a morning ceremony closed to the media, family members, including Jay Y. Lee, boarded a bus, which left the Samsung (KS:005930) Medical Center, where the funeral services had been held, Yonhap News TV channel showed.
The late Lee's casket, with a white wreath atop, was transported in a black hearse from the hospital to a family burial ground in Suwon, Yonhap news agency reported. 
The route taken passed by sites that held meaning for Lee, including his home in central Seoul and Samsung Electronics' chip-production facilities in Hwaseong near the capital. 
Lee's death raised expectations for stake sales and a potential restructuring of the sprawling business empire, as the family grapples with an anticipated inheritance tax bill of nearly 10 trillion won ($9 billion).
The tasks awaiting Samsung Electronics' new head will include growing the non-memory chip business and expanding its presence in software.
But heir apparent Jay Y. Lee faces a bigger risk from two ongoing trials, which analysts say could land him in jail for a second time.
One trial concerns the 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates that helped Lee assume greater control of Samsung Electronics, and another relates to his role in a bribery scandal, for which he had been jailed for a year.

""Inheritance and corporate governance are issues as well, but the trials, especially the latter case, are the biggest problem. His father's passing may turn public opinion in his favour, but the effect it might have is unclear,"" said Park Ju-gun, head of research firm CEO Score.

(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp 's (O:MSFT) cloud computing business slightly re-accelerated and its Teams messaging and collaboration software won new users, as a pandemic-driven shift to working from home and online learning drove quarterly results ahead of investor targets.
COVID-19 has speeded up a move toward cloud-based computing, helping companies such as Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) cloud unit and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google Cloud. For Microsoft, it has also boosted demand for its Windows operating systems for laptops and its Xbox gaming services as families work, learn and play from home, leading to profit that was about 30% above expectations.
Daily users of its Teams messaging and collaboration software have risen to 115 million from 75 million in April, the company said.
""It was another healthy quarter, with continued demand for remote offerings continuing to power results,"" Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood told Reuters in an interview.
Revenue growth for Azure, the company's flagship cloud computing business, was 48%, up 1 percentage point from the previous quarter and ahead of Wall Street estimates of 43.45%, according to consensus data from Visible Alpha. Hood said the rise in the fiscal first quarter ending in September was driven by ""an increase in larger, long-term Azure contracts.""
On an investor call she forecast ""continued strong growth"" for Azure. 
GRAPHIC: Microsoft Azure revenue growth - https://graphics.reuters.com/MICROSOFT-RESULTS/xegvblbbnvq/chart.png 
Microsoft has shifted to selling many of its products via recurring subscriptions, which investors like because it generates stable revenue flows. The value of Microsoft's future recurring revenue contracts with big business customers was flat from the previous quarter and its proportion of one-time deals rose slightly after two quarters of growth.
Microsoft bundles several sets of software and services such as Office and Azure into a ""commercial cloud"" metric that investors watch closely to gauge the company's progress in selling to large businesses. Microsoft's commercial cloud gross margins - a measure of the profitability of its sales to large businesses - was 71%, compared with 66% a year earlier.
Hood said some of the rise was explained by a change in accounting rules for Microsoft's servers, but the better margins were also driven by sales of lucrative software such as Dynamics 365, which competes with Salesforce.com (N:CRM).
""That Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 38% was better than we thought and quite good,"" Hood told Reuters.
Microsoft said 93% of commercial cloud products were sold as subscriptions, compared with 94% the quarter before. The company's remaining performance obligations - a measure of how much revenue has been booked for the future in sales contracts but not yet formally recognized as revenue - stayed flat at $107 billion in the fiscal first quarter but was up from $86 billion a year prior.
Microsoft said revenue in its ""Intelligent Cloud"" segment rose 20% to $13 billion in the most recent quarter. Analysts had expected revenue of $12.7 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Wednesday on worries about the damage to the region’s economies caused by a second wave of shutdowns to combat the surge in Covid-19 cases.
At 2:00 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 1.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the UK fell 0.8%. 
Europe continues to be hit hard with the second wave of the virus, with many of the region’s countries reporting soaring infection rates, not helped by the onset of cold, damp winter weather.
Restrictions imposed to try and combat the pandemic have had a limited effect to date, prompting fears of more draconian measures.
French President Emmanuel Macron is set to give a televised address on Wednesday evening, with local media reporting that the government is considering imposing a lockdown from midnight on Thursday.
Similarly, the Belgian government will convene on Friday to decide on a potential new national lockdown, while Spain has already announced a state of emergency for six months.
In corporate news,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) will be in focus after the troubled bank returned to quarterly profit, helped by a strong performance from its investment banking arm.
Additionally, Reuters reported that U.S. jeweler Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) and French luxury goods giant LVMH (PA:LVMH) are in talks to settle their dispute over a $16 billion takeover at a price slightly lower than that initially agreed.
Oil prices slumped Wednesday, as a jump in U.S. crude stocks, coupled with the potential damage to demand from the incessant increase in Covid-19 cases, raised worries about a supply glut.
Data from the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday showed a build of 4.577 million barrels for the week ending Oct. 23, more than the 1.2 million barrels expected, while gasoline inventories also rose. Government data are expected later Wednesday.
Oil had rallied on Tuesday, with the Brent contract climbing nearly 2% and the WTI version 2.6%, after a significant portion of U.S. Gulf output was shuttered ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Zeta, which is expected to make landfall in Louisiana later Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 2.6% lower at $38.55 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.6% to $40.95. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,908.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1775.

647,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 02:36AM ET</span>","JPMorgan Says Trump Win Could Spur U.S. Stocks, Dent Asia Assets","(Bloomberg) -- A surprise election victory by President Donald Trump next week could benefit U.S. equities and the dollar while hampering Asian assets, according to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.
That’s based on market moves after Trump unexpectedly won the vote in 2016, according to strategists including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. Democrat nominee Joe Biden is currently leading in polls but Wall Street firms have recently cautioned against assuming he will beat Trump.
The JPMorgan strategists said it’s reasonable to expect an echo of the fallout from four years ago if Trump wins, such as a favorable market reaction for American equities compared with non-U.S. stocks, a decline in Asian currencies and the underperformance of Asian shares relative to global peers. They also see the potential for a rise in a trade-weighted gauge of the dollar.
“Asian assets are likely to be sensitive to a continued Trump Presidency as it would likely mean further U.S./China conflict on trade, technology and investments,” the strategists wrote.
While polls and prediction markets give Biden the edge, analysts also remember how Trump shocked many pundits and markets by defeating then-favorite Hillary Clinton in 2016. Some investors have positioned not just for a Biden victory, but also a so-called “Blue Wave” where Democrats take control of the Senate while retaining the House of Representatives.
Other assets might break away from the patterns seen in 2016. For instance, there’s less scope for gold to drop this time around, JPMorgan said.
There might be “some pressure for further steepening” and increases in 10-year yields though not of the same magnitude as four years ago, when markets were starting to price in the possibility of significant deficit-financed tax cuts, the strategists said.
Infrastructure initiatives haven’t been a focus area for the Trump campaign, suggesting less scope for a rally in copper compared to four years ago, they said.

(N:AES) will sign a deal with PetroVietnam Gas (HM:GAS) to develop a $2.8 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal and a power plant in Vietnam, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday.
""Vietnam has given the green light to AES Corp. (N:AES), a company based in Virginia, to go forward with the project,"" Pompeo said at a virtual Indo-Pacific Business Forum. 
The deal will open the door for the import of billions of dollars worth of U.S. LNG to Vietnam each year, Pompeo said, describing it as a ""real win-win situation"".
The forum, also attended by his Vietnamese counterpart Pham Binh Minh, comes as the United States ramps up its rhetoric against the regional influence of Chinese state firms. 
""American companies adhere to the rule of law and transparency and have very high standards of quality for their products,"" Pompeo said. ""I say that because that's quite a contrast with the Chinese state-backed companies."" 
Vietnam is building numerous LNG-to-power plants, with the first to be operational by 2023, an ambitious move that could see LNG become a major energy source for its fast-growing economy.
Much of that will be imported from the United States, which wants to narrow its trade deficit with Vietnam, which widened to $44.3 billion in the first nine months of this year from $33.96 billion in the same period of 2019. 

Also at Wednesday's forum, Delta Offshore Energy formalised an earlier announced plan for a $3 billion agreement with Bechtel Corp.,  General Electric  (N:GE) and McDermott  for the development of a 3.2-gigawatt LNG power plant in Bac Lieu province, the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Wednesday morning. They continued Tuesday’s losses as worries over the economic impact of the ever-rising number of COVID-19 cases continues to dampen investor sentiment.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.24% by 11:18 PM ET (3:18 AM GMT). The Bank of Japan will hand down its monetary policy on Thursday, with the European Central Bank also due to announce its policies on the same day.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.03%. President Jae In Moon  declared that COVID-19 has been contained in the country, and was seeking a budget increase to aid the recovery of the COVID-19 battered economy. The Consumer Confidence index increased to 91.6 in October, up from the previous month's 79.4 reading.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.31%, boosted by the higher-than-expected rise of the country’s Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI rose 1.6% quarter-on-quarter during the previous quarter, higher than the 1.5% predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com, and remained unchanged at 0.7% year-on-year. The Reserve Bank of Australia is due to meet on Nov. 3, after which it is widely expected to announce lower interest rates and increased government debt purchases.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.46%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.11%, while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.03%, reversing some earlier losses. China’s manufacturing and non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indexes could send out mixed signals about the country’s economic recovery from COVID-19. Meanwhile, the Central Committee continues its fifth plenum to map the country’ economic path for the next five years. The plenum will run through Oct. 29.
As the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election draw closer, the uncertainty over whether Democrat Joe Biden will translate his lead over incumbent president Donald Trump into a victory, and whether Congress will pass the latest stimulus measures, is contributing to continued volatility in the market. U.S. stocks slid after Trump admitted that the measures would likely be passed after the election.
“Markets had a risk-off tone as U.S. consumer confidence data disappointed, COVID-19 cases continue to rise, and the chances of a fiscal deal before the U.S. election faded,” ANZ analysts said in a note.
The surging second wave of COVID-19 cases in Europe and the U.S, as well as the economic impact, also continues to dampen investor sentiment. French president Emmanuel Macron will give a televised address later in the day, where he is expected to announce the re-imposition of a national lockdown starting Thursday. France recorded the highest number of COVID-19 deaths since April and Italy recorded a record number of cases.
“COVID-19 case numbers and hospitalizations continue to rise … these will continue to be closely watched as investors gauge the likelihood of more stringent mitigation measures,” StoneX global market strategist Yousef Abbasi told Bloomberg.
On the data side, the U.S.’ Conference Board (CB) Consumer Confidence index, released on Tuesday, fell to 100.9 in October. The reading was lower than the 102 predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and lower than the previous month’s 101.3 figure. Investors now await further data, including the third-quarter GDP, due to be released on Thursday."

The Justice Department is reviewing the proposed transaction to determine if it is in violation of antitrust law.
The Wall Street Journal had reported on Tuesday that the department could decide soon whether it will sue to block the deal.
The government on Tuesday filed a petition with a U.S. district court in Massachusetts, asking it to require consulting firm Bain & Co to turn over documents wanted as part of the antitrust review, including some that discuss Visa’s strategies around pricing and competition with other debit card networks.
The department said in a statement that Bain was ""asserting unsupported claims of privilege over the documents."" Bain did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Visa and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment regarding the newspaper report. Plaid declined to comment about the report.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 08:05PM ET</span>",Bank loans scrutinized for harm to wildlife as well as climate,"By Matthew Green
LONDON (Reuters) - Campaigners called on Wednesday for global banks to stop financing industrial activities driving animal and plant species toward extinction, after a report ranked 50 lenders involved in sectors that pose the greatest threat to wildlife.
While European and U.S. banks have faced years of pressure from regulators or environmental groups to act on climate change, their role in financing economic activities that destroy biodiversity is also coming under growing scrutiny.
Portfolio.earth, a network of researchers that published the ""Bankrolling Extinction"" report https://portfolio.earth/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Launching-on-28th-Oct.pdf, said none of the lenders had adequate systems to limit the impact of their loans on the web of animal and plant life that supports human well-being. 
""Banks are starting to realize that if they invest in sectors that cause climate change, that will hurt their returns,"" Liz Gallagher, director of portfolio.earth, told Reuters. ""Banks need to understand that the same holds true for destroying biodiversity."" 
The report found that in 2019, the 50 banks provided loans and underwriting of more than $2.6 trillion to sectors such as industrial farming and fishing, fossil fuels and infrastructure that scientists say are big drivers of biodiversity loss.
Kai Chan, an environmental scientist at the University of British Columbia, and a leading author of a global study published last year that found a million species are at imminent risk of extinction, endorsed the findings. 
""Imagine a world in which projects can only raise capital when they have demonstrated that they will contribute meaningfully and positively to restoring the planet's bounty and a safe climate for all? That's the future this report envisions and builds toward,"" he said.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), identified among the 10 biggest lenders, declined to comment, referring Reuters to existing sustainability pledges. BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), also ranked highly, said the authors had not contacted it or shared their methodology so it could not comment.
HSBC, also ranked in the top 10, pointed out that it had teamed up in August with climate change advisory firm Pollination Group to create an asset management venture focused on ""natural capital"", which seeks to put a value on resources such as water, soil and air to help to protect the environment.
""Climate and nature are intricately linked, and the financial services industry can help customers transform their businesses to low carbon and also enable credible investments that preserve and protect nature and biodiversity,"" said Daniel Klier, global head of sustainable finance at HSBC.
Banks also pointed to their support for various biodiversity initiatives, such as a new Task Force on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures https://tnfd.info designed to boost transparency among companies and the finance sector, but some investors want more.
The report emphasised the risks associated with lending to industrial agriculture, which is a major cause of biodiversity loss, particularly when tropical forests in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) basin or Asia are cleared to grow commercial crops. 

""This report from portfolio.earth confirms what our research also shows, that banks globally still need to step up their game and develop an approach to protect biodiversity,"" Peter van der Werf, senior engagement specialist at Netherlands-based asset manager Robeco, told Reuters.

653,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 08:00PM ET</span>",U.S. approves use of Bayer weed killer for five years,"By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Tuesday it will allow farmers to spray crops with weed killers based on the chemical dicamba that are sold by  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) and other companies, after a U.S. appeals court blocked sales in June.
The decision is a boost for Bayer (OTC:BAYRY), which has been hammered by lawsuits over various chemicals in the United States since acquiring seed company  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018. Critics said it was another example of the Trump administration favoring business interests over regulations, just a week before the presidential election. 
The EPA re-approved for five years Bayer's XtendiMax, a popular dicamba-based herbicide that is sprayed on soybeans and cotton genetically engineered to resist it. It is known to drift away and damage other crops that are not resistant to it. 
The EPA will implement new restrictions on dicamba products that will ""take care of the drift issues that we have witnessed in the past,"" Administrator Andrew Wheeler told reporters on a call.
The agency also re-approved BASF SE's (DE:BASFn) dicamba herbicide Engenia and extended an approval for Syngenta's Tavium.
Environmental groups have sought a ban on dicamba products, arguing they harm nearby plants and wildlife. 
A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed this summer and ruled the EPA had substantially understated the risks related to the use of dicamba. Its ruling also blocked sales of Engenia and  Corteva  Agriscience's (N:CTVA) FeXapan.
The EPA's decision invalidates the court's ruling, experts said. 
""Rather than evaluating the significant costs of dicamba drift as the 9th Circuit told them the law required, EPA rushed re-approval as a political prop just before the election,"" said George Kimbrell, legal director at the Center for Food Safety. 
Bayer and farm groups including the American Soybean Association and the American Farm Bureau praised the EPA's decision. 
About 60% of the U.S. soybean crop this year was estimated to be seeded with Bayer's Xtend soybeans, according to Bayer. They need to be sprayed with the herbicide to ward off weeds that have developed a tolerance for another chemical, glyphosate.
BASF said the need for its Engenia is greater than ever due to increased weed resistance to glyphosate. Syngenta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Corteva said it is focused on selling rival Enlist E3 soybeans seeds, which resist chemicals aside from dicamba.
The EPA said it would impose a June 30 deadline for farmers to spray dicamba on soybeans and a July 30 deadline for its use on cotton.

Farmers will not be able to spray dicamba within 240 feet to 310 feet (73 metres to 94 metres) of areas where certain species are located. The EPA will also require that users mix dicamba with another product, known as a ""pH-buffering agent,"" to prevent it from drifting away.

The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year, EQT said in a statement on Tuesday. Chevron has been trying to unload its Appalachian gas holdings since late 2019, when it recorded an $11 billion writedown for that asset and others amid a swelling domestic gas glut and cratering prices for the furnace and power-plant fuel.
The acquisition is the latest in a string of recent deals where shale drillers are seeking to add scale to cope with a plunge in commodity prices that has left much of the industry unprofitable.
“This acquisition is a natural bolt-on extension of EQT’s dominant position in the core of the southwest Marcellus and supplements our already impressive asset base,” EQT Chief Executive Officer Toby Rice said in the statement.
The Chevron assets include about 100 work-in-progress wells, with a net production capacity of 450 million cubic feet a day, EQT said. It will also give the shale explorer a 31% ownership interest in pipeline company Laurel Mountain Midstream.
EQT indicated it may fund the deal with cash on hand, a revolving credit facility or a separately disclosed issuance of up to 23 million common shares. EQT fell 4% to $15.51 at 4:37 p.m. Eastern time in after-hours trading. Chevron was little changed.
EQT has also made a proposal to acquire rival CNX Resoures Corp., people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News last week. No final decision had been made and EQT could opt to not proceed with a potential deal, they said.
CNX fell 1.6% after the arrangement with Chevron was announced.
EQT already is the largest supplier of U.S. gas, producing 44% more than its nearest competitor,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)., according to figures compiled by the Natural Gas Supply Association. EQT pumped about 4 billion cubic feet a day as of the first quarter.

655,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 05:45PM ET</span>",Tyson Foods workers to replace some federal inspectors at U.S. beef plant,"By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Tyson Foods  (N:TSN) said on Tuesday it plans in January to replace more than a dozen federal inspectors at a large Kansas beef plant with company employees, after getting a U.S. government waiver.
Tyson said the changes would improve food safety and efficiency, though some activists worried they could result in less oversight.
The country's highest-selling meat supplier asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in March 2019 for a waiver from inspection requirements at its plant in Holcomb, Kansas. Other companies have made similar changes at chicken and pork plants.
The USDA granted the waiver in March 2020, allowing Tyson workers instead of government inspectors to check cattle carcasses for blood clots, bruises or signs of disease before the animals are butchered, company executives said.
The pandemic delayed the changes, but Tyson will now hire 15 people per shift to check carcasses, said the company, which worked with Iowa State University to develop training materials for workers.
The number of USDA inspectors at the plant will drop to nine per shift from 17, the agency said in a statement to Reuters. The number of highly trained government employees who do more complex work like monitoring animal welfare or meat testing will increase to seven per shift from two, according to USDA.
Tyson aims to eventually use cameras and computer imaging to evaluate the carcasses, said Jennifer Williams (NYSE:WMB), vice president of food safety.
""This is a way to leverage new technology and plant employees to implement these steps, that will free up some inspectors to focus on improving public health, animal welfare and food safety,"" said James Roth, director of Iowa State's Center for Food Security and Public Health.
Meatpackers have accelerated automation after COVID-19 infected thousands of slaughterhouse employees this spring. USDA inspectors were also infected. 
Activists said the inspection changes were a move to deregulate the industry. 

""It's really problematic,"" said Zach Corrigan, a Food & Water Watch senior staff attorney.

CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The two largest U.S. flight attendant unions, representing more than 75,000 workers, endorsed Democratic candidate Joe Biden on Tuesday ahead of the U.S. presidential election next week.
The unions have been pressing Congress and Republican President Donald Trump to back $25 billion in additional payroll assistance to prevent 32,000 airline furloughs.
The Association of Professional Flight Attendants, representing the 27,000 American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) flight attendants, and the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA that represents about 50,000 workers at 20 airlines, said in separate statements they were endorsing Biden. 
Asked about the timing of the endorsement, AFA-CWA International President Sara Nelson said: ""The complete and total failure of this president on any plan around coronavirus, putting our lives in danger and now putting tens of thousands of us out of work with no hope for fixing that gives us the space to do what we normally would be doing this time of year.""
Trump campaign spokesman Ken Farnaso said Biden's ""threats to re-close the economy"" and said the Democrat's policies would ""keep our country grounded and would be the final nail in the coffin for the American travel and hospitality industries.""
Biden said this week that he would issue a mandate requiring the use of face coverings in all interstate transportation like airline flights, while the Trump administration has repeatedly rejected mandates.
“Right now there's no plan. The only plan is politicizing things like masks which put the people who I represent in more danger not only in terms of their lives, their safety at work, but also the longevity of our industry and our industry's ability to even survive,"" Nelson said.
Airlines and unions had urged action on the new bailout before the prior $25 billion in payroll assistance expired on Sept. 30.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows had said Trump was weighing executive action to avoid massive layoffs at airlines if Congress failed to act, but the White House did not act.
On Oct. 2, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked airlines to halt furloughs, saying a long-awaited deal to provide $25 billion to airlines was “imminent."" 
That deal did not materialize.

Even after the White House endorsed a stand-alone measure to assist airline workers, congressional Republicans and Democrats could not reach agreement on a measure.

Shares declined as much as 3.9% to their lowest since June 2009, dipping further than the 24-firm KBW Bank Index. Scharf, who took over last October, has been reviewing each of the firm’s businesses and is preparing to lay out his turnaround plan for the embattled lender. He’s said he would provide more information to investors in January.
Scharf has promised a simpler structure, and is examining sales of units including the corporate-trust business, the student-lending portfolio and the asset manager. The bank has also embarked on a job-cutting initiative that could ultimately result in workforce reductions numbering in the tens of thousands.
Read More on Wells Fargo:
Wells Fargo, still under a Federal Reserve-imposed asset cap, has been the worst-performing company in the KBW Bank Index this year, with shares down more than 59%. The Fed limit has kept the bank from offsetting low rates with balance-sheet growth the way many rivals have. A Joe Biden win in the U.S. presidential election next week could prolong that timeline, according to Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg.
“We expect Wells Fargo to push the Federal Reserve to release it from the asset cap before Biden can replace top Fed officials in late 2021 and early 2022,” Seiberg wrote in a note. “We see that as an uphill fight, which is why the asset cap could stay in place into 2023.”

Earlier this month, Reuters reported the company was aiming to raise $3 billion in its IPO, which could give it a valuation of more than $30 billion, and that it was targeting a listing before the end of the year.
The push to go public and the growth in its potential valuation underscores Airbnb's dramatic recovery from earlier this year, when it secured emergency funding from investors and the outlook for the travel industry was uncertain.
San Francisco-based Airbnb, which has benefited as travelers shy away from larger hotels and instead prefer to drive to local vacation rentals, said in July that customers had booked more than 1 million nights in a single day for the first time since March 3.
Airbnb did not give a timeline for when it may complete its IPO. The company had filed confidentially for an IPO with U.S. regulators in August. (https://refini.tv/3mqUe97)
Reuters reported earlier this year that billionaire investor William Ackman had approached Airbnb about going public through a reverse merger with his blank-check company but that Airbnb was prioritizing going public through a traditional IPO.

Investing.com -- The Dow and the S&P 500 slipped while Nasdaq rose thanks to tech, the usual suspect.  
It's all about Covid-19 infections growing in the U.S. and Europe, while stimulus talks are done until after the Nov. 3 election. Consumers are also failing to do their part, with the Conference Board saying the index of consumer confidence slipped to a reading of 100.9 this month from 101.3 in September, missing economists' forecast for a reading of 102.  
Industrials and financials led the selling as banks and airlines, respectively, extended losses from a day earlier amid concerns parts of the U.S. may see reopening measures rolled back.  
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported profit that easily beat estimates after the market close. The company reported earnings per share of $1.82 on revenue of $37.2 billion. That compares to estimates for EPS of $1.54 on revenue of $35.76 billion. Let's see how investors take that news tomorrow morning.
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. Earnings galore in the morning
We hope you like corporate results, because Wednesday serves up a ton. Highlights before the market opens include pandemic standout  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS)., up more than 40% so far this year,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co., Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA)., Anthem Inc. and  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN). We'll also get a check on the health of beleaguered plane maker Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.
2. And then some more earnings in the afternoon
The earnings deluge continues post-market. Speaking of beleaguered, we'll hear from struggling carmaker Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. Like buying stuff online? eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY)., Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) Inc., and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc. are all reporting.  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V). is up, as is remdesivir maker  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD).
3. Tech on the Hill
The CEOs of tech titans Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Twitter are expected to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee. The hearing will focus on their liability protections for user content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. But don't be surprised if the New York Post's Hunter Biden stories come up. This hearing was scheduled before Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey agreed to appear before the Judiciary Committee to discuss that kerfuffle.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks on Wall Street closed little changed on Tuesday, with the Dow and S&P 500 dipping on disappointing earnings and little hope for a U.S. coronavirus stimulus before Election Day, though the Nasdaq rose ahead of big technology company results.
Investor sentiment sagged after the White House said a deal on COVID-19 relief could come in ""weeks,"" meaning a deal is unlikely before the Nov. 3 election.
But the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) firmed in the run-up to its results after the closing bell, and the technology heavyweights supported the S&P500.
Shares of drugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co fell after quarterly profits took a hit from increased costs to develop a COVID-19 treatment and after a trial of its antibody therapy failed to show a benefit in hospitalized patients.
""This pullback that we've seen is a little bit more of a risk-off move as an additional stimulus package now has been pushed aside,"" Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed income strategy at WisdomTree Investments (NASDAQ:WETF), said. ""That led to some disappointment.""
On Monday, the three major U.S. stock indexes posted their biggest declines in about four weeks on a record number of new coronavirus cases in the United States and some European countries, and as the elusive stimulus rattled investors.
Sectors sensitive to economic growth took a hit, with both the S&P 500 banks index and the S&P energy sector closing lower.
Meanwhile, Wall Street's fear gauge hovered at its highest level since early September on election jitters. 
Democratic challenger Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump in nationwide polls but the race is much tighter in battleground states which should determine the outcome.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 221.37 points, or 0.8%, to 27,464.01, the S&P 500 lost 10.23 points, or 0.30%, to 3,390.74 and the Nasdaq Composite added 72.41 points, or 0.64%, to 11,431.35.
The Nasdaq rose in anticipation of results later this week from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). The tech bellwethers together account for about a fifth of the S&P 500's total value.
The NYSE FANG+TM Index rose about 1.69%.
Analysts expect the tech sector to post a 0.4% increase in third-quarter earnings from a year earlier, while overall S&P 500 profit is forecast to fall 16.2%, according to Refinitiv data.
Concerns over a rise in U.S. coronavirus cases are weighing on the market but the technology sector seems to be the least exposed, said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.
""A focus on big technology companies may move this market to rally despite the problems the virus is creating,"" he said.
Semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc fell as it agreed to buy  Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX) in a $35 billion all-stock deal. Xilinx shares soared, the largest gainer on the Nasdaq 100, while those of AMD-rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell.

Insurer American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) gained after its board named Peter Zaffino as chief executive officer and approved a plan to separate the life and retirement business from the rest of the company.

664,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 04:09PM ET</span>",State Parent of BMW’s China Partner on Brink of Bond Default,"(Bloomberg) -- A Chinese automaker linked to BMW AG is looking increasingly in danger of a default, after missing a domestic bond repayment and seeing its debt sold off in recent days.
With some of its yuan notes yielding above 150%, investors appear to have priced in a strong possibility of an ultimate failure by state-run Brilliance Auto Group Holdings Co. to honor a bond that came due Friday.
What’s happening:
Parent of BMW’s joint venture partner in China, Brilliance Auto failed to repay its 5.3% three-year 1 billion yuan ($149 million) bond on time and said it is trying to raise funds and seeking a solution with investors. The borrower has a 30-day grace period to make good on the debt.
Investors don’t look optimistic. The automaker’s 5.4% bond due 2023 has plunged by almost 40% to 36.1 yuan since the latest round of selloff began a week ago. Its 6.2% bond due 2022 tumbled by about 83% on Tuesday to 10.3 yuan, according to Bloomberg-compiled prices. At least two of its notes carry implied yields of more than 150%.
Shares of its Hong Kong-listed unit Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd., which manufactures vehicles with BMW via a joint venture in China, have fallen 5.2% since Thursday.
Why does it matter:
Concerns have grown about the financial health of Brilliance Auto since its Hong Kong-listed unit agreed two years ago to give up control over its joint venture with BMW by 2022. The China-based joint venture has been a crucial source of earnings for the group.
Worries about a default started intensifying in August when some banks set up a creditor committee to coordinate claims on Brilliance Auto’s debt. Brilliance Auto has 17.2 billion yuan in outstanding bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
While it hails from the rust belt northeastern province of Liaoning that hosts some of China’s bleeding state-run firms, the automaker’s debt woes appear isolated in nature and threaten limited contagion.
What’s the company:
Brilliance Auto’s history dates back to 1949 when the People’s Republic of China was founded. It is one of the largest state-owned firms in the northeastern province, employing 47,000 people. It has four publicly-listed companies in Hong Kong and Shanghai, and about 160 units either wholly or partially owned, according to information on its official website.
In the first half of 2020, Brilliance Auto suffered a loss of 196 million yuan, according to its interim financial report. It generated 70 million yuan net profit attributable to shareholders in the same period a year ago. Cash from operations fell 16.75% to 4.96 billion yuan in the first half, while that from investing activities dropped by 123.63% to a negative 4.6 billion yuan.
What does the company say:
The automaker said in a statement dated Oct. 23 that it is faced with tight liquidity and funding pressure, adding there are “significant uncertainties” over its ability to raise sufficient funds in time.
Calls to Brilliance Auto’s information disclosure office went unanswered.
What do ratings agencies say:
Chinese credit rating firm Golden Credit Rating International Co. has twice cut Brilliance Auto’s rating in recent weeks. It now rates the firm BBB, down from AA+, citing a lack of debt repayment funding arrangements and large refinancing pressure.
In a report released in June, Golden Credit said Brilliance Auto has low profitability and relies heavily on its joint venture with BMW. In addition, sales from the joint venture are expected to fall this year with the pandemic crimping demand, it said.
What are traders watching next:
Investors are now more focused on Brilliance Auto’s effort to raise cash for its bond repayment and whether it will be able to produce a debt workout plan with its major lenders on the creditor committee. All eyes are also on the Liaoning authorities who have so far remained mum on their stance over the troubled state firm.

Investing.com – The Dow slipped Tuesday, led by a slump industrial heavyweights like  Caterpillar  and 3M following quarterly results and renewed concerns about the impact of a surge in Covid-19 infections on the economy. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.80%, or 222 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.30%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.64%.
Covid-19 infections in the U.S. surged above 8.7 million on Tuesday, with more than 20 states reporting record numbers of new cases.
The U.S. has averaged at least 71,000 new cases of the coronavirus over the last seven days, according to The New York Times, the highest seven-day number since the start of the outbreak.
The surge comes as Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) said its coronavirus antibody drug showed no improvement in hospitalized patients who had an advanced stage of the disease, sending its shares down 7%. The drug maker added, however, it would continue to explore the efficacy of its antibody drug in patients at an early stage of disease progression.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), another drug maker in the race to find a vaccine, fell 1% as weaker-than-expected third-quarter sales and news that results from its Covid-19 vaccine trial is unlikely to be released before the U.S. election weighed on sentiment. 
Fears over the pace of the economic recovery were exacerbated by signs the strength of the consumer is beginning to wane at a time when hopes of pre-election stimulus suffered a blow.
The Conference Board said the index of consumer confidence slipped to a reading of 100.9 this month from 101.3 in September, missing economists forecast for a reading of 102.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday adjourned the Senate until Nov. 9, all but ending hopes for a deal on stimulus before the U.S. election on Nov. 3.
Financials pressured the broader market as banks continued to slip amid concerns parts of the U.S. may see reopening measures rolled back.
As well as weakness in airlines, a fall in major Dow components like 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), pushed industrials further into the red. Both industrial stalwarts fail to provide guidance, though 3M did forecast sales to be flat to up low single digits in October. 
Tech, however, held up firm, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) up more 1% ahead of its quarterly results after the closing bell. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are also expected to report later this week.

VANCOUVER/TORONTO (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd lawyers resumed witness testimony in a Vancouver court on Tuesday, pushing a Canadian federal police officer to explain why the border security officials intercepted the company's Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou before the federal police arrested her.
Huawei's legal team took the floor on the second day of the hearings in the British Columbia Supreme Court, where Meng is fighting her extradition case to the United States.
The five days of scheduled hearings will focus on allegations by her lawyers of abuses of process committed by Canadian and U.S. authorities during her arrest in December 2018 at the Vancouver International Airport.
Meng, 48, is facing charges in the United States of bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei's [HWT.UL] business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to break U.S. sanction laws.
She has claimed innocence but remains under house arrest in her Vancouver home, located in an upscale neighborhood of the Pacific coastal city, for the duration of the trial.
Meng was questioned for three hours by Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers without any legal representation and her electronic devices were seized before RCMP officials arrested her, according to court documents.
On Tuesday, Meng's lawyer Richard Peck went over a series of text messages, and emails that Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Constable Winston Yep sent and received before arresting Meng, as well as the notes Yep took throughout the day in his notebook.
Specifically, he presented Yep with an email where the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said to the RCMP that the ""best way to ensure CBSA to interject"" is to know Meng's name and flight details ahead of her arrival.
Meng's lawyers have previously alleged that Canadian authorities improperly communicated with their U.S. counterparts during her arrest, including sharing identifying details about her electronic devices.
Canada has denied this and provided affidavits from members of RCMP who were involved in Meng's arrest.
Meng arrived in court on Tuesday, accompanied by her translator. She spoke with Chinese consular officials before seating herself in the courtroom.
Her lawyers' questions build on themes from Monday, when prosecutors for the Canadian government questioned Yep about how the decision was made to allow the CBSA to intercept Meng before the RCMP arrested her.
Meng's lawyers have argued that Canadian and American authorities made this decision because CBSA officers have special privileges in searching and investigating individuals crossing Canada's borders.
They strove on Monday to highlight lapses of due process during Meng's arrest, including Yep's failure to promptly complete a chronological account of the extradition as required by Canadian extradition law.
Although Yep, under Peck's questioning, acknowledged it was considered ""a possibility"" for the RCMP to arrest Meng while her plane was on the tarmac, he insisted the police did not want to intrude on the CBSA's jurisdiction.
""It could have been just as easy for you to arrest her as soon as she got off the plane, hand her over to the CBSA...then take her,"" Peck said. ""That way she'd have her rights.""
Meng's arrest triggered an ongoing chill in diplomatic relations between Ottawa and Beijing. Soon after her detention, China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig on espionage charges in what was widely seen as retaliation.

The trial is scheduled to wrap up in April 2021, although the potential for appeals means the case could drag on for years through the Canadian justice system.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Technology stocks, which have surged for months during the pandemic, likely hit their top last month, hedge fund investor David Einhorn wrote on Tuesday, adding that he's prepared for a drop by betting against more names, including second-tier companies and ones that just listed their stock.
Einhorn, who runs Greenlight Capital, wrote in a letter ""we are in the midst of an enormous tech bubble,"" but noted ""September 2, 2020 was the top and the bubble has already popped."" Reuters saw a copy of the letter.
Einhorn said he's ""adjusted"" his portfolio's short-book with bets that stock prices will fall by ""adding a fresh bubble basket"" of mostly second-tier companies and ""recent IPOs trading at remarkable valuations.""
Einhorn, who made a timely call against Lehman Brothers just months before the bank collapsed, said he prematurely identified what he thought was a bubble in 2016. He announced his first bubble basket -- including bets against high flyers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) -- years ago. Now, he says, ""there is a consensus that there is a bubble.""
The signs are clear, Einhorn wrote, citing the race to list companies publicly, high volumes in speculative trading instruments and a ""parabolic ascent toward a top.""
One of the strangest signs may be a recent job application Einhorn said he had received via email from a from a 13-year old who says he quadrupled his money since February.
Einhorn did not identify the stocks he's betting against.
He does expect some stocks to keep climbing and said he added new names to the portfolio: B2B IT services company Synnex, software company NCR (NYSE:NCR) and sensor maker ams AG.

672,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chevron to lay off about 25% of Noble Energy employees after merger,"By Shariq Khan and Jennifer Hiller
(Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) will lay off about 25% of  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL)'s employees who joined the oil major after its $4.1 billion purchase of the smaller rival earlier this month, the company told Reuters on Tuesday.
A collapse in crude oil prices has forced most oil and gas producers to drastically cut costs by laying off thousands of employees and cutting down on drilling. For many companies, consolidation with larger players at low or no premiums is becoming the only option to survive.
The job cuts, which are on top of Chevron's plan to reduce 10%-15% of its own workforce, come after the company promised to lower its operating expenses by $1 billion this year to cope with the downturn.
Chevron's 10%-15% cuts would imply a reduction of between 4,500 and 6,750 jobs, while job cuts at Noble (OTC:NEBLQ) will reduce the total workforce by roughly another 570 positions.
Most of the cuts will take place this year, Chevron said in an email.
Chevron's purchase of Noble boosted its investments in U.S. shale patches of Colorado and the Permian basin and gave the company a foothold in Israel through Noble's flagship Leviathan project, the largest natural gas field in the eastern Mediterranean.
The company, which took a $1 billion charge earlier this year to cover severance payments, has also been in the process of asking employees worldwide to reapply for their positions as part of a cost-cutting program, Reuters reported this month.
As part of the plan, Chevron also plans to lay off more than 50 employees starting Dec. 14 in both its Bakersfield production unit and the El Segundo refinery, according to a notice the company sent to the state of California.
About 700 employees will lose jobs in Houston starting this month, according to a filing with the Texas state.
Chevron had begun streamlining its operations at the end of 2019 when investor pressure was mounting on oil producers over their abysmal returns.

Reuters also reported exclusively on Tuesday that  Cenovus Energy  Inc (TO:CVE) plans to cut 20% to 25% of its workforce after it acquires  Husky Energy Inc  (TO:HSE).

673,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 01:15PM ET</span>",Tiffany and LVMH could patch things up with cut-price deal,"By Greg Roumeliotis
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co and French luxury goods giant LVMH are in talks to settle their dispute over a $16 billion takeover at a price slightly lower than that initially agreed, sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The negotiations were based on a price in the range of $131-$134 for each Tiffany share, against the $135 price when the deal was first agreed last November.
An agreement at the bottom of that range would save LVMH, led by billionaire businessman Bernard Arnault, about $480 million on the initial $16.2 billion purchase price. 
The initial deal ran into trouble last month when the French group said it could no longer complete the transaction by the Nov. 24 deadline.
It cited a French political intervention preventing it from doing so, but also what it described as the jeweller's ""dismal"" performance during the coronavirus crisis.
The two sides are facing off in a Delaware court, with Tiffany seeking to force LVMH to honour the deal. The case is due to be heard in early January.
CNBC earlier reported that the two parties were in indirect talks to settle the dispute.
Both LVMH and Tiffany did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Tiffany shares rose almost 5% to $128.78 on Tuesday after reports of a potential end to the dispute.
Louis Vuitton owner LVMH agreed last year to buy Tiffany in its biggest acquisition yet, betting it could restore the U.S. jeweller's lustre by investing in stores and new collections.
The deal was designed to boost LVMH's smallest business, the jewellery and watch division that is already home to Bulgari and Tag Heuer, help it to expand in one of the fastest-growing industry sections and strengthen its U.S. presence.
New York-based Tiffany, founded in 1837 and known for its signature pale blue boxes, retains a resonance as the go-to purveyor of engagement rings that only a handful of rivals can match.
Tiffany also said on Monday that it had received the nod from the European Commission for the deal's completion, thus clearing all regulatory hurdles.

Investing.com -- Online education companies are bringing home the bacon, but they are not all created equal in the eyes of investors.
K12 (NYSE:LRN) jumped 7% after reporting sales rose 44% in the first fiscal quarter to $371 million, compared to the estimated $363 million. Profit of 31 cents per share compared to the expected loss of 30 cents per share. Total enrollment topped 195,000, up 57% for a fifth consecutive year of growth. 
Meanwhile, Chegg (NYSE:CHGG) fell 10% after reporting third quarter earnings per share of 17 cents versus the expected 10 cents on sales of $154 million compared to the estimated $144 million. It also raised its guidance again, expecting fourth quarter sales of $188 million to $190 million and 2020 full year revenue of between $626 million and $628 million. 
Revenue for Chegg in 2021 is expected at about $775 million -- and apparently that wasn't enough to satisfy investors, according to Needham. 
""While investors may feel the urge to nitpick at the initial FY21 guide, we believe it represents a strong initial outlook off a difficult topline comp,"" Needham analyst Ryan MacDonald said in a note. 
Nonetheless, he, among other analysts, reiterated a buy rating on Chegg and a $100 price target, according to StreetInsider. Chegg sales rose 64% year-over-year and subscribers jumped to 3.7 million, up 69% from a year earlier.  
Both Chegg and K12 are invested in skills-based learning, with Chegg having recently bought Thinkful, a coding bootcamp.
""There has always been a need to connect academic to professional pathways and we believe this moment in time will create a major acceleration of that trend,"" said Chegg Chief Executive Officer Dan Rosensweig.    
K12's career learning segment that focuses on skill development for middle and high school learners more than doubled to $48.8 million. Adult learners, a first time segment, came in at $8.3 million.  The general education segment, which focuses on core subjects in kindergarten through grade 12, grew 34% to $313.8 million. 
 K12 forecast revenue from $358 million to $366 million for the fiscal second quarter, and adjusted operating income of between $42 million and $45 million. For the full fiscal year, the company provided guidance of sales between $1.45 billion and $1.47 billion. Adjusted operating income should be in the range of $120 million and $130 million.

(Reuters) - Drugmaker  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) said on Tuesday it does not yet have data from the late-stage trial of the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with Germany's BioNTech SE (F:22UAy), and provided a timeline that makes its release unlikely ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election.Pfizer said there had not yet been enough infections in the 44,000-volunteer trial to trigger an analysis of whether or not the vaccine works. An independent panel will conduct the first analysis when it reaches 32 infections.
Chief Executive Albert Bourla said after it has enough data for the analysis, it typically takes 5 to 7 days before the company can publicly release the data, meaning it is likely to happen after the election.
U.S. President Donald Trump had said a vaccine could be available before the Nov. 3 election, but in recent weeks his administration has emphasized that one will be ready this year.
Bourla has previously said the company could release data on whether or not the vaccine works as early as this month. 
""For us, the election is an artificial milestone,"" Bourla said on a conference call for the company's earnings. ""This is going to be not a Republican vaccine or a Democrat vaccine. It will be a vaccine for the citizens of the world.""
Pfizer shares were flat at $37.92.
Pfizer hopes to be the first U.S. drugmaker to unveil successful data from a late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trial, ahead of rival  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA). Pfizer and BioNTech launched their phase 3 study in late July.
The data monitoring board is scheduled to make its first assessment of the vaccine's performance after 32 participants in the trial become infected with the novel coronavirus. 
Healthcare investor Brad Loncar said it was difficult to draw a positive or negative conclusion from the fact that the trial has not yet had its first interim analysis.
""I think this means that the overall infection rate is a lot lower than Pfizer initially estimated,"" Loncar said. 
Dr. David Boulware, professor of medicine at University of Minnesota, said the study's participants may be more adherent to social distancing guidelines than the general population. 
""Who the vaccine trials really need are the people who don't wear masks, who are going out to bars, who go to crowded events, who are singing in church choirs - those are the high risk people,"" he said.
Boulware said that a data monitoring board could still review the data relatively quickly - perhaps in less than a day - once the trial hits its first interim point.
As the pandemic crimps demand for certain Pfizer therapies and damages global economies, investors are keenly focused on seeing the late-stage study data of the vaccine candidate being developed with BioNTech. 
The company also said that if the trial is successful, it still expects to file for emergency authorization of the vaccine candidate from U.S. regulators shortly after it has enough safety data in late November. It expects to have manufacturing data ready to submit to those regulators before then.

Pfizer reported quarterly earnings that beat estimates by one cent, helped by lower-than-expected costs. Sales fell 4.3% to $12.13 billion in the third quarter due to a sharp drop in revenue from its off-patent pain drug Lyrica, as well as a $500-million hit from the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding items, Pfizer earned 72 cents per share, beating analysts estimates of 71 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The maker of Hellmann's mayonnaise and Ben & Jerry's ice cream last week said the boards intended to proceed with their proposals ""provided that unification, in the boards' view, remains in the best interests of Unilever, its shareholders and other stakeholders as a whole"" and that it would update shareholders as appropriate.
The company said on Tuesday that the boards had met and that they consider unification to be in the best interests of all parties and plan to implement the unification. 
The move will bring ""significant benefits"" by increasing Unilever's flexibility when it comes to buying and exiting businesses, removing complexity and strengthening its corporate governance, the boards said.
""The boards are of the view that unification under Unilever PLC is the best practical option to achieve these objectives and will better position Unilever for future success,"" the company said. 
The boards plan to request that the UK High Court approve the cross-border deal at a hearing scheduled for Nov. 2, with a view to completing the process on Nov. 29, the company said.

The trial for its antibody treatment was paused earlier this month due to safety concerns... though the drugmaker said on Tuesday other trials of the coronavirus antibody therapy, bamlanivimab, remain on track.
Eli Lilly said costs associated with COVID-19 research and development are likely to rise to $400 million for the full year.

683,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 10:50AM ET</span>",Rubio unveils bill to kick blacklisted Chinese firms out of U.S. markets,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top Republican Senator Marco Rubio has introduced legislation to block access to U.S. capital markets for Chinese companies that have been blacklisted by Washington, threatening a blow against Chinese firms that rely on U.S. investors for funding. 
The bill, which Rubio submitted late on Monday, would bar U.S. investment firms, retirement funds, and insurance companies from taking stakes in Chinese companies that have been placed on a trade black list overseen by the Commerce Department or added to a list of firms backed by the Chinese military according to the Pentagon. 
If the legislation is approved, blacklisted Chinese companies would also be banned from trading on U.S. exchanges after a year-long grace period.
""The Chinese Communist Party's exploitation of U.S. capital markets is a clear and ongoing risk to U.S. economic and national security that must be addressed,"" Rubio said in a statement to Reuters. 
The legislation could hit surveillance camera maker Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd (SZ:002415), which was added to the trade blacklist for its involvement in China's suppression of its Uigher Muslim minority and placed on the DOD list in June. It could also hurt  China Telecom  (HK:0728) and China Mobile (HK:0941), which the Defense Department also labeled as backed by the Chinese military. 
""It's a dark day for those on Wall Street who assumed that mainland-listed Chinese companies would continue to have unfettered access to the unregulated and unscreened 'back door' into U.S. capital markets via Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) benchmarked against indices,"" said Roger Robinson, a former White House official in the Ronald Reagan administration who has sought tougher controls on Chinese companies in U.S. capital markets. 
The proposal comes amid growing pressure from Congress and the Trump administration to crack down on Chinese companies that enjoy the backing of U.S. investors but do not comply with U.S. rules faced by American rivals.
In August, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Treasury officials urged President Donald Trump to delist Chinese companies that trade on U.S. exchanges and fail to meet its auditing requirements by January 2022. 

The Senate unanimously passed legislation in May that could prevent some Chinese companies from listing their shares on U.S. exchanges unless they follow standards for U.S. audits and regulations.

Last year, Amazon hired 200,000 seasonal employees to handle the rush of orders during the fourth quarter. But this year, Amazon has already experienced holiday-like demand, reaping record sales, from shoppers turning to online ordering during the coronavirus pandemic.
Amazon added more than 175,000 workers during a hiring binge that began in March and later said it would keep on most of those recruits. The company followed that up last month with a pledge to hire 100,000 people for its logistics network.
In a blog post on Tuesday announcing its seasonal hiring, Amazon also said it had promoted some 35,000 employees in its operations group this year. The shares have surged more than 73% this year.

685,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 10:36AM ET</span>","Second Food-Stockpiling Wave Is Here, With 3,400% Pantry Surge","(Bloomberg) -- American consumers who’ve worked their way through the trove of shelf-stable meals they frantically bought back in March are at it again. This time, food makers are prepared.
 General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS)., the maker of Cheerios and Annie’s boxed mac and cheese, added 45 external production lines through contractors since the first round of pantry loading this spring.  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) Co. spent $40 million to expand production of Goldfish crackers and is building capacity for chip brands like Cape Cod. Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) Inc. boosted third-party manufacturing and warehousing, while Stonyfield Farm, a producer of organic yogurt and milk, added farmers to its supply network.
America’s food-makers are determined not to get caught flatfooted again. Many companies left sales on the table this spring when they couldn’t ramp up production fast enough for the dried pasta and canned soups that skittish consumers were stockpiling. Food producers used a calmer summer to assess the new grocery landscape and rework their strategies. Now, with Covid-19 cases climbing again and big holiday meals getting closer, investors are waiting to see whether it will be enough.
They won’t have to wait long to find out. Signs point to another round of stockpiling already starting. Demand for items like baking goods spiked 3,400% from a year earlier in the three weeks through Oct. 13, according to Centricity Inc., a platform that tracks online activity like searches and e-commerce. Mike Brackett, Centricity’s chief executive officer, said that’s less than the 6,000% jump that preceded the first wave of pantry loading, but he expects this one to hit a wider range of products beyond canned goods and other staples.
“In the last three to four weeks, we’ve seen very drastic increases, similar to how we did with the first wave of the pandemic,” Brackett said.
The fresh pantry loading comes as U.S. hospitalizations hit a two-month high last week as 37 states reported increased numbers. Parts of Europe and Latin America have also seen a rise in cases. While food companies insist they are better prepared than before, some shortages persist.
Raley’s, a West Sacramento-based grocer with nearly 130 locations, is still only filling an average of 70% to 75% of its orders. That’s better than the 40% it was filling at the peak of the pandemic, said Paul Gianetto, senior vice president of sales and merchandising, but the retailer is still seeing constraints in access to some packaged foods.
‘A Lot of Hoarding’
To keep shelves from looking scarce, Raley’s is ordering more private-label brands ahead of an expected rush on holiday essentials like baking supplies and sauces. It expects the rush to start earlier this year, and it plans to hold 20% more inventory than normal for some under-supplied categories.
“There is definitely a lot of hoarding that’s being anticipated that’s already causing a little strain,” Gianetto said in an interview. “The real thick of it is going to be those 10 to 14 days prior to Thanksgiving.”
Vivek Sankaran, chief executive officer of Albertsons Cos., which operates Safeway, Vons and other grocery chains, also said the company is stocking up on more Thanksgiving items. It’s still difficult to get items like cleaning sprays and wipes, hot dogs and flour, he said.
“There will be greater demand this holiday season than last holiday season. We’re increasing the amount of supply,” Sankaran said.
The longer-term hurdle for food companies will be to rebuild inventories that were depleted in the spring amid strong sales. While the next round of pantry loading may be easier than the last one, General Mills doesn’t expect its inventories to normalize until next June. That’s because consumer are still snapping up as much food as they can, pressuring companies across the industry.
“We are pretty much selling everything we can make,” said Sean Connolly, chief executive officer at Healthy Choice parent Conagra. “As long as demand remains very elevated, and if there is an additional uptick, that will just further stretch the supply that can be produced.”

Investing.com -- Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) jumped 21% after reporting its best profit in five years. It's still not clear if it's been able to reach Millennials. 
Earnings per share of $1.05 for the third quarter beat the estimated 31 cents on sales of $964 million, versus the expected $864 million.
Chief Executive Officer Jochen Zeitz, named in May, appears to be driving much-needed change at the legendary company. In July, Harley said it would cut 700 positions across global operations and announced it was overhauling its global operating model to become a “leaner, more nimble” organization.
Results indeed show progress, including $250 million cash savings including SG&A and capital reductions expected in 2020; $115 million annual savings from restructuring actions taken expected starting in 2021; and a 30% reduction in global dealer inventory compared to third quarter 2019. 
""The company's new operating model eliminated duplication and complexity across global operations, resulting in significant expected ongoing SG&A savings and vast improvements in agility and efficiency,"" the company said in a statement. 
Harley-Davidson will exit 39 markets where volume or profitability doesn't support continued investment and focus on its 36 highest potential markets.    
Still, there's little evidence that the brand is reaching younger riders, who, according to a 2019 UBS report, are interested in bikes for ease of transportation rather than riding to be cool. 
For the first nine months of the year, sales were down 22% compared to in 2019, and profit was lower by 76%. Retail motorcycle sales dropped 19% in that time in North America and 18% worldwide.

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) commercial truck unit and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Waymo on Tuesday said they will collaborate on development of self-driving Class 8 semi trucks, applying Waymo's automated system to Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s Freightliner Cascadia.
Class 8 trucks are semi trucks and other large commercial vehicles with a carrying capacity exceeding 33,000 lb (14969 kg).
The partnership accelerates a race to put automated heavy-duty trucks on the road, with a handful of powerful teams chasing commercial customers seeking to reduce dependence on human drivers. 
Waymo Chief Executive John Krafcik said during a conference call that it will take time for major suppliers of Class 8 truck hardware to develop the braking, steering and other technology required to bring a fully automated semi to market in high volume.
""These are super-long timelines,"" he said. 
The agreement is another win for Waymo as it tries to bring aboard more established vehicle makers. Waymo has also worked with U.S. truck maker PACCAR Inc (O:PCAR), whose brands include Peterbilt and Kenworth, but said it does not have a formal development agreement with the Bellevue, Washington company.
Daimler Trucks North America, whose brands include Freightliner and Western Star, and rival PACCAR together control more than 70 percent of the U.S. Class 8 heavy truck sector, according to John Stark, editor of Stark's Truck & Off-Highway Ledger.
Martin Daum, head of Daimler Trucks, said the agreement with Waymo does not change the German company's previously announced plan to spend 500 million euros on automated truck development. Daum and Roger Nielsen, head of Daimler Trucks North America, said Daimler's in-house efforts to develop a robotic truck driver will continue.
""Having a dual strategy approach, working with Waymo and another company, gives our customers a choice,"" Nielsen said.
Waymo has been working on self-driving vehicles for more than a decade, going back to when it was part of Alphabet's Google unit. The group initially focused on robo-taxis but in 2017 set up Waymo Via to build a goods delivery service using automated commercial vehicles, including heavy trucks.
Daimler and PACCAR will square off against Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which has said it plans to begin building its automated electric Semi truck next year at a new plant in Austin, Texas.
Other heavy truck makers planning to put automated vehicles into commercial service include Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) Traton, which is working with Pittsburgh-based Argo, and is negotiating the acquisition of Illinois-based  Navistar International Corp  (N:NAV). 
Swedish truck maker Volvo AB (OTC:VLVLY) is collaborating with Silicon Valley chip maker  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) in its autonomous truck efforts. 
Navistar is working on automated vehicles with Chinese startup TuSimple, which in turn has development deals with Amazon (O:AMZN) and  United Parcel  Service (N:UPS).

UPS has its own automated commercial vehicle development agreement with Waymo.

688,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>",Value Stock Bulls Are Counting On a Democratic Sweep,"(Bloomberg) -- The latest hope for beleaguered value managers: a decisive Democratic win next week.
The argument is that a blue wave of Democrat lawmakers in the halls of Congress would lead to a massive stimulus package to rev up the economy and spur inflation. That could set the stage for a rally in cyclical stocks and finally knock Big Tech off its perch atop the U.S. equity market.
“I don’t think it’s fully priced in,” Ronald Temple, head of U.S. equities at Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Asset Management, said on a webinar last week. “If we have a broadening of the economic recovery from all of this fiscal stimulus, there will be more companies with growing revenue to choose from.”
Value stocks -- those that look cheap relative to fundamentals -- tend to be cyclical companies that ride economic growth trends, such as banks and energy producers. A steeper yield curve also works in favor of value strategies. As long-end rates rise, investors will gravitate to stocks that can deliver cash flow now, instead of companies selling a long-term growth story, Temple said.
It’s not a sure bet. As many value diehards would tell you, few stock rotations in their favor have lasted since the global financial crisis.
Yield Drama Drowns Out Trump-Biden Show in Rotating Stock Market
That might be why the strategy of buying undervalued shares remains in the doldrums, even as other areas of the market price in the effects of more stimulus under a Democratic administration.
The spread between 5- and 30-year Treasury yields has widened 28 basis points over the past three months as polls showed a commanding lead for Democratic candidate Joe Biden. But an index tracking a strategy that buys cheap stocks and sells expensive ones -- which tends to follow the yield curve -- has largely gone nowhere.
History is also on the side of value strategies starting to improve. In seven of the last nine presidential elections, factors such as small size, value and high volatility have outperformed their historical averages in seven months after the vote, regardless of which party prevails, according to Style Analytics, a technology provider. That might be because newly elected presidents tend to unleash economic stimulus.
Of course, predicting market reactions to political events in recent years has been a sure way to make bad calls, and the surge in Covid-19 cases doesn’t bode well for a recovery in economically sensitive stocks. Value bulls may have to be a little choosier.
“You could see a major rotation -- not your grandfather’s growth to value rotation -- but a rotation into quality, into high current returns on capital and sustainable returns on capital,” Temple said. “This is likely to be a stock picker’s market.”

DUBAI (Reuters) - State-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines is facing a claim in London's High Court filed last month by a Dubai-based financial services firm over an alleged breach of lease agreements of 50 Airbus (PA:AIR) aircraft, court documents showed.
Alif Segregated Portfolio Company, which specialises in shariah-compliant aircraft leasing, has filed a complaint against the Jeddah-based carrier, also known as Saudia, in which it could seek at least $460 million in unpaid rent and maintenance cost. 
Alif also demands other damages and costs, the documents seen by Reuters showed.
London's High Court told Reuters the claim has been filed but not yet acknowledged by the defendant. 
The airline, in a statement to Reuters, said it would stand by its contractual commitments and was also prepared to defend itself against inaccurate claims. 
It declined to comment on specific details of claims made against it but said that active legal proceedings had not begun. ""We are currently in discussions with the lessor to resolve contractual differences, and we believe that common sense will prevail in the end.""
The deal between Alif and Saudia, announced by Airbus at the 2015 Paris Airshow, was hailed as the largest aviation deal to be secured via Islamic financing. The 50 aircraft, which account for a third of Saudia's fleet, were worth around $8.2 billion when the deal was announced.
Under the deal, Alif's managing unit International Airfinance Corporation (IAFC) bought the planes, which included 30 A320neo and 20 A330-300 aircrafts and leased them to Saudia. 
Alif claims in the documents that Saudia has failed to pay basic rent after seeking to reduce its payments and engaged in ""unauthorised and unnotified engine and part swaps"". 
Saudia has been struggling since the coronavirus pandemic brought global aviation to its knees. Saudi Arabia in March suspended flights and banned Muslims abroad from performing pilgrimages in the kingdom which normally attract millions of foreign visitors. 
The Gulf Arab state restarted domestic flights in May and has recently resumed international flights including to cities in the Middle East, Asia, Europe, Africa and the United States. 
But Saudia does not expect flight operations to return to normal until the end of the year and has asked some cabin crew employees to suspend their contracts until then.
Aviation has been one of the worst-hit industries during the pandemic and regional airlines including Emirates Airline, have cut thousands of jobs, sources have said. 
Emirates has received 7.3 billion dirhams ($2 billion) from the government of Dubai as it faces a cash crunch caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

It was unclear if the Saudi government was planning such injection to see Saudia through the crisis.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets turned lower in early trade on Tuesday as a gloomy drumbeat of news on the public health front inevitably focused attention on the weaker offerings from the ongoing earnings season.
By 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 32 points, or 0.1% at 27,653 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.1%, but the Nasdaq Composite managed a gain of 0.6%. All three had suffered their worst day in over a month on Monday as the market reacted to record-high numbers of new infections of Covid-19 across the U.S., and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows' unguarded admission at the weekend that ""we're not going to control the virus.""
Deflated market hopes for a stimulus package before next week's election were mirrored in an unexpected decline in the Conference Board's monthly consumer confidence index, to 100.9 from a downwardly-revised 101.8. By contrast, durable goods orders for September, released earlier, were slightly above expectations.
Representative of the general mood was a 5.1% drop in Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock after the life sciences company said it will end an unsuccessful test of its experimental antibody treatment for Covid-19.  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) stock, seen by some as a rough proxy for the overall economy, fell 2.8% after it reported third-quarter profit down by over half from last year, with all three major business lines suffering. The stock, which had enjoyed a solid rally on hopes that the world economy was over the worst of the pandemic, is still up over 50% its low in May. 
In brighter news, Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) stock rose 23% after a rise in quarterly profit more than outweighed a 10% drop in U.S. sales, providing the first major sign that its turnaround efforts are gaining traction.
Elsewhere, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock fell 3.7% on the big merger news of the day, its $35 billion all-stock deal for rival chipmaker Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX). Xilinx stock rose 8.9% on perceptions that the valuation terms were generous to the smaller company's shareholders.  The news put fresh pressure on Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock, amid concerns that Intel will now face tougher competition for its data center chip business. Intel fell 2.8%.
Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock rose 2.9% after announcing a deal to partner with TikTok to help its million merchants advertise their products through the video streaming service. "
692,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",Caterpillar Earnings Offer Little Guidance on Recovery Pace,"(Bloomberg) --  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT). said it sees “positive signs in certain industries and geographies” while failing to give reassurance that the worst of the hit from the coronavirus pandemic is behind the heavy-equipment maker.
The company reported third-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates, helped by lower-than-expected taxes. Caterpillar said it will discuss the outlook on its earnings call, according to a statement on Tuesday.
Caterpillar, which has been cutting costs to blunt the impact of still-sluggish orders in energy and mining, said machine sales fell 20% in September. The report comes as a resurgent virus hampers efforts to reopen economies, renewing concerns over global demand. The company’s stock was among the best performers in U.S. markets the past month on bets that sales were on the mend after virus shutdowns dented demand for its signature yellow machines.
“We’re encouraged by positive signs in certain industries and geographies,” Caterpillar Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby said in a statement. “We’re executing our strategy and are ready to respond quickly to changing market conditions.”
Adjusted profit for the three months through September was $1.34 a share, down from $2.66 in the same period a year earlier, the company said Tuesday in the statement. Analysts had estimated $1.13, based on the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Third-quarter revenue fell 23% from the same period a year earlier to $9.88 billion. The decline was mostly due to lower sales volume driven by lower end-user demand for equipment and services and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the third quarter of 2020 than during the third quarter of 2019, the company said.
Caterpillar expects operating margins to improve in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, according to the company’s presentation. It also said it expects dealers to reduce inventory levels by about $700 million in the fourth quarter, and by $2.5 billion for the year.
A bright spot for the rest of the year may be China, where government efforts to bolster growth in the wake of pandemic shutdowns are stoking demand. The heavy-equipment maker now expects an “up” year for sales in China’s construction market despite the shutdown in the first quarter, mainly helped by stimulus, according to Caterpillar Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield.
“Obviously, the China government is stimulating the economy to try and recover post Covid, and it’s very strong, particularly in the excavation market,” said in a phone interview following the earnings report. Bonfield also said the company is in a “battle” for market share in China.
Deerfield, Illinois-based Caterpillar suspended its earnings forecast earlier this year because of uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus.
The earnings report was released before the start of regular trading in New York, where Caterpillar shares fell 2.1% at 8:19 a.m.
With the recent run-up in Caterpillar’s shares, the third-quarter results and four-quarter outlook “may not provide enough excitement for additional near-term performance,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Stephen Volkmann said in a report. “While we see no major red flags, it appears any meaningful improvement in fundamentals will be pushed at least to 2021.”

693,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 09:51AM ET</span>","Comic: Ant Group's Record-Breaking, Super-Symbolic IPO","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Ant Group, the financial services empire built by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) founder Jack Ma, registered the world’s biggest-ever initial public offering, raising over $34 billion in the sale of new stock on the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges.
The deal is a landmark in many ways. It reflects how the world’s financial and economic center of gravity is shifting eastwards; how value in the world economy is migrating to technology and away from old sources of commodity-based wealth (the previous holder of the IPO record was Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Aramco (SE:2222)); how China has developed a financial system to rival its economy in scale and modernity (Ant has grown out of the payments system that powered the online marketplace of its former parent, Alibaba); how modern, digital financial service companies are devouring their legacy competitors in the banking and asset management industries.
But, not least, it also represents the growing distance between the U.S. and Chinese financial systems and economic spheres of influence. Alibaba, famously, went public in New York, at a time when the depth and legal predictability of the U.S. capital market made it indispensable to anyone trying to sell a blockbuster deal, and when the U.S. and China still believed they had more to gain by working together than against one another.
Six years later, Chinese household and institutional wealth has expanded to a degree that makes New York a luxury, and U.S.-Chinese relations have deteriorated so much as to make it a liability. A New York-listed Ant would have been a big, fat sitting target for sanctions the next time Washington wanted to apply economic or financial pressure on Beijing. The last vestiges of that U.S.-Chinese cooperation that made the Alibaba IPO possible are the presence of Citigroup, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley among the bookrunners.
That may not bother Ma much now. He becomes the only man in recent history whose companies have held the record for the biggest ever IPO not once, but twice. Others however may regret the days when the U.S. and China still felt like they needed each other."

LONDON (Reuters) - Shareholders in Britain's Rolls-Royce (L:RR) approved the aero-engine maker's 2 billion pound ($2.61 billion) rights issue on Tuesday that will bolster the company's finances after the pandemic stopped planes flying. 
The approval of the capital raise boosts the group's total liquidity by 5 billion pounds by unlocking extra debt options, including 2 billion pounds from a bond issued earlier this month and an extra 1 billion pounds from a two-year bank loan. 
Airlines pay Rolls based on how many hours its engines fly and a plunge in flying during the crisis has put Rolls' finances under intense scrutiny. 
But on announcing the rights issue plan at the start of October, CEO Warren East said securing the new shareholder funds and extra debt would take ""any liquidity questions off the table through this crisis"".
A statement published on Tuesday showed that 99.5% of shareholders approved the rights issue plan, confirming comments from the chairman earlier that the result was passed overwhelmingly. 
Shares in Rolls-Royce traded down 1% at 223 pence by 1308 GMT, reversing the 2% rise immediately after the meeting. The stock is up 75% since Sept.30, the day before the capital raise was announced. Overall, it has lost two-thirds of its value this year.
Under the terms of the rights issue, investors can buy 10 new shares for every three they own at 32 pence each, a 41% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price.
East told the meeting on Tuesday that the company had been right to go ahead with the equity raise, instead of waiting.
""We didn't want to put the business and our shareholders' interests at risk by gambling on what the situation might look like in the middle of next year,"" East said. 
Investors are backing East's plan to help the company ride out COVID-19 through cost cuts of 1.3 billion pounds, including axing 9,000 jobs and closing factories to adjust to lower demand from airline customers that fly with Rolls engines on Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787s and Airbus 350s.
Rolls also plans temporary shut-downs at factories and to reduce working hours and benefits as part of the those cost-cutting plans, the Financial Times reported.
The company's chairman Ian Davis said that Rolls' successful bond issue last week, when it raised double its 1 billion pound target following strong demand, meant it would not for now need to use an extension of a British government-backed guarantee on another loan. 

Demand for the bond issue showed ""the effectiveness of this equity raise in reassuring debt markets,"" Davis said.

The upbeat results showed Merck was on a recovery path after its revenue took a hit at the height of the pandemic, nudging the company's shares about 2% higher in premarket trading.
Sales of the drugs increased by 2% to $11.3 billion during the third-quarter, driven primarily by growth in its cancer drugs like blockbuster immunotherapy Keytruda and certain hospital acute care products.
The company also benefited from increased demand for its bacterial pneumonia vaccine, Pneumovax 23, in the United States, Japan, and Europe as people seek to avoid one lung disease compounding another during the pandemic.
Sales of Keytruda, which is an approved treatment for cancers including non-small-cell lung cancer, rose 21% to $3.7 billion, above analysts estimates of $3.66 billion, according to six analysts polled by Refinitiv. 
Merck said it now expects full-year adjusted profit of between $5.91 and $6.01 per share, compared with its prior forecast of between $5.63 to $5.78 per share.
For 2020, Merck now expects an unfavorable impact to revenue of about $2.35 billion due to the pandemic, up from $1.95 billion it had initially estimated.

Excluding items, Merck earned $1.74 per share, beating analysts' average estimates of $1.44 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

697,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 08:40AM ET</span>",Are U.S. election stories bad for business? How publishers are fighting ad keyword 'block lists',"By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - In the days leading up to what is expected to be a chaotic U.S. presidential election, publishers are using new software tools to analyze their news coverage in order to make advertisers more comfortable with placing ads on stories that could be deemed too controversial. 
Aiming to avoid a repeat of earlier this year, when news publishers lost an estimated $1.3 billion in ad revenue due to companies pulling ads from stories about the pandemic, major news organizations are using software and human moderators to lure advertisers back.
Gannett’s (N:GCI) USA Today, News Corp’s (O:NWSA) Dow Jones and other publishers contacted by Reuters said they are expecting an increase in companies blocking ads from election-related stories before and after Election Day on Nov. 3.
“Given what’s happening right now and what we know, it will be a challenging time in the news between now and whenever (the election) ends,” said Paul Tsigrikes, head of marketing at the Wall Street Journal and Barron’s Group, which are units of Dow Jones.
Publishers are working to limit the impact of keyword-blocking software that prevents ads from showing up on pages with terms viewed as unsuitable by some advertisers, including ""shooting"", ""dead"", ""coronavirus"", ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""protest.""
In a demonstration of how encompassing such keyword lists can be, one publisher showed Reuters a list of nearly 2,000 terms from a major Fortune 500 advertiser that included commonly used terms in news coverage such as “Donald Trump” and “Rudy Giuliani” and other terms referring to violence including “Paris attack” and ""Yom Kippur shooting."" 
These lists, which are now common among advertisers and publishers, would prevent most ads from appearing on election-related coverage, the publisher source told Reuters.
Dow Jones said it is pitching its tool called SafeSuite in ""every single meeting"" with advertisers. The software helps determine whether an article is considered to have a positive or negative slant, and if the content is suitable next to a brand's ad. 
The tool uses a mix of artificial intelligence to understand the meaning of the words in a story, and manual scoring of the articles to determine if it is suitable for a brand's ad, the company said.
Advertisers have long worried about inappropriate ad placements -- an airline ad next to stories about plane crashes, for instance, because digital ad placement is largely determined by tech systems rather than humans.
To avoid this, advertisers have relied on services from ad tech firms like Integral Ad Science (IAS) and DoubleVerify that let advertisers block ads based on words and phrases on pages or web addresses. 
In August, IAS launched a product called Context Control, which uses “semantic” technology that determines whether an article has a positive or negative emotion associated with it. 
IAS said the technology could also better determine nuances in words and block stories on pages with words like “gunshot” but not on pages with phrases like “basketball shot.” 
PUBLISHERS FIGHT BACK
More recently, publishers have built their own tools that use artificial intelligence and machine learning to determine the sentiment of articles. 
In some cases, sentiment analysis tools built by publishers have worked better than ones offered by outside ad tech companies like IAS and DoubleVerify.
The third-party tools were sometimes found to block more ad inventory than necessary compared to publisher tools, said Joshua Lowcock, chief digital and innovation officer at ad agency UM.
“The best person to tell you about the content is the person who owns the content,” he added.
Fine tuning these sentiment analysis tools is one crucial aspect to protecting the bottom lines of publishers while still protecting advertisers during chaotic news cycles.
Education also plays a vital role. USA Today’s ad sales team is reaching out to advertisers to explain the benefits of advertising on news, as well as make them aware of softer election coverage like stories that include local voting information, Michael Kuntz, chief operating officer of USA Today Network said. 
Dow Jones' ad sales team is also working with the brands to narrow down the keyword lists, said Erin Laughlin, product director of advertising at Dow Jones.
A Dow Jones advertising group that produces custom ad campaigns and sponsored content is seeing increased interest, Tsigrikes said. Advertisers often see such content as brand safe because it is produced in close collaboration with the news publisher.

""There's a lot of anxiety about (the aftermath of) the election, because obviously there could be a lot of craziness,"" said David Chavern, CEO of news organization trade group News Media Alliance. ""We don't want keyword blocks to start hitting legitimate coverage of that controversy.""

DETROIT (Reuters) - When the coronavirus pandemic slammed the United States in March, the Detroit Three automakers shut their plants and brought their North American vehicle production to an unprecedented cold stop.
Now, four months after a slow and sometimes bumpy restart in May, many General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) factories are working at close to full speed, chasing a stronger-than-expected recovery in sales.
So far, none of the Detroit Three has had a major COVID-19 outbreak since restarting production, even as the coronavirus is surging in Midwestern and Southern communities outside factory walls.
""We have people testing positive, but it's not affecting operations,"" said Ford global manufacturing chief Gary Johnson.
Keeping the pandemic at bay has pushed the automakers and 156,000 U.S. factory employees represented by the United Auto Workers into unfamiliar work routines and extraordinary levels of cooperation among rivals that will have to be sustained for months to come.
For automakers, the automakers' COVID response has been as much about instilling new habits as relying on new technology. Workers log their symptoms, or lack of them, into smartphone apps and walk past temperature scanners to get to their work stations.
But company and union executives said masks, along with physical distancing, are the key to keeping assembly lines rolling.
""The mask is the foundation"" of protecting workers on the job, said Gerald Johnson, GM's head of global manufacturing.
COMPLAINTS ABOUT MASKS
Auto workers are accustomed to wearing protective gear such as shatterproof glasses and gloves.
Masks that cover the mouth and nose, however, were not standard equipment on auto assembly lines, and were a tough sell at first.
""The biggest complaint is wearing a mask,"" United Auto Workers president Rory Gamble told Reuters. ""A lot of our members perform physical tasks. Wearing the mask inhibits breathing.""
Beyond that, Gamble said, masks and distancing make it harder for workers to have conversations on the job or socialize during breaks. ""That’s pretty much out the window, and it makes for a longer day,"" he said.
Masks make it harder for co-workers to read each other's expressions - often crucial in the noisy environment of a car plant. At GM factories, employees wear badges that show their face framed by the message: ""I'm smiling behind my mask.""
The politicized controversy over mask-wearing means company and union officials have to put their messages about the importance of keeping masks on a constant repeat cycle.
""There was a lot of mixed messaging coming out of Washington that gave us some heartburn,"" Gamble said. The automakers and the union agreed to follow guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization. All three companies also adapted measures taken at their plants in China, which were hit first as the pandemic spread.
At GM's Factory Zero in Detroit, UAW skilled trades worker Scott Harwick said the mask wearing debate outside the plant isn't an issue inside. Sometimes a co-worker will let a mask slip during a long hot shift, he said. ""You don't have to say anything, you just tap on your mask.""
COOPERATION AMONG AUTOMAKERS
Coronavirus safety has now become one of the rare areas in which the automakers do not compete. Instead, the CEOs of the Detroit Three and the UAW formed an extraordinary task force that meets biweekly to share information and coordinate safety policies.
The discussions can be as detailed as whether safety glasses or face shields offer better protection, said Scott Garberding, global head of manufacturing for Fiat Chrysler.
The restart has hit obstacles, executives and UAW leaders said.
Some workers have filed complaints with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that COVID safety procedures are not being followed, according to OSHA records.
Ford and Fiat Chrysler said the complaints have been resolved. GM said four of six complaints lodged with OSHA have been closed, and it has not been cited or inspected by OSHA related to its COVID protocols.
“We are confident in our multi-layered approach to COVID-19 safety, which has proven effective in preventing workplace transmission of COVID-19 in our facilities,” GM spokesman Dan Flores said in a statement. 
The Detroit automakers test workers who exhibit symptoms associated with coronavirus infection, but have not adopted widespread testing for their 156,000 factory workers.
All three companies have encountered workers who tested positive for COVID-19 exposure, and early on there were brief shutdowns to clean plants.
Absenteeism rates are still higher than normal at some plants, driven both by concerns about infection and problems getting child care. UAW leaders have granted the companies more flexibility to use temporary workers. The automakers have begun helping workers obtain or pay for child care.
Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant and Louisville Assembly Plant are using about 2,000 temporary workers, said Todd Dunn, president of UAW Local 862, which represents about 16,000 hourly workers at the plants.
""There are issues every night,"" he said. ""But the line's still running.""

700,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 07:58AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Up 104 Pts; Earnings Deluge in Focus,"By Peter Nurse
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Tuesday, bouncing to a degree after Monday’s sharp losses, as investors digest a slew of key earnings amid concern over the rising number of coronavirus cases.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 16 points, or 0.5%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 104 points, or 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 65 points, or 0.6%. 
Investors will likely focus Tuesday on the release of a raft of key earnings. Eli Lilly  (NYSE:LLY) stock fell 4.6% in premarket trading after reporting a 4% drop in profit, only a day after acknowledging its experimental antibody treatment for Covid-19 had failed to produce the desired results. Rival drug producer Merck (NYSE:MRK) rose 1.3% after handily beating expectations for earnings, while  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock slipped after the company said it wasn't yet ready to release preliminary data from late-stage trials of its Covid-19 drug.  
Also in the spotlight are numbers from  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), where profit fell 54%, slightly less than expected, and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM). Software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) starts a big week for the tech giants, even as they face increasing antitrust scrutiny.
Looking at economic data, updates are due for durable goods orders for September, house price data and the Richmond Fed’s regional business survey; But the Conference Board’s consumer sentiment index for October is likely to be the main release, as a sign that there is support for spending, which drives two-thirds of U.S. economic output. 
Wall Street closed substantially lower on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 2.3%, its worst day since early September, the S&P 500 losing 1.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.6%. 
Driving the recent weakness has been concerns over the resurgence of Covid-19 cases in the northern hemisphere as the winter draws nearer. Europe has been hard hit, with a number of countries resorting to new containment procedures, but the U.S. has also reported records for new daily cases. 
In just one week, the United States has seen an increase of nearly half a million cases, leading some local and state officials to rein in their reopening plans, as hospital capacity constraints start to loom.
Meanwhile the chances of a new coronavirus relief deal seems very unlikely with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell adjourning the Senate until November 9.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, rebounding after Monday’s hefty losses, but the surge in coronavirus cases in the U.S. and Europe means sentiment remains gloomy.
Hurricane Zeta is due to make U.S. landfall on Wednesday, with rigs and refineries shutting down in preparation for its arrival, while traders also await crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the session.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $38.88 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.8% to $41.12. Both contracts fell more than 3% on Monday.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,905.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1828.

701,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>",Citigroup Chasing Growth in Emerging Markets as Rivals Retreat,"(Bloomberg) --  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). plans to deepen its corporate banking presence in developing countries from Russia to South Africa even as some rivals decamp to focus on their home markets.
Citigroup has overhauled its business in eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa to focus on emerging economies. The third-largest U.S. bank is betting unprecedented deal opportunities will follow the economic slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic, weak oil prices and political uncertainty.
As part of the revamp, Citigroup in September shifted 29 of its operations across these three regions and added another 30 units in countries where it didn’t have a presence, creating a single emerging markets cluster.
“We’re going to look at increasing the canvas for the bank compared to where we are now,” Naveed Kamal, chairman of EMEA EM corporate banking, said in an interview.
The expansion contrasts with some of its European rivals. Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc have scaled back or retreated from Africa to focus on their home markets. Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc is cutting staff and reducing its presence in Dubai, along with  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG.
“We’re already hiring new resources and will hire more people as the opportunity grows,” Kamal said. “It will be a combination of either hiring more or reallocating resources.”
Bigger Buckets
Demand for emerging-market assets will increase substantially as global asset managers and pension funds look to generate higher returns in the low interest-rate environment, Rizwan Shaikh, co-head of Citigroup’s EMEA EM corporate-banking division, said on the same call.
Direct lending platforms set up by sovereign wealth funds like Mubadala and Qatar Investment Authority are further opportunities for the New York-based bank and its competitors.
The lender’s emerging-markets business could get a further boost when Jane Fraser takes over as chief executive officer in February given her experience in some developing regions.
“We’re excited about the entire region especially in light of the last seven to eight months,” said Aziz Rahman, co-head of EMEA EM corporate banking. “We see a common thread in EM from companies and sovereigns who are either looking to raise capital, do refinancing, and/or do more acquisitions and grow.”
The bank expects sovereigns to keep tapping markets for their capital needs, with bond and sukuk sales from the Middle East and North Africa hitting a record $115 billion so far this year.
Fiscal Space
“These countries have significant sovereign wealth and fiscal space to borrow for investing in their economies for growth and to fund deficits,” Kamal said.
The bank is the third top arranger of debt and sukuk sales from the Middle East and North Africa, behind  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and Standard Chartered, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It ranks third for Eastern European bonds after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA, and fourth in Africa.
To complement the bond-sale spree, state-owned firms are also turning to asset sales to support their economies.
Citigroup Sees Asset Sales Boosting $47 Billion Gulf Debt Binge
While Citigroup isn’t expecting a big rush for liquidity from regional clients any time soon -- mainly because of quarterly earnings that either met or beat expectations -- this is poised to change.
“There will be need for capital as things normalize and our clients look to reinvest for growth,” Shaikh said. “Most have held back spending in the past months and we expect pent up demand to drive a lot of capital raising in debt and equity.”

704,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Analysis: Take a stance or tiptoe away? Corporate America's battle with social activism,"By Anna Irrera, Jessica DiNapoli and Imani Moise
(Reuters) - Earlier this year, a flood of major U.S. companies pledged to address racial inequality and promote social justice after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd, a Black man, setting off protests across the country.
Companies that rushed to take a stand include household names like  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD), Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) and  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO). Corporate America pledged billions to promote diversity in employee ranks and the communities in which they operate, including banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), which recently made a $30 billion commitment over the next five years.
Another set of companies, particularly in Silicon Valley, are turning more cautious, according to interviews with more than a dozen investors, entrepreneurs, executive coaches and recruiters.
Companies and employees should avoid taking public stances that stoke controversy in an increasingly polarized America, proponents of this view and their advisers told Reuters. Instead, they should focus on strategic initiatives and meeting financial targets, they said.
Management teams and boards of directors are discussing how to handle the issue, sources said, with some staying silent as a strategy and others laying out formalized ground rules detailing how executives can discuss sensitive social and political issues.
""People are struggling with employees expecting companies to solve problems that are beyond the purview of the company,"" said executive coach Stephen Miles of the Miles Group.
Miles has spoken to at least 10 CEOs in recent weeks who commiserated with Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of Coinbase, whose Sept. 27 blog post explaining why the cryptocurrency company would remain apolitical brought the debate into the public square. (Blog: https:// Coinbase and its employees should pay attention to the corporate ""mission"" and not delve into broader societal problems that distract and decrease productivity, Armstrong wrote. The company declined to comment further for this story.  After he shared it on Twitter, some founders and former senior executives of prominent tech companies replied supportively. The view may be shared even more widely in corporate America than it appears. ""People aren't taking a public stand about this, but they are asking about it in the boardroom: 'What should we do?'"" said Kathleen Utecht, managing partner at venture-capital firm Core Innovation Capital. Utecht agrees with Armstrong. His position is more common than people may realize, she said, especially at smaller companies where management teams do not want to devote limited resources to fixing complex societal issues.  The unprecedented outpour of corporate support for racial justice lately follows several years of companies taking a stand on other issues that activists criticize them about, including climate change, the gender wage gap and LGBTQ rights. Blue-chip corporations have not wavered from their announcements and smaller companies have taken a stand, too. On Friday, Expensify CEO David Barrett emailed the software company's 10 million users urging them to vote for Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden.  These declarations get attention, partly because of how unusual they are historically, said Harvard University professor Mike Toffel, who has studied CEO activism. It is more common now than it was five or 10 years ago, but still rare, he said, and the feeling that companies should get involved in politics is far from universal. ""You can count on a couple of hands how many examples you can find,"" he said. ""Many are not engaging."" Roughly half of the companies in the Russell 1000 did not make statements about racial inequality last summer, according to preliminary data from As You Sow, a nonprofit that advocates for corporate accountability. Of those that did make statements, 195 were in hard-to-find locations like a CEO's LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) page or staff Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, not the corporate website, said Andrew Behar, As You Sow's chief executive. Lloyd Carney, a former tech executive who sits on the boards of companies including artificial intelligence provider  Nuance Communications  Inc (O:NUAN), said ""smart"" companies are taking steps to address social causes internally, but not in a splashy way. That allows them to avoid backlash from employees, customers or politicians, he said. ""It's one of those things where it's better to make quiet noise,"" said Carney. ""A press release is the worst thing you can do in this highly politicized environment."" About half a dozen companies outside Silicon Valley recently set up ""guardrails"" for how executives can discuss sensitive social and political issues, like Black Lives Matter, one adviser to boards told Reuters. Executives must make it clear that they are speaking in a personal capacity on certain issues and notify boards about their comments, the adviser said. For instance, high-tech manufacturer  Sono-Tek Corp  (PK:SOTK) adopted a similar code of conduct in September that forbids employees from participating in politics on the job or with company resources. The provision is especially important in today's tumultuous world and is meant to help employees feel comfortable at work, said the company's chief financial officer, Steve Bagley. 
""Large businesses want people to buy their product, to support their company, whether they are hardcore Democrats or hardcore Republicans, or in between,"" said Ronn Torossian, head of 5W Public Relations, who talks to CEOs across a wide swath of industries. ""A week doesn't pass that major companies aren’t discussing this.""

709,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>",Wall Street banks and their staff are leaning left,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wall Street banks and their employees have been leaning left in recent years, increasing the proportion of cash allocated to Democrats. 
Some of that has been prompted by the industry's bid to rebuild the bipartisan support it enjoyed before the 2009 financial crisis, which turned many Democrats against the industry. Here is the breakdown for the 2020 election cycle, based on data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. 
JOE BIDEN VERSUS DONALD TRUMP
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has dramatically outpaced Republican President Donald Trump in total fundraising during the final months of the campaign ahead of the Nov. 3 election, and that is also true when it comes to winning cash from the banking industry. 
Biden's campaign and other fundraising vehicles supporting his campaign have pulled in roughly $3 million from commercial banks, compared with just over $1.4 million for Trump, CRP data shows. 
By comparison, in 2012, the first presidential election following the 2009 financial crisis, Republican candidate Mitt Romney pulled in nearly $5.5 million from commercial banks and their workers, compared with Democratic President Barack Obama's nearly $2 million. 
Wall Street banks and their workers were the top five contributors to Romney, while no financial firms were among Obama's top contributors, according to the CRP data. 
CONGRESSIONAL MONEY
In the 2020 election cycle, campaign contributions from commercial banks and their workers to Republicans and Democrats running in congressional races are split nearly evenly, at $14 million and $13.6 million respectively. 
That is a significant shift from four years ago, when Republicans pulled in $18.9 million from the industry, nearly twice as much as Democrats. 
It was even more tilted in 2012, when Democrats won just 29% of the bank donations pot.
Of the top 20 recipients of bank and bank-worker donations this cycle, including presidential candidates, sitting and aspiring lawmakers, 10 are Democrats or left-leaning independents, compared with six Democrats in 2012. 
WHO IS GETTING THE MONEY?
Stripping out Trump and Biden, the next top recipient on that list is anti-Wall Street progressive and former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, with $831,096. 
While at first blush that seems counter-intuitive, Sanders, an independent who lost to Biden in the Democratic presidential race, tops contributions from many industries due to his grassroots following among millions of Americans, including those who work at banks.
Focusing only on funds dished out by banks' dedicated political arms, the picture changes.
House of Representatives lawmaker Blaine Luetkemeyer of Missouri, one of the senior Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee, which is key for the banking industry, tops the list, hauling in $226,000. Next up is Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, the top Republican on that panel, with $185,500 in cash from bank political committees.
That suggests many bank employees favor more progressive lawmakers than the industry's leadership. 
The top 20 recipients of bank political funds comprise 14 Republicans and six Democrats. Representative Gregory Meeks of New York, a senior member of the House banking panel, received the most among Democrats, with $140,000. 
Nearly all the top 20 recipients for this cycle sit on a panel with jurisdiction over the industry. 
WHO ARE BANKS BATTING FOR?
Beyond campaign donations, the banking industry is playing a more direct role in this year's presidential election cycle, with the industry's top trade group, the American Bankers Association, running ads backing 14 congressional candidates. 
Some of those include Republican industry allies like Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Representative French Hill of Arkansas, a former banker. The group, looking to build bipartisan ties, is also running ads for a handful of moderate Democrats, like Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey and Senator Chris Coons of Delaware. 

The ABA also weighed in on some of the tightest races in the country, running ads backing Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado, who, along with Tillis, are top Democratic targets.

Caterpillar announced earnings per share of $1.34, down 54% from last year, on revenue of $9.88 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.17 on revenue of $9.71 billion.
The company's stock dropped 1.4% premarket, having been up 10% from the beginning of the year.
“I’m proud of our global team’s performance as we continue to safely navigate the pandemic while remaining firmly committed to serving our customers,” said Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby. “Our third-quarter results largely aligned with our expectations, and we’re encouraged by positive signs in certain industries and geographies. We’re executing our strategy and are ready to respond quickly to changing market conditions.""
Catepillar reported a strong balance sheet, ending the third quarter with $9.3 billion of enterprise cash and more than $14 billion of available liquidity sources.
""Investors have built expectations that global efforts to kick-start the economy are going to help Caterpillar sooner and later, helping the company to boost its production and make use of the idled capacity.

""That said, Caterpillar has shown through cost cuts and demand management that it is well-positioned to weather the crisis, especially when it has enough cash and available liquidity.""

717,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 06:38AM ET</span>","StockBeat: HSBC, Santander Make a Strong Case for Dividend Restart","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- European banks have been telling regulators for weeks they’re strong enough to pay dividends again. Now at least a couple of them have the figures to prove it.
HSBC (LON:HSBA) and Santander (MC:SAN), two of the continent’s largest banks, both reported better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter that both featured comparatively modest provisions against possible loan losses and surprisingly strong capital ratios.
At the same time, both stepped up their campaigns to restart returns to shareholders, which were banned by regulators earlier in the year, out of fear that a wave of bad loans could leave the banking sector dependent again on taxpayer-funded bailouts to survive.
Santander is pushing more aggressively: it’s already asked its shareholders to approve a dividend worth 10 cents for this year, albeit in the form of additional shares, along with another 10c cash dividend to be paid next year.  Approval from shareholders, who will hardly be blind to the risk of hollowing the bank’s balance sheet in the current circumstances, could arguably sway the European Central Bank to let the payout proceed.
HSBC was more circumspect: it said it “will seek to pay a conservative dividend if circumstances allow” for 2020, but added that a decision will depend on how the economy looks at the start of next year, and will in any case “be subject to regulatory consultation”.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), Santander stock was up 3.7%, having earlier hit a six-week high, while HSBC stock was up 6.5% at its highest in two and a half months. HSBC is now up 20% from the multi-year low it hit in September.
Largely, that’s because of its exposure to Asia, where the economy has rebounded more quickly from the pandemic than anywhere else, and where growth and interest rates are in any case higher. HSBC’s Asia business generated $3.2 billion of pretax profit in the quarter, more than the group reported overall. That suggests its operations in the rest of the world lost money.
HSBC responded by saying it is looking for ways to speed up cost-cutting in the U.S. and France, two areas which have been long-term underperformers. But the optics of resuming dividend payments are complicated by the fact that it makes its profits so far away from where its regulators sit in London.
That’s a problem shared by Santander too: the profits are far away, in Brazil, Mexico and the U.S.: a supervisor in Madrid, by contrast, is surrounded by soaring unemployment and business closures, a state of emergency and an ever-earlier curfew. Believing in the strength of the group numbers requires a leap of faith, not normally a supervisor’s forte. The leap required is even greater now that the economy is clearly turning down again in Europe: the pandemic has not yet run its course in this credit cycle.
And yet, the numbers demand respect: Santander said that only 2% of the loans that were subject to moratoria earlier in the year are now impaired. The core tier 1 capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, has risen to 11.98%, close to the top of its target range (HSBC’s is even more impressive, rising to 15.6% at the end of Q3), provisions have fallen for two straight quarters.
The argument that the dividend ban is making investable companies uninvestable has some merit against such a backdrop. The negative signal that emanates from such a policy risks creating its own reality. Regulators have argued since the pandemic erupted that the banking sector is in much better shape than it was 12 years ago. Maybe it's time they heeded their own advice.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's National Pension Service (NPS) will oppose LG Chem's (KS:051910) plan to separate its battery business into a new company, the NPS said on Tuesday. 
It cited concerns about damage to shareholder value, including the possibility of diluting the equity value. 
LG Chem said in a statement that it very much regrets that NPS opposes the plan when most domestic and foreign proxy advisers including Institutional Shareholder Services back it, adding it will actively communicate with shareholders. 
LG Chem, an electric car battery supplier for Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and GM (N:GM), said last month it plans to separate the business as the electric vehicle market takes off.
NPS, the world's third-largest pension fund with $689 billion in assets, was the second-largest shareholder of LG Chem with a 9.96% stake as of end-June, after  LG Corp 's (KS:003550) 33.34% stake, a company filing showed.

(Reuters) - Apple (O:AAPL), Alphabet (O:GOOGL), Amazon (O:AMZN) and Facebook (O:FB), together accounting for about a fifth of the S&P 500's total value, report their quarterly results on Thursday, with their stocks trading near record highs, even as they face increasing antitrust scrutiny.
Amazon and Apple have surged 74% and 57%, respectively, this year, far outperforming the S&P 500's 5% gain as the coronavirus pandemic accelerates trends toward online shopping, video streaming and other technologies helping Wall Street's largest companies take market share from smaller rivals.
Big Tech for years has been criticized for choking competition and stifling smaller competitors, and investors are looking for signs that they are extending their lead during the pandemic. However, antitrust storm clouds in recent months have increased. 
A scathing report by a House of Representatives panel this month detailing abuses of market power by large tech companies suggests a tough road ahead should Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who is leading in polls, win the Nov. 3 election.
""There seems to be a lot of angst and desire to not only fine these companies, but potentially change the way they do their business. In the past, there was a lot of lip service, but now you are starting to see some pretty active postures,"" said Dan Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus (NYSE:SNV) Trust.
Morgan said he expects to see companies set money aside to pay for potential future fines.
Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook have a combined stock market value of $5.5 trillion, compared to the S&P 500's $29 trillion market capitalization.
Their reports come amid turbulence on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 (SPX) on Monday posting its biggest daily decline in four weeks, as soaring coronavirus cases and uncertainty about a fiscal relief bill in Washington dim the outlook for an economic recovery.
Microsoft (O:MSFT), which posts its results late on Tuesday, has elevated its stock market value by a third in 2020 to $1.6 trillion. Investors expect the software maker to report an 8% rise in quarterly revenue and a 10% jump in net income, with Cowen analyst Derrick Wood saying in a recent client note that Windows sales could get a lift from additional laptop demand as people keep working from home. 
S&P 500 technology sector earnings per share are seen rising 0.3% in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
By comparison, analysts expect S&P 500 companies to see an aggregate decline of 16.7% in their third-quarter earnings as the U.S. economy remains crippled by the pandemic. 
Amazon's September-quarter report will likely be a ""calm before the storm"" as the online retailer builds more fulfillment centers in anticipation of a busy holiday shopping season, Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote in a client note on Monday.
""With a holiday crunch expected, the scale and pace at which (Amazon) is bringing incremental capacity online is encouraging,"" Shmulik wrote.
Twitter also reports its results on Thursday, with analysts on average expecting a 9% revenue decline as advertisers hurt by the pandemic spend less.

Analysts on average expect Apple's report after the bell on Thursday to reflect a 0.5% drop in revenue to $63.7 billion and net income down 11.2% to $12.1 billion. However, Apple investors are mostly focused on the outlook for sales of the newest iPhone and growth in recurring revenue from apps, games and video and music streaming.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell 0.9% after closing at a one-month low on Monday, when markets were hammered by rising infections in the United States and Europe and fading hopes of a stimulus package before the U.S. presidential election.
The German DAX (GDAXI) shed 0.9% after hitting a four-month low a day earlier, while France's CAC 40 (FCHI) fell 1.6% to a one-month low as the country grappled with a runaway infection rate.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is planning a ""lockdown light"" in Europe's largest economy that would mainly focus on the closure of bars and restaurants to slow down a second wave of infections, newspaper Bild reported.
Travel & leisure (SXTP) were among the top decliners, down 1.8%, while retailers (SXRP) dropped 1.7%. 
""There is continued malaise (in markets) over the rise in European COVID-19 cases,"" said Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald Asset Management.
""There's an expectation that some of the things that were kept sacrosanct, such as keeping businesses open, might need to reconsidered."" 
Losses in UK's FTSE 100 (FTSE) were limited by a 5.7% jump in Europe's biggest bank HSBC (L:HSBA) after the lender signalled a pandemic-induced overhaul of its business model, accelerating plans to shrink in size and slash costs.
Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) gained 3% as it expects 2020 core profit to beat market expectations, helped by additional cost savings of 1 billion euros.
BP (L:BP) rose 1.3% as it swung back to a small profit in the third quarter.
Third-quarter earnings remain largely positive. Out of the 27% of the STOXX 600 companies that have reported so far, 73% have beat profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data. 
French consulting and IT services provider Capgemini (PA:CAPP) jumped 5% after confirming its full-year targets.
Tobacco group  Swedish Match  (ST:SWMA) climbed 5.4% as it reported a bigger-than-expected rise in quarterly profit on the back of higher sales of smokeless products.
However, miners (SXPP) fell 1.7%, dragging markets lower, after Liberum analysts downgraded stocks of  Rio Tinto  (L:RIO),  Antofagasta  (L:ANTO) and KAZ Minerals (L:KAZ). 

Meanwhile, data showed profits at China's industrial firms rose at a slower pace in September, hurt by factory-gate deflation and rising raw materials costs.

723,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 05:54AM ET</span>",Banks Working on Ant Group’s Hong Kong IPO Could Get $396 Million Windfall,"(Bloomberg) -- The banks working on the Hong Kong leg of Ant Group Co.’s record-breaking initial public offering are looking at a windfall of as much as $396 million, although in percentage terms it is less than the city’s average for big deals.
Ant is set to raise as much as $19.8 billion in Hong Kong if it fully exercises an over-allotment option. The fintech giant disclosed in a filing that it will pay an underwriting commission of as much as 1% of the total deal size, or $198 million. That’s below the average 1.45% paid by companies raising over $1 billion in the city, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The final percentage, however, will only be decided around Oct. 30, meaning the banks could end up receiving less. How the fees get split among the banks will also be decided later, though typically the sponsors take the lion’s share. That puts  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and China International Capital Corp. in line for the biggest portion.
Part of the $396 million will come from investors, who pay a 1% brokerage fee when buying shares.
An Ant representative declined to comment.
The only other IPO that is bigger than Ant in Hong Kong, AIA Group (OTC:AAGIY) Ltd.’s $20.4 billion offering in 2010, paid banks 1.75%. Budweiser Brewing Co APAC Ltd. rewarded them 1.5% of its $5.76 billion listing last year, while smartphone maker Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp. forked out 1%.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. only paid banks 0.25% for its $12.9 billion second listing in Hong Kong last year, well below the average. However, such offerings tend to pay less, because, the argument goes, investors are already familiar with a company trading on another exchange. NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc. also disclosed an underwriting fee of 0.25% for its Hong Kong share sale, while JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. paid 1%.
Still, if Ant were to end up paying less than 1%, that would put it more in line with secondary listings like Alibaba’s as opposed to traditional IPOs.

724,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>",HSBC to revamp business model as lower interest rates hit profit,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Lawrence White
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) -  HSBC Holdings  PLC (L:HSBA) on Tuesday signalled it would embark on a pandemic-induced overhaul of its business model, seeking to flip its main source of income from interest rate to fee-based businesses.
Reporting a 35% tumble in quarterly profit, Europe's largest bank also accelerated plans to shrink in size, targeted deeper cost cuts, and said it will resume conservative dividend payments when able.
The planned business model changes mark one of the biggest shifts in strategy to date from HSBC, which has long touted its ability to generate interest income from its more than $1.5 trillion in customer deposits.
But with interest rates worldwide now rock bottom and even turning negative, the bank is struggling to charge more for loans to borrowers than it pays out to depositors and it warned that net interest income would remain under pressure.
In a potentially seismic shift for the banking industry, HSBC also said it could start charging for products such as standard current accounts that customers in some markets such as Britain expect to be free.
""We will have to look at charging for basic banking services in some markets, because a large number of our customers in this environment will be losing us money,"" Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson told Reuters.
That could prove a tough pill to swallow in some markets, industry experts said.
""It will need to be done carefully to not damage the trust of the brand or get customers to switch, especially in countries where competitors offer the service for no charge,"" said Sudeepto Mukherjee, senior vice president, financial services, at consulting firm Publicis Sapient.
The restructuring measures helped HSBC shares climb more than 6%, although they have still lost nearly half their value year to date. 
Underscoring its challenges, the bank's third-quarter revenue fell to $11.9 billion, down 11% from a year earlier.
Its 35% slide in pretax profit to $3.1 billion beat a consensus estimate of $2.07 billion as HSBC flagged an easing in bad loan provisions.
""While the outlook for impairments still remains highly uncertain... HSBC delivered strong third-quarter results in overall terms and the upbeat outlook commentary in terms of strategy execution is reassuring,"" analyst John Cronin at Dublin-based broker Goodbody said.
HSBC now expects losses from bad loans to be at the lower end of the $8-$13 billion range it set out earlier this year.
""There are encouraging signs that the credit assumptions we have got are holding up, the government support we are seeing for the corporate sector has bought them time,"" Stevenson told investors on a conference call. 
RESTRUCTURING REVVED UP 
Faced with fewer options to bolster revenue growth, Asia-focused HSBC has been looking to reduce costs globally and in June resumed plans to cut around 35,000 jobs it had put on ice after the coronavirus outbreak.
The bank has no immediate plans to cut more jobs, Stevenson told Reuters, but that could happen as its transformation plans continue.
HSBC said on Tuesday it plans to reduce annual costs to below $31 billion by 2022, a more ambitious target than it set out in February and well below the operating expenses of $42.3 billion it reported in 2019.
It will also accelerate the transformation of its U.S. business, where it has long struggled to compete with much bigger players, and will provide an update at its 2020 results in February.
HSBC, which in common with other British lenders stopped paying dividends earlier this year at the request of regulators, said it would communicate a revised dividend policy in February.
Analysts and investors fear the lender could cut payouts in the long run.

""When we start paying distributions again, we'll start conservatively and build from there,"" Stevenson said on the conference call.

The Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH (EFW) joint venture between Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd (SI:STEG) will expand beyond Singapore allowing it to convert around 25 planes each year to meet rising demand for dedicated cargo aircraft, they said in a statement.
About half of the air cargo carried worldwide normally flies in the belly of passenger jets rather than in dedicated freighters. But pandemic-related flight cuts due to weak travel demand have squeezed air freight capacity.

 Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) also impressed, with its stock rising 4.2% after recording third-quarter net profit of 1.75 billion euros ($2.1 billion), a strong bounce after posting the first loss in its 163-year history in the second quarter.
BP  (LON:BP) (NYSE:BP) stock rose 2.4% after the oil major returned to profit in the third quarter, reporting underlying replacement cost profit of $86 million, a big improvement on its massive second-quarter loss of $6.7 billion.

(Reuters) - South Korea's powerful Lee family faces a battle to maintain control of Samsung Group, the country's biggest conglomerate, following the death of patriarch and group Chairman Lee Kun-hee. 
From the astronomical inheritance tax bill to potential legal obstacles, here are some of the issues the family faces as it seeks to stay on top of the business empire founded back in 1938. 
CROWN JEWEL
The family is expected to focus on maintaining control of the conglomerate's crown jewel Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd (KS:005930), but family members' combined direct stake ownership is only at 5.8%. 
Their outsized control is made possible through their shareholding in  Samsung Life  Insurance (KS:032830), which holds 8.5% of the flagship chipmaker, and Samsung C&T Corp (KS:028260), which owns 5%. 
The majority of the late chairman's assets were a 4.18% stake in Samsung Electronics, worth about 15 trillion won ($13.3 billion), which the family is expected to try to inherit entirely. 
Heir apparent Jay Y. Lee's direct stake in Samsung Electronics is just 0.7% but he exercises control primarily through his 17.3% stake in Samsung C&T, which in turn is the second-largest shareholder of Samsung Life Insurance - a major shareholder of Samsung Electronics.
HEFTY INHERITANCE TAX 
If the family inherits Lee's stocks, the total tax bill is estimated to top 10 trillion won ($9 billion). It can be paid in instalments; one-sixth must be paid initially, then the rest over five years, meaning annual payments can exceed $1 billion. 
MONEY TO PAY THE TAX
The Lee family can sell their stocks in information service provider Samsung SDS (KS:018260) and other non-core affiliates to pay the tax.
Dividends totalling about 702 billion won a year from their combined holdings in Samsung affiliates can also be used, which will add up to about 32% of the annual tax bill, according to Choi Nam-kon, an analyst at Yuanta Securities.
The shortfall may have to be covered with loans or partial sales of stakes they hold or will inherit in Samsung Life Insurance and Samsung Electronics.
""The view is that selling part of the stake in Samsung Electronics during the inheritance process may be unavoidable,"" said Jeong Dae-ro, analyst at Mirae Asset Daewoo Securities.
Such stake sales could weaken the family's direct control of Samsung Electronics. 
LEGAL OBSTACLES
Proposed legislation making it tougher for insurance companies to hold large stakes in non-financial affiliates relative to their assets could force Samsung Life to sell about $20 billion in shares in Samsung Electronics and cripple the Lee's family's grip on the chipmaker. 
To ensure the Lee family keeps control, Samsung Life may try to sell its stake to Samsung C&T, which would in turn unload stakes in other units to come up with the funds.

The passage of the law remains uncertain as it could be unpopular with retail investors ahead of a presidential election in early 2022.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street faces a rocky run-up to Election Day, with mounting worries about the outcome in Washington adding to nerves about the coronavirus pandemic and fading chances of stimulus.
The Cboe Volatility Index, Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" surged to 32.46, its highest closing level since Sept. 3., while the S&P 500 had its biggest one-day drop, with investors reluctant to buy ahead of the vote.
""What we're seeing today is people setting up for Election Night: raising cash to preserve capital, lock in capital gains at a lower rate, and to have some cash available for the growing eventuality of lower prices,"" said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas.
Investors have been betting on a win by Democratic challenger Joe Biden by buying alternative energy shares and cannabis stocks, which are expected to benefit from his policy proposals. Bond yields have climbed, partly in anticipation of greater stimulus under a Biden administration. 
Some of those bets looked a bit weaker on Monday. For instance, the Invesco Solar ETF was down 2.1% and bond yields slipped. 
Before Monday, investors appeared to be dialing back on election-related volatility bets on the expectation of a clean win. As stocks fell, however, VIX futures rose along with the volatility index. 
Now market watchers worry that an unexpected victory by President Donald Trump, a Republican, or an uncertain election outcome could force drastic unwinding of positions similar to what occurred in 2016, when investors were overwhelmingly positioned for a Hillary Clinton presidency.
Biden still leads in national opinion polls by 7.9 percentage points, though Trump has increased his standing in battleground states Georgia and Michigan, according to polling aggregator RealClearPolitics. 
A surprise victory by Trump could lead to a post-election jump similar to that in 2016 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks/wall-street-surges-after-trump-wins-white-house-idUSKBN1332TA, when a rally in drugmakers and financial companies helped reverse deep overnight losses and pushed the S&P 500 up more than 1%, the start of a surge through the end of the year. 
J.P. Morgan analysts said on Monday that the best outcome for equities is an ""orderly"" Trump victory, with the S&P 500 potentially catapulting to 3,900. A divided government could be a net positive, they said, while a Democratic White House and Congress would be neutral with the potential for a larger stimulus weighed against higher corporate taxes.
Signs of a close election tend to lead to more volatility in the run-up to Election Day, said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco. 
""The polls appear to be narrowing...and what that causes is just more uncertainty,"" he said. 
Overall, the S&P 500 is up approximately 5% for the year to date and remains about 5% below its record high posted in early September. Since then, a widely expected fiscal stimulus bill in Washington has stalled and the U.S. has posted its highest-ever numbers https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/u-s-sees-highest-number-of-new-covid-19-cases-in-past-two-days-idUSKBN27A0JK of new coronavirus cases.

The deep drops in the stock market Monday have ""to do with the lack of a stimulus package and concerns about the pending election,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""There's nervousness on both those issues.""

732,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 03:06AM ET</span>",Vale dam-break trauma raises level of ESG funds in Brazil,"By Sabrina Valle
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Many Brazilian investors - dazzled by iron ore miner Vale SA's (SA:VALE3) resilient cash flow - were ready to forgive the company within months of a deadly dam disaster in 2019, piling back into its shares after an initial selloff.
But not everyone was as willing to continue as if nothing had happened.
The company's second lethal dam disaster in three years was a formative moment for ethical investment in Brazil, where criteria based on environmental and governance concerns had long been dismissed as ideological.
""Our fund suffered a lot. Vale was by far our main position,"" said Marcio Correia, stock manager at Rio de Janeiro based JGP, which in common with other fund managers suffered as the stock lost a quarter of its value within days of the dam burst.
""We realized we were overlooking the risks associated with mining, the climate issue, and we decided to take it seriously.""
In response, the 34 billion reais ($6.07 billion) asset management firm co-founded in the 1990s by Paulo Guedes, now Brazil's economy minister, sold two thirds of its Vale share holdings.
That August, it also established its first dedicated fund guided by ESG - environmental, social and governance criteria.
Other local investors also began to realize ESG issues had major financial implications.
""The Vale disaster was game-changing in Brazil,"" said Eduardo Dumans, a partner of Sao Paulo-based asset management Constellation.
By September this year, around 20 self-styled sustainable funds had lured some 1 billion reais, twice as much as 18 months earlier, the association of Brazilian financial institutions Anbima said. The country still lags the international trend.
Brazil’s three leading ESG investment firms manage less than 50 billion reais. Two of them have funds that do not exclude all polluting industries, although they use ESG data to help decide on investments.
Worldwide, funds that integrate ESG criteria managed $30 trillion when the Brumadinho dam disaster happened, figures from the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance show.
""If Vale commits to changes, it will be because of international investors, not much because of the ones in Brazil,"" said Fabio Alperowitch, portfolio manager of Fama, a 2.5 billion reais firm known as a pioneer of sustainable investment in Brazil.
But he says ESG is at last catching on in Brazil.
""I see all of this with a mix of hate and love. I've been advocating for this for 30 years and for a long time no one could care less,"" he said. ""Now it has become trendy.""
SAFETY OBSESSION
Vale has taken action to try to regain trust.
""Safety has become an obsession, and the company believes that the integration of ESG in our routine will be essential for Vale's de-risking,"" it said in a written response to questions from Reuters.
It has set aside 18.6 billion reais for cleaning up and restoring the environment and to compensate victims following the 2019 dam burst. So far, it has spent more than 10 billion reais of the sum.
Its efforts to address ESG issues helped to persuade ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) to restore Vale's investment grade rating on Oct. 1.
Still Vale has the lowest company valuation multiple among the top global miners, based on its enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) ratio, a commonly-used metric.
JGP and other ethically-focused Brazilian funds say Vale's reduced value reflects continued investor doubts about its ability to meet ESG targets without compromising production.
Restoring its reputation is particularly hard in that the Brumadinho collapse in January 2019, which killed 270 people, occurred only just over three years after another dam burst at Samarco in Nov. 2015 that left 19 dead in Brazil's worst environmental disaster.
JGP has ruled out any Vale share purchases until August 2021 - which would mark two years since the creation of its dedicated ESG fund.
Correia said the ban could be extended unless Vale convinces investors of its commitment to good practice and to measures to prevent new accidents, protect the environment and improve its behavior when mining in indigenous lands.
Responding to Reuters' questions, Vale said its safety measures included reducing its use of dams that store mining waste known as tailings in favor of safer dry stacking.
In addition, it said 20% of long-term compensation targets for its senior management will be based on ESG performance without giving a specific timeframe.
But Dumans at Constellation, which has 13 billion reais under management and includes Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann among its minority stakeholders, said he would not consider Vale.
ESG aside, he said Constellation avoids volatile asset classes such as metals.
But without risk, there is no reward. Iron ore prices hit a six-year high in mid-September making major iron ore producer Vale appear a bargain.

""The tricky thing is that Vale is cheap compared to its peers so it attracts investors,"" Correia said.

733,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 03:01AM ET</span>",European Stocks Set to Rise at Open; HSBC Puts Banking Sector in Focus,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen edging higher at the open Tuesday, rallying after Monday’s sharp losses, but the growing incidence of coronavirus cases continues to cast a shadow over the region.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%. 
Wall Street closed substantially lower on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 2.3% overnight, the S&P 500 losing 1.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.6%. This followed weakness in Europe, with the DAX ending down 3.7%, the CAC 1.9% lower and the FTSE 100 off 1.2%.
The number of Covid-19 cases continued its incessant rise, with over 43.4 million cases globally as of Oct. 27, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Europe has been hard hit by this second wave of the virus, with France, for example, on Monday seeing the highest number of coronavirus patients going into hospital since April. This has resulted in a number of countries imposing new restrictions--Spain has announced a state of emergency for six months--curtailing economic activity.
This increases expectations of action by the European Central Bank when its governing council meets on Thursday, although the consensus view is that the bank will only announce fresh stimulus at its December meeting.
An additional source of concern for the markets is the fading prospect of a new U.S. coronavirus relief package. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday that she remained hopeful an agreement can be reached before the Nov. 3 elections, but this looks increasingly unlikely.
In corporate news, HSBC (LON:HSBA) is likely to be in the spotlight after the banking giant reported third-quarter pretax profit of $3.1 billion, a smaller-than-expected 35% drop from a year earlier The U.K.-based, Asian-focused bank also signaled a quick return to dividend payments.
Rival  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) also beat expectations, recording third-quarter net profit of 1.75 billion euros ($2.1 billion), a strong bounce after posting the first loss in its 163-year history in the second quarter.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, rebounding to a degree after Monday’s hefty losses, but the surge in coronavirus cases in the U.S. and Europe means sentiment remains gloomy.
Hurricane Zeta is due to make U.S. landfall on Wednesday, with rigs and refineries shutting down in preparation for its arrival, while traders also await crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the session.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% higher at $38.98 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.1% to $41.27. Both contracts fell more than 3% on Monday.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,909.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1828."
734,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 02:27AM ET</span>","Santander Rebounds from Historic Loss With Profit, Capital Boost","(Bloomberg) --  Banco Santander  SA (NYSE:SAN) rebounded from its worst-ever quarter with profit that beat estimates and improved capital as it seeks to convince regulators that its balance sheet is strong enough to resume dividend payments.
After recording the first loss in its 163-year history in the second quarter, net income totaled 1.75 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in the third, beating estimates of about 1 billion euros, the bank said on Tuesday. The CET1 ratio, a key measure of capital strength, improved to 11.98% from 11.84% at the end of June.
The results strengthen a push by lenders to overturn the European Central Bank’s de-facto ban on paying dividends, which has pushed down share prices. Santander (MC:SAN) Chairman Ana Botin has argued that the measure is harmful not only to bank stocks but also to the economy as a whole because it restricts the flow of capital and increases the cost of equity.
Santander was boosted by its operations in Brazil, as the third-quarter earnings once again highlighted diverging fortunes between Europe and its the bank’s more successful businesses in the Americas.
The bank expects underlying profit for the full year to reach 5 billion euros, compared with estimates of 3.66 billion euros.
Profit was lifted by better-than-expected cost savings, the bank said. The lender held back 2.5 billion euros for loan losses in the quarter after 7 billion euros of provisions in the first half. Net interest income fell from a year earlier to 7.77 billion euros.
Santander will hold a shareholders meeting on Tuesday to vote on a proposed dividend for this year’s earnings.

(Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Tuesday as investors were unnerved by the soaring global coronavirus cases that dampened the recovery outlook and slow progress on a U.S. stimulus deal.
U.S. shares however were set to bounce back from Wall Street's worst day in a month with E-mini futures for the S&P 500 up 0.23%. London's FTSE futures edged up 0.02%.
MSCI's gauge of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was down 0.43%, while Australia's ASX 200 closed down 1.7%, in its worst session in a month.
China's CSI300 Index pared morning losses, as investors looked out for any news from a meeting of China's Communist Party leaders to set the next five-year plan. 
""Two events in the next few days will shape the policy outlook for the world’s two largest economies: China’s 14th Five-Year Plan and the U.S. elections,"" said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
""The recent surge in infections in the U.S. and Europe is also denting market sentiment.""
Rising coronavirus cases around the world are forcing some countries to impose new curbs, risking derailing any global economic recovery.
Data out earlier also showed China's industrial profits grew at a slower pace in September, suggesting a recovery in the manufacturing sector of the world's second-largest economy has yet to solidify.
In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped 0.11% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was down 0.76%. 
China's Ant Group, will close its Hong Kong institutional book building a day earlier than planned as it aims to raise about $17.2 billion in the city, Reuters reported on Tuesday. The group, controlled by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) founder Jack Ma, is set to raise up to $34.4 billion in a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai in the world's largest IPO.
U.S. indices fell sharply overnight over the double whammy of record coronavirus cases and political deadlock in negotiations to provide more economic aid.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters on Monday that talks over a coronavirus relief package have slowed, though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi remained hopeful an agreement can be reached before the Nov. 3 elections. 
""The challenge for markets is that in most cases they are already pricing a very strong economic bounce. The new outbreaks, and the potential for a double-dip recession, directly contradict this assumption,"" Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.
National polls give Democrat Joe Biden a solid lead over president Donald Trump but the contest is much tighter in battleground states that could decide the outcome.
The sharp stock market decline set a bleak tone ahead of a busy third-quarter earnings season, with large U.S. tech firms like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc set to report.  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) reports its results Tuesday. 
The dollar was down 0.153% during the Asia day to trade at 92.932 against a basket of six major currencies.
Much of the trading in currency markets, as well as other asset markets, was buffeted by the renewed coronavirus fears. 
Oil prices eked out small gains on Tuesday after recent sharp losses, but sentiment remained subdued as surging global coronavirus cases hit prospects for crude demand while supply is rising. Brent crude was up 35 cents, or 0.87%, at $40.81 a barrel, having dropped more than 3% overnight. U.S. oil was up 30 cents, or 0.78%, at $38.86 a barrel, after also declining more than 3% on Monday.

The safe-haven Spot gold added 0.32% to $1,907.64 an ounce.

The book was due to close on Thursday, but that deadline will be accelerated to Wednesday 5.00 p.m. in each region.
The order book was oversubscribed one hour after the launch on Monday, two separate sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Ant Group declined to comment on the planned early closure of the Hong Kong institutional book, which is part of its world record initial public offering (IPO).
It is looking to raise up to $34.4 billion in a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai, with the offer split between the two exchanges, giving it a valuation of about $312 billion. 
The sources asked not be identified as they were not authorised to comment to media. 
Ant, which operates China's biggest mobile payments platform Alipay, is an affiliate of e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group Holding (N:BABA) (HK:9988).
It will offer 41.76 million shares, or 2.5% of its total shares in Hong Kong, to retail investors whose demand to buy the stock is expected to be strong. 
Hong Kong operates a 'clawback' system where heavy oversubscription from small investors can result in them getting a greater share.
The prospectus shows the total amount will be increased to 167.1 million shares, or 10% of the deal, if the initial retail allocation is more than 20 times oversubscribed.
The city's brokers are readying billions of dollars of margin financing to lend to customers to buy the stock..

Retail investors need to finalise and pay for the shares they have bid for by Friday, according to Ant's prospectus.

The venture “is a strong candidate for a full digital banking license,” DBS analyst Sachin Mittal wrote in the report published Tuesday. Singtel may need to make the investment over the “long term,” he said.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore plans to award as many as five permits by the end of this year, including two for full digital banks for consumers -- the category that the Grab-Singtel venture has applied for.
The Grab-Singtel consortium has the potential to win a 2% to 4% share of the local consumer market excluding mortgages in five years, and may break even over a similar time frame, Mittal said. Singtel, majority owned by state-owned investor Temasek Holdings Pte., should be able to build trust among its customers and take in bank deposits, he said.
A spokeswoman for Singtel declined to comment.
Grab holds a 60% stake in the digital bank venture, and the remainder is owned by Singtel. The group hired Charles Wong, a 20-year veteran at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). in Singapore, for the venture earlier this year.
Other contenders for the full-bank permits are Sea Ltd., which is backed by Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd., a consortium led by Razer Inc., another involving V3 Group Ltd., and a venture between Singapura Finance and Matchmove Ltd., according to the report.

739,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 11:09PM ET</span>",Ant IPO By the Numbers: It’s Bigger Than Finland’s GDP,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s no shortage of superlatives for Ant Group Co.’s initial public offering. Here’s a look at some of the key metrics, and why billionaire Jack Ma seems to be such a fan of the number eight.
IPO: $34.5 Billion
Ant’s $34.5 billion IPO blows past the previous record, set last year by  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) at $29 billion. Ant’s money raise will likely jump another $5.2 billion once bankers sell additional shares to meet demand in what’s known as the greenshoe option. This chart of the 10 biggest IPOs also reflects the growing economic clout of Asia. The top five are all from Asia or the Middle East, and eight of the 10 are from the region, including Ma’s online giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp.
Valuation: $315 Billion
Ant’s IPO puts the company’s valuation at dizzying heights. At about $315 billion, Ant is worth more than the gross domestic products of Egypt, Chile or Finland. For corporate comparisons, it’s bigger than JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., the biggest U.S. bank. Ant is larger than payment rival Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) Inc., media giant Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. and dwarfs Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). It’s three times bigger than tech giant  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp. and four times larger than  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Wealthy Eight
Ma appears to be a big fan of the number eight, which is often associated with wealth in China. Eight is pronounced “ba” and rhymes with the word for “prosperity” or “getting rich” in Mandarin. As a result, couples often try to get married in August, the 8th month, while eight is a popular number for street addresses and apartment floors. The 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics opening ceremonies began at 8 p.m. on Aug. 8.
Ant is knee-deep in eight. The stock ticker in Shanghai will be 688688; in Hong Kong it’s 6688. Six is also considered a lucky number in China. The shares were priced in Shanghai at 68.8 yuan and at HK$80 in Hong Kong. Ma’s Alibaba Group, which owns about a third of Ant, trades under the ticker 9988 in Hong Kong.
The eight focus seems to be working for Ma. Alibaba has soared since its Hong Kong listing last year, up 69%, trouncing the Hang Seng index, which is down 8% over that period.
76 Billion Shares
Ant’s IPO was expected to attract investors from all over the world and that’s borne out in the demand for shares. Institutional investors put in orders for 76 billion shares, more than 284 times the initial offering, according to the Shanghai filing. Brokers were willing to lend individual investors credit worth 20 times their investment so they could load up on the shares. Ant is planning to stop taking investor orders for the Hong Kong leg a day earlier than scheduled as the share sale has already been heavily subscribed, according to people familiar with the matter.
$71.6 Billion Fortune
Ma, the former English teacher who co-founded Alibaba with $60,000, is poised to become the world’s 11th-richest person after the Ant IPO.
Ma’s 8.8% stake is worth $27.4 billion based on the stock pricing in Hong Kong and Shanghai. That will lift the 56-year-old’s fortune to $71.6 billion on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, exceeding that of  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL).’s Larry Ellison, L’Oreal SA heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers and individual members of the Waltons, whose family own Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.

Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou arrived in the British Columbia Supreme Court on Monday for the first of five days of hearings as her U.S. extradition case resumed.
This week's hearings will focus on abuse of process committed by Canadian and U.S. authorities during her December 2018 arrest at Vancouver International Airport, as alleged by her lawyers. The case has intensified diplomatic tensions between China and the two North American nations.
Meng, 48, is charged by the United States with bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei's [HWT.UL] business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to break U.S. sanction laws.
She denies the charges and is fighting extradition from under house arrest in Vancouver.
Meng's lawyers have argued that Canadian authorities improperly communicated with their U.S. counterparts, including allegedly sharing identifying details about her electronic devices.
Canada has denied this and provided affidavits from members of the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) who were involved in Meng's arrest.
Meng arrived in court wearing a black sparkly cardigan, knitted blue top and grey skirt, accompanied by her translator as she came face to face with Winston Yep, a RCMP officer who arrested her nearly two years ago.
Meng's lawyers have alleged that authorities used the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and its powers to search passengers to investigate Meng in a way that violated her rights.
Government lawyer John Gibb-Carsley asked Yep why, as the arresting officer, he didn't board the plane once Meng had landed. Yep said that because the airport is within the CBSA's jurisdiction it was decided that the CBSA would do its work first.
Yep said ""there was no concern"" about this process and added other passengers on the plane created a potential risk of violence if they made the arrest on the aircraft.
Meng's team has asserted that the CBSA inappropriately seized her electronic devices and that identifying information was shared with U.S. authorities.
Yep said the RCMP asked the CBSA to seize Meng's devices on a request from the United States and to put them in Faraday bags, which prevent data from being erased.
He added the request was ""part of the process"" and presented no cause for concern.
Gibb-Carsley asked whether Yep's supervisor expressed concern about the CBSA investigating before the RCMP.
""No,"" Yep said, adding that his supervisor was concerned Meng might elude CBSA and escape the airport, a concern that Yep shared.
However, Huawei lawyer Richard Peck said Yep's concern about potential violence on the plane was disingenuous and that as trained officers, the RCMP should have been able to arrest Meng there.
Peck also described Yep’s written notes from the day as ""very sparse"" and drew attention to the fact that Yep had not written a chronological report of the day, as required by Canada's extradition laws.
Calling live witnesses in an extradition case is ""very, very unusual,"" said Leo Adler, a Toronto-based extradition lawyer, particularly if both sides will be able to cross-examine. Adler is not involved with the case.
Meng's team was able to do that based on documents released to them, Adler said, another aspect that is rare in extradition cases.
Meng's case, which is expected to last years, has strained relations between Ottawa and Beijing. Soon after her detention, China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig on espionage charges.
Hearings are scheduled to wrap up in April 2021.

(Reuters) - Casino operator  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) Corp is exploring a sale of its flagship casinos in Las Vegas for about $6 billion, a source told Reuters on Monday, with the move likely to mark the exit of the group's chairman from the U.S. gambling industry for now.
The properties included in the potential sale are Sands Expo Convention Center, the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Palazzo, the source added, asking not to be identified.
A potential sale of the Las Vegas properties will concentrate the company's casino portfolio entirely in Macau and Singapore.
Bloomberg reported earlier that Las Vegas Sands is working with an adviser to solicit interest from potential suitors, with a company representative cited by the news outlet confirming there were early discussions about a sale and that nothing has been finalised. 
In May, Sands ended plans to open an integrated resort casino in Japan without providing a reason for the cancellation of the project. 
The gambling industry, which thrives on air travel and large groups of people in close proximity, is one of the hardest hit industries amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
As of June 30, the company had $13.82 billion total outstanding debt, excluding finance leases. 
Chairman and chief executive of the group, Sheldon Adelson, said in the second quarter that a ""recovery process from the COVID-19 pandemic in each of our markets is now under way.""
The company reported a third-quarter loss of 74 cents on revenue of $586 million. Revenue fell 82% from a year earlier.
In August, rating agency Fitch Ratings revised the outlook on the company to 'negative' from 'stable' due to market conditions brought about by the pandemic.

Fitch had said back then that near-term prospects for the group's business remained ""dim"" and ""lackluster"" in Las Vegas.

The lawsuit was filed by Marla Crawford, a former associate general counsel at the bank, against Goldman Sachs, the bank's General Counsel Karen Seymour and its Global Head of Litigation, Darrell Cafasso.
The lawsuit claimed Cafasso used his position of power to ""romantically prey upon a much younger and vulnerable female colleague."" 
Crawford, who was a confidant of the alleged victim, attempted to speak up about the alleged misconduct, the lawsuit said, and was subsequently fired after 10 years of ""exemplary performance."" 
Seymour and Goldman hired law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP to conduct an investigation with the intention to quickly ""sweep it under the rug,"" the lawsuit claimed. Cafasso returned to work after two weeks, while the alleged victim - who is unnamed in the lawsuit - left the bank, it said.
Seymour declined to comment. Cafasso was not available for comment. 
Goldman Sachs rejected the claims in the lawsuit.
""We conducted a review of the allegations in this complaint and found that they were completely without merit,"" a spokeswoman said. 
""The General Counsel took all appropriate actions, including ensuring there were thorough investigations by our HR function, after the incidents that form the basis of the plaintiff's complaint,"" she added.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.3%, or 650 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%.
Coronavirus infections in the U.S. hit a record, adding more than 85,000 through Saturday, Bloomberg reported, after surpassing the previous record on Friday of 83,757 new cases.
Positive remarks on stimulus talks, meanwhile, did little to lift expectations the economy would receive a fiscal boost before the U.S. election on Nov. 3.
""As the nation faces record spikes in new COVID cases, we continue to eagerly await the Administration's acceptance of our health language, which includes a national strategic plan on... testing and tracing. We are hopeful their response will be positive as we also await the outcomes of talks between committee chairs. It is clear that our progress depends on Leader McConnell agreeing to bipartisan, comprehensive legislation to crush the virus, honor our heroes - our essential workers - and put money in the pockets of the American people. The Speaker remains optimistic that an agreement can be reached before the election,"" said Drew Hammill, who is Speaker Nancy Pelosi's deputy chief of staff.
Energy and industrials led the move lower in value stocks, with the latter down on heavy selling in airline stocks as the spike in cases raised concerns that restrictions to curb infections could prompt airlines to cut capacity further.

In other aviation news, Boeing (NYSE:BA) ended 4% lower after China threatened tariffs on the aircraft maker and other defense contractors over arms sales to Taiwan.

Investing.com -- U.S. markets tumbled on Monday, with just over one week until the Nov. 3 election and at the start of a heavy week for company earnings reports.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed more than 800 points at midday, closing down around 649 points. That is sure to be unwelcome news in President Donald Trump’s camp. The Republican candidate has been campaigning on economic recovery hopes and frequently points to the stock market as a symbol of his success.
Monday’s culprit: A worrisome spike in new coronavirus infections even as Trump said over the weekend that the U.S. was turning the corner on the pandemic. Not helping: Congressional negotiations stalling out on a new round of stimulus to help the economy recover from Covid-related lockdowns.
Business owners and consumers in hot spot states -- which seems to make up most of the U.S. -- now face the possibility that things might have to shut down again if record numbers of infections can’t be contained. Already in Europe, governments have had to reimpose restrictions.
Big U.S. companies are on tap to report their most recent quarterly results this week, with Tuesday’s calendar including pharmaceutical giants, industrial companies and Microsoft. A consumer confidence reading is also on the schedule. 
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow.
1. Drug maker profits as investors await news on Covid treatments
Four major drug makers tee off profit reports before the opening bell as investors crave any information at all about the progress of possible Covid vaccines and treatments. 
Profits for Merck & Company Inc (NYSE:MRK) are expected to be $1.44 a share on revenue of $12 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) profits are expected to be 69 cents a share on revenue of $12.3 billion. 
 Novartis AG  ADR (NYSE:NVS) is seen reporting profit of $1.44 a share on revenue of $12.6 billion, and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is expected to report earnings of $1.71 a share on revenue of $5.9 billion.
2. Big-name industrials and tech also expected
 Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) is expected to report profit of $1.17 on revenue of $9.7 billion, and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is seen posting $2.26 a share on revenue of $8.31 billion.
On the tech side, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) is seen posting profit of 35 cents on revenue of $2.6 billion, while Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is expected to report $1.54 on revenue of $35.7 billion.
3. Measuring consumer confidence heading into election
Consumer confidence readings for October will come out at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT). The expected number is 102, which would be slightly higher than 101.8 the prior month.
The reading is important as a sign that there is support for spending, which drives two-thirds of U.S. economic output. Millions of households are feeling the pressure of lost jobs and wages, and Congress remains stalled on negotiations for another relief package.

The sector, one of the worst hit by the pandemic, is still operating with limited sit-down options in some places but has begun recovering from lows in March and April, when government mandates brought dine-in services to a halt. 
Since then, companies have invested in hiring staff, cleaning supplies, drive-thrus and delivery, weighing on profits. Rising commodity costs have also been eating into earnings. 
Domino's Pizza Inc (N:DPZ) said cheese prices went from their lowest in the second quarter to record rates in the third quarter.  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG), which brought carne asada back to its menu, said high beef prices dented profits. 
Both companies recently reported underwhelming earnings largely hurt by higher coronavirus-related expenses, even as sales rose and revenue beat expectations. 
Starbucks, which is still recovering from the loss of morning business as people work from home, reports on Thursday. 
""While the pace of Starbucks' top line recovery will continue to be closely watched, the timing of the FY21 margin recovery will also be a key focus for investors and the subject of debate,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Christopher Carril wrote in a note. 
Carril noted the coffee chain paid out about $300 million in the previous quarter for sick pay and enhanced frontline pay for store employees.
Restaurant Brands International Inc (TO:QSR) is to report Tuesday. The operator in its preliminary quarterly report said Burger King and Tim Hortons struggled but Popeyes' sales continued to grow on demand for its chicken sandwiches.

Investors will look to Tuesday's report as a ""show-me story,"" though ""there is limited visibility into the unit growth outlook,"" wrote  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Lauren Silberman.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Pacific Ethanol  Inc (O:PEIX) will change its name to reflect its focus on specialty alcohols used in alcoholic beverages and sanitizers rather than on fuel ethanol, the company said on Monday.
Pacific has increased production of specialty alcohol for consumer products over the past nine months, it said, as the coronavirus pandemic has boosted demand for hand sanitizer and other products that promote hand hygiene.
The pandemic, meanwhile, has weighed on fuel demand because of government-imposed travel restrictions and remote working.

Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of Ant and affiliate  Alibaba  Group Holding (HK:9988) (N:BABA), said it was a ""miracle"" that such a large listing is taking place outside New York. 
Ant's looming market debut had been clouded by concerns over growing regulatory scrutiny at home for its lucrative consumer credit business as well as a U.S. State Department proposal to add the company to a trade blacklist.
Global investors, however, have largely shrugged off those concerns as they bet on continued rapid growth of a group that also operates China's biggest mobile payments platform and distributes wealth management and insurance products.
""The fear of missing out and the lack of other opportunities of this calibre"" was spurring investor interest in the IPO, said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at investment adviser United First Partners in Singapore.
BOOKS OVERSUBSCRIBED
Ant's order books on the Hong Kong offering to institutional investors was oversubscribed one hour after the launch, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Many prospective investors placed orders worth at least $1 billion in the first hour, said one of the sources, adding that the number of the institutional orders could reach about 1,000.
Ant declined to comment on investor demand. 
Headquartered in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, Ant is aiming to raise about $17.2 billion in Shanghai and roughly the same in Hong Kong.
The group has earmarked 80% of its domestic offering to 29 strategic investors that will be locked up for at least one year. A wholly-owned unit of Alibaba has agreed to purchase 44% of the Shanghai float.
Other strategic investors in the Shanghai float include China's National Council for Social Security Fund, a unit of Singapore state investor Temasek Holding, as well as Singaporean and Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds GIC and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. 
Large Chinese insurers and mutual funds will also have shares allocated via the strategic investor route, Monday's filing showed. 
RECORD DEBUT
Ant shares are expected to start trading in Hong Kong and Shanghai on Nov. 5, two days after the U.S. election.
The company set the price tag for the Shanghai leg of the listing at 68.8 yuan ($10.27) per share and HK$80 ($10.32) per share for the Hong Kong tranche, the exchange filings showed.
The price represents a multiple of 31.4 times Ant's 2021 earnings and 24.2 times its 2022 earnings forecast, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
By comparison, Alibaba is trading at 34.28 times trailing 12-month earnings in Hong Kong. 
Ant declined to comment on the price multiples.
The group's China listing would eclipse the record set there previously by Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF)'s (SS:601288) $10.1 billion float in 2010. The record in Hong Kong was set by insurance major AIA's $20.5 billion offering in 2010.
The bookbuilding for the Hong Kong leg will run from Monday to Friday, while books for the Shanghai leg open for one day on Thursday.
Ant's IPO would also serve to burnish STAR's status.
Companies raised $22.5 billion via IPOs and secondary listings on STAR between the start of the year and mid-October, making it the third-biggest stock market behind Nasdaq and Hong Kong, Refinitiv data shows.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU plans to set out criteria specifying the kind of dominant companies that will face tougher rules, Europe's antitrust chief said on Monday, in a move that will likely affect Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who is drafting rules known as the Digital Services Act which will spell out how data should be shared and how digital marketplaces should operate, said she was looking into a list of criteria to define market influence or weight.
""Well obviously it will not be targeted at any specific company or any specific nationality. What is important is that they target a certain market weight, market influence and this is what will be guiding these criteria that we will set out,"" she told Reuters in an interview.
""We are not done yet with this list of criteria but obviously we do not work backwards, from a list of companies to a list of criteria.
""We try to sort of set out a list of criteria so that businesses that have that kind of weight in the market, that kind of market influence where they do their business, that they will be within the scope of the legislation,"" Vestager said.
She said working with a list of criteria rather than a list of names would be a more durable approach.
Vestager is scheduled to announce her proposal on Dec. 2 after which the Commission will negotiate with EU countries and the European Parliament to agree on legislation, a process which could take a year or two.

Apple, Facebook and Google have said any new rules should be reasonable, proportionate and based on clear parameters.

The revised deal, expected to close on Oct. 30, sent Spirit AeroSystems shares down 7% while Bombardier stock edged 2.3% shares higher in midday trading.
Spirit caused jitters among Bombardier investors in late September when it raised uncertainty over the deal's closing. 
Montreal-based Bombardier is shedding assets amid broader plans to become a pure-play business-jet maker, and pay down some of its $9.3 billion in debt.
The two companies first agreed to a deal in 2019.
Bombardier said in a statement on Monday that Spirit would now assume at least $824 million in liabilities. Bombardier said in October 2019 that the U.S. company would assume at least $700 million in liabilities under the original deal.
Spirit said separately that its liabilities were unchanged and the total enterprise valuation of the unit stood at $865 million, down from a prior $1.09 billion. 
The revised agreement includes a facility in Belfast which produces wings for Airbus SE's (PA:AIR) A220 jet, which is considered politically sensitive as the largest high-tech manufacturer in Northern Ireland.
In September, French train maker  Alstom  SA (PA:ALSO) lowered its offer to acquire Bombardier's rail business by $350 million, in a deal to create the world's second-largest rail company by next year.
Bombardier's restructuring comes amid broader turmoil in the aerospace sector because of the pandemic, which has grounded flights across the globe, weakened valuations and some companies' appetite for deals.
Earlier this month,  Air Canada  (TO:AC) slashed its price to buy Canadian tour operator Transat A.T. Inc (TO:TRZ) by nearly 75% as the coronavirus pandemic weighs on travel demand.

Prosecutors in Stuttgart had looked at whether Winterkorn had manipulated markets by delaying the disclosure of VW’s emissions scandal in 2015. VW in September that year admitted using engine control software to cheat U.S. diesel emission tests, battering its share price.
Until his resignation in 2015 in the wake of the scandal, Winterkorn was both CEO of Volkswagen and of the group's main shareholder, Stuttgart-based Porsche SE.
A spokeswoman for the Stuttgart prosecutors said the investigation was dropped because any penalty imposed by the court there would have little significance compared to what could result from the Braunschweig proceedings.
A lawyer for Winterkorn has said his client denies the charges. 

Should Winterkorn be acquitted by the Braunschweig court Stuttgart prosecutors may decide to resume their investigation, she said.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks decline picked pace on Monday afternoon, setting the Dow for its worst day in more than seven weeks, as soaring coronavirus cases and a political deadlock over the fiscal relief bill raised doubts about the fate of the economy recovery.
New infections have touched record levels in the United States, with El Paso in Texas asking citizens to stay at home for the next two weeks. In Europe, Italy and Spain imposed new restrictions.
Travel-related stocks, vulnerable to COVID-19 related curbs, dropped. The S&P 1500 airlines index fell 5% and cruise line operators Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises Ltd shed more than 9.5% each.
""People are nervous about the expansion in cases,"" said Christopher C. Grisanti, chief equity strategist, MAI Capital Management, Cleveland, Ohio. 
""The administration has said it does not want to slow down the economy yet as cases rise they may not have a choice.""
Energy index tracked a more than 3% fall in oil prices. Other economically-sensitive industrials and financials sectors posted the steepest percentage declines among S&P sectors. (O/R)
Meanwhile, chances of a fiscal stimulus before the presidential election faded as U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said there were a number of areas in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's plan that President Donald Trump cannot accept.
Wall Street's fear gauge hit a near seven-week high even as 60 million Americans voted in a record breaking early turnout as Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden enter their final week of campaigning.

The tech sector, which includes Apple, is among the only three sectors apart from healthcare and consumer staples that is expected to post an increase in profit compared to a year earlier.
Of the 139 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings so far, 83.5% of them have beaten Wall Street expectations, according to Refinitiv data.

Software company  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) fell about 4% after German rival SAP abandoned medium-term profitability targets and warned of a longer than expected recovery time from the pandemic hit. 
 Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS) tumbled 10% as quarterly adjusted revenue fell due to coronavirus-led delays in the production of movies and TV shows.
Companies deemed stay-at-home winners including Amazon.com Inc,  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc and video game companies Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive Software Inc rose between 2.2% and 0.3%.

(Reuters) - UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) has elevated the head of its special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) practice, Jeff Mortara, to co-lead its equity capital markets (ECM) business for the Americas, the investment bank said in internal memo seen by Reuters.
In the new role, Mortara will work with Brad Miller, UBS Co-Head of global banking Ros L'Esperance said in the memo, which was sent to staff on Monday. The memo's contents were confirmed by a bank spokeswoman. 
Mortara's promotion underscores the growing popularity of SPACs, as well as their importance to UBS's ECM franchise. 
So far this year, UBS has worked on 18 SPAC IPOs with a market share of 7.65%, ranking it fifth across Wall Street, up from 4.48% and eight place in 2019, according to SPAC Research.
SPACs have raised a record $59.2 billion through IPOs in 2020, up from $13.6 billion in 2019 which had been the previous record year, SPAC Research data showed. 
Mortara joined UBS in 2016 after 25 year with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), where he helped initiate its SPAC business in 2004. 
Mortara's move comes after UBS earlier this month appointed Carlos Alvarez as head of its permanent capital solutions business, which will build continue to out the bank's SPAC practice, according a separate memo seen by Reuters.
A SPAC is a shell company that uses proceeds from an IPO to acquire a private company. For the private company, merging with a SPAC is an alternative to going public through a traditional IPO.
So far this year, the likes of sports betting platform DraftKings Inc (O:DKNG) and electric commercial truck maker  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA) have gone public by merging with a SPAC.

MILAN/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The United States, Russia and France set new daily records for coronavirus infections as a second wave swelled across parts of the Northern Hemisphere, forcing some countries to impose new curbs.
More than 42.9 million people are reported to have been infected by the coronavirus globally and 1,151,929​ have died, according to a Reuters tally. The United States has the highest number of deaths and infections.
Word that a vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc produced immune responses in both elderly and young people offered some positive news as autumn turns to winter in northern countries and people socialise indoors.
But British Health Secretary Matt Hancock cautioned that the vaccine would not be widely available until next year and said ""we're not there yet"".
The seven-day average of new daily cases in the United States has reached a record high of 69,494, according to a Reuters tally, while deaths, hovering around 800 per day, are on an upward trend.
At more than 41,500, the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients is at a two-month high, straining health care systems in some states.
U.S. President Donald Trump, facing a tough re-election battle on Nov. 3, lashed out again at reports that the coronavirus is surging.
He repeated his unfounded claim that COVID-19 cases are rising because there is more testing, an assertion not supported by data and one that has been rejected by health experts.
""Cases up because we TEST, TEST, TEST. A Fake News Media Conspiracy. Many young people who heal very fast. 99.9%. Corrupt Media conspiracy at all time high,"" Trump said in a Twitter post.
In Europe the picture was unrelentingly grim as a string of countries reported record increases, led by France, which posted more than 50,000 daily cases for the first time on Sunday, while the continent passed the threshold of 250,000 deaths.
France may even be experiencing 100,000 new infections a day, Professor Jean-François Delfraissy, who heads a council that advises the government, told RTL radio.
Governments have been desperate to avoid the lockdowns which curbed the disease at the start of the year at the cost of shutting down their entire economies. But the steady rise in new cases has forced many in Europe to tighten curbs. 
""We are facing very, very difficult months ahead,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a meeting of leaders from her Christian Democrat party, according to daily Bild.
RUSSIAN RECORD
Although Germany has fared relatively well compared to other countries in Europe, it too has seen a sharp rise in cases and the closely watched Ifo business climate index fell on Monday, reflecting the worries over the virus.
The gloom weighed on global financial markets. Shares fell on Monday as surging infections clouded the economic outlook..
The Spanish government faced a backlash over its plans to put one of Europe's worst COVID-19 hotspots under a six-month state of emergency. Opposition parties said six months was too long, epidemiologists said this may be too little too late and some citizens balked at nightly curfews.
Russia's daily tally of new COVID-19 infections surged to a record high of 17,347 on Monday as the Kremlin warned the pandemic was beginning to take a greater toll outside Moscow.
Russia in August became the first country to grant regulatory approval for a vaccine against COVID-19 after less than two months of human testing, raising eyebrows among sceptical scientists in the West. Regulators approved a second vaccine earlier this month.
With 1,531,224 infections, the country of around 145 million people has recorded the world's fourth largest COVID-19 case load - after the United States, India and Brazil.
Italy, the country worst hit in the early stages of the crisis in March, imposed new curbs, ordering restaurants and bars to close from 6 p.m. and shutting down cinemas, and gyms and imposing local curfews in several regions.
The novel coronavirus, first identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year, has overshadowed campaigning ahead of the U.S. presidential election, with Democratic candidate Joe Biden repeatedly accusing Trump of grossly mishandling the pandemic.

In total, more than 225,300 people have died from the coronavirus in the United States.

765,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",Mission creep? Italy's bad loan manager irks rivals,"By Valentina Za
MILAN (Reuters) - As the coronavirus rips through Italy's already fragile economy, one sector should be thriving – the market for soured debt. 
Not so, say some would-be buyers of such loans. The problem? The government, they say, is crowding them out.
AMCO, a state-backed bad loan manager, has gone from bit player to one of the leading forces in Italy's 330 billion euro ($390 billion) bad debt market in the space of three years with over 33 billion euros in assets under management.
Swamped by bad debts from the last financial crisis, Italy in 2016 put the Treasury in control of AMCO, expanding its remit beyond managing the problem loans of failing Banco di Napoli for which it had been created two decades earlier. 
In 2018 AMCO took on a pile of unpaid loans from two regional banks being liquidated. Stepping in to relieve ailing lenders of soured debts remains its main focus, including a complex deal it is due to complete by Dec. 1 for 8.1 billion euros in loans from bailed-out lender Monte dei Paschi.
However, under the leadership of former UniCredit executive Marina Natale, AMCO has also started participating in the sale of debts from healthy lenders, creating a stir in the market.
Authorities say AMCO can aid the banking system's clean-up, but rival bad loan specialists complain it further heightens competition in a sector were profit margins are thinning.
AMCO is currently vying for some 1 billion euros in problem loans put on the block by Italy's third-largest bank Banco BPM, three people familiar with the matter have said, in a move that prompted at least two potential bidders to drop out, the people say.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, two suitors for the Banco BPM portfolio told Reuters they refrained from submitting an offer because they had no hope of beating AMCO's proposition and didn't want to spend between 2 million and 4 million euros analysing the loan books. 
Rival bad loan managers say they had already been irked by AMCO winning a tender for a small portfolio sold by Creval and striking a partnership with rival Prelios to manage impaired property loans for a group of banks. 
State backing allows AMCO to raise cheaper financing, and in accepting lower returns than private investors AMCO can offer more for loans.
Such higher prices help financial stability by limiting losses for banks, according to Elena Carletti, a finance and banking professor at Milan's Bocconi university.
The pricing gap between buyers and sellers held back Italy's bad loan market for years, until the state closed it through a guarantee scheme that leaves taxpayers on the hook for part of the potential losses.
AMCO also helps to narrow that gap, creating further risks for Italian taxpayers, already shouldering one of the world's highest public debts.
In a statement to Reuters, AMCO said it had always applied a strict pricing discipline when competing for loan portfolios, and so far this year, it had lost three out of seven tenders it had taken part in. 
AMCO says it operates at market conditions and under the strict oversight of European competition authorities and Italy's state accounting body.
CLEAR RULES 
Speaking at a recent conference organised by specialised lender Banca IFIS, Treasury adviser Giuseppe De Martino said the ministry was aware of concerns among market players but did not share them.
""AMCO's strong point is a patient shareholder that is not after double-digit returns in the short term. This allows it to combine profit goals with the public interest,"" he said. 
""AMCO should not be seen as crowding out private investors given the public nature of its shareholder ... it has an important role to play in the market.""
The Treasury declined to comment further for this story.
The role of state-backed players like AMCO is under the spotlight as European authorities strive to prepare for the new bad loan wave driven by the pandemic. 
The COVID-19 crisis may as much as double Europe's half-a-trillion problem loan pile based on some estimates. 
""We need rules on who does what, there are banks that need saving and banks that don't. AMCO is a competitor and not a bad bank like in other countries. Clear rules must be in place by the time the new wave hits,"" Marc Knothe, Italy's head at Europe's largest bad loan manager Intrum, told the IFIS conference. 
While stoking new flows, the pandemic also makes it harder to recover loans.
Bad loan investors complain that rising competition over the years has driven up prices, squeezing profit margins. 
""AMCO buys assets in competition with private investors and then manages them ... so it ends up distorting the market for both buyers and collectors of bad loans,"" Andrea Mangoni, head of Italy's biggest loan recovery firm doValue, told the IFIS conference. 

""It's a direct rival in a hyper-competitive market that was probably already overcrowded even before AMCO arrived.""

Investing.com -- Star Wars failed to give Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) a win despite better-than-expected results. 
Hasbro shares are down 10% after failing to live up to rival Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT)'s strong results last week.
Revenue grew in franchise brands, led by Magic: The Gathering, and products for Lucasfilm's Star Wars and The Mandalorian delivered strong sales, but third quarter revenue fell 4% on a pro forma basis to $1.78 billion. That compares to Mattel's gross sales gain of 10% to $1.8 billion.
Earnings per share of $1.88 compared to the estimated $1.62 on sales of $1.78 billion, versus the expected $1.73 billion. In contrast, Mattel's earnings per share of 95 cents compared to the estimated 39 cents on sales of $1.63 billion, versus the expected $1.47 billion.
While Hasbro revenue grew 9% in the U.S. and Canada and 7% in Europe, it tumbled 40% in Latin America and 9% in Asia.  Live-action production shutdowns led to a decline in television and film revenue.
""Building off this quarter's growth in toys, games and digital we are positioned to deliver a good holiday season,"" said Chief Executive Officer Brian Goldner in a statement. ""Live-action entertainment production is returning, and we are set to improve deliveries in the fourth quarter with some moving into 2021.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened weakly on Monday and sank through the morning session, on fears that a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic will push back the day when economic life can get back to normal. Failure by politicians in Washington to make any progress in passing a support package to bridge the gap until that day has also weighed on sentiment.
By 11:13 AM ET (1513 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 631 points, or 2.2%. The S&P 500 index was down 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.5%.  All three indexes have now been trending downward for the last two weeks. 
The U.S. is clearly experiencing a third wave of the pandemic with just a week to go before the election. Hospitalization rates have risen by around half over the last month to their highest since August, while the seven-day moving average for deaths has been trending up for nearly two weeks. Whether the economy has adapted enough in the last six months to ride out the new wave seems open to question, with initial jobless claims still running at nearly 800,000 a week.
Airline and cruise stocks were conspicuous early fallers, with United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock falling 3.8% and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock falling 3.3%
Various software stocks came under pressure after German enterprise planning giant SAP slashed its short- and medium-term outlook for profitability, as the pandemic weighs on business spending and accelerates transition to the Cloud - an area where SAP's margins are lower than in its legacy business. SAP (NYSE:SAP) ADRs fell over 20%, while Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock, exposed to many of the same factors, fell 1.4%.
Elsewhere,  Dunkin Brands Group  (NASDAQ:DNKN) stock rose 14.8% to a new all-time high after it said it was in early talks to be acquired by Private Equity group Inspire Brands, which already owns the Arby's and Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant franchises.
The moves came on a day when the biggest deal in world stock markets was taking place far away, as Chinese financial services giant Ant Group priced its initial public offering to raise some $34 billion on the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges. 
The IPO is a reminder of the growing distance between U.S. and Chinese capital markets: Ant's founder, Jack Ma, had listed his  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) group on the New York Stock Exchange only six years earlier, but such moves have been complicated by U.S. regulatory moves, as part of a general move to tighten Chinese access to U.S. capital and technical expertise.

A rise to 3,900 would mark a 12.6% jump from Friday's closing level.
A clean sweep by Democrats would be ""mostly neutral"" for markets, JPM said in a note received on Monday, adding: ""We see an 'orderly' Trump victory as the most favorable outcome for equities.""

JPMorgan said several of its data gatherings, such as voter registration, Twitter sentiment, point to a ""tightening race"". The bank sees a gridlock in the election as a ""net positive"" for stocks.
Within sectors, JPM sees beaten down energy and financial stocks to likely be key beneficiaries of a Trump victory, while a Biden win could trigger a rotation from U.S. growth stocks to non U.S. growth stocks, given the risk of higher taxes.

LONDON (Reuters) - Aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) will ask shareholders on Tuesday for 2 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) in a make-or-break attempt to survive the COVID-19 pandemic, which has stopped planes flying and hammered its finances. 
At stake is the future of a company which has been at the heart of manufacturing in Britain for more than 100 years, making engines that powered World War Two bombers and still drive the country's fighter jets and nuclear submarines. 
Investors are expected to back the rights issue, supporting CEO Warren East's plan to cut 9,000 jobs and close factories to adjust to a lower level of demand from airline customers that fly with Rolls engines on Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787s and Airbus 350s. 
Shareholder advisory groups Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have both urged clients to back the fundraising. 
""We find the terms of the proposed rights issue to be reasonable,"" Glass Lewis said in a note, while ISS said the rationale was ""compelling"". 
Investors can buy 10 new shares for every three they own at 32 pence each, a 41% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price.
The company, which made a 5.4 billion pound loss in the first half of 2020, faces a cash crunch at the end of next year, when 3.2 billion pounds of debt needs to be repaid.
In a sign of Rolls's strategic importance, the UK government has guaranteed a 1 billion pound loan on top of the 2 billion pounds it backed in July through its UK Export Finance arm. 
Rolls accounts for 2% of all UK goods exported and is one of the country's biggest spenders on research and development. It also buys from 2,300 smaller UK suppliers, and before the pandemic supported as many as 135,000 UK jobs. 
But COVID-19 has shattered the company's finances because airlines only pay it when their planes fly, forcing it to seek a 5 billion pound debt and equity package to survive many more months of expected turmoil.
Rolls's market value has slumped from over 20 billion pounds in 2018 to 4.7 billion pounds, putting it broadly on a par with online clothing retailer ASOS (L:ASOS). 
Analysts are positive on Rolls's future if it secures the 50% plus one of votes cast at Tuesday's virtual meeting. 
""They've given themselves enough time and space to make sure that they get through to the other side,"" said Agency Partner analyst Nick Cunningham.
Further debt options will also open up if shareholders back the fundraising, including 2 billion pounds from bonds, after strong investor demand enabled it to double the amount it had been aiming for.
While the rights issue will be highly dilutive for shareholders, investor advisory groups say it is preferable to a stake sale to a sovereign wealth fund, which would not have given them the option to participate.

But ongoing travel restrictions mean the outlook is bleak. There were just three orders for the wide-body jets that Rolls supplies in the third quarter, according to UK industry body ADS.

The WTO approved the EU’s arbitration award -- which is the third largest in WTO history -- during a meeting of the dispute settlement body at the WTO’s headquarters in Geneva.
The development marks the final procedural hurdle at the WTO before the EU can legally retaliate against U.S. goods. Nevertheless, officials in Brussels do not expect to trigger new tariffs until after the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3.
A U.S. official at the WTO on Monday urged the EU not to impose duties on American goods because Washington state terminated its illegal subsidies to Boeing on April 1.
If the EU moves forward with the tariffs, it would force a U.S. response that would move away from the effort to resolve the dispute, according to a statement from the U.S.’s WTO delegate.
The EU still needs to narrow down its draft retaliation list, which currently targets politically sensitive U.S. industries for President Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress, such as aircraft, coal, farm products and seafood.
The U.S. delegate said the Trump administration strongly favors a negotiated resolution to the 16-year-old dispute and is seeking a reasonable settlement that would provide a level playing field.
Stalled Negotiations
Earlier this month U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer sent a proposal to the EU’s trade chief, Valdis Dombrovskis, seeking a pledge from Europe to end its aircraft subsidy regime and for Airbus to repay the subsidies it received from France, Germany, Spain and the U.K.
Dombrovskis previously said the bloc’s “strong preference is for a negotiated settlement. Otherwise, we will be forced to defend our interests and respond in a proportionate way.”
But if the EU moves forward with its tariff plan, Trump has pledged to “strike much harder.”
“If they strike back, then we’ll strike much harder,” Trump told reporters on Oct. 15. “They don’t want to do anything, I can tell you that.”
To date, the U.S. has not applied the full thrust of its $7.5 billion tariff award that the WTO granted last year in a parallel dispute against Boeing’s European rival, Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY).
That ruling led the Trump administration to impose 15% tariffs on Airbus aircraft and 25% levies on an array of European exports including French wine, Scotch Whisky and Spanish olives.
Washington could raise those import taxes to 100%, which for many European products would effectively block their entry into the U.S. marketplace.

The airplane meals have quickly turned into a hit with 1,600 meals sold within days at the supermarket located near Finnair's main hub the Helsinki-Vantaa airport, Finnair said. It plans to sell in more outlets. 
""There are redundancies and layoffs going on already at Finnair and we are trying our best to find new innovative ways,"" head of Finnair Kitchen Marika Nieminen told Reuters.
Finnair said last Tuesday it would cut around 700 jobs by March 2021.
Finnair Kitchen's first main courses on the ground, for 12.9 euros ($15.2) apiece, comprise beef with teriyaki-radish sauce served with grilled spring onion and rice or smoked arctic char with chantarelle risotto.
""In this desperate remote work environment this is a small, nice taste of normal life,"" Mika, a customer from Vantaa said.
In 2017, Finnair stopped outsourcing its catering services by buying LSG Sky Chefs, a company that operated at Finland's main airport, from a Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) subsidiary and renamed it Finnair Kitchen.
A year later, Finnair Kitchen produced some 12,000 meals a day but the numbers collapsed when the COVID-19 pandemic hit air travel. 
Nieminen said Finnair planned to introduce new dishes, including reindeer meat from Finnish Lapland and Japanese-style pork shoulder, for supermarkets.
""We have had very much positive feedback from our customers and this product has become one of the best selling products in our store,"" Kimmo Sivonen, a shopkeeper at  Kesko 's (HE:KESKOB) K-Citymarket Tammisto in Vantaa said.

As schools in many parts of the country continue to hold classes online, coupled with limited options for outdoor activities, parents have turned to toys and board games to keep their children occupied, boosting sales for Hasbro and rival  Mattel Inc  (O:MAT). 
Hasbro said it was positioned well for a ""good"" holiday but stopped short of providing a sales forecast, unlike Mattel, which last week said it expected mid-single-digit growth in gross sales for the crucial shopping season.
Analysts at MKM Partners said investors were likely expecting more from Hasbro, after Mattel's trounced sales and profit forecasts last week.Hasbro shares, which have gained over 11% this month, fell 2% in premarket trading amid broader market declines. 
The company also said coronavirus-induced production delays pushed revenue from its TV, film and entertainment business down nearly 30%, while a drop in sales in Latin America hit the company's international business. 
Total revenue from all of its gaming brands including Monopoly, Scrabble and Dungeons & Dragons jumped 21% to about $543 million in the third quarter. 
The company's net revenue rose 12.8% to $1.78 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 27, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.75 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening sharply lower Monday as investors fretted about the rising number of coronavirus cases and the potential for new containment measures to derail the economic rebound.
At 8 AM ET (1200 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 33 points, or 1%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 284 points, or 1%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 90 points, or 0.8%. 
Weighing heavily on investors’ confidence has been the resurgence of Covid-19 cases in the northern hemisphere as cooler weather starts to arrive. In Europe, France reported a record daily rise over the weekend, while Italy has ordered bars to close early and Spain has issued a nationwide curfew.
The news in the U.S. isn't much better, with the country seeing its highest ever number of new Covid-19 cases in the past two days, even affecting some aides of Vice President Mike Pence. Hospitalizations are also rising and deaths are trending upwards, yet White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told CNN that ""we aren't going to control the pandemic.""
Yet, despite this news, a new coronavirus relief package seems very unlikely to happen before next week’s presidential election. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Meadows accused each other of “moving the goalposts” in negotiations over the weekend, suggesting there still is too large a gap between the two sides for a compromise to be reached promptly.
This will be the busiest week of the earnings season so far, with almost 170 S&P 500 companies set to report. The major focus is likely to be on the big tech names, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reporting Tuesday and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) all reporting after the closing bell on Thursday.
Looking at economic data, the main release Monday will be the September new home sales number, with the housing market still showing strong growth. However, the week’s major release will be the preliminary estimate of third-quarter GDP on Thursday, which is expected to see a record rebound of 31.9% after a historic 31.4% plunge in the second quarter. 
Oil prices slumped Monday, weighed by the rise in coronavirus cases in the U.S. and Europe, traditionally two of the largest energy consuming regions in the world.
Oil traders will also be keeping an eye on the progress of tropical storm Zeta, as it’s poised to turn into a hurricane and disrupt oil production in the Gulf of Mexico.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGn) agreed to acquire unlisted U.S. biotech firm Asklepios BioPharmaceutical Inc for as much as $4 billion in a bet on gene therapy with the help of modified viruses. 
Germany's Bayer will pay $2 billion upfront and up to an additional $2 billion in milestone payments contingent on development achievements, it said on Monday. 
The North Carolina-based takeover target, also known as AskBio, is trying to use the harmless adeno-associated virus as a delivery device to bring genetic repair kits against a range of diseases into the body.Drugs and farming pesticides maker Bayer needs to upgrade its drug development pipeline amid a weaker outlook for agricultural sales and as it seeks to finalise an $11 billion settlement over claims its Roundup weedkiller causes cancer.
Among AskBio's most advanced projects are early tests on volunteers of prospective treatments against Pompe disease - a rare genetic disease causing buildup of a sugar molecule inside cells - as well as against Parkinson's disease and congestive heart failure.
Bayer said the deal complements the 2019 acquisition of BlueRock Therapeutics, a developer of stem cell therapies, and underscores Bayer's intention to create a cell and gene therapy business.
AskBio, which was founded in 2001, and BlueRock will exchange information and collaborate but will each operate as independent entities, prompting a pledge from AskBio's five main owners, who are co-founders or key scientists, to remain with the firm.
""We are staying on board because of the unique structure that Bayer has provided ... We’ll have the ability to make our science decisions,"" said Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Sheila Mikhail.
Investors TPG Capital and Vida Ventures are selling a minority stake in the company. 
AskBio is also helping other companies with their gene therapy research and production and has licensed experimental drugs to external partners, which has financed much of its own drug development activities. Bayer or AskBio would not provide figures for such fee revenues.
A potential treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, invented by AskBio is currently being developed in clinical trials by  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and this month won fast track https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-receives-fda-fast-track-designation-duchenne status from U.S. regulators. 
Bayer in 2018 moved to lean more strongly on external firms to improve drug development, which analysts say needs a boost to make up for an expected decline in revenues from its two pharma bestsellers from about 2024.

 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) was financial advisor while Baker McKenzie was legal counsel to Bayer. JP Morgan was financial advisor to AskBio, while Ropes & Gray was legal counsel.

Consistent with the past few quarters, credit to Africa and the Middle East registered the highest growth rate at 14%, the BIS said, driven by countries in the Middle East. 
Emerging Asia-Pacific and Latin America saw 9% and 5% respective year-on-year increases. In contrast, emerging Europe saw a 5% fall, extending the decline seen over the past six years as euro-denominated credit has become more important for the region.
Outstanding euro-denominated credit in emerging Europe, which includes countries such as Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania, surpassed dollar credit in terms of the overall amount earlier this year.

784,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",Goldman Says Capital-Gains Tax Hike Would Be ‘Minor’ for Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Any capital-gains tax increase resulting from a Democratic “Blue Wave” victory on Election Day is unlikely to have a big impact on stock prices, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
If Democrats sweep the White House, Senate and House on Nov. 3, one concern for investors has been the chance of an increased tax on capital gains and resulting headwinds for stocks. But while past capital-gains tax hikes have been associated with declines in equity prices and in total household equity allocations, Goldman said, the trend of net equity selling and declining stock prices around them has usually been brief.
“History shows stock prices fall, equity allocations decline, and Momentum underperforms ahead of increases in the capital-gains tax rate,” strategists led by David Kostin wrote in an Oct. 23 note. “However, any potential equity selling will be short-lived and reversed in subsequent quarters.”
Goldman’s analysis dovetails with that of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., which said recently that any hit to stock prices from a capital-gains tax hike would be brief, and stocks would likely resume their upward trajectory afterward. That offers a counter to strategists and wealthy investors already worrying about the potential tax hit to their portfolio -- or a decline in stock markets -- if a Blue Wave does occur.

“We expect U.S. household equity allocations will rise in 2021 irrespective of the election outcome. Rising economic growth expectations should support higher equity allocations next year. Equity fund flows have also usually increased following presidential elections,” the strategists said. “Regardless of the election outcome, we expect roughly 10% upside to the S&P 500 by the middle of next year.”

785,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>","Fiat, PSA to win EU approval for $38 billion merger, sources say","By Foo Yun Chee and Giulio Piovaccari
BRUSSELS/MILAN (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler and PSA are set to win EU approval for their $38 billion merger to create the world's No.4 carmaker, people close to the matter said, as they strive to meet the industry's dual challenges of funding cleaner vehicles and the global pandemic.
The green light from the European Commission would formalize the creation of Stellantis, a carmaking group that could tap hefty profits from selling Ram pickup trucks and Jeep SUVs to U.S. drivers to fund the expensive development of zero-emission vehicles for sale in Europe and China.
The all-share merger announced late last year would unite brands such as Fiat, Jeep, Dodge, Ram and Maserati with the likes of  Peugeot  (OTC:PUGOY), Opel and DS - while targeting annual cost cuts of 5 billion euros ($6 billion) without closing factories.
The Commission and Italian-American group Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) declined to comment. France's PSA (PA:PEUP) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
PSA and FCA shares reversed losses after the Reuters story was published. PSA stock was last up 3.4% at 17.06 euros, while FCA shares were 3% higher at 11.43 euros.
To allay EU antitrust concerns, PSA has offered to strengthen Japanese rival Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), with which it has a van joint venture, by ramping up production and selling it vans at close to cost price, the people said.
FCA and PSA will also allow their dealers in certain cities to repair rival brands. 
Following feedback from rivals and customers, the carmakers only had to tweak the wording of their concessions, with no changes to the substance, the people said. 
The companies did not have to use the COVID-19 pandemic to argue for the merger, they said, adding the EU decision could come by the end of the year, ahead of the official Feb. 2 deadline.
FCA and PSA have said they hope to complete the merger in the first quarter of 2021.
The challenge of switching to electric cars has been complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Just last month, FCA and PSA restructured the terms of their deal to conserve cash and raised their targeted cost savings because of the economic fallout from the health crisis.
The companies have said about 40% of the savings will come from product-related expenses, 40% from purchasing and 20% from other areas, such as marketing, IT and logistics.

JAL is expected to report around an 85 billion yen loss from its main business for the three months through September as demand for international flights is not expected to rebound due to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the report said. 
A JAL spokeswoman, declining to comment on the report by Kyodo, said the airline has enough liquidity in hand. 
Global airlines, facing record losses as the coronavirus pandemic discourages travel, are seeking to secure their finances through measures such as debt and government aid. 
Rival ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202) expects a net loss of around 500 billion yen ($4.8 billion) for the year to March, and is eyeing cuts to both jobs and its aircraft fleet, a source with direct knowledge said last week.

The company was forced to delay their publication because of over-payments related to the construction of its new Kusile power station and issues with its pension fund, people familiar with the situation said. The plant disbursements could have consequences if the contracts don’t comply with the Public Finance Management Act, which regulates spending by government entities and is designed to minimize corruption.
“Eskom experienced some delays due to the lockdown resulting in late access to sites by the auditors and the resolution of some accounting and PFMA-related matters,” the utility said in a response to queries. “Eskom intends to release the annual results by the end of October to ensure compliance with legislation and regulations.”
In July, Eskom said the results for year through March had been delayed due to the coronavirus and an associated lockdown. The utility’s results for the three previous financial years were published within four months of the year-end.
The company has struggled to properly account for spending on Kusile, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information isn’t public. In June, Eskom estimated it had overpaid contractors working on the new plant by 4 billion rand ($247 million).

The budget for Kusile and Medupi, another coal-fired plant of a similar size, has ballooned to more than 450 billion rand from an initial amount of about a third of that.

790,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",StockBeat: SAP Shocks a Complacent Tech Narrative,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Well, this wasn’t supposed to happen.
SAP stock plunged on Monday as Germany’s most valuable company slashed its profit forecasts after programming in a longer and deeper hit from the Covid-19 pandemic.  
By 4:50 AM ET (0950 GMT), the software giant’s stock was down 18%, having dropped over 20% at the opening, its biggest intraday loss in over 20 years according to Bloomberg.
The idea that business software companies are not immune to the business cycle seemed to come as a surprise to many (even if growing doubts about the outlook had already been evident in a 5% decline from its all-time high in August).
The movement is a shock to the narrative that growth stocks are the only sure refuge from Covid-19, and that their admission to the Kingdom of Stock Market Heaven has only been accelerated by a  virus that has already claimed over 1 million lives.
That virus is now ruthlessly exploiting the lockdown fatigue of populations in Europe and the U.S. and, as SAP was forced to admit on Monday, is likely to have a sustained impact on business for at least another eight months.  
SAP ripped up its earlier guidance, which had “assumed economies would reopen and population lockdowns would ease, leading to a gradually improving demand environment in the third and fourth quarters.”
The recovery in demand, it noted, had been “has been more muted than expected”. That much was evident in a 16% year-on-year drop in service revenue and a slowdown in order backlog growth for its Cloud division, a closely-tracked leading indicator for the company. Demand problems were also evident in a 14% drop in revenue from Concur, the business expense processing software that exposes SAP – at least to a modest degree – to the same woes as the airline and hotel sector. SAP said it “no longer anticipates a meaningful recovery in SAP Concur business travel-related revenues for the remainder of the year 2020.”
But most worrying for investors was the downward revision of its medium-term profitability goals, as a result of the very trend to accelerated digital transformation that investors have bought into so aggressively.
When SAP’s customers transition to Cloud-based services, they make SAP’s business more predictable, but less profitable. Assuming a new Cloud revenue target of 22 billion euros ($26 billion) by 2025, SAP expects its operating margin to be 4-5 percentage points lower over the next three years.
Ultimately, SAP still expects to end up in the same place, but it will make a bit less money on the way there. The revisions to this year’s profit and revenue outlook, of around 5%, are arguably not as dramatic as the stock price movement suggests (and even less so when adjusted for the reality of a rising euro).  That helps to explain why JPMorgan was almost alone in downgrading the stock on the back of the figures on Monday.
Even so, SAP’s scale and breadth make it a valid, if rough, proxy for much of the European tech sector. To see it putting out numbers and forecasts so starkly at odds with the narrative that has fueled the tech rally is a clear negative."

(Reuters) - European stocks fell on Monday as Italy and Spain imposed fresh restrictions to control a resurgence in coronavirus cases, while shares in German heavyweight SAP slumped after it cut its 2020 outlook.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) declined 0.5% and the euro zone blue-chip index (STOXX50E) tumbled 1.4%, with risk appetite globally sapped by worries over slow progress on a new U.S. stimulus bill and looming presidential election.
The German DAX (GDAXI) dropped 2.0% after software company SAP (DE:SAPG) abandoned medium-term profitability targets and cautioned that its business would take longer than expected to recover from the pandemic hit.
Shares of Europe's most valuable tech firm tumbled 18%, set for their worst decline in 24 years, with the wider tech index (SX8P) down 5.2%. 
SAP's earnings came as a blip in the third-quarter earnings season, which has been largely better than feared. 
Meanwhile, Italy has ordered bars and restaurants to close by 6 p.m. and to shut public gyms, cinemas, while Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced a new state of emergency as many Southern European countries reported their highest number of COVID-19 cases in a single day.
Europe on Saturday became the second region after Latin America to surpass 250,000 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.
Nick Nelson, head of European equity strategy at UBS, said the Swiss bank's target for STOXX 600 into the year-end is 340 points, about 5% below the current level, in part due to the impact of the latest round of restrictions. 
""Not a large move, but we see some modest downside into year-end partly because of the mobility restrictions and a slowdown in the macro momentum with PMIs falling below 50,"" he said. 
Surveys of euro zone purchasing managers last week showed economic activity slipped back into decline in October, heightening expectations for a double-dip recession as a second wave of virus sweeps across the continent.
Milan's blue-chip index (FTMIB) fell 0.9%, even as ratings agency Standard and Poor's (NYSE:SPY) upgraded Italy's sovereign outlook to stable from negative.
Oil majors  Total  (PA:TOTF) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) fell over 1% as crude prices slumped almost 3% on worries surging COVID-19 cases in the United States and Europe would hurt demand. [O/R]

SYDNEY/BENGALURU (Reuters) -  Coca-Cola Co 's (N:KO) European bottler has made a A$9.28 billion ($6.6 billion) buyout approach to Australian peer Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd (AX:CCL), a cut-price proposal that the target firm is backing due to uncertainty sparked by the coronavirus crisis.
The takeover by Coca-Cola European Partners PLC (L:CCEPC) (CCEP) would be the biggest involving Australia this year, but prices the target company below its market valuation in February - before the COVID-19 pandemic began to rock global markets and plunged the world into recession.
The support from the Australians indicates expectations of an economic recovery that could take years, a bleaker view than that of some local economists who have pointed to improving economic indicators. Coca-Cola Amatil's profit has been hit by shutdowns of restaurants and pubs since March. 
The deal would unite two companies that bottle and distribute Coca-Cola drinks, providing scale, operating efficiencies and a larger geographic spread. 
""Ultimately, when franchises become available, aligned Coke bottlers need to act,"" said Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts in a note, adding CCEP would be able to strengthen Amatil's operational capabilities. ""Longer term, the deal offers a platform for further consolidation in Asia.""
Amatil's shares closed up 16.3% at A$12.50, below the proposed offer price of A$12.75, indicating investors are factoring in the possibility a deal might not come to fruition.
CCEP shares rose 8.5% in morning trade in London. 
The deal could lift CCEP's earnings by 18% after three years, Jefferies said.
""We are really confident about the recovery that the business is making (but) clearly there's uncertainty over the next couple of years with the economic situation, and just the risk of further health outbreaks that could disrupt the business,"" said Coca-Cola Amatil Chief Executive Alison Watkins on an investor call on Monday, when asked about the price.
CCEP was formed by the 2016 merger of three European bottlers. It is now the largest bottler by revenue, operating in 13 countries including the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain. 
A spokesman for The Coca-Cola Co (N:KO), which owns 31% of the Australian company and 19% of London-listed CCEP, said in an email the deal would be ""in the best interests of the shareowners of both companies and of the Coca-Cola system overall"".
The Australian company said CCEP would conduct due diligence before making a binding offer. The deal would also need approval from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board, which was granted increased powers this year to block overseas deals deemed to be a security or supply chain risk.

CCEP said the deal would almost double its consumer reach, ""ultimately driving sustainable and faster growth, through geographic diversification and scale.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The EU's markets watchdog said on Monday banks and asset managers based in the bloc should execute most of their share trades inside the EU after full Brexit from January, in a step set to fragment cross-border markets.
Large chunks of cross-border share trading are currently done on platforms in London, but Britain's unfettered access to the bloc ends on Dec. 31.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) set out a revised ""share trading obligation"", or STO, that mandates where banks and other users of stock markets must trade EU-listed shares from January if Brussels decides not to allow London's unfettered access in share trading to continue.
It eased previous guidance that EU shares must be traded inside the bloc in one respect, saying that shares listed on exchanges inside the bloc can still be traded on platforms in London if they are traded in sterling.
The EU is keen to build up its own capital market to cut reliance on London, and ESMA said trading in a non-EU currency introduced a currency risk for EU investors.
Fewer than 50 EU-listed shares are traded in sterling in London, accounting for less than 1% of total EU trading, ESMA said.
London-based pan-European platforms Cboe, the London Stock Exchange's Turquoise, and Aquis Exchange trade shares listed on EU exchanges.
""This revised guidance aims at addressing the specific situation of the small number of EU issuers whose shares are mainly traded on UK trading venues in pounds,"" ESMA said.
ESMA said it had done the ""maximum possible"" to avoid a clash with Britain over where shares must be traded from January.
Britain has yet to set out its own rules on trading of EU-listed shares, saying the best solution would be for Brussels to extend full access. 

Cboe, Turquoise and Aquis have already opened hubs in the EU to offer euro-denominated trading in EU-listed shares to avoid disruption to clients from such a clash.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Shares in Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd and affiliates rose on Monday after the death a day earlier of Chairman Lee Kun-hee sparked hopes for stake sales, higher dividends and long-awaited restructuring, analysts said.
Investors are betting that the imperatives of maintaining Lee family control and paying inheritance tax - estimated at about 10 trillion won ($8.9 billion) for listed stockholdings alone - will be the catalyst for change, although analysts are divided on what form that change will take. 
Shares in Samsung (KS:005930) C&T and Samsung Life Insurance closed up 13.5% at a two-month high and 3.8%, respectively, while shares in Samsung SDS also rose. Samsung Electronics - the jewel in the group's crown - finished 0.3% higher. 
Son and heir apparent Jay Y. Lee has a 17.3% stake in Samsung C&T, the de facto holding firm, while the late Lee was the top shareholder of Samsung Life with 20.76% stake. 
""The inheritance tax is outrageous, so family members might have no choice but to sell stakes in some non-core firms"" such as Samsung Life, said NH Investment Securities analyst Kim Dong-yang. 
""It may be likely for Samsung C&T to consider increasing dividends for the family to cover such a high inheritance tax,"" KB Securities analyst Jeong Dong-ik said. 
Lee, 78, died on Sunday, six years after he was hospitalised due to heart attack in 2014. Since then, Samsung carried out a flurry of stake sales and restructuring to streamline the sprawling conglomerate and cement the junior Lee's control.
Investors have long anticipated a further shake-up in the event of Lee's death, hoping for gains from restructuring to strengthen de facto holding company Samsung C&T's control of Samsung Electronics, such as Samsung C&T buying an affiliate's stake in the tech giant. 
""At this point, it is difficult to expect when Samsung Group will kick off with a restructuring process as Jay Y. Lee is still facing trials, making it difficult for the group's management to begin organisational changes,"" Jeong said. 
Lee is in two trials for suspected accounting fraud and stock price manipulation, as well as for his role in a bribery scandal that triggered the impeachment of former South Korean President Park Geun-hye. The second trial resumed hearings on Monday.

Lee did not attend the trial on Monday, as Samsung executives joined other business and political leaders for the second day of funeral services for his father.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Monday, with surging coronavirus cases prompting more restrictive measures while software giant SAP offered up a profit warning.
SAP (DE:SAPG) stock slumped over 15% after the software giant cut its guidance for the year, abandoning its forecast that profitability would expand steadily over the medium term, saying coronavirus lockdowns would hit demand well into 2021. 
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 2.4% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 1%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.5%.
Europe has been hit hard by the second wave of the coronavirus, becoming the second region after Latin America to surpass 250,000 deaths on Saturday, according to a Reuters tally, as a number of countries reported a record number of cases.
Italy has responded by introducing the strongest virus restrictions since the end of a national lockdown in May, while Spain is set to impose a national curfew, having declared a national state of emergency at the weekend.
The news in the U.S. doesn’t make for good reading either. The country recorded the most infections of the pandemic for the second day in a row, adding another 85,317 cases, including aides of Vice President Mike Pence. Pence himself continues to attend election campaign rallies, while White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told CNN that ""we aren't going to control the pandemic.""
Elsewhere,  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) stock fell 1.2% after Bloomberg reported that U.S. private equity firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) is nearing an agreement to buy the German industrial giant’s mechanical drive arm Flender, for about 2 billion euros ($2.37 billion).
Bayer (DE:BAYGN) stock fell 0.2% after the German pharmaceutical giant agreed to acquire unlisted U.S. biotech firm Asklepios BioPharmaceutical for as much as $4 billion in a bet on gene therapy with the help of modified viruses.
Investors will keep a wary eye on the release of the German Ifo business climate indicator for October later in the session to see whether these rising Covid-19 numbers are having an impact on confidence in the country’s corporate sector.
Concerns about the virus also hit oil prices: U.S. crude futures traded 2.7% lower at $38.78 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.4% to $41.05. Brent fell 2.7% last week and WTI dropped 2.5%, their first weekly losses in three.

Then the pandemic struck. Borders closed. The buses he had used to send his cash stopped running. 
""I had to send something, even a few dollars,"" said Takawira, though it meant sometimes going without bread. So he tried out an online remittance company on a friend's recommendation.

This is fuelling a boom for Africa-focused money transfer companies, despite predictions from the World Bank of a historic 20% drop to $445 billion in remittances to poorer countries this year due to a pandemic-induced global economic slump. 
""We saw an increase of transfers as the diaspora wanted to help their family,"" said Patrick Roussel, who heads mobile financial services for the Middle East and Africa at French telecom company Orange (PA:ORAN) - a dominant player in French-speaking Africa. 
Like Takawira, many had to dip into savings or make other sacrifices to do so, analysts and company officials say.
The pandemic gave remittance companies an advantage over their main competition in Africa: the sprawling informal networks of traders, bus drivers and travellers used by many migrants to send money home.
""We've seen an influx of new customers, and we see them mainly coming to us from the informal market,"" said Andy Jury, chief executive of Mukuru, the company Takawira now uses.
Jury and other industry executives say that shift is likely to last as digital remittance services are typically cheaper, faster and safer than informal networks, which are difficult for governments to regulate. 
Mukuru, which focuses mainly on African remittances and allows customers to send both cash and groceries, has seen a roughly 75% acceleration in growth compared to last year. 
'SILVER LINING'
Remittances to sub-Saharan Africa officially totalled $48 billion last year, according to the World Bank. Experts, however, say that figure tells only part of the story.
Much of the money Africans ship home via informal networks is absent from official data. 
As those networks ground to a halt during lockdowns, formal money transfer businesses - particularly digital platforms - were suddenly the only game in town. 
According to Kenyan central bank data, remittances to Kenya were up 6.5% though August compared to the same period last year. Remittance inflows to Zimbabwe were up 33% through July.
Online remittance company WorldRemit reported last week that transfers to Zimbabwe via its service had doubled over the past six months. 
Azimo, a UK-headquartered remittance company whose major African markets include Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya, saw a nearly 200% increase over the expected number of new customers in April, May and June. 
""I'd swap it out for no pandemic any day of the week,"" Azimo CEO Michael Kent told Reuters. ""But given that's what's happening, I think you are seeing digital adoption in financial services all over the place."" 
Remittance companies got an additional boost early on in the pandemic when African central banks reduced fees and loosened limits on digital transactions, to encourage the public to use digital services to facilitate social distancing.
""I would probably agree with the World Bank that the total amount (of remittances) will go down,"" said Dare Okoudjou, founder of MFS Africa. ""But anyone who's in digital would actually gain market share and see their volume go up.""
The company, which runs networks across 36 African countries to channel remittances between mobile money accounts, has seen year-on-year transaction growth of over 90% in 2020.
The industry is now at an inflection point, analysts say.
""If we can get the money flowing with less friction, it's going to be better for everybody. That's the silver lining,"" said Timothy Ogden, managing director of the Financial Access Initiative at New York University. 
Takawira, whose brother also works in South Africa, says he's now using Mukuru each month to send cash and groceries to his 60-year-old mother in rural Zimbabwe, where inflation is topping 650%.

""My salary does not buy much ... When the boys send me money, it does help a lot "" his mother Gladys Muzira told Reuters.

798,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 04:30AM ET</span>","SAP goes all in on cloud, scraps mid-term margin goals","By Douglas Busvine
BERLIN (Reuters) - SAP said on Monday it was going all in on its shift to cloud computing as it abandoned medium-term profitability targets and cautioned that its business would take longer than expected to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.
Investors reacted by dumping shares in Europe's most valuable tech firm, which opened nearly 20% lower in Frankfurt to wipe $35 billion off its market value - their biggest one-day drop in 24 years.
The strategic pivot by Chief Executive Christian Klein means investors are once again being asked to wait for the promise of fatter margins at the German business software group to become a reality.
""We are at an inflection point,"" Klein told journalists on a conference call. ""I am not willing to trade value to our customers for short-term margin optimisation.""
JP Morgan cut its price target for SAP to 120 from 160 euros, and downgraded the stock to ""neutral"" from ""overweight"". Citi said SAP's cautious outlook would hurt broader sentiment towards European tech and software stocks.
The change of course follows a year of turmoil unleashed by the exit of long-time CEO Bill McDermott and a failed experiment in tandem leadership that ended in April when Klein became sole CEO as governments locked down economies.
At that time, the pandemic was already hitting operations, but SAP stood by a medium-term ""ambition"" set on McDermott's watch that foresaw profit margins growing by a percentage point a year in the five years to 2023.
The reset rightly abandons a strategy that was made ""once upon a pre-COVID lifetime"", said industry analyst Josh Greenbaum at EAConsult.
""I think it’s a good time to take the margin hit of transitioning to the cloud, and clearly the pandemic economy is helping justify the move,"" he said. 
HEADWINDS
The latest shift means effectively that profit margins will languish over the next three years. Headwinds will only turn to tailwinds after that, Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic told reporters.
Cloud revenue - from subscription-based services hosted at remote data centres - is now expected to triple to 22 billion euros ($26 billion) by 2025. That will eclipse traditional licence sales that have for decades been SAP's cash cow.
Total adjusted revenue in 2025 is now forecast at 36 billion euros and adjusted operating profit at 11.5 billion - implying a margin of 31.9% that is roughly in line with SAP's third-quarter showing.
Some investors question whether SAP, a kind of one-stop shop for running processes such as finance or supply chains, will win in the cloud, or end up losing out to more innovative competitors.
They point to fast-growing rivals such as Celonis, a German process-mining specialist, that are seeking to become global leaders in a single category, and can run on top of SAP or its U.S. competitor Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).
In the quarter, adjusted total revenue fell by 4% while operating profit fell 12%, based on international financial reporting standards. After adjustments and at constant currency rates, profit rose by 4%.

SAP cut its guidance for 2020, saying the reimposition of lockdowns by some governments had hit its business, while hard-hit industries would now take longer than expected to recover.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) said on Monday it swung to a net loss for July-September, missing market estimates by a wide margin, as costs related to engine quality issues and recalls smashed what would otherwise have been strong earnings.
Hyundai, the world's fifth-biggest automaker when combined with affiliate Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270), reported a net loss of 336 billion won ($297.72 million). The average of 12 analyst estimates complied by Refinitiv was 1.2 trillion won in profit.
The automaker said it booked 2.1 trillion won to cover charges related to engine defects that increased the risk of stalling and fire. The years-long quality problems have cost Hyundai and Kia nearly $5 billion and left the pair subject to a probe by U.S. authorities over the manner of their recalls.
""Third-quarter results reflect engine-related provision expenses as the company took preemptive measures to ensure customer safety and cover any possible future increase in quality-related expenses,"" Hyundai said in a statement.
""We sincerely apologise to our shareholders and investors for having repeated quality cost issues over three quarters since 2018,"" an executive told an earnings briefing.
Operating loss for the third quarter was 314 billion won. Excluding quality costs, the figure would have been 1.8 trillion won profit. Revenue rose 2.3% on year to 27.6 trillion won.
Analysts said the operating loss was not as deep as expected as Hyundai enjoyed firm sales in the quarter backed by increased demand in the United States and emerging markets such as India.

Its stock rose as much as 4.2% after the announcement versus a 0.3% fall in the benchmark KOSPI (KS11) in afternoon trade.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening sharply lower Monday, as surging coronavirus cases prompted more restrictive measures in the region while the U.S. remains unabe to provide fresh catalysts as election day looms ever nearer.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1.7% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.8%. 
Europe continues to be hit hard by the second wave of the Covid-19 virus. France reported record new infections for the fourth consecutive day on Sunday. Italy also reported a jump in infections, and has introduced the strongest virus restrictions since the end of a national lockdown in May, while Spain is set to impose a national curfew, having declared a national state of emergency at the weekend.
The news in the U.S. doesn’t make for good reading either. The country recorded the most infections of the pandemic for the second day in a row, adding another 85,317 cases, including aides of Vice President Mike Pence. Pence himself continues to attend election campaign rallies, while White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told CNN that ""we aren't going to contol the pandemic.""
“This is a dangerous moment for many countries in the northern hemisphere as cases spike,” World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, in an online meeting of the Berlin-based World Health Summit. “We still have a long haul ahead of us.”
Investors will keep a wary eye on the release of the German Ifo business climate indicator for October later in the session to see whether these rising Covid-19 numbers are having an impact on confidence in the country’s corporate sector.
In corporate news,  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) is likely to be in the spotlight after Bloomberg reported that U.S. private equity firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) is nearing an agreement to buy the German industrial giant’s mechanical drive arm Flender, for about 2 billion euros ($2.37 billion).

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares got the week off to a hesitant start on Monday as surging coronavirus cases in Europe and the United states undermined the global outlook, while China's leaders meet to ponder the future of the economic giant.
The U.S. has seen its highest ever number of new COVID-19 cases in the past two days, while France also set unwanted case records and Spain announced a state of emergency. 
That combined with no clear progress on a U.S. stimulus package to pull S&P 500 futures down 0.6% (ESc1). EUROSTOXX 50 futures (STXEc1) eased 0.7% and FTSE futures (FFIc1) 0.4%.

A packed week for monetary policy sees three major central banks hold meetings. The Bank of Canada and Bank of Japan are expected to hold fire for now, while the market assumes the European Central Bank will sound cautious on inflation and growth even if they skip a further easing.
Data due out Thursday is forecast to show U.S. economic output rebounded by 31.9% in the third quarter, after the second's quarter's historic collapse, led by consumer spending.
Analysts at Westpac noted that such a bounce would still leave GDP around 4% lower than at the end of last year, with business investment still lagging badly.
""To fully recover the activity lost, additional meaningful fiscal stimulus is a must,"" they argued in a note.
The U.S. presidential election will again loom large as markets move to price in the chance of a Democratic president and Congress, which would likely lead to more government spending and borrowing down the road.
That outlook drove U.S. 10-year Treasury yields to their highest since early June last week at 0.8720% . They were trading at 0.83% on Monday.
""We have raised the probability of a Democratic sweep, already our base case, from 40% to just over 50% and have increased our expectation of Biden to win from 65% to 75%,"" wrote analysts at NatWest Markets in a note.
""We see steeper U.S. yield curves and a weaker USD as likely to prevail in our base case.""
The dollar was flatlining on Monday, having fallen broadly last week. The euro was holding at $1.1836 (EUR=) and just under its recent top of $1.1880, while the dollar was pinned at 104.86 yen  and not far from last week's trough of 104.32.
The dollar index was a fraction firmer at 92.904 (=USD), after shedding almost 1% last week.
In commodity markets, gold edged down 0.1% to $1,898 an ounce . 
Oil prices fell further in anticipation of a surge in Libyan crude supply and demand concerns caused by surging coronavirus cases in the United States and Europe.

(Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) has reached an agreement to buy Simply Self Storage from Canada's  Brookfield Asset Management  Inc (TO:BAMa) for about $1.2 billion, a spokeswoman for the asset manager said late on Sunday.
Blackstone's non-traded real-estate investment trust, known as BREIT, is acquiring the 8 million-square-foot portfolio of self-storage facilities, the spokeswoman said, confirming an earlier report from the Wall Street Journal.
Bloomberg reported earlier this month that Brookfield was exploring a sale of the real estate company.
The Canadian company acquired Simply Self Storage for $830 million in 2016 when it had 90 locations.
The self-storage facilities provider now operates more than 120 locations across 23 U.S. states, including Texas, Florida, New York and California, according to its website.
BREIT, which was launched in 2017 and has a net asset value of $19 billion, plans to continue to buy smaller assets in the fragmented industry and run them under the Simply brand, Tyler Henritze, head of acquisitions in the Americas for Blackstone's real-estate group, was quoted as saying by the Journal earlier on Sunday.
Self storage has remained resilient through economic cycles, evident more so during the COVID-19 pandemic as people no longer tied to office locations have moved out of cities or gone to stay with relatives, Henritze said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has dealt a body blow to the quantitative model-based style of investing, with a majority of the firms using such strategies negatively impacted, a study by Refinitiv has found.
In a report, financial data provider Refinitiv said 72% of such investors were hurt by the pandemic. Some 12% declared their models obsolete and 15% were building new ones.
Machine-learning refers to the use of complicated mathematical models and algorithms based on historical data in order to make predictions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
While such machine-driven models had success in the past as historical correlations among different asset classes held firm, they have suffered in the wake of the pandemic as these linkages have broken down.
These quantitative models have also suffered in 2020 as the amount and complexity of the inputs that go into such algorithms to generate trading signals have exploded in recent years.
""COVID-19 presented a large shift in many of the market dynamics and many institutions would have had to revisit a large portion of the models that they had in order to make them cope with what has been extreme market events,"" said Amanda West, global head of Refinitiv Labs at Refinitiv.
A majority of the respondents said the major focus areas in the next two years in the field of data strategy will be to extract more value from data and ramp up the speed of processing. The average size of data science teams in companies have more than tripled to 7.1 in 2020 from 2.7 in 2018, the study found.
The survey was conducted via 423 telephone interviews of senior executives and data-science practitioners across various financial services firms between June 29 and Aug 14, 2020.
Machine-learning has long been the mainstay of deep-pocketed hedge funds, which have combined complex algorithmic strategies with financial data to make big bets on markets.
But the coronavirus pandemic has fast-tracked the adoption of new technology across the financial industry, though the lack of quality data will be the main distinguishing factor between firms in the coming years.
The number of firms that only use unstructured data has shot up to 17% in 2020 from 2% in 2018, while only 3% of the firms surveyed said they do not use alternative data sources compared to 30% in 2018.

""Those who have instituted careful data governance processes will be far more likely to succeed in this game than those who haven't because rubbish in is rubbish out in the world of machine modelling,"" said Refinitiv's West.

BERLIN (Reuters) - SAP (DE:SAPG) on Sunday cut its guidance for the year and abandoned its forecast that profitability would expand steadily over the medium term, saying coronavirus lockdowns would hit demand well into 2021.
The German business software group, a leader in enterprise applications ranging from finance to supply-chain management, said in an ad-hoc release it was shifting strategy to accelerate its push into cloud computing.
Separately, SAP also released third-quarter results showing a 4% decline in adjusted total revenue. Operating profit was down 12%, based on international financial reporting standards, but after adjustments and at constant currency it rose by 4%.
The change of course follows a year of turmoil unleashed by the exit of long-time CEO Bill McDermott, while the leadership duo of Christian Klein and Jennifer Morgan that replaced him unravelled in April to leave Klein in sole charge as governments were locking down their economies.
At that time, the coronavirus pandemic was already having an impact on operations, but SAP stood by the medium-term 'ambition' set on McDermott's watch that foresaw profit margins growing by a percentage point a year in the five years to 2023.
In its Sunday-evening release, SAP dumped its targets for 2023 and instead replaced them with new targets for 2025.
It said the COVID-19 pandemic would have an impact on demand ""through at least the first half of 2021 pushing out the achievement of key metrics such as (adjusted) cloud revenue, total revenue, and operating profit, by 1 to 2 years"".
Further, SAP said, shifting customers more quickly to lower-margin cloud hosting from its traditional cash-cow software licenses would ""negatively impact the 2023 operating margin by approximately 4 to 5 percentage points relative to the previous mid-term ambition.""
An SAP spokesman declined to elaborate on the statement but, taking it at face value, it appeared that the company now expected margins to be flat through 2023 rather than grow by a percentage point a year, as originally targeted by McDermott.
In 2025, SAP now expects adjusted total revenue of 36 billion euros ($42.7 billion), of which 22 billion euros would be cloud revenues. This business is based on subscriptions and is less profitable than software licenses, which feature chunky up-front payments but generate less predictable cash flows.
Adjusted operating profit is expected to reach 11.5 billion euros by 2025, while the share of more predictable revenue should grow to 85%, SAP said.
RECOVERY STALLS
SAP also cut its guidance for 2020, saying the reimposition of coronavirus lockdowns by some governments had hit its business while hard-hit industries would now take longer than expected to recover.
""While SAP continues to see robust interest in its solutions to drive digital transformation as customers look to emerge from the crisis with more resilience and agility, lockdowns have been recently re-introduced in some regions and demand recovery has been more muted than expected,"" SAP said.
In particular, SAP added, it no longer anticipates a meaningful recovery in Concur, its business travel and expenses expenses application, for the remainder of this year.
SAP, headquartered in the southwestern town of Walldorf, now expects adjusted total revenue this year at 27.2 billion euros to 27.8 billion euros ($32.24-$32.95 billion), at constant currency, down from an earlier range of 27.8-28.5 billion euros.
Adjusted operating profit, also at constant currency, is now seen at between 8.1 and 8.5 billion euros. The earlier range had been 8.1-8.7 billion euros.

(Reuters) -  Cenovus Energy  Inc (TO:CVE) has agreed to buy rival  Husky Energy Inc  (TO:HSE) in an all-stock deal valued at C$3.8 billion ($2.9 billion) to create Canada's No. 3 oil and gas producer, as a pandemic-driven collapse in demand forces the industry to consolidate.
The combination, announced on Sunday, follows recent big deals in the United States.  Concho Resources Inc  (N:CXO) agreed this month to a takeover by ConocoPhillips (N:COP) for $9.7 billion. That followed  Chevron  Corp's (N:CVX) $4.2 billion purchase of  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL).
The collapse in fuel demand during pandemic lockdowns has put additional pressure on companies in Canada, the fourth-largest global oil producer, forcing them to cut costs.
They have been under stress for six years, dating back to the last downturn, due to congested pipelines and the flight by foreign oil companies and investors from Canada's high production costs and emissions.
Consolidation makes the Canadian industry leaner and lowers costs, said Jackie Forrest, executive director at the ARC Energy Research Institute, adding that deal-making is likely just getting started.
The deal makes Cenovus an integrated producer with refineries in Canada and the United States, adding to their existing half-ownerships in two U.S. refineries.
Acquiring refineries, pipelines and storage offered a solution to Canada's often-congested pipelines, which have usually created price discounts, said Cenovus CEO Alex Pourbaix.
""In one fell swoop, this deal will almost completely remove our exposure to (West Texas Intermediate/Western Canada Select) differentials,"" Pourbaix told analysts on Sunday, referring to the discounts.
Pourbaix said the deal did not come in response to the risk that oil pipelines will be more difficult to build if Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden wins the White House on Nov. 3.
HONG KONG TYCOON
After the deal closes, Cenovus shareholders would own 61% of the combined entity, with Husky shareholders controlling the rest. Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing-controlled Hutchison Whampoa would hold a 15.7% stake in the new company. 
Hutchison Whampoa is the biggest shareholder of Husky currently, with a 40.2% stake.
Cenovus' deal for Husky is valued at C$23.6 billion, including debt, the companies said. 
It is the biggest Canadian oil and gas deal in nearly four years, based on enterprise value, said Tom Pavic, president of Sayer Energy Advisors, which advises on M&A. 
Cenovus said the deal would create Canada's third-largest producer based on total company output behind Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources Ltd (TO:CNQ) and  Suncor Energy  Ltd (TO:SU).
Husky shareholders will receive 0.7845 of a Cenovus share and 0.0651 of a Cenovus share purchase warrant in exchange for each Husky common share, according to the statement. Husky's market value stood at C$3.2 billion as of Friday's close, which implies Cenovus is offering a 19.5% premium through the all-stock deal.
Cenovus and Husky shares have lost 63% and 70% respectively this year, exceeding the Toronto energy index (SPTTEN) loss of 53%. 
The combined company is expected to generate annual synergies of C$1.2 billion and will operate as Cenovus Energy Inc with headquarters in Alberta.
Pourbaix will serve as chief executive of the merged company with Jeff Hart, currently Husky's finance chief, becoming chief financial officer.
Cenovus said the combined company will be able to produce 750,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d).
The transaction has been approved by the boards of both Cenovus and Husky and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, the companies said.
RBC Capital Markets and TD Securities are acting as financial advisors to Cenovus, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Canada and CIBC Capital Markets are acting as financial advisors to Husky.

809,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2020 03:15PM ET</span>","Siemens, Carlyle near $2.4 billion deal over Flender business: Bloomberg","(Reuters) - U.S. buyout group  Carlyle Group  Inc (O:CG) is nearing an agreement to acquire  Siemens  AG's (DE:SIEGn) mechanical drive arm Flender, for about for about 2 billion euros ($2.37 billion), Bloomberg News https://bloom.bg/35ylyvj reported citing sources.
Siemens and Carlyle are finalizing terms of the deal that could be announced as early as this week, the report said.
Last week Siemens had asked Triton, Carlyle, CVC and Brookfield to submit final offers next week for the business, which has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of just above 200 million euros and could be valued at 8-9 times that, according to sources.
Brookfield was outbid by Carlyle in the end, the report said, adding that the talks could still be delayed or fall apart. 
Siemens declined to comment, Carlyle did not immediately respond to a request for a comment. 
Flender supplies Winergy branded gear boxes and generators for wind turbines, gears and couplings for cranes, ships, oil and gas production, as well as components for the chemicals, pharma, cement and food industries.
Siemens bought Flender, which traces its roots back to a 19th century maker of belt pulleys, from Babcock Borsig in 2005. Flender has, however, not lived up to Siemens' growth and profitability expectations.
The divestiture is a part of the industrial conglomerate's plans to streamline its operations.

Lufthansa and its subsidiaries Eurowings, Swiss, Austrian and Brussels Airlines will ground 125 more aircraft during the winter than originally planned, Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said in a letter to staff seen by Reuters.
""It is unavoidable to ramp down operations during the winter of 2020/21 even further and to put as many areas as possible in 'hibernation' from mid-December,"" he said.

814,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2020 10:26AM ET</span>",Samsung's Lee: tainted titan who built a global tech giant,"By Miyoung Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - In February 1993, five years after taking over from his father at South Korea's Samsung (KS:005930) Group, 51-year-old Lee Kun-hee was frustrated that he wasn't making his mark.
He summoned a group of Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) executives to a Best Buy store in Los Angeles for a reality check on the Samsung brand. Covered in dust, a Samsung TV set sat on a corner shelf with a price tag nearly $100 cheaper than a rival  Sony  Corp (T:6758) model.
After a tense nine-hour follow-up meeting, Lee kick-started a strategic shift at Samsung - to gain market share through quality, not quantity.
Lee, who died aged 78 on Sunday after being hospitalised for a heart attack in 2014, was driven by a constant sense of crisis, which he instilled in his leadership teams to drive change and fight complacency. In the mid-1990s, Lee personally recalled around $50 million worth of poor quality mobile phones and fax machines, and set fire to them.
This focus on crisis, and his often abrasive manner, helped Lee grow his father Lee Byung-chull's noodle trading business into a sprawling business empire with assets worth about $375 billion as of May 2020 in dozens of affiliates stretching from electronics and insurance to shipbuilding and construction. 
Samsung Electronics developed from a second-tier TV maker to the world's biggest technology firm by revenue - seeing off Japanese brands Sony (NYSE:SNE), Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) Corp and Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp in chips, TVs and displays; ending Nokia Oyj (HE:NOKIA)'s handset supremacy and beating Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in smartphones.
In a 1997 essay, Lee recalled his frustration at management inertia. ""The external business environment was not good ... but there was no sense of anxiety within the organization, and everyone appeared to be eaten up with self-conceit ... I needed to tighten them up a bit and repeatedly reminded managers of the need to have the sense of crisis.""
In 2013, Forbes named Lee as the second most powerful South Korean, ranked only behind United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
FEARED AND REVERED
Four months after the Los Angeles meeting, Lee called his lieutenants to a Frankfurt hotel conference room, where he laid out his ""New Management"" plan, exhorting executives to ""change everything except your wife and children.""
Executive meetings proved brutal, often stretching to 10 hours, with participants afraid to even drink water as they didn't want to have to interrupt Lee's flow by visiting the washroom. 
Lee's business acumen made him the object of endless fascination and speculation in Korea, but he and the empire he built have also been vilified by critics and activist shareholders for wielding such economic clout, hierarchical and opaque governance, and dubious transfers of the family wealth.
In 2008, Lee was accused of managing a political slush fund and of helping his children buy Samsung company shares on the cheap. Prosecutors failed to prove either charge, but Lee was convicted of tax evasion and embezzlement. He apologised and stepped down, only to return within two years following a presidential pardon.
He had since kept a lower profile and delegated to an army of managers, while promoting his son, Jay Y. Lee, to vice chairman, a grooming post for the eventual transfer of power. 
As his health deteriorated - Lee needed help in walking and was susceptible to respiratory diseases following lung cancer treatment - he was a less frequent presence at Samsung's headquarters, spending long winter vacations in Japan or Hawaii.
But his hold over the group remained undimmed. Whenever he travelled overseas, at least four of Samsung's top executives, along with company crew and security, would be at the airport to see him off.
At Samsung's human resources development centre, the tens of thousands of employees attending training sessions pay a silent vigil to a mock-up of the drab Frankfurt hotel conference room - with furniture specially imported from Germany. As most of Samsung's 260,886 regular staff, according to South Korea's Fair Trade Commission, are in their 20s and 30s and didn't experience Lee's managerial heyday first-hand, this homage serves to remind them of the need to 'think crisis,"" several people who have been trained at the centre said.
JAPAN EXPOSURE
Lee was born in 1942 in the southern Korean village of Uiryeong, the third son of Samsung's founder. He was sent to Japan at the age of 11, just after the Korean war ended. His father wanted his sons to learn how Japan was rebuilding from the ashes of World War Two.
He has admitted to being a loner and found it tough to make friends when he returned home to a country riven with anti-Japanese sentiment. He went back to Japan to study economics at Waseda University, and then business management at George Washington University in the United States.
His early exposure to Japan's advanced technology led him to establish the basis of Samsung Electronics by forming alliances with the likes of Sanyo, and adopting chip making and TV manufacturing technologies.
Lee began his Samsung career in broadcasting, working his way up to group chairman by 1987, breaking with the traditional Confucian practice of the eldest son taking over the reins. His older brother, Lee Maeng-hee, was initially chosen to lead Samsung in 1967 when his father retired, but his aggressive management style caused friction with the founder's confidants, according to several books about Samsung. 
The second son, Lee Chang-hee, severed family ties by telling the presidential office that his father had a $1 million slush fund overseas.
Lee senior exiled Chang-hee to the United States and returned as chairman himself. In 1976, diagnosed with cancer, he handed the business down to Kun-hee. Chang-hee died in 1991.
Kun-hee's hunched posture, due to a traffic accident, soft voice, round eyes and often bemused expression were atypical for such a powerful character. Married to Hong Ra-hee, who ran a Samsung-affiliated art gallery called the Leeum - a combination of Lee and museum - Lee had a son and three daughters. 
His youngest daughter died in New York in 2005, which Samsung said at a car accident but media reports said was a suicide.
Lee had been a member of the International Olympic Committee between 1996 and 2017.

SABIC reported a net profit of 1.09 billion riyals ($291 million) in the quarter that ended on September 30, up from 740 million riyals in the same period a year earlier. The result came after three straight quarters of losses, on a jump in impairment charges and drop in sales.
Still SABIC cautioned that supply still exceeds demand for its key products, which will continue to pressure product prices and margins for the foreseeable future.
The third-quarter return to profit, SABIC said, was mainly due to higher average selling prices, higher production and sales volume, in addition to a reversal of impairment provisions in certain financial assets in the quarter of about 690 million riyals. 
Analysts had expected SABIC to post a net profit of 775 million riyals, according to a mean estimate of analysts based on Refinitiv Eikon data showed.

The job losses are part of ANA's broader business restructuring plan to be announced on Tuesday, as it scrambles to cut fixed costs in anticipation of a prolonged downturn in travel demand, the Yomiuri said on Sunday.
ANA, which had group workforce of 43,500 as of last year, plans to achieve the job cut target by the year ending in March 2023 through outplacement programmes and a hiring freeze, according to the paper.

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's Ant Group could raise up to $17.3 billion in the Shanghai leg of the likely $35 billion dual listing, the world's largest ever, after some large investors submitted bids in the range of 68-69 yuan per share, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The simultaneous listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai of the Chinese financial technology giant, backed by e-commerce behemoth  Alibaba  (N:BABA), would beat the previous largest IPO,  Saudi Aramco 's (SE:2222) $29.4 billion float last December.
The pricing for the Shanghai tranche of the initial public offering was decided on Friday, Alibaba founder Jack Ma said on Saturday, without disclosing the price.
""It's the first time that the pricing of such a big listing - the largest in human history - has been determined outside New York City,"" he told the Bund Summit in the eastern financial hub of Shanghai, referring to Ant's float as a ""miracle"".
Later on Saturday, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters many large Chinese fund managers had bid for Ant shares in the listing on the Nasdaq-style STAR Market in Shanghai at close to 69 yuan ($10.32) apiece.
At 69 yuan per share, Ant could raise up to 115.3 billion yuan ($17.3 billion) in the Shanghai tranche, valuing the company as a whole at up to 2.1 trillion yuan ($314 billion), before a 15% greenshoe or over-allotment option is exercised.
Under local market rules, the final price for the IPO, which would also be the first dual-listing in Hong Kong and on the year-old STAR, is based on guidance from large investors.
The people declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media. Ant declined to comment on the pricing.
GOOD FORTUNE
The IPO would burnish the Shanghai-based exchange's status as a fast-growing capital markets center, at a time when rising Sino-U.S. tensions have triggered concerns about the prospects of listing of Chinese companies in New York.
Ant has chosen the stock code 688688 for its Shanghai listing, which for Chinese speakers combines two of the luckiest or most auspicious numbers, together symbolizing long-lasting prosperity and good fortune in Chinese culture. 
Books for the Shanghai leg of the float will open for one day on Oct. 29.
Ant plans to sell up to 1.67 billion shares in the Shanghai float, which is set to be the biggest IPO in China, eclipsing the record set by Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF)'s (SS:601288) $10.1 billion Shanghai float in 2010, according to Refinitiv data.
Strategic investors, whose investments in Ant's STAR IPO will be locked up for at least 12 months, will account for 80% of the Shanghai float. 
Among them are Zhejiang Tmall Technology, a unit of Alibaba, which has committed to purchase 44% of the Shanghai float, according to Ant's updated prospectus.
Ant aims to split the share sale evenly between Hong Kong and Shanghai, selling up to 11% of its enlarged share capital.
For the Hong Kong leg, Ant plans to open order books as soon as Monday and price the offering in coming days, separate sources have said.
Ant did not immediately respond to request for comment on the Hong Kong timetable late on Saturday. 

Its shares are likely to start trading a few days after the U.S. presidential election, which could fuel a spike in market volatility.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The mammoth dual listing for Chinese fintech giant Ant Group will be the world's biggest, according to a pricing determined on Friday night,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) founder Jack Ma said on Saturday.
""It's the first time that the pricing of such a big listing - the largest in human history - has been determined outside New York City"" he told the Bund Summit in the eastern financial hub of Shanghai.
""We didn't dare to think about it five years ago, or even three years ago. But a miracle just occurred,"" he told the audience, which included officials from China's regulators. 
He did not give exact details of the pricing which is expected to be officially announced next week. 
Backed by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, Ant plans to list simultaneously in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's STAR Market in the coming weeks.
Sources have said the listing could be worth $35 billion, surpassing the record set by  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222)'s $29.4 billion float last December. 
Ma said the financial and regulatory system stifles innovation, calling for a revamp to extend financial services to more small firms and individuals on the basis of technology - an ethos that Ant is largely based on.
He said the global system established after World War II is outdated and too risk-averse, calling the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ""an old men's club"" and warning that risks are accumulating in the whole economy. 
In China, banks still operate with a strong ""pawnshop"" mentality, demanding collateral and guarantees before lending, a model that will fail to fuel future growth, he said. 
Instead, he said a new, inclusive and universal banking system that lends to small businesses and individuals on the basis of big data should be established. 
Ant, which has an extensive payment and micro-lending business that is largely based on big data, has faced rising scrutiny from regulators. 

""Today's financial system is the legacy of the Industrial Age,"" Ma said. ""We must set up a new one for the next generation and young people. We must reform the current system.""

822,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 24, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>",This SPAC Found the Right Fit in CarID,"By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- This auto parts company has nary a warehouse in sight, and that's the plan. 
Onyx Enterprises connects customers -- mostly comprised of gearheads, for now -- to parts distributors via CARiD.com, an e-commerce company it owns and operates. Onyx is poised to go public in a merger with a special purpose acquisition company Legacy Acquisition Corp., which will change its name to PARTS iD, and move from specialty accessories and parts into repair and collision, a market 10-times the size of the one CARiD currently serves.
""There is a lot of competition in the market,"" said Nino Ciappina, interim general manager at Onyx, in a video interview. ""What makes us different is the tech infrastructure, which we purpose-built over the past 10 years.""
Here's what CARiD says sets it apart: The technology to source 17 million SKUs -- or stock keeping units, aka, individual products -- and growing. Compare that to rival Carparts.Com Inc (NASDAQ:PRTS), which has about 830,000 SKUs, according to its most recent quarterly report. The rival also boasts more than 840,000-square-feet of warehouse space, and growing.
CARiD's model does not require significant investments in distribution centers or inventory.
There are millions of parts and accessories given how many different models of cars are made each year -- this is known as fitment -- making servicing the market as a whole a challenge. 
""It creates an incredible amount of friction in this particular industry,"" Ciappina said. E-commerce solutions that exist aren't built for this kind of multidimensional industry. ""We wanted to control the accuracy of the data.""
After the reverse merger, CARiD will have up to $55.5 million of cash on the balance sheet to fund future growth and potential acquisitions. The implied pro forma enterprise value is $331.1 million.
CARiD, which estimates it will bring in $401 million in revenue this year, has more than 800 partners and 2,800 shipping locations in the U.S. 
""We can offer a wide selection and get goods to consumers relatively quickly, regardless of what you're ordering,"" Ciappina said. ""Our business model is completely unique.""
That was exactly what Legacy Acquisition was looking for. 
Legacy is led by a couple dozen former corporate executives and entrepreneurs, largely African-Americans, with years of experience at places like Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Coty (NYSE:COTY) and Maytag.
Legacy Chief Executive Officer Edwin Rigaud said he has made it a point to get underrepresented groups involved in capitalism.  
""The more talent we can bring to Wall Street, the better off we all are,"" Rigaud said in the same interview. ""There is African-American talent that's been sitting there waiting to do things, and not knowing exactly how to do it. This is my legacy.""
Legacy went public in November 2017, raising about $300 million. 
""We have 25-plus experts who know how to look at an opportunity like this and really determine in depth to determine whether it's the right fit for the right company and whether it has growth potential,” Rigaud said. “There aren't other Spac teams that are comparable with the expertise that we have.”        
CARiD's market specialty equipment and accessories -- think, custom rims --  still represents the center of the business, but the focus is on building out product lines like repair that have a higher purchase frequency. After all, how often does one need new chrome rims?
“Our core objective is to win the automotive space, we know that's the much bigger opportunity,"" Ciappina said. “That is the quickest path to $1 billion in revenue.”

823,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 24, 2020 06:46AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: The Case for Netflix,"By Liz Moyer and Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com -- Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) faces new competitors and an uphill battle with subscriber growth, but don’t let that sway you.
Overseas markets are a big source of growth, and the streaming giant is on better footing operationally now that production is gearing back up after lockdowns in the spring that affected the television and film production cycle. 
But Netflix is losing market share and will have to fight to keep it from eroding further.
Investing.com's Liz Moyer argues the bull case for Netflix, while Yasin Ebrahim explains why this is one stock to avoid. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bull Case
If you’re bullish on Netflix, you’re not going to let a little lull in subscriber growth get you down.
Earlier this week, Netflix reported disappointing results. It added 2.2 million global subscribers in the quarter, but that was short of its own guidance. Profits of $1.74 a share also fell short. 
The numbers even failed to meet the expectations of analysts, but several Wall Street analysts raised their price targets despite the miss, and many confirmed a positive outlook on the stock. The shares are up 50% this year.
The pandemic was a boost to Netflix’s business earlier this year as hunkered down people comforted themselves by binge-streaming. It added 25 million new subscribers in the first half of the year. The nationwide shut down of movie theaters during the worst of the spring virus wave also pushed more people seeking entertainment to streaming services like Netflix. Habits are hard to change.
Now that things are opening back up (in fits and starts), subscriber growth naturally won’t keep pace with this spring. But that doesn’t mean Netflix’s business is broken.
One metric some analysts jumped on was positive free cash flow in the quarter. Netflix has had trouble keeping this measure in the green as it spends on new content, but the company says it’s on track for $2 billion in cash flow this year and an operating margin of 19%. The CEO was optimistic on the company’s ability to maintain positive cash flow next year even as production -- and spending -- gets going again on new shows.
Even if new subscribers are slowing in the U.S., Netflix still has an opportunity to expand overseas, where rates are growing at 30% or more. Michael Morris of Guggenheim, who rates the stock a buy with a $570 price target, says opportunities in India and South Asia are encouraging.
High-growth, mobile markets “stay basic to the Netflix bull case,” he writes, “with native partnerships as a key driver.”
Netflix also faces new competition from Disney + as well as older foes such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), but its content keeps a loyal following coming back for more. In the early days of the pandemic lockdowns, audiences flocked to Tiger King, a true crime documentary series.
Next up: season four of The Crown, the wildly popular Netflix original series about the British royal family. That starts streaming in mid-November.

825,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 10:33PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: More U.S. companies offer earnings guidance despite pandemic,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With earnings season in full swing, more companies are again offering earnings guidance, signaling to investors that some corporations are adapting to uncertainty about a global pandemic that may extend deep into next year.
Overall, 73 companies in the S&P 500 index have offered guidance this quarter so far, up from last quarter's 65 pre-announcements but well below the 170 companies that typically offer guidance, according to Refinitiv data. The companies offering guidance are giving the most bullish expectations in Refinitiv data going back to 1997. 
""If a company is able to offer guidance it shows that they're able to have a better idea of what's coming down the road,"" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management.
The market has been buffeted by cross-currents related to the looming Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, drawn out fiscal stimulus talks in Washington and a resurgent pandemic. Still, investors appear more hopeful in recent months. 
Fifty percent of high net worth U.S. investors surveyed by UBS Global Wealth Management voiced optimism on the economy, up from 41% three months prior, with 55% optimistic on stocks, up from 44%. The S&P 500 index is up nearly 7% year to date, including a 2.2% gain since the start of October.
So far this quarter, shares of AT&T Inc (N:T),  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) and Quest Diagnostics Inc (N:DGX) have rallied after each company gave investors updated guidance on how they expect to fare over the next fiscal year. 
""It's not surprising we've had so many beats this quarter because we entered the season with very little guidance,"" causing analysts to slash their estimates, said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Wealth Management.
""Now we're seeing how companies expect to be able to navigate through the challenges of the year ahead,"" she said.
Investors next week will wade through the busiest period of earnings season so far, with companies ranging from  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) to  Pinterest Inc  (N:PINS) scheduled to report results. 
Microsoft, in particular, should outperform its conservative guidance thanks to strong PC shipments and growth of its Azure cloud computing platform, said J. Derrick Wood, an analyst at Cowen.
""The set-up feels more compelling as the bar was reset last quarter and as macroconditions are improving,"" he said.
Nearly 86% of companies that have reported earnings so far have beat analyst expectations, a rate 20 percentage points higher than the average beat rate since 1994, according to Refinitiv data. 
Still, investors like Nixon say they are looking past beat rates and focusing on companies that can improve or maintain measures such as refinancing debt, raising cash, and controlling costs regardless of the pandemic's trajectory or a breakthrough in stimulus talks. 
The White House and congressional Democrats remain in negotiations for another coronavirus relief bill, though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has signaled he may not bring the bill to the floor until after the election.
Companies in the S&P 500 index are likely to post average earnings growth rates of up to 25% next year as they bounce off of prior-year comparisons during the worst of the economic lockdowns, said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI). 
Companies that can offer positive guidance despite the unknowns are also more likely to weather higher corporate taxes expected if Democratic challenger Joe Biden beats President Donald Trump and Democrats take the U.S. Senate, he said. 

""We're seeing a lot of positive metrics that show that these companies may be able to easily absorb any cut to earnings,"" he said.

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) on Friday urged a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit by dozens of Black former franchise owners who accused the fast-food giant of racial discrimination for selling them underperforming stores, saying it did not want them to fail and never promised success.
In a filing in the federal court in Chicago, McDonald's said its franchise agreements made clear the obligations and risks of owning restaurants, which was ""fatal"" to the claim it defrauded the 52 plaintiffs, who operated more than 200 stores and have been seeking as much as $1 billion in damages.
McDonald's, which is based in Chicago, also said many of the plaintiffs' claims were too old, and that there was no proof it made or broke promises that would support their ""expansive"" claim of longstanding, companywide discrimination.
""On its face, this claim is illogical as it suggests the company somehow has an interest in undermining its franchisees and seeing them fail,"" McDonald's said. ""Success is promised to no one, and plaintiffs' struggles - while regrettable - are simply not a basis for a claim against McDonald's.""
Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Aug. 31 lawsuit accused McDonald's of steering prospective Black franchisees to stores in depressed, crime-ridden neighborhoods requiring high security and insurance costs and where sales lagged the nationwide average.
While McDonald's has denied treating Black franchisees differently, Chris Kempczinski told employees in August that its franchisee ranks ""should and must more closely reflect the increasingly diverse composition of this country and the world.""
McDonald's has also denied discrimination claims in a separate lawsuit filed by two Black executives in January in the Chicago court.

They said McDonald's harsh grading of stores and other ""strong-arm"" tactics drove a disproportionate number of Black franchisees from its system.

827,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 06:36PM ET</span>","U.S. tentatively approves Delta, WestJet alliance","By David Shepardson and Allison Lampert
WASHINGTON/MONTREAL (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department said on Friday it had tentatively approved a proposed alliance agreement between Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and Canada's WestJet that is expected to expand travel options between the United States and Canada.
The department said as part of its tentative antitrust immunity approval it would require the carriers to remove Swoop, an ultra low-cost carrier affiliate of WestJet, from the alliance, and divest 16 takeoff and landing slots at New York's LaGuardia Airport.
The department also proposes to require WestJet to provide interline access to select carriers flying to Canada, and to review the proposed alliance in five years. Interline agreements allow consumers to fly to destinations using both airlines.
The Delta-WestJet joint venture would have a combined 27%share of scheduled air carrier transborder capacity, while the dominant carrier,  Air Canada  (TO:AC), would have 45%.
WestJet, which is owned by private equity firm Onex Corp (TO:ONEX), welcomed the tentative approval, saying the two carriers are reviewing the order ""and will respond.""
The carriers said the proposed alliance ""would optimize aircraft utilization, enhance schedules, and lower costs.""
Canada, with 38 million people, is the second-largest U.S. international passenger air market after Mexico, with Toronto flights accounting for over 50% of transborder air travel demand.
U.S.-Canada transborder flight capacity has grown 15% over the last five years to 39 million seats annually.
The department said competition is not as healthy for U.S.-Canada flights versus transborder U.S. flights to Mexico, noting comparable U.S.-Canadian flight fares are 12% higher.
Air carriers had urged slot divestitures at New York's LaGuardia, noting American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta and United Air Lines control 83% of all slots, with Delta controlling 45% of flights. 

New York-Toronto flights account for 6% of all U.S.-Canadian flights and the route is the second largest U.S. international air travel market.

(Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) said on Friday its coronavirus vaccine deal with Oxford University will allow it to add up to 20% of manufacturing costs to cover additional expenses required to be incurred by the British drugmaker.
""In addition to the manufacturing costs, the company is incurring costs in excess of $1 billion globally that include clinical development, regulatory, distribution, pharmacovigilance and other expenses"", an AstraZeneca spokesman said in a statement.
""To cover these additional expenses, the company will add an amount equivalent to a maximum of 20% of the manufacturing costs to ensure there is no material impact on its finances this year while continuing efforts to provide the vaccine at no profit during the pandemic,"" the statement added.
AstraZeneca has previously signed multiple supply-and-manufacture deals for more than 3 billion doses globally.
These agreements are with companies and governments as the company gets closer to reporting early results of a late-stage clinical trial. Developed by the University of Oxford and licensed to AstraZeneca in April, the vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval.
The company had said earlier it has created multiple supply chains to ensure that access to its vaccine is timely, broad and equitable for high- and low-income countries alike.
Pricing and supply of experimental COVID-19 vaccines have been widely debated as richer countries pump billions of dollars into funding, and AstraZeneca has also been granted protection from future liability claims.

Separately, AstraZeneca resumed the U.S. trial of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine after approval by regulators, the company said on Friday.

829,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 06:30PM ET</span>","Brazil prosecutors accuse BHP, Vale of colluding to reduce payouts to disaster victims","SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian federal prosecutors have accused mining giants BHP and Vale of colluding with a lawyer to reduce compensation for victims of a fatal dam collapse and interfere with a landmark lawsuit against BHP in the UK.
A mining waste dam burst in 2015 at BHP and Vale's Samarco joint venture in the town of Mariana, releasing a torrent of sludge that killed 19 people. The collapse is also considered the country's worst-ever environmental disaster, contaminating a river for hundreds of miles to the ocean.
In a 91-page document attached to court filings on Thursday, prosecutors in Minas Gerais state criticized a judge who accepted compensation limits for nine plaintiffs and then extended the limits to all victims in Baixo Guandu, Espirito Santo state, affected by the sludge flowing down river from the disaster. Details of the decision are under seal. 
""Moral damages"" claims were limited to 10,000 reais ($1,780).
Baixo Guandu has about 31,000 residents, according to Brazil's statistics agency IBGE.
Vale and BHP did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The prosecutors said the judge ruled under seal in the case, without the proper participation of the prosecution office, despite requests for access.  
The decision would end liabilities for BHP, Vale and Samarco for victims who accept the compensation, the prosecutors said. Victims who received payouts under the decision would have no chance to claim further compensation outside the country. 
BHP is also the subject of a $6.3 billion lawsuit in the United Kingdom brought by 200,000 Brazilian people and groups. BHP has called the lawsuit ""pointless and wasteful.""
The prosecutors' appeal is the latest in a series of ongoing lawsuits against Vale and BHP over the mining disaster, which have made the companies set aside multi-billion dollar provisions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed modestly higher on Friday in choppy trading, with investors keeping a close eye on negotiations on a U.S. stimulus package that would ease the economic shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The Dow ended lower on the day, moving within tight ranges.
Uncertainty over the timeline of the relief legislation has been weighing on Wall Street's major indexes in recent sessions, with all three indexes posting declines for the week.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it still was possible to get another round of COVID-19 aid before the Nov. 3 election, but that it was up to President Donald Trump to act, including talking to reluctant Senate Republicans, if he wants it.
Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin countered that Pelosi must compromise to get an aid package, saying significant differences remained between the Republican administration and Democrats.
Still the market believes a stimulus deal is going to get done: The only question would be size and timing, analysts said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 28.09 points lower, or 0.1%, to 28,335.57, the S&P 500 gained 11.9 points, or 0.34%, to 3,465.39 and the Nasdaq Composite added 42.28 points, or 0.37%, to 11,548.28. The communication services sector rose 1.1%, the highest gainer among the major S&P sectors.

Meanwhile, a record 50 million Americans cast ballots, eclipsing total early voting from the 2016 election. 
Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden debated on Thursday for the last time to persuade the few remaining undecided voters 11 days before their contest, but while the debate was more toned down and substantive, it hardly moved the needle.
Trump still trailed former vice president Biden in national polls after the debate, although the contest is much tighter in some battleground states where the election will likely be decided.
A sharp 10% fall in chipmaker  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) after it reported a drop in margins earlier weighed on the market. Intel's results were pressured as consumers bought cheaper laptops and pandemic-stricken businesses and governments clamped down on data center spending.

835,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>","Analysis: Stimulus-fueled rally in Treasury yields may have room to run, investors say","By David Randall and Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are gauging whether a rally in bond yields to their highest in months can run further, as markets increasingly price in chances that a fiscal stimulus deal is signed in Washington regardless of who wins the Nov. 3 election.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR), which move inversely to bond prices, rose to 0.8682% Friday morning, the highest since early June when the U.S. economy began to reemerge from widespread lockdowns to halt the spread of the coronavirus.
Past rallies in Treasury yields have wilted over the years, as the Federal Reserve has kept rates low to help spark growth.
This time, however, some investors are betting that conditions may be right for a more sustained move. Lawmakers appear ready to deliver more fiscal stimulus in coming months, a vaccine against COVID-19 may come next year, and more U.S. Treasury bond offerings are set to weigh on prices.
""It may now be time to flip thinking on U.S. rates where instead of mechanically buying dips ... upticks in bond prices now need to be sold,"" analysts at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) wrote on Friday.
Net short bets on the 30-year Treasury (US30YT=RR) reached an all-time high earlier this month, reflecting wagers that yields would continue to rise on expectations of economic recovery and rising inflation.
Longer-dated bonds are sensitive to inflation expectations as rising consumer prices can erode their value.
The potential for more issuance to fund fiscal stimulus could also be a potential weight on Treasury prices.
The Treasury Department has issued record amounts of debt this year – roughly $15.5 trillion through the end of September – to fund government spending programs, most notably, the stimulus package Congress passed earlier this year.
The heavy supply has had a muted effect on prices so far, given the Fed's near-zero interest rates and hefty debt purchases. Issuance could rise in the coming months if a fresh round of stimulus funding is passed, however.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday it still was possible to get another round of COVID-19 aid before the election, but that it was up to President Donald Trump to act, including bringing along reluctant Senate Republicans.
Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin countered that Pelosi must compromise to get an aid package.
At the same time, some investors believe a win by Democratic candidate Joe Biden, who is leading in the polls, and a sweep by Democrats in the Nov. 3 vote would likely usher in a bigger fiscal package and more economic spending, boosting bond prices further.
""My view is that the curve has further to go ... if Biden does end up securing the White House and the Democrats take the Senate,"" said John Briggs head of strategy, Americas at NatWest Markets.
Bets on a Biden victory may have been further fueled by the lack of any standout moments in the final debate between Trump and Biden on Thursday. Trump entered the debate trailing by 10 percentage points in national polls, though the contest appears tighter in some battleground states where the election will likely be decided.
Rising yields are a potential problem for the Fed as they raise the cost of borrowing for companies and individuals and threaten economic growth.
Still, ""the Fed is not interested, exclusively, in keeping long-term interest rates low,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist, Janney Montgomery Scott.
""If long-term interest rates rise because of stronger economic or inflation expectations, that is actually a good thing and I don't think the Federal Reserve intends to choke it off,"" he said.

(Reuters) -  American Express  Co (N:AXP) on Friday warned that business travel spending would not pick up before early 2022 after reporting underwhelming third-quarter profit due to weak spending on travel and entertainment by its card users.
In what appears to be a shift in strategy, the New York-based credit card issuer, for long a preferred choice of affluent Americans, walked back on its cost-cutting target of nearly $3 billion in 2020 and decided to spend heavily to add new card customers. 
""We're all consistent in terms of how we feel about business travel, which is probably not going to (pick up) till late 2021, early 2022,"" Chief Executive Officer Stephen Squeri said in a post-earnings conference call with analysts.
Credit card companies have been hit hard as the pandemic-induced recession forces companies to lay off workers and consumers to stay at home, drastically reducing their purchasing power.
Spending on its cards fell 19% to $248.7 billion in the quarter, with travel and entertainment related spending sliding 69% from a year earlier.
AmEx, which has tie-ups with large airlines and hotels and whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), set aside $665 million in loss provisions during the quarter. 
However, it was still lower than what it set aside last quarter, as the outlook for potential defaults improved, with AmEx saying that overall spending volumes had shown a ""steady recovery"" since the lows of mid-April.
Online consumer retail spending was a bright spot for the card issuer during the quarter, clocking a 32% jump over last year. 
Non-travel and entertainment spending, which comprises most of the spending on AmEx's network and includes online and offline retail spending, inched up 1% from a year ago after adjusting for cross-currency fluctuations.
Quarterly profit fell 40% to $1.07 billion, or $1.30 per share, missing analysts' average estimate of $1.35 per share, according to Refinitiv data, hurt mainly by higher expenses. 
Total revenue, excluding interest expense, fell 20% to $8.8 billion, but came in ahead of muted expectations. 

AmEx shares, which have lost about 16% of their value so far this year, fell 3.5% after reporting results.

GENEVA/ZURICH (Reuters) - Health officials reviewing Gilead Science Inc's (O:GILD) remdesivir against COVID-19 should consider all evidence, including a trial where the medicine failed, before giving it the green light, the top WHO scientist said on Friday.
U.S. regulators appeared not to have done so when approving the drug this week, Soumya Swaminathan told a news conference. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved Gilead's antiviral drug for treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19, making it the first and only drug approved for the disease in the United States.
The FDA decision came a week after the release of the results of the World Health Organization's Solidarity trial, which concluded remdesivir has little or no impact on a patient's chances of surviving COVID-19.
Swaminathan said that the FDA does not appear to have taken the global health body's study into account in its approval. 
""We believe our results are very robust,"" Swaminathan said, when asked about the FDA move. ""We hope that people who are doing treatment guidelines in other countries, as well as regulators around the world, will take note of our study results, in addition to the other evidence.""
""Because you need to look at the global evidence for a drug, before you make decisions,"" she added.
For the remdesivir arm of the WHO's Solidarity trial, 2,743 patients were given the treatment, compared to 2,708 in the control group. 
Gilead's own study, of 1,062 participants, produced data indicating that the treatment cut COVID-19 recovery time by five days and helped reduce the risk of death in some patients who were getting oxygen.
The company, which has raised the possibility of bias in the ""unblinded"" WHO study because patients and their doctors were aware of which treatments were being used, got initial data showing that remdesivir failed the Solidarity trial in late September, the WHO has said. 
The U.S. company said it told the FDA about initial Solidarity results.
""We have apprised FDA of the topline WHO Solidarity trial results and the draft manuscript"", submitted to a publication, it said. ""However, at this time Gilead has not received the requested datasets from WHO for the Solidarity trial results.""
The FDA did not immediately comment on Swaminathan's statement that the U.S. agency did not take Solidarity data into account in its approval. 
The WHO also said on Friday that its formal guidelines on use of remdesivir for COVID-19 should be ready for release in three to four weeks, after a separate group within the United Nations health agency reviews data from the study. 
An independent WHO panel will convene next week to look at all evidence of the effectiveness of Gilead's drug, Janet Diaz, the WHO's top official for clinical care responses, said.

""We would anticipate that the guidelines will be available within three to four weeks,"" Diaz said. ""What we're doing now in the pandemic is to try to continue with that approach in a transparent and trustworthy way, but do it faster.""

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian fitness-equipment maker Technogym (MI:TGYM) is working to supply more of its exercise machines and virtual trainers to peoples' homes to offset a drop in sales to gyms and studios due to the pandemic.
Restrictions to contain the new coronavirus, or even just fears of contagion, have prompted many people to give up training at their local gym. Italy has not ruled out closing gyms and swimming pools again to fight a COVID-19 resurgence.
""We are seeing a strong acceleration in the home fitness segment,"" Technogym founder and Chief Executive Nerio Alessandri told Reuters in an interview.
Technogym has been the official supplier of the last seven Olympic games and its client book includes several top soccer clubs. Alessandri said the company had been selling equipment to professional athletes stuck at home.
It also received an order from a big company that bought a ""Technogym package"" for its staff, offering employees working from home training programmes and equipment. 
""We think that the Home & Consumer segment could come to represent around 50% of our total revenues in four years from now. And profit margins match those of the professional segment,"" added Alessandri, 59.
Companies such as exercise bike business Peloton (O:PTON) have successfully tapped into the home workout market as people try to stay fit during lockdowns.
Technogym, which supplies equipment to gyms, hotels and spas in around 100 countries, can offer home-friendly products. An ""entry level"" treadmill costs 3,250 euros ($3,850) and an exercise bike 2,950 euros.
In September, Technogym reported that first-half revenue fell to 222 million euros from 295 million a year earlier. By contrast, the group recorded a jump in sales of its home fitness equipment.
Sales of exercise machines and online training programmes directly to customers soared by 50% in the first half. They now account for 30% of group revenues, twice the level of 2019.
Alessandri said Technogym would invest to support growth at its home fitness division, using budget savings linked to the cancellations of trade fairs and business trips due to COVID-19.
He said the pandemic had impressed upon people the importance of keeping fit, and he pointed to a boom in medical fitness centres, which combine healthcare and gym facilities. 
""We see new markets opening up,"" he said. ""People are increasingly aware that good health is the true luxury.""

841,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 12:54PM ET</span>","Pelosi, Mnuchin Trade Blame as Stimulus Negotiations Stall","(Bloomberg) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Friday put the onus on each other to re-energize flagging stimulus talks as prospects for action on virus relief legislation before the election are fading fast.
Pelosi said the burden is on President Donald Trump to push forward on stimulus negotiations and get reluctant Republicans to go along with any eventual deal reached with the White House on a nearly $2 trillion aid package.
“We could do that before the election, if the president wants to,” Pelosi said Friday in an interview on MSNBC.
Mnuchin, Pelosi’s primary negotiating partner, said there’s been significant progress but blamed the California Democrat for holding up an agreement by not compromising on her party’s priorities.
“We’ve offered compromises,” Mnuchin told reporters at the White House. “The speaker, on a number of issues, is still dug in. If she wants to compromise, there will be a deal.”
Talks between Pelosi and Mnuchin have been at a standstill over the past day and a half. Pelosi has reported progress on a virus testing, tracing and vaccination strategy -- a key piece of the bill -- but the same sticking points on state and local aid that have bedeviled the talks remain, with just a week and a half to go before Election Day.
Trump again on Friday derided Pelosi’s insistence on including aid to state and local governments, and accused her of wanting to stall a stimulus package until after the Nov. 3 election.
“She wants to bail out poorly run Democrat states and that’s a problem, because you’re talking about tremendous amounts of money and we don’t want to reward areas of our country who have not done a good job,” Trump said at the White House.
With the pace of talks dragging, resistance from Senate Republicans is building, and Trump’s ability to twist arms into supporting a deal appears to be waning. Now some House Democrats are telling Pelosi that they don’t want to vote on legislation before the election if the Senate won’t do so, according to a party official.
Talks Slowed
Pelosi said in an interview at the Capitol Friday that she and Mnuchin are waiting for congressional committees to report back on lower-level talks before having another call. Aides to the relevant committees say that there is little they can do until they get clearer guidance from Pelosi and Mnuchin however.
“The ball’s not moving much right now,” White House economic director Larry Kudlow said on Bloomberg Television. “The clock is ticking.”
He also questioned whether there needed to be a comprehensive stimulus bill now. “There’s no reason why we have to have this humongous bill, which covers so much ground,” Kudlow said.
Pelosi has said that the House still has time to vote on a stimulus bill before the election if the administration making further compromises. But the Senate may not have time to act.
Putting off votes on a stimulus package until after the election raises the risk that the Trump administration will be less inclined or able to push a package through the GOP Senate. That likely would be amplified if Trump loses to Democrat Joe Biden and Republicans lose their Senate majority -- leaving action on stimulus for the pandemic-stricken U.S. economy until late January at the earliest.
White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany insisted that Trump would be able to persuade Senate Republicans to back a compromise deal, even though GOP leaders in the chamber have said there isn’t support for a stimulus package of the size being talked about in the negotiations.
Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby of Alabama said Thursday that he’s among Republicans in the chamber who have been frustrated by the lack of details they’ve gotten from Mnuchin about the talks.
“A lot of the top line he is talking about is big -- but we haven’t seen anything,” Shelby said, expressing doubt that a stimulus could be finished before the election. “I think it’s about two minutes to midnight, and we’re not going to pass anything until we see the particulars.”
He said that while a pre-election vote is possible, it’s “probably not going to happen.”

PARIS (Reuters) - The world's largest planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) has taken the industry by surprise by asking suppliers to prepare for a sharp increase in production after the coronavirus crisis - yet at the same time it quietly delayed its timetable for recovery. 
Airbus said on Thursday it had asked suppliers to be ready to support an 18% increase in output of its best-selling A320 jet in the second half of 2021, partially reversing cuts when the virus provoked a global slump in travel.
That pushed the European company's shares up 6%, but also risks upsetting unions facing job cuts and governments being asked to dig into their coffers for crisis support.
It divided analysts over whether airlines, many facing reduced furlough schemes, are ready for more jets.
""It is very unlikely that there will be any demand for up to 47 Airbus single-aisle aircraft a month in second half 2021. Very few airlines want more capacity at the moment and this will continue for a while,"" said Bertrand Grabowski, an aviation banker turned independent adviser.
Airbus, which must garner political and union support for 15,000 job cuts, has for weeks been giving mixed signals. 
Barely a month ago its operations chief said the recovery was worse than expected, yet deliveries to airlines sped up in September.
The picture inside an operation running 12,000 suppliers points to a more nuanced calculation, with a previously undisclosed interim step illustrating Airbus' cautious thinking.
Even while preparing the groundwork for production increases, the planemaker's most recent move was in fact to apply the brakes, two people familiar with the talks said.
When the pandemic paralysed travel in April, Airbus cut output of its A320 - which has a list price of $111 million though generally sells for much less - by a third to 40 a month.
It then resisted pressure to cut production even further and asked suppliers to start planning for a partial rebound to 45 a month from March 2021, the sources said.
VOLUME UP, BUT TIMING BACK
Now, as the second coronavirus wave hits Europe, it has pushed that potential increase back by three months. The new plan unveiled on Thursday is to ask the supply chain to support 47 jets a month, but delayed to second half of next year.
Airbus is effectively telling suppliers to hurry - but a bit later than previously planned.
Debate continues over whether 47 is the right number and Airbus has not yet decided whether to go ahead.
Demand for air travel has plummeted by two thirds since the pandemic began, forcing many cash-strapped airlines to postpone accepting new airplanes, though popular workhorses like the A320 have fared better than larger jets used on long-haul routes.
Airbus' arch-rival Boeing (N:BA) remains hobbled by the 18-month-old grounding of its 737 MAX following two crashes. It is not only the number of jets but the direction of change in plans that feeds into suppliers' confidence.
Insiders said Airbus aims to give suppliers a clear path forwards. Many are unhappy about being asked to take a risk on higher parts production without proof of demand, but Airbus is squeezing them to do more by using flexible contract clauses.
The move to put the supply chain under starters' orders is also seen as a coded warning to airlines that have delayed taking deliveries during the crisis: Airbus will soon be back in business and ready to supply many jets you have ordered. 
That means it is time for airlines to pay deposits - bringing in cash - and secure their place in the queue. Any that do not may lose their place and face price hikes for inflation.
Critics say such tactics are part of a months-old game of bluff and risk further souring relations strained by the crisis.

""If you don't have money you don't have money. If you don't have traffic you don't have traffic,"" said one industry executive of Airbus' pressure for airlines to commit.

The U.S. health regulator's approval on Thursday for its use in hospitalized patients came despite the World Health Organization last week saying the drug did not have a substantial effect on patients' length of hospital stay or chances of survival in a global trial.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) backing signals its confidence in Gilead's U.S.-based study results, which showed the drug was able to cut time to recovery in patients, Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) analyst Tyler Van Buren said in a client note. 
Remdesivir has been available under an FDA emergency use authorization since May, after a study led by the National Institutes of Health showed it reduced hospital stays by five days.
The drug, given intravenously, could generate over $1 billion in sales during the second half of the year at the current case rate, analyst Van Buren said.
Remdesivir, which will be sold under the brand name Veklury, costs $3,120 for a five-day treatment course, or $2,340 for government purchasers such as the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Shares of Gilead were up 5.67% at $64.11 before the bell.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (N:AIG) agreed to give up claims to more than $400 million of foreign tax credits and to accept a 10% tax penalty to settle accusations it used abusive tax shelters, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Friday.
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan said the settlement related to seven cross-border transactions between the insurer's AIG Financial Products unit and foreign banks dating from the mid-1990s.
She said there was ""overwhelming evidence"" that the seven transactions had no economic substance, and were designed to generate bogus foreign tax credits to reduce AIG's U.S. tax liabilities for the 1997 tax year.
AIG had filed a lawsuit in 2009 challenging an Internal Revenue Service decision from the prior year to disallow the tax credits and impose a 20% tax penalty.
But the government said the seven transactions enabled the New York-based insurer to ""game"" the tax system by exploiting differences between foreign and U.S. tax laws, and ""sucked hundreds of millions of dollars"" from the U.S. Treasury.
""AIG created an elaborate series of sham transactions that were designed to do nothing--and in fact did nothing--other than generate hundreds of millions of dollars in ill-gotten tax benefits,"" Strauss said in a statement.
The settlement was approved on Thursday by U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton in Manhattan.
AIG was allowed to keep some income expense deductions, and remove some amounts related to the transactions from its taxable income. It had reached a nonbinding settlement in principle in January 2018.
""We are pleased to put this longstanding matter behind us,"" AIG said in a statement.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>",U.S. says no justification for 'concentration camps' in China,"By David Brunnstrom and Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The deputy White House national security adviser on Friday denounced China's treatment of Uighur Muslims, saying there was no justification for the country maintaining ""concentration camps"" within its borders.
Matt Pottinger, who has been a leading figure in the development of President Donald Trump's China policy, made the remark in Mandarin in an online address to the U.K.-based Policy Exchange think tank.
""There is no credible justification I can find in Chinese philosophy, religion, or moral law for the concentration camps inside your borders,"" Pottinger said in his speech, which he said was directed to the Chinese people.
It represented a further ratcheting up of American rhetoric against China in the run-up to the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, in which Trump, a Republican, has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy theme.
Last week, Pottinger's boss, U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien, said China was perpetrating ""something close to"" genocide with its treatment of Muslims in its Xinjiang region.
Pottinger called on people in China ""to research the truth about your government’s policy towards the Uighur people and other religious minorities.""
He said they should ask themselves why The Economist newspaper had called China's actions in Xinjiang ""a crime against humanity.""
The United States has denounced China's treatment of Uighur and other minority Muslims in Xinjiang and imposed sanctions on officials it blames for abuses. 
It has not, though, so far termed Beijing's actions genocide or crimes against humanity, designations that would have significant legal implications and require stronger action against China.
The United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslims have been detained in Xinjiang, and activists say crimes against humanity and genocide are taking place there. China has denied any abuses and says its camps in the region provide vocational training and help fight extremism.
Pottinger said there was a growing consensus internationally about the need to take a more assertive stance with Beijing.
He said that in a second term, Trump would continue working to diversify supply chains to avoid excessive reliance on one country - an apparent reference to China's dominance of critical supplies laid bare at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Pottinger spoke after China's President Xi Jinping delivered a speech on the 70th anniversary of Chinese troops entering the Korean War to fight against U.S. troops, in which he warned that China will never allow its sovereignty, security and development interests to be undermined.

Xi did not directly refer to the present-day United States, with which relations have sunk to their lowest in decades over disputes ranging from trade and technology to human rights and the coronavirus.

848,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 09:48AM ET</span>",Wall Street Drifts Higher at Open as Election Looms Large; Dow up 60 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened modestly higher on Friday, after the final presidential debate of the election season did little to change the big picture or force many people into rethinking how they want to trade the elections on November 3.
President Donald Trump's more reserved and polite approach in Thursday's debate failed to make a meaningful impact on undecided voters, according to snap polls after the debate, although it did allow him to score his points more effectively when attacking the record and policies of his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden. As such, prediction markets and polls still point to a Biden victory a week on Tuesday, with the odds still on the Democrats taking back the Senate in a 'Blue Wave'. That scenario has underpinned some bullish bets this week, with many prepared to bet on a major stimulus package in the new year, skewed towards poorer consumers and towards a transition to cleaner energy.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 62 points, or 0.2%, at 28,426 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.2%, while the NASDAQ Composite was underperforming with a 0.2% decline. That was due chiefly to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock, which fell over 10% to its lowest in more than two months after releasing disappointing results on Thursday evening.
Heading in the opposite direction was Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) stock, which rose 10.7% to its highest in eight months after its results showed a surge in demand for Barbie dolls and related accessories due to parents' need to keep housebound children entertained.
Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) stock also rose 3.4% after the Food and Drug Administration authorized its antiviral drug remdesivir for the treatment of Covid-19, the first drug to get the FDA's full seal of approval.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stock rose 0.8%, showing no lasting ill effects of the $5 billion settlement it will have to pay for its involvement in the Malaysian 1MDB embezzlement scandal. Analysts noted that the New York-based parent had been able to avoid pleading guilty to a felony, thus protecting relationships with many clients whose statutes forbid them from doing business with convicted entitities.
The broader market remains restrained by the continued lack of agreement on a stimulus package - White House advisor Lawrence Kudlow said earlier Friday he doubted a deal could be struck in time for it to be passed before the election - and by the continued spread of the Covid-19 virus, whose progress through the U.S. is making fresh Europe-style restrictions on activity increasingly likely. A rising proportion of positive tests and increased hospital admissions both contradict claims by the administration that the sharp recent rise in new infections is due to increased testing.
""The trend in the test positivity rate hit bottom earlier this month, at about 4¼%, but it has since risen steadily to about 5½%, and it shows no sign of peaking,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics in a note to clients. "
849,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Macron lays ground for netting Brexit compromise on fisheries,"By Michel Rose and Gabriela Baczynska
PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France is preparing its fishing industry for a smaller catch after Brexit, industry members said, in a sign that President Emmanuel Macron is laying the ground for a delicate compromise to help the European Union strike a trade deal with Britain.
The EU and Britain are trying to hammer out an agreement over the next three weeks to avoid damaging $900 billion in annual trade when Britain leaves the bloc's single market on Jan. 1, 2021. Fisheries is among the biggest obstacles.
Macron has publicly taken a hard line on fisheries, saying France would not accept any Brexit pact that ""sacrifices our fishermen"". He rejected London's demand for annual negotiations on fish quotas in British waters, saying it damages EU industry.
In a first sign of a tentative softening of Paris' stance, however, Macron said after last week's summit of EU national leaders dedicated to Brexit that the French industry will no longer be in the same situation as today after year-end. 
Privately, his government has gone further, bluntly telling France's politically influential fishing industry to brace for impact, sources told Reuters, in comments that instantly pushed sterling and British bond yields higher. 
France has a total of 20,000 fishermen, on top of 10,000 fish processing jobs. On average in 2011-2015, some 98,000 tonnes of fish were caught in British waters, representing 171 million euros in turnover and 2,566 direct jobs. 
A fourth of France's catch in the northeastern Atlantic was in British waters, according to a French parliamentary report.
As the EU summit was convening in Brussels last week, Macron's Europe minister posted pictures from a visit to the French coastal town of Port-en-Bessin.
""One single objective: to defend and protect the interests of fishermen,"" Clement Beaune said on Twitter. ""We're fighting... for French fishing.""
But - in previously unreported exchanges - Jerome Vicquelin, a member of local fishing lobby groups who attended the meeting, said the minister's message was starker when asked off-camera if France would yield.
""I was rather blunt and said: 'It's all well and good you came, but I'm worried because... just a 10-15% cut in turnover... would be a disaster over the long term,"" Vicquelin said he told the Paris envoys in the wheelhouse of fishing boat aptly called L'Europe. 
""They were blunt too. They said it won't be the same as before. For me it's clear, they just want to try to limit damages as much as possible,"" Vicquelin told Reuters.
Asked to comment on Vicquelin's account of the meeting, Beaune told Reuters he had told the industry representatives to no longer expect to maintain ""the status quo"".
MACRON HOLDS THE KEY
The exchange illustrates France's twin strategy in the Brexit negotiation - talking tough in public while quietly preparing to fish less in British waters from 2021.
In another example of Paris eyeing a possible compromise, a fisheries source told Reuters separately the French government has already asked the industry what concessions would be acceptable to them. 
""They asked us if potentially, really potentially we were ready to make concessions,"" said the source, who declined to be named. ""They asked us to think about it.""
Many French and other EU vessels now fish in the rich British waters that would be beyond reach if there is no deal. Any agreement would need to fix catch quotas for over a 100 species. 
In an early indication of movement on fisheries from London, Britain last month offered a transition period from 2021 to increase its catch gradually rather than overnight. 
But the sides remain seas apart on what exactly Britain's share would be in the end.
Britain says it would become an ""independent coastal state"" controlling its waters and who fishes there once its transition out of the EU is complete.
EU fishing states including Germany and Ireland support France. But it is Macron, facing presidential elections in 2022, who leads the hardline rhetoric and will be instrumental in striking a fisheries pact. 
He has to weigh up the risk of angering a small but thriving and vocal industry, with that of blocking the new Brexit pact, which would lead to tariffs and quotas damaging bilateral trade. 
""Macron holds the key,"" said an EU diplomat following Brexit. ""If France climbs down, we can get a deal.""
Bidding for continued access to the UK fishing waters, the EU is also at odds with London over conditions to keep the bloc's common market of 450 million consumers open to British companies. The two can only be solved together, if at all.
Another diplomat said EU Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, this week ""wasn't worried about anything else but fish"".
""He said Macron has to put on the political show as 20% of their fishermen or vessels are 'jobless' if they don't get their quotas,"" the person said of a closed-door meeting with Barnier.

""Macron has to fight not to have the fishermen on the streets. That's why the French are publicly still in full throttle.""

850,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 09:09AM ET</span>","In Must-Win Florida, an Economic Rebound Gives Trump a Shot","(Bloomberg) -- Florida’s economic picture has been as murky as President Donald Trump’s odds of winning the state next month, but the outlook for both is brightening.
Florida, with 29 electoral votes, has backed the presidential victor every year since 1996 and is accordingly often viewed as a “must-win” state. Coronavirus cases and deaths have been declining lately after a summer surge, leading businesses to reopen and begin rehiring.  The economy’s improving trajectory looked to benefit Trump, even if former Vice President Joe Biden’s support increased in late September. Then came a rash of layoff announcements at Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. and Universal Orlando Resort in Central Florida and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) in Miami, clouding the picture once again.
“At least some more voters are now thinking about who will be better prepared to lead an economic recovery,” said Aubrey Jewett, a political scientist at the University of Central Florida. “To the degree voters think like that, it benefits Trump.”
The economy ranks first among issues in several Florida likely voter polls, with respondents favoring Trump over Biden in polls by Reuters/Ipsos and Quinnipiac University.
Trump's campaign has to hope that Florida's voters see the recent economic momentum and look past his handling of the virus that critics say caused the recession, said Kevin Wagner, political science professor at Florida Atlantic University.
“Republicans are much more willing to give the president the benefit of the doubt,” Wagner said. “But Democrats are less willing to do so, and a problem for the president is it appears many independents are less willing to do so.”
Long Lines
There are signs that point to a fledgling economic rebound in Florida.
Lines at the Magic Kingdom, the 49-year-old bedrock of Orlando’s economy, had grown surprisingly long by early this month. The plunging Seven Dwarfs Mine Train coaster required a 70-minute wait at one point on Oct. 2, although some pre-pandemic lines stretched past 150 minutes.
Florida’s struggle with coronavirus has eased since mid-summer, with new seven-day average cases dropping to around 3,200 a day from a peak of almost 12,000 daily in July, although they've rebounded some recently. Trump’s standing in the polls has risen since trailing by 8 points in midsummer. Biden still is 2.1 points ahead in RealClearPolitics’ average of state polls after pulling away slightly in recent days.
 
Meantime, Florida’s labor market is less bleak than it had been this summer. The jobless rate is down to 7.6% in September from 11.4%  two months before, according to recent federal data. The Orlando area is a notable exception with its 9.8% unemployment.
Diners also are eating out more frequently in the Sunshine State than elsewhere, helping to propel the recovery. Governor Ron DeSantis is trying to further juice up economy while infuriating critics, by allowing restaurants last month to open without capacity restrictions.
Restaurants there are now seating about 60% of the customers they were a year ago, beating the national level, according to a seven-day average of bookings on reservation service OpenTable. More than 75% of diners have returned in the Tampa area, OpenTable data show.
Senior Vote Key
Both campaigns are heavily targeting two large voting blocs there, Hispanics and seniors. Floridians age 65 and older supported Trump over Hillary Clinton four years ago by a 17-point margin and helped him win the state. Yet, Biden had a 15-point lead among seniors in Florida in this month’s Quinnipiac poll.
In Pinellas County, where Democrats have a 1-point lead over Republicans in voter registration rolls, April Thanos bristles at Trump’s boasting about the pre-pandemic economy despite its decade-long record expansion.
“It wasn’t his economic upturn, it was left over from Obama,” said the 71-year-old Democrat, a city council member in tiny Gulfport. “He did nothing to help it. The trade stuff with China hurt the farmers. And he’s an idiot if he thinks when you put a tariff on something, it costs the originating country money. It costs the end user.”
Trump has made more headway with Florida’s Hispanics, running ads touting wage and job gains under his watch, including the campaign spot “Subio Los Salarios” or “Raised the Salaries.” A September poll of likely Miami-Dade County voters showed that, while Biden had a comfortable lead in the majority Hispanic county, it fell short of Clinton’s lead in four years ago. A Democratic pollster, Fernand Amandi, urged the Biden campaign to heed the results, because Democrats traditionally run up the score in liberal South Florida to offset weakness in conservative north Florida.
In Osceola County, a suburban Orlando community reeling with 13.3% unemployment, Emilio Ruiz owns a coffee kiosk in a mall popular with Puerto Rican seniors who come in to play dominoes. He sees Trump as the best bet to bring the economy back, even if his own sales are down 45% since the pandemic started.
“I don’t blame him at all, because I don’t think any world leader got to manage this situation the way everyone wanted to,” said Ruiz, 30, vice chairman of a local Hispanic Republican group. “Now more than ever, we need someone who can manage the economy. He did pretty well for the first three years.”
 (Michael Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, pledged last month to spend $100 million in Florida to help Biden’s election efforts.)

851,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 09:05AM ET</span>","Earnings lift shares, gains pared by U.S. election caution","By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rallied on Friday, buoyed by positive earnings, but gains were limited by investor caution less than two weeks before the U.S. presidential election and with conflicting signs of progress in stimulus talks in Washington.
The final debate between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden on Thursday offered few surprises and little new direction. 
European stocks were up 1%, heading for their best day in five trading sessions, but still set for their worst week in a month. Strong third-quarter results offset key business survey data showing patchy recoveries in Germany and France.
Britain's main stock index rose 1.5% in its best day since early September after  Barclays  (LON:BARC) reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings and last month's British retail sales beat expectations.
The chief negotiators for Britain and the European Union meet on Friday for talks on a last-gasp trade deal to avert a tumultuous finale to the five-year Brexit crisis.
U.S. S&P 500 futures were up 0.3%, after dipping following the debate where Biden again criticized Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and Trump levelled unfounded corruption accusations at Biden and his family.
The underlying index had gained about 0.5% the day before on hopes the U.S. Congress and the White House would soon strike a deal on another round of COVID-19 stimulus.
""There is no reason for markets to take big long positions as we have the election in less than 10 days,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners. ""Combined with COVID-19 uncertainty it's a time where people will take a step back and wait for election developments before taking a bet on the markets."" 
In Asia-Pacific, MSCI's broadest index of the region's shares outside Japan was flat, while Japan's Nikkei ticked up 0.2% and the CSI300 index of mainland China shed 1.3%.
The MSCI world equity index, which follows shares in nearly 50 countries, was up 0.2%, but set for its biggest weekly fall in a month.
Biden's widening lead in polls is prompting many investors to bet on his presidency and a ""blue sweep"", where Democrats win both chambers of Congress.
While Democrats' plans to raise corporate and capital gains taxes could hit share prices, their promise of large stimulus is seen as mitigating the impact.
Clean energy is seen as a potential winner at the expense of conventional energy under Biden, who has pledged to target net-zero emissions by 2050. The Dow Jones oil and gas index is down nearly 49% this year.
The Nasdaq index, which had led the market's rally this year, has underperformed lately, losing 1.4% so far this week, on concern Democrats will take a harder stance on big tech firms. 
Expectations of bigger government stimulus have also boosted U.S. borrowing costs. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield hit a four-and-a-half-month high of 0.870% on Thursday and last stood at 0.865%.
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi reported progress in talks with the Trump administration for another round of financial aid, but Senate Republicans remained skeptical of a possible deal.
In the euro zone, Italian 10-year bond yields dropped 4 basis points to 0.767% as investors seemed confident an S&P Italy ratings review late on Friday will not lead to a downgrade. 
In currency markets, the dollar was 0.2% lower against a basket of currencies early in Europe, shy of a seven-week low hit on Wednesday. 
The euro ticked up 0.3% against the dollar, as was sterling at $1.3084.
The Chinese yuan also held its ground against the dollar after an official at China's foreign exchange regulator said it has been more stable than expected, suggesting authorities are not too worried about its recent rise.
Oil prices gained. [O/R] Brent futures added 0.5% to $42.68 per barrel. U.S. crude futures gained 0.5% to $40.84 per barrel.
Spot gold rose 0.4% to $1,911.14 per ounce. [GOL/]

852,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 08:55AM ET</span>",U.S. solar stocks rise on Biden's clean energy focus in pre-election debate,"(Reuters) - U.S. solar stocks rose on Friday after U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said in the final pre-election debate on Thursday night that if elected he plans to transition to a more climate-friendly economy.
Shares of  Renesola Ltd  (N:SOL), Jinkosolar Holding Co Ltd (N:JKS),  Canadian Solar  Inc (O:CSIQ) and SunPower Corp (O:SPWR) were up between 2% and 3% in premarket trading.
Biden and President Donald Trump were asked at their matchup in Nashville, Tennessee, what they would do to combat climate change - the first time in a presidential debate they were not asked if they believed in it or not.
Biden said the country should eventually replace oil with solar, wind and other forms of non-polluting power.
""I would transition from the oil industry,"" Biden said, adding his plan for a more climate-friendly economy would create high-paying jobs and boost U.S. businesses.
Shares of oil companies were broadly unchanged as U.S. crude (CLc1) ticked up 0.4% to $40.79 with demand concerns raised by surging coronavirus cases in the United States and Europe being offset by the prospect of an extension to OPEC-led supply curbs. 
After the debate, Biden told reporters, ""We're not getting rid of fossil fuels."" 
""We're getting of the subsidies for fossil fuels. But we're not getting rid of fossil fuels for a long time...they're not going to lose their jobs. Besides, a lot more jobs are going to be created in other alternatives.""
Trump, during the debate, cited a federal program to plant trees and a drop in carbon emissions to say he loves the environment, but added he was not willing to harm businesses.

He accused Biden of planning to ban hydraulic fracturing, a process of extracting oil and natural gas from shale that is opposed by many environmentalists. Biden, however, said he would ban fracking on federal land only.

Quarterly results from consumer products giants Procter & Gamble Co and Reckitt Benkiser this week showed demand for cleaning products, detergents and soaps remained robust, helping the companies beat sales expectations and lift their annual forecasts.
While consumers have been scrambling to get their hands on anything that could potentially slow the spread of the new coronavirus, they have also been spending on items that make living in the pandemic more manageable and comfortable.
iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) Corp, the maker of Roomba autonomous vacuum cleaners, reported a 43% surge in quarterly revenue this week. 
""Customers are prioritizing essentials that address safety and hygiene, as well as purchases that enhance life at home,"" Daniel Binder, partner at Columbus Consulting, said. 
Shoppers are also buying more toys to keep their children entertained.  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT)'s Barbie dolls raked in over half-a-billion dollars in sales in the third quarter - the brand's highest quarterly sales since 2003.
Americans eager to travel, but wary of hotels, restaurants and airplanes, are also spending on motorhomes. Recreational vehicle maker Winnebago Industries (NYSE:WGO) saw its revenue jump nearly 40% in the June-August quarter.
Mattel and P&G still expect demand growth in the holiday season, but concerns remain over the state of the U.S. economy and if Congress can pass another round of fiscal stimulus. 
""Shoppers have been funding big-ticket purchases such as robot vacuums, home appliances and recreational homes with their vacation and entertainment budgets,"" said Amar Singh, principal analyst at Kantar Consulting. 

""However, these purchases will likely decline over the winter after government stimulus funds dries up and with the jobless rate still very high.""

854,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 08:30AM ET</span>",Ant's record strategic allocation in Shanghai IPO fuels small investor scramble,"By Samuel Shen and Julie Zhu
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese fintech giant Ant Group's move to earmark a record 80% of the Shanghai leg of its $35 billion dual-listing for strategic investors has led to a scramble among smaller investors for what some see as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Ant [IPO-ANTG.HK], backed by e-commerce firm  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA), has launched a dual-listing process in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's STAR Market, and the offering is set to be the world's largest.
Some smaller Chinese investors, spooked by concerns they could get edged out of the initial public offering (IPO) at home, are looking to bid for Ant shares in the Hong Kong float, which sources have said will not include a cornerstone tranche.
The move underscores the likely robust demand for the float, even as the approaching U.S. election has triggered concerns about a spike in market volatility.
Shanghai-based Regan Fund Management Co, for one, is helping mainland investors subscribe to Ant's IPO in Hong Kong, the firm's Shanghai-based general manager Richard Li said.
The chance of securing IPO shares in the Asian financial hub is 50-70%, much higher than on the mainland, Li told Reuters.
Non-strategic or smaller investors in China participate in a lottery-like bidding process for IPOs, which means the fewer the number of new shares on offer the smaller the chance of winning the lucky draw.
""Everyone knows buying IPO shares makes good profits as most shares trade up on debut,"" said a banker working on Ant's STAR IPO, declining to be named as he was not allowed to speak about the process. ""The demand has been rather strong for Ant shares.""
WOOING MAINLAND INVESTORS
Hong Kong-based brokerages are also taking advantage of the Ant IPO frenzy to woo mainland investors.
Huatai Financial Holdings is offering new clients from the mainland one Alibaba Hong Kong share if they open a brokerage account and deposit more than $HK20,000, according to an advertisement posted on an overseas investment platform in China.
Ant's earmarking of 80% of the offering for strategic investors, including a unit of Alibaba, is sharply higher than an average proportion of 19% for such buyers in other STAR IPOs this year, according to Refinitiv data.
Before Ant, the record of strategic tranche on Chinese markets was set by Beijing-Shanghai High Speed Railway (SS:601816), which in January sold 49% of its $4.4 billion IPO to strategic investors, the data showed.
On the Nasdaq-style STAR, the bulk of past IPO allocations have been skewed towards state investors, mutual fund houses and select hedge funds, elbowing out smaller institutions and individuals, most of whom are not even qualified to trade.
In another unprecedented move, some of Ant's strategic investors are subject to lock-up periods of longer than the one year that is typical, the company's filing with the Shanghai exchange showed.
Such arrangements ""reflect concerns that such a massive listing could have a big impact on A-share market liquidity,"" said Hu Bo, fund manager of Future Star Fund Management Co, a Shenzhen-based hedge fund house, referring to mainland listed stocks.

""It could also show strategic investors are confident of Ant's long-term growth prospects.""

856,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 08:27AM ET</span>",Canada’s Stock Winners and Losers in U.S. Vote: Election Guide,"(Bloomberg) -- Canada’s main stock index is still about 10% lower than its February high. With its largest trading partner heading to the polls in 11 days, investors are bracing for more volatility -- no matter who the winner is.
With just 11 days until the election, Joe Biden is leading Donald Trump by just under 8 points in the RealClearPolitics average of national poll. Democrats are also trying to win back the Senate. For Canadian traders, there’s a lot at stake on the outcome, from the oil sector to marijuana and beyond.
A new stimulus package, corporate tax rates, climate change rules, trade policy and infrastructure spending are some of the big themes in play.
The S&P/TSX Composite Index has produced an average gain of 10% and has been positive nine out of 11 times in the year after the inauguration of the U.S. President, said Brooke Thackray, an analyst at Horizons ETFs Management (Canada) Inc., citing data going back to 1976. The two exceptions: 1982, when the North American economy was in a deep recession, and 2002, when it was reeling from 9/11 and the tech bust.
Here are stocks and sectors to watch as we near election day. Year-to-date stock performance follows each name.
Weed
A Democratic win this November is “more favorable” to the cannabis industry, said Canaccord Genuity analysts led by Matt Bottomley.
A task force Biden formed with Senator Bernie Sanders calls for legalized medical cannabis and supports states’ rights to govern the implementation of adult-use programs. The presence of a pro-cannabis running mate in Kamala Harris (sponsor of the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act) also point a potential win for the sector.
The election presents “the most meaningful catalyst package the cannabis industry has seen since Canadian legalization in late 2018,” analysts at Toronto brokerage firm Eight Capital said, with any outcome seen as a win-win for the sector.
The firm sees the reinforcement of Trump as president as “arguably net positive for multi-state operators as it maintains current oligopolistic competitive dynamics in the near and medium-term.”
Key stocks:  Acreage  Holdings (OTC:ACRGF) Inc. (+12% YTD), AYR Strategies Inc. (+60%), Curaleaf Holdings (OTC:CURLF) Inc. (+56%), Green Thumb Industries (OTC:GTBIF) Inc. (+71%), Harvest Health & Recreation Inc. (-51%), TILT Holdings Inc. (+14%) and Trulieve Cannabis (OTC:TCNNF) Corp. (+103%).
Energy
Almost one-tenth of Canada’s economy comes from the energy sector. Trump’s re-election could be a boon for global heavy oil due to the potential for tighter sanctions on Venezuela, a push for OPEC+ to increase production cuts and a buildout of infrastructure, Eight Capital said.
Biden’s climate change mandate would be negative for pipelines but a possible gain for pure play refiners. If the Democrats run the Supreme Court, his administration could look at shutting down key oil infrastructure, causing oil differentials to blow out.
In a Biden administration, independent producers of renewable power stand to benefit. His climate agenda, which includes plans to spend $2 trillion over the next four years, provides “tangible, near-term opportunities for Canadian equity investors,” CIBC analyst Shaz Merwat said.
Policy decisions on electric vehicles have the potential to impact fuel distributors with operations in the U.S., Canaccord Genuity said. A Biden win could be a “slight negative” for those firms given his proposed measurees to increase electric vehicle use, Eight Capital said, adding that a Trump win is seen as neutral.
Key stocks:  Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc  (TSX:ATDb) (+4%), Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources Ltd. (-46%), Cenovus Energy (NYSE:CVE) Inc. (-63%), MEG Energy (OTC:MEGEF) Corp.(-67%), Husky Energy (OTC:HUSKF) Inc. (-70%), Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU) Inc. (-62%), Boralex Inc.(+65%), Innergex Renewable Energy Inc. (+51%), Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) LP (+43%), Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (+12%), WSP Global Inc. (-0.3%), Stantec (NYSE:STN) Inc. (+8.1%).
Taxes & Tech
Biden’s proposal to raise corporate taxes could be a material headwind for Canadian tech companies with big U.S. exposure, Eight Capital said. Investors should consider buying the dip on any near-term volatility based on corporate tax concerns.
The firm recommends building positions in some small-cap stocks that are still considered undervalued and long-term winners of the digital boom.
Key stocks:  Docebo Inc  (TSX:DCBO) (+218%),  Kinaxis Inc  (TSX:KXS) (+110%), Converge Technology Solutions Corp (TSXV:CTS)  (+86%),  Vitalhub  Corp (TSXV:VHI) (+83%) and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc. (+156%).
Gold & Miners
A Democratic win in the U.S. would be negative for gold’s outlook as climate change policy initiatives may hurt extractive industries, Eight Capital said. A Republican win could be a positive with a shift toward greater emphasis on international political, fiscal and monetary challenges.
Battery metals companies should stand to gain from either election outcome. Trump supports greater domestic production of critical minerals to compete with foreign supply and Biden’s climate push includes investment in battery storage.
Key stocks: Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp. (+241%), Jervois Mining Ltd. (+47%)"

859,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Retailers urge Welsh government not to dictate what people can buy in 'fire-break' lockdown,"LONDON (Reuters) - Retailers in Wales have written urgently to First Minister Mark Drakeford expressing alarm over new regulations that restrict the sale of ""non essential"" products in essential shops during the country's two-week COVID-19 lockdown.
Wales' ""fire-break"" begins on Friday at 1700 GMT and ends on Nov. 9. Everybody but essential workers will have to work from home. All non-essential retail, leisure, hospitality and tourist businesses will have to close.
Retailers that can stay open, such as supermarkets, were told on Thursday that the regulations require them to only sell what the Welsh government deems to be ""essential"" product lines, partly to protect smaller businesses that do have to close being put at an unfair advantage.
Supermarket chains Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons, which are all big sellers of clothing, immediately scrambled to adapt their stores to focus on food.
However, retailers are perplexed because no definition of an essential product has been forthcoming from government.
In a letter to Drakeford, the Labour leader of the devolved government which has responsibility for health and sometimes finds itself at odds with the Conservative government in London, the Welsh Retail Consortium and the Association of Convenience Stores called for a rethink of the plan. 
The trade bodies also requested an urgent meeting.
""Compelling retailers to stop selling certain items, without them being told clearly what is and what isn't permitted to be sold, is ill-conceived and short-sighted,"" said Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium.
James Lowman, Chief Executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, said the regulations were badly thought out.
""Retailers must not be forced to stop making products available to customers just because ministers don't think they're essential,"" he said.

861,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>","U.S. Futures Just Higher; Stimulus, Gilead Drug in Focus","By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening slightly higher Friday, as investors digest the final presidential debate while waiting for fresh news over a potential new coronavirus stimulus package.
At 7:05 AM ET (1125 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 8 points, or 0.2%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 92 points, or 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 10 points, or 0.1%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 are on course to break a three-week winning streak, and the Nasdaq Composite is set to post its first down week in five.
President Donald Trump and Democrat candidate Joe Biden took part late Thursday in the final televised debate of the presidential election campaign in Nashville, Tennessee, as the clock ticks down to the November election.
“The final debate was substantially less esoteric than the first and it will likely not prove to be a gamechanger for neither the presidential race nor for markets,” said Nordea analyst Andreas Steno Larsen, in a research note.
Of more immediate importance for investors are the prospects for a U.S. stimulus package passing Congress before the Nov. 3 election. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said late Thursday that a deal on stimulus “just about there,"" though added that key issues including state and local funding as well as liability protection were yet to be resolved. 
The earnings calendar is light Friday, after a heavy week, with  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) the main highlight. Elsewhere, the corporate focus is likely to be on Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), after the chipmaker reported its margins tumbled in the latest quarter, and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), after its Covid-19 drug was approved by the Federal Food & Drug Administration to treat patients requiring hospitalization.
Looking at economic data, the main release will be the October flash services and manufacturing PMI releases. The European equivalents showed a patchy picture, with a slowdown in services as many countries went back into partial shutdowns, while the dominant German manufacturing sector boomed. The latter was also reflected in Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler  (OTC:DMLRY) lifting its guidance for the year.
Oil prices edged higher Friday, continuing the previous session’s strong gains after Russia’s President Vladimir Putin didn't rule out delaying scheduled production hikes by the OPEC+ alliance.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, faces a decision on whether to further restrain crude output at a meeting scheduled to start in late November amid pressure on fuel demand caused by fresh coronavirus restrictions.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $40.71 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $42.56. Both contracts posted gains of over 1.5% on Thursday, but are still currently heading for their first weekly loss in three.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,912.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at $1.1844.

863,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>",Daimler lifts profit forecast as China snaps up luxury cars,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) raised its profit outlook for 2020 on Friday after a record 24% jump in Chinese demand for its Mercedes-Benz cars boosted margins in the third quarter, though it warned that a spike in COVID-19 infections made forecasting hard.
Earlier this week, Daimler's chief executive said there was anecdotal evidence that wealthy Chinese families unable to splash out on expensive European holidays during the pandemic were buying luxury goods at home instead.
Benefiting from higher prices and a fall in fixed costs, the adjusted return on sales by its Mercedes-Benz cars and vans division rose to 9.4% in the quarter ending Sept. 30 from 7% a year earlier, rebounding from minus 1.5% in the second quarter.
The German car and truck maker said it now expected full-year earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to match last year's levels, whereas it had previously forecast a drop in earnings. In 2019, EBIT came in at 10.3 billion euros. 
A spike in COVID-19 infection rates in recent days has not hit visits to its showrooms, orders or sales, the carmaker said, but it warned that its outlook was based on the assumption that conditions would continue to normalise.
Daimler shares climbed following the results and were trading 2% higher at 0900 GMT.
In the third quarter, Daimler's adjusted EBIT rose to 3.48 billion euros ($4.1 billion) from 3.14 billion a year earlier. 
Margins recovered despite a jump in sales of less profitable plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles (EVs) to 45,000 cars.
Sales of low-emission cars are expected to accelerate in the fourth quarter with deliveries in the triple-digit thousands, Daimler said, adding that the vehicles were all sold at a profit and would help it meet European emissions goals. 
""We appreciate the fact the Mercedes can deliver very high margins whilst selling an increasing number of electrified vehicles. This should calm down some of the fears concerning alleged material profitability erosion from EVs,"" Arndt Ellinghorst, analyst at Bernstein Research, said on Friday. 
To help offset lower profits from hybrid and electric cars, Daimler cut costs, with 2,000 staff agreeing to voluntary redundancy, the carmaker said. 
The company said it was also continuing to seek solutions for divisions that are losing money, such as its ride-hailing joint venture with BMW (DE:BMWG). Uber (N:UBER) has offered more than 1 billion euros to buy it, Germany's Manager Magazin said on Wednesday.
Deliveries of Mercedes Benz cars and vans were down 4% in the quarter as the pandemic continued to weigh on demand, prompting Daimler to reiterate that it expects overall sales and revenue in 2020 to be significantly lower than last year.

A spike in infection rates in Germany has made further predictions about the outlook ""increasingly difficult"", Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm told reporters on a call to discuss the quarterly results.

864,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 05:53AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Hotel Heartbreak Eases - a Little - in Q3,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The hotel industry began the long road back to some kind of normality in the third quarter, but figures from Europe’s two biggest operators show just how long it will be.
Revenue per available room, the key metric for hotel investors, was down 53% at InterContinental Hotels Group (LON:IHG), which owns the Holiday Inn and associated franchises in the three months, and was down 63% at  Accor  (PA:ACCP), owner of the Ibis and Sofitel chains among others.
The figures, while dismal, were in both cases a significant improvement from the second quarter, and Accor’s shares in particular profited, rising 4.2% by mid-morning in Europe on Friday after CEO Sebastien Bazin said that the worst was behind the company. IHG stock fell 1.3%.
However, this is a pallid optimism. Even Bazin’s group is predicting that bookings won’t return to pre-pandemic levels until 2023. In the meantime, Bazin told France 24, ""60% of the hotel industry is distressed, 40% is optimistic” as they face the prospect of full winter of Covid 19.
On Thursday, France had extended its curfew to an area covering three-quarters of its population after posting its highest daily figure yet for new infections. In Spain, Germany and the U.K., all key markets, officials bemoan that the virus is currently out of control, despite various attempts to restrict non-essential social contact.  Bazin urged European governments to be more clear and coordinated in their guidelines on travel, after an abortive summer tourism season when official guidelines changed at dizzying speed and with little or no consistency.
IHG CEO Keith Barr acknowledged that “uncertainty remains regarding the potential for further improvement in the short term.”
Barr’s conservatism is an implicit acknowledgment that he expects the U.S. market, which accounts for more of IHG’s business, to broadly follow the European one as the latest wave of the pandemic gains force there. That could leave Asia as the sole ray of sunshine for both companies. At IHG, RevPAR has already recovered to be down only 23% year-on-year in Greater China.
Both CEOs strove to put a brave face on the medium term, however. And not without reason: conventional wisdom says that when the vaccines are finally distributed and fear of public spaces recedes, hotel stocks should be among the best performers around. Pent-up demand and fading tail risks should allow a violent reversion to the mean.
But is there anything to hope for beyond that? The pre-pandemic assumptions of endless growth in world tourism will have to be tested anew as life returns to normal, and business travel budgets will remain crimped long after the vaccines arrive. IHG has in general created value over the last two decades but Accor hasn’t posted a new all-time high since 2007, and even though Bazin is finally pushing the group towards an ‘asset light’ model that should generate higher returns on equity and demand a higher valuation, the onus is squarely on him to prove it. 
Talking to Bloomberg TV earlier, Bazin dismissed the notion of M&A activity, which would offer the quicker path to capacity rationalization and higher margins. That may disappoint some, but the truth is that Accor’s current valuation doesn’t allow to hope for an active role in any such consolidation. The question is only whether or not Accor is 'in play'.
IHG may have the better opportunities for driving the process, but Barr gave no hint of anything on the horizon in his statement. For investors, holding the stocks continues to require even more patience and tolerance of uncertainty than for most other assets."
865,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 04:30AM ET</span>",China's carmakers seek more government support for smart car supply chain,"By Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh
XIAN, China/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's auto industry has called for more government support and tie-ups between auto and tech companies on technologies, such as software and semiconductors, to make the country's smart car supply chain more self-sufficient. 
Government officials and industry executives at the 2020 China Auto Supply Chain Conference, held in the northwestern city of Xian this week, said the supply chain of in-car operating systems and other core technologies lagged behind international levels, a situation they want to change. 
China, the world's biggest auto market, wants sales of vehicles with intelligent functions like internet connectivity and autonomous driving to make up 30% of overall new vehicle sales by 2025. 
Beijing has been trying to boost domestic tech capability by pouring billions of dollars into sectors such as semiconductors, after trade tensions between China and other countries, including the United States, exposed the country's reliance on foreign know-how. 
""China's supply chain of in-car operating system, software and other key core technologies are still far behind the international advanced level,"" Ma Chunsheng, an official at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said.
Ma said the government will encourage companies from different industries to work together on key technology breakthroughs like car operation systems.
""Technology startups face financial difficulties and urgently need the government to issue strategic support measures,"" said Luo Junmin, senior executive at the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Jumin said the government should offer better fundraising platforms to those companies to ""support the transformation and upgrading of the automobile industry.""
In-car software and semiconductor products are expected to make up the majority of cars costs by 2030, a recent research report by consultancy Roland Berger and industry think tank China EV 100 estimated.
Chinese internet companies, including Alibaba (HK:9988) and Baidu (O:BIDU), have launched partnerships with automakers, while Huawei Technologies, BYD (SZ:002594) and startup Horizon Robotics are developing semiconductor products.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Friday, helped by fresh signs of economic recovery although fresh curfew measures in Europe will likely limit the gains.
At 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.9% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.1%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index gained 1.1%.
German private sector activity grew for the fourth month running in October, according to Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index. While the services sector showed weakness, the dominant manufacturing sector proved robust, with the flash PMI rising to 58.0, its highest level since April 2018. 
U.K. retail sales rose more than expected last month, jumping 1.5% from August, and gaining over 17% in the third quarter following a lockdown-induced slump in the previous period.
This news will be welcomed by policy makers as the region heads into the winter period amid rising cases of the Covid-19 virus and with the prospect of a difficult divorce from the European Union by Britain at the end of the year.
The number of reported coronavirus cases in Europe have more than doubled in 10 days, crossing 200,000 daily infections for the first time on Thursday, according to a Reuters tally. Specifically, France is set to widen a curfew to more than two thirds of its population after the country set an all-time daily high of new coronavirus cases on Thursday.  
In corporate news, Daimler .(OTC:DDAIF) stock rose 1.9% after the German carmaker raised its 2020 profit outlook, while French rival  Renault  's (PA:RENA) stock was up 2.1% after saying it should have positive cash flow from cars by the end of 2020 as sales recovered.
In the U.K.,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) stock rose 4.5% after the banking giant posted a 38% rise in revenue in dollar terms in the third quarter, helped by another strong performance from its investment bank and markets division.
Oil prices slipped slightly Friday, consolidating the previous session’s strong gains after Russian President Vladimir Putin chose not to rule out extending record supply cuts in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, faces a decision on whether to change its output policy at a meeting scheduled to start in late for November amid pressure on fuel demand caused by fresh coronavirus restrictions.

SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's government is expected to issue more import quotas and buy millions of tonnes of additional corn in the new crop marketing year, three industry sources said, amid a surge in animal feed demand and tightening supplies.
Under already approved quotas, Beijing has booked around 12 million tonnes of corn from the United States and around 5 million tonnes from elsewhere including Ukraine for the 2020/21 marketing year, according to a Singapore-based international trading source and two other people with knowledge of the deals.
China, which needs about 280 million tonnes a year of corn, previously held massive reserves but has almost emptied them at auctions, leading to grain buyers buying alternatives such as rice and wheat, as well as boosting corn imports. Domestic corn prices hit record highs this month on shortages: as China scoops up more grain, global prices are set to rise.
""China over the next decade may change the landscape of the world corn balance sheet by becoming a major import player,"" said Terry Reilly, senior analyst at Chicago brokerage Futures International.
GRAPHIC-China corn supply and demand link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/nmovaykgzva/ChinaCornStats.png)
Until now Beijing has imposed a 7.2 million tonne annual low-tariff quota system for corn imports. Imports outside the quota are possible, but can face tariffs of up to 65% of the purchase price. 
Two China-based sources and the Singapore-based trader said Beijing is considering issuing more lower-tariff quotas for buyers amid tighter inventories.
""(The government) will review the market supply-demand situation, and might issue more quotas later that could go into the state reserves,"" said one of the sources, familiar with the government plan.
The people with knowledge of the deals declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to media. 
Even before additional quotas are awarded, China is already on par with Japan as the world's second-largest corn importer behind Mexico (18.3 mln tonnes) in terms of 2020-21 corn imports, according to United States Department of Agriculture estimates.
China's state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission, which sets import quotas, did not immediately respond to faxes seeking comment on future additional imports. COFCO, China's top grain trader, and state stockpiler Sinograin did not respond to faxed requests for comment.
GRAPHIC-US vs China corn prices since 2005 link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/bdwvkjrmwpm/ChinaUSCornprice.png
China has so far this calendar year booked cargo shipments far exceeding the official annual quota level for corn after COFCO received and used special low-tariff quotas of at least 5 million tonnes to book mainly U.S. corn supplies for delivery through April 2021, according to one of the sources, who was briefed on the trades said.
Under the terms of that extra allowance, COFCO will import the corn at the lower tariff rate, but its profits will be capped at 30 yuan ($4.49) per tonne and any additional windfall will go to the state, the person said. 
""I think this is done out of considerations from two perspectives,"" the person said.
""One is we do need corn. Secondly, we have this deal with the United States that we need to fulfil,"" said the source, referring to commitments under the Phase 1 trade deal Beijing concluded with Washington to resolve a festering trade row.

Since 2002, the MSCI AC World Growth Index has about doubled the return of its value counterpart, yet its relative earnings expectations have failed to grow at a similar pace. That means a significant valuation gap has emerged between the two types of stocks, one that isn’t necessarily justified by higher relative earnings growth.
That leaves growth stocks vulnerable to a sharp valuation correction should investors become disappointed. Netflix fell about 7% on Wednesday after missing Wall Street’s estimates for subscribers, renewing doubts about its ability to maintain growth.
About 15% of the companies in the Bloomberg World Index have reported so far this season, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. More than 80% of firms in the traditional growth sector -- technology -- have beaten earnings estimates, it showed.
But traders have been unimpressed despite the positive reporting. The average one-day price move for tech companies that have reported was -0.4%, the data showed.
And for those that disappointed, the share price reaction has been more severe. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp. shares slumped 6.5% on Tuesday, the most in four months, after failing to provide an earnings outlook. Citrix Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CTXS). fell more than 7% Thursday, to the lowest since March, after cloud growth lagged investor expectations.
“Optimism is fraying at the edges with recent disappointing earnings results beginning to undermine the growth qualities of U.S. IT,” Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA strategist Albert Edwards said in a note. “Woe betide any stock that profit-warns, making the market realize it has been fooled, having wrongly valued it as a growth stock.”

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen trading mixed at the open Friday, with investors digesting fresh curfew measures in Europe, the final U.S. presidential debate before the November election as well as the ongoing stimulus negotiations.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% lower, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%. 
The final debate between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Democrat challenger Joe Biden took place late Thursday, an event that many saw as Trump’s last chance to substantially eat into Biden’s poll lead ahead of the Nov. 3 poll.
“It was a slightly more civilized debate this time around, but Trump failed to make up for lost ground from the first debate,” OCBC Wealth Management senior strategist Vasu Menon told Reuters.
Also helping investors’ confidence Friday was the news of the first approved Covid-19 treatment, after Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) received U.S. FDA approval on Thursday for its antiviral therapy to treat the virus. 
However, reported coronavirus cases in Europe have more than doubled in 10 days, crossing 200,000 daily infections for the first time on Thursday, according to a Reuters tally.
In corporate news, Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) could be in the spotlight after the German car maker said third-quarter net profit rose while revenue declined, noting strong demand for luxury cars in China helped turn around margins at its Mercedes-Benz cars division. The company had already announced preliminary results last week.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) also posted a drop of revenue in the third quarter of 2020, but the drop of 8.2% was better than expected, helped by a jump in sales of the Zoe, its popular electric car model.
In the U.K., Barclays posted a 38% rise in revenue in dollar terms in the third quarter, helped by another strong performance from its investment bank and markets division.
The European data slate includes key PMI data for the region, while U.K. retail sales impressed, climbing 1.5% on the month in September, above the 0.4% gain predicted.
Oil prices slipped slightly Friday, consolidating the previous session’s strong gains after Russian President Vladimir Putin chose not to rule out extending record supply cuts in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, faces a decision on whether to change its output policy at a meeting scheduled to start in late for November amid pressure on fuel demand caused by fresh coronavirus restrictions.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $40.41 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.5% to $42.25. Both contracts posted gains of over 1.5% on Wednesday, but are still currently heading for their first weekly loss in three.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,906.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1796."
874,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 01:54AM ET</span>",Renault Beats Revenue Estimates as Electric-Car Sales Surge,"(Bloomberg) --  Renault  SA (OTC:RNLSY) third-quarter revenue beat estimates, partly fueled by a surge in sales of its popular electric car model that the carmaker said will allow it to meet European emissions rules.
While revenue fell about 8% to 10.37 billion euros ($12.2 billion) in a period still marked by the pandemic, according to a statement Friday, it surpassed the 9.96 billion-euro average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The French manufacturer sold 6% fewer passenger cars and trucks overall during the period, while sales of the Zoe battery-powered model rose 150%.
The global health crisis has added to pressure on Renault (PA:RENA), which was already suffering from overcapacity in its factories and problems at alliance partner Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co. before the pandemic took hold. The beat in sales are in line with better-than-expected results from BMW AG,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Volvo Group, and a rise in overall European car registrations in September for the first time this year.
“This third quarter highlights the change in our commercial policy, which now focuses on profitability rather than volumes,” Chief Executive Officer Luca de Meo said in the statement, adding that it’s confident in liquidity reserves.
The company’s order were 60% higher at the end of September and inventories were down by about a fifth compared with last year.
While Renault doesn’t report earnings on a quarterly basis, it posted a record first-half loss due mostly to impairments and restructuring costs at Nissan. The partners in the alliance, which also includes Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp., have embarked on plans to cut costs and jobs in a bid to turn around their flagging operations.
Renault’s new chief executive officer, Luca de Meo, has promised to unveil a strategic plan in January and overhaul the company’s portfolio. He has provided some clues in recent months with an expansion in the line-up of electric vehicles and a new focus on the Alpine, Dacia and Renault brands, along with new mobilities.
The Franco-Japanese car-making alliance has been trying to overcome damage wrought by the November 2018 arrest of Carlos Ghosn, who was chairman of all three companies. The partnership was meant to create a global powerhouse to compete against Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp., but its aggressive strategy fixated on volume growth proved misguided when auto sales began to decline.
Renault has announced a plan to eliminate about 14,600 jobs worldwide and to lower production capacity by almost a fifth in a bid to cut costs by more than 2 billion euros.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd's (HK:0293) decision to force pilots permanently onto lower-paid contracts or risk losing their jobs is ""draconian"" and ""short-sighted"", the head of the union representing them said on Friday.
The carrier on Wednesday announced plans to cut 5,900 jobs to help it weather the pandemic, including nearly all of the positions at its regional airline Cathay Dragon, which it has shut down. [nL4N2HB51B]
It is also seeking changes in its contracts with pilots and cabin crew as part of a restructuring that would cost HK$2.2 billion ($283.87 million). 
Staff at many airlines around the world have agreed to temporary pay cuts to help their companies get through the COVID-19 crisis. 
At rival Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL), pilots have agreed to pay cuts, including up to 28.5% for most captains and up to 18.5% for most first officers through March 31, 2022 to avoid more job losses.
""The vast majority (of other airlines' pay cuts) are tied to a waypoint such as a point in time or profitability,"" Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association (HKAOA) General Secretary Chris Beebe said in an interview. At Cathay, he said, the cuts are ""completely open-ended and perpetual.""
HKAOA said under the new contracts, Cathay will no longer need to follow the principle of ""last in, first out"" used at most legacy carriers, with the most recent joiners losing their jobs first.
That would enable it to target pilots for cuts based on the type of aircraft flown, which would be more efficient financially and operationally as it continues to review its fleet plans.
The new contracts, similar to those for new hires since 2018, also offer pay based more on flying hours than previously, leading to far lower salaries in periods where the airline is largely idle. 
The degree of pay cut depends on which older contract the pilot was on, with one Cathay pilot telling Reuters on condition of anonymity that he expected a reduction of about 40%.
""By imposing these things, without a doubt, it will erode goodwill,"" Beebe said. ""The arrogance of the company and the way they have approached this will be remembered for years to come.""
Cathay chairman Patrick Healy told news media on Wednesday that the new terms were ""highly competitive"" with those of global peers. The airline did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.
BOCOM International analyst Luya You said that the new contracts might see greater uptake than expected given the soft market for aviation professionals, but that there was a risk employees could leave when conditions improve.
Pilots who do not sign the new contract will be terminated with three months' pay rather than made redundant with six months' pay, Beebe said, adding that the union was taking legal advice on the issue.

876,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 11:50PM ET</span>",Chinese low-cost carrier Spring soars amid COVID downturn,"By Stella Qiu and Jamie Freed
BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese budget carrier Spring Airlines is leveraging its low-cost position to attract customers with cheap fares as the country's domestic aviation market recovers, pursuing an aggressive expansion strategy that could soon turn profitable.
Domestic capacity at Shanghai-based Spring rose over 50% in September compared with a year earlier, while passenger traffic was up 47% and the airline's load factor, or percentage of seats filled, neared 90% as it redirected planes from closed international markets. Spring's market share has doubled from 2% a year ago to 4%, according to broker Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
The private airline's success in the Chinese market, traditionally dominated by full-service state-owned carriers, could herald a wider global trend.
Investors expect low-cost, domestic-focused carriers will be the first to recover from the pandemic as leisure travellers focus on value and corporate travel takes longer to recover. 
 Japan Airlines Co Ltd  (T:9201) has said it plans to bolster its low-cost operations, including its Japanese joint venture with Spring, while sources said ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202) is weighing whether to use budget carrier Peach for more flights. 
""We do see low-cost carriers (LCCs) rebounding the fastest out of all airlines across most regions, not just China,"" BOCOM International analyst Luya You said. ""The reasons are that LCCs can offer lower prices due to lower costs as well as fill their planes more efficiently than full-service carriers.""
Low-cost carriers held just a 10% market share in the domestic Chinese market, and 17% in Japan in 2018, compared with a majority share in South Korea, India, Malaysia and Vietnam, according to CAPA Centre for Aviation data.
During the COVID-related downturn, Chinese budget operators like Spring and Air China (OTC:AIRYY) Ltd (SS:601111) subsidiary Shenzhen Airlines have been expanding relative to rivals.
Spring's shares have rebounded to pre-COVID levels, compared with declines of up to 25% at the state-owned big three airlines, as investors bet on China's only listed budget carrier.
""Full-service carriers will mimic the low-cost carrier model over the next few years, which could pressure established low-cost carriers like Spring over time,"" BOCOM's You said. ""But right now their clear advantage is still solid.""
SPRING IN ITS STEP
Spring charges customers for extras like priority check-in, meals and using airport lounges, allowing it to offer fares as much as 30% below rivals on some routes while still taking aim at price-conscious business travellers.
""We can see Spring's offerings for a lot of their domestic routes are even lower than fares on high-speed railway trains,"" Chinese aviation expert Li Xiaojin said. ""Flying with them is faster and cheaper, which helped bring in a lot of customers."" 
Since May, Spring has added more than 60 domestic routes, and will add another 20 in the winter/spring flight season, saving on costs by having a single-type fleet of 103 Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A320 family narrowbodies.
The aggressive expansion has helped Spring outperform its peers, with fares on some domestic routes almost reaching last year's levels, Spring Airlines Chairman Wang Yu told Reuters.
Chinese brokerage CICC expects Spring to swing to a profit of 150 million yuan ($22.51 million) in the third quarter, barring an one-off capital injection into its Japanese joint venture. 
Spring, which mostly focuses on Asian markets, is also well-positioned to recover in a post-COVID global aviation world, given travel bubbles between nations are likely before a full reopening of international travel. 
""Compared with Europe and the United States, Asia-Pacific countries have largely managed to keep COVID under control, and are gradually easing travel restrictions. This is a good trend,"" Wang said. 
""Possibly, the Asia-Pacific region will recover first and we'll first restore capacity supply to these target markets and resume flights as soon as possible."" 
Spring received its first A321neo in September as part of plans to introduce seven planes in the second half of the year, Wang said, adding that the company had ruled out the purchase of widebodies.
In contrast, the state-owned carriers are pushing back deliveries.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Friday morning, with investors digesting the final presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.
“It was a slightly more civilized debate this time around, but Trump failed to make up for lost ground from the first debate. Biden came through better than Trump in this debate and this should help to cement his lead over Trump and may just help him to cross the final line with a win,” OCBC Wealth Management senior strategist Vasu Menon told Reuters.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.43% by 11:10 PM ET (3:10 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.50%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 inched down 0.10% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.60%.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.20%, while the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.04%.
Some investors warned of market volatility ahead as markets in the region opened.
“There will be a positive bias to the opening tone in Asian trade,” CommSec market analyst Tom Piotrowski told Reuters.
“But regional investors won’t necessarily hang their hats on that outcome, the markets can move around quite quickly,” he added.
Other developments in Washington on investors’ radar is progress on the latest stimulus measures. Continuous, staunch Republican opposition to the measures’ price tag makes the likelihood that Congress will pass them before the election slim. However, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi continued to be optimistic that a deal can be reached soon.
Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are “just about there” vis-a-vis a deal and are currently resolving how to allocate money for testing and tracing to safely reopen schools and the economy, a key part of the measures.
The continuing uncertainty has a big move in the bond market over expectations that a deal will materialize soon.
“The big move in the bond market has been going on for the past few days and it’s mostly because the market is expecting that one way or another there will be a stimulus package, if not before the election then after the election” Yardeni Research president and chief investment strategist Ed Yardeni told Bloomberg.
There are over 41.5 million COVID-19 cases globally as of Oct. 23, according to Johns Hopkins University data. In Europe, which is fighting a second wave, Germany recorded a record number of cases and Spanish health minister Salvador Illa warned that the spread of the virus is out of control in certain parts of his country.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp said on Friday it would pay an interim dividend of 22 yen per share, the same as the previous fiscal year, after a series of massive asset sales stabilised the group's finances. 
The dividend declaration is the latest sign the group, which was shaken by soured investments and the COVID-19 pandemic, is regaining its confidence, buoyed by deals including the $40 billion sale of chip designer Arm to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp. 
Its year-end dividend forecast is yet to be determined. SoftBank did not offer a dividend forecast in May when it reported a record annual operating loss. 
SoftBank also said it had completed the sale of U.S. cellphone distributor Brightstar as it cuts ties to the telecoms industry to focus on investing.
Asset sales have stoked speculation about how SoftBank might deploy its mounting cash pile, with CEO Masayoshi Son telling a Saudi Arabian conference on Thursday that he is a ""risk taker.""
SoftBank's shares were flat in line with the benchmark index. Its shares are trading near two decade highs.

(Reuters) - U.S. stock futures dipped and the Japanese yen ticked up on Friday after a final debate between U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden merely hardened investors' caution heading into the election.
U.S. S&P 500 E-minis  were down 0.1% at 3,445.75 points at 0230 GMT. The S&P 500 index (SPX) closed down 0.5% at 3,453.49 on Thursday.
The dollar (=USD) was a few pips higher, while the safe-haven yen  was up 0.1% at 104.71 per dollar.
""It was a slightly more civilised debate this time around, but Trump failed to make up for lost ground from the first debate,"" said Vasu Menon, a senior strategist at OCBC Wealth Management in Singapore.
""Biden came through better than Trump in this debate and this should help to cement his lead over Trump and may just help him to cross the final line with a win.""
The final debate in Nashville, Tennessee on Thursday follows over a week of choppy trade on Wall Street, with investors worried about whether Congress and Trump will approve another fiscal stimulus package before the election.
Gary Ng, Natixis economist for Asia in Hong Kong, pointed to the slight strengthening in the U.S. dollar index as a sign that sentiment has turned conservative because of the risk and uncertainty around the election outcome.
Following a recent decline, the S&P 500 remains up over 3% since the two candidates' first debate, on Sept. 29, with investors voicing growing comfort with a potential Biden victory as the Democratic candidate increased his lead in polls.
Many investors in recent months have held that a second term for Trump, who favors tax cuts and deregulation, would be good for the stock market.
The S&P 500 is up more than 60% since Trump's unexpected election victory on Nov. 8, 2016, beating the 42% gain in the first four years after Democratic President Barack Obama won in 2008.
Investors view Biden as likely to raise taxes, especially if Democrats wrest control of the Senate from Republicans. However, a Biden presidency, coupled with a Democratic Senate, would likely mean a larger fiscal stimulus plan than what a Republican Senate would agree to, many investors believe.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) this month estimated that under a Biden presidency, corporate earnings would receive a boost from fiscal stimulus and lower tariffs, more than offsetting a drag caused by an expected tax hike.
However, it is unclear how Wall Street would react to the election outcome. In the run-up to the 2016 election, investors widely predicted that a Trump victory would hurt stocks due to his unpredictability and trade-war threats against China and Mexico.
Following Trump's victory, the S&P 500 surged 5% in a month, in what was dubbed the ""Trump trade"", as investors bet the president would cut taxes and regulations and boost infrastructure spending.
With expectations that the increased use of mail-in ballots by voters concerned about the coronavirus could mean no immediate winner is announced, S&P 500 options show investors are bracing for volatility in November and December.
With 12 days to go, some 47.5 million Americans have turned in ballots, roughly eight times the number of early votes cast at about same point before the 2016 presidential contest, according to data compiled by the U.S. Elections Project.

Trump has declined to say if he will accept the results of the election if he loses, repeating his unfounded complaint that mail-in ballots would lead to election fraud.

Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) chair James Shipton stunned a routine parliamentary hearing by saying had just notified the government he was removing himself from the role for the duration of a review into the matter.
""I took this position to serve the Australian community and work to improve the corporate and financial system that also serve it,"" Shipton told the hearing.

Shipton started in the role in 2018, but Chester said the Australian National Audits Office (ANAO) raised its concerns this September as ASIC was signing off its 2020 annual accounts.

Remdesivir, given intravenously, was one of the drugs used to treat President Donald Trump, who tested positive for the respiratory disease earlier this month.
The FDA's formal approval came just hours before the president's final debate with Democratic rival Joe Biden ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.
Trump's seemingly dismissive approach to the coronavirus has clouded his re-election prospects, with polls showing Americans losing confidence in his ability to handle the pandemic.
Remdesivir has been available under an FDA emergency use authorization since May, after a study led by the National Institutes of Health showed it reduced hospital stays by five days.
However, the World Health Organization last week said its global trial of COVID-19 therapies found that the drug did not have a substantial effect on patients' length of hospital stay or chances of survival.
At $3,120 for a five-day treatment course, remdesivir has become the standard of care for patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 even though it has not been shown to improve survival.
Doctors have remained wary of using it in patients with less severe illness. "

MIYAGI, Japan (Reuters) - Iris Ohyama, whose goods are ubiquitous in Japanese homes, has relied on its usual offbeat methods during the COVID-19 pandemic and U.S.-China trade tensions to ride the teleworking wave and bring production back from China. 
Family-run, unlisted and based in the provincial city of Sendai, the quick-iterating manufacturer of everything from rice to rice cookers has become the most high-profile firm to sign up for government incentives to bring production back home. 
With newly labelled ""made in Japan"" face masks flying off shelves alongside its other diverse products, such as office furniture and air conditioners, Iris predicts annual revenues of 700 billion yen ($6.7 billion), compared with 500 billion yen a year earlier. 
Although pandemic-driven demand is propelling Japanese sales this year, the company sees overseas markets growing to provide most of its revenue, compared with about 30% now, its president Akihiro Ohyama said in an interview. 
That change is made possible by advances in factory automation and the growth of e-commerce, opening up markets such as the United States, where Iris is expanding production of ""made in USA"" items, including electronics and masks. 
The shift also provides a hedge against U.S.-China trade tensions. Corporate Japan is deeply dependant on Chinese supply chains, making it all the more important to ensure production is insulated from disruptions there. 
Iris, for instance, may increase production in Japan beyond plastic items and LED lighting. 
""Unfortunately many parts for items like washing machines and refrigerators can't be sourced domestically,"" Ohyama said during an interview in rural Miyagi prefecture, where factory space is being converted to face mask production. 
Three quarters of the cost of building the mask line is covered by government subsidies - part of a 60 billion yen ($570 million) programme covering about 60 companies.
Iris is also applying for further subsidies as the government expands payouts under new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.
The company said it remains committed to China both as a production site and a market, with a new factory under construction in Tianjin.
But analysts say lower barriers to entry in the electronics market mean Iris could be vulnerable to fresh competition.
""Iris Ohyama is still not such a big brand, and if cheaper, attractive products appear, it risks being squeezed,"" said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute. 
ELECTRIC DREAMS
Little-known outside its home country, Iris Ohyama got its break with plastic products before moving into mass market electronics in 2009.
To hire engineers from manufacturers like Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) and Sharp (OTC:SHCAY), who were shedding staff in the face of Chinese and South Korean competition, Iris shifted research and development to Osaka, in Japan's industrial heartland, where those workers lived. 
Product proposals at the company receive on-the-spot approval or rejection at Monday meetings. It's a seat-of-the-pants approach that industry insiders say the firm's unlisted status - and lack of investor pressure - makes possible.
Iris launches more than 1,000 new products a year, which make up more than half of total sales.
The firm's emphasis on simple design and reasonable prices has also proved a winning formula for companies such as furniture maker Nitori Holdings (T:9843) and Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing (T:9983). 
Although the total Japan market for lines such as storage items has peaked, the company will continue to grow by expanding its product range, Ohyama said, adding that online shopping would help sales.
Japanese manufacturing has a reputation for quality but also overengineering. New products often include more and more features and foreign competition has left players competing at the top end for items like televisions. 
""The number of high-end brands will decrease over time,"" Ohyama said, who took up the position of president in 2018 from his father, Kentaro, the company's leader for more than half a century.
Competitors say they lean toward more expensive materials and work in larger teams than Iris, which has attracted engineers by giving them the chance to directly design products. 
""Iris fixes a product price target and rigorously builds to stick to it, whereas we tend to overrun,"" said an executive at a rival electronics maker. 
The firm, which employs about 13,000 people, plans to recruit a record 640 more next year. 
Industry insiders point to the difficulties of attracting engineers amid competition from larger peers and Chinese companies offering higher pay. 
""Lack of people is the biggest problem; the company is growing but staff numbers haven't kept up,"" Ohyama said.
Iris sees annual sales hitting by 1 trillion yen by 2022, a milestone that would elevate it into an elite group of companies that have prospered by taking aim at Japan's thrifty consumers.
""Our brand image is improving,"" Ohyama said.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co is exploring a sale of its asset management business, in what would be the U.S. bank's biggest shake-up since former Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) chief executive Charles Scharf joined as CEO last year, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 
The potential deal would illustrate how Scharf is looking at drastic moves, beyond cost cuts, as he seeks to turn Wells Fargo around following a years-old sales practices scandal. He has said he is targeting $10 billion in savings annually over the long term.
Wells Fargo's asset management arm, which managed $578 billion on behalf of customers as of the end of June, could fetch more than $3 billion in a sale, two of the sources said. 
The San Francisco-based bank has discussed a potential deal with asset management companies and private equity firms, according to the sources, who cautioned that a divestment is not certain and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment.
Wells Fargo reported a 57% drop in its third-quarter profit earlier this month, missing Wall Street's expectations, as persistent costs continued to haunt the bank.
The bank has been grappling with these costs since 2016, when it entered a settlement with regulators that detailed millions of phony accounts employees had created in customers' names without their permission to hit sales targets. 
Bank executives have signaled repeatedly that the worst of the fallout is in the past, but elevated operating losses have persisted. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve has placed restrictions on Wells Fargo's balance sheet, to be lifted only when the management team can prove it has sufficiently improved risk management and controls.
Scharf told analysts on the bank's third-quarter earnings call this month that he expected to create some room on Wells Fargo's balance sheet by exiting non-core businesses.
""I just want to be clear. We are exiting them because they are not core to serving our core customer base on the consumer and large corporate side. We are not exiting them because of the asset cap,"" Scharf said.
The asset management business, which is part of Wells Fargo's wealth and investment management division, offers mutual funds and retirement products. Wells Fargo plans to keep its wealth management business that caters to high-net worth clients, the sources said.
The wealth and investment management division is led by Barry Sommers, the former head of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co's wealth management business that Scharf recruited in June.

Wells Fargo had started to trim the division even before Scharf because CEO. It sold its retirement plan services business to Principal Financial Group Inc (NASDAQ:PFG) last year for $1.2 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States, state governments and some foreign countries should replace quarantines and travel bans on airline passengers with COVID-19 testing of travelers before departure and upon arrival, airline and business groups said on Thursday.
They said the move would boost U.S. international air travel, which is down 78% year-over-year for the most recent seven-day period, according to airline industry data.
The groups, which include the International Air Transport Association, Airlines for America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, airline unions and the U.S. Travel Association, called on the Trump administration, state governors and international partners ""to pursue a risk-based and data-driven approach to COVID-19 testing which would obviate the need for quarantines and travel bans so that the travel network can be safely re-opened.""
The groups added that ""travel quarantines are decimating our industry."" 
Currently, 18 U.S. states have some type of quarantine for arriving travelers, the groups said. Hawaii last week began allowing airline passengers who tested negative for COVID-19 to avoid a two-week mandatory quarantine upon arrival. 
The United States still has in place entry bans on nearly all non-U.S. citizens who recently were in China, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Brazil, Iran and countries in the so-called Schengen border-free area of Europe.
Nearly all of Europe still bans most U.S. travelers, while the UK allows Americans to visit but requires a two-week quarantine upon arrival.
""The continued restrictions on international travel and differing state and international quarantine policies are hampering the recovery of the U.S. economy,"" the letter added. 
The Trump administration has been holding high-level discussions with countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy about the possibility of establishing ""flight bubbles"" that would allow travel or reduce quarantines if passengers agreed to COVID-19 tests before departure and upon arrival.

Under discussion are whether a quarantine would still be required, with some health experts in the Trump administration calling for a one-week quarantine, and what test would be used. Rising coronavirus infections in some countries, such as the United States, pose a hurdle to lifting restrictions.

885,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>","Investors will hoard gold even faster next year, keeping prices high: Refinitiv","By Peter Hobson
LONDON (Reuters) - Demand for gold from jewellers and central banks will remain sharply lower in 2021 than before coronavirus, but investors will keep prices high by stockpiling record amounts of bullion, Refinitiv Metals Research said. 
Gold prices are near record highs after surging to $2,072.50 an ounce in August as investors in Europe and North America hoarded an asset they thought would hold its value through the pandemic. 
But those high prices, along with coronavirus lockdowns, have collapsed sales of jewellery in Asia, previously the biggest driver of the bullion market.
Jewellery demand will fall 31% to 1,327 tonnes this year before rising 9% to 1,447 tonnes in 2021, Refinitiv Metals Research director Cameron Alexander said, releasing its latest quarterly report on supply and demand on Friday. 
Central bank purchases will plunge by half to 312 tonnes this year and recover slightly to 385 tonnes next year, Alexander said. 
Investors will continue to plug the demand gap, with exchange traded funds (ETFs), which store metal for investors, stockpiling 1,205 tonnes this year, three times the amount in 2019, and another 1,362 tonnes in 2021, the most ever. 
Purchases by retail buyers of bars and coins will fall 6% this year to 917 tonnes before rising 13% to 1,039 tonnes in 2021, Alexander said.
Gold will average $1,890 an ounce next year, below the $1,965 price forecast by a Reuters poll this week, but prices could be volatile, Alexander said.
The July-September quarter saw the weakest demand so far this year, despite a recovery in jewellery fabrication, Refinitiv found.
Bullion owners in Asia sold gold, driving demand for retail bars to the lowest in over a decade, while central banks sold more gold than they bought for the first time since 2010 and ETFs slowed the pace of their stockpiling.

Walmart said certain officials in the U.S. Justice Department are threatening to sue the retail giant, claiming pharmacists should have refused to fill otherwise valid opioid prescriptions. 
""We are bringing this lawsuit because there is no federal law requiring pharmacists to interfere in the doctor-patient relationship to the degree DOJ is demanding,"" Walmart, which runs one of the largest pharmacy chains in the country, said in a statement https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/10/22/walmart-sues-doj-and-dea-seeking-clarity-for-pharmacists-in-dispensing-prescription-opioids.
Walmart in the lawsuit against the DOJ and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) said the federal authorities are seeking civil penalties related to its alleged failure to submit suspicious order reports and added that this potential move would be ""unprecedented."" 
The DOJ and the DEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
On Wednesday, a West Virginia court ruled that Walmart must turn over information about federal and state investigations into its opioid-related practices to hospitals suing the company for allegedly contributing to the epidemic. https://reut.rs/37vZNim
Opioid addiction has claimed roughly 400,000 lives in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Critics of the industry said opioid makers hid the addiction and abuse risks of prolonged use from consumers.

(Reuters) -  Mattel Inc  (O:MAT) reported a surprise rise in quarterly sales on Thursday and forecast more growth in the holiday season, as retailers rushed to restock their shelves of Barbie dolls and other toys in high demand from stuck-at-home kids.
The toymaker's shares rose 6% in extended trading. 
With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing schools in many parts of the United States to hold classes online, parents have turned to playsets and games to keep children's boredom at bay, boosting toy sales at retailers such as Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT).
As pre-pandemic inventories run low, Mattel has had to boost shipments, leading to a 10% jump in its third quarter net sales - the biggest increase in a decade.
According to research firm NPD, demand is expected to increase as wealthy families with excess of money to spend due to canceled vacations splurge on toys during the holiday season.
Mattel Chief Executive Officer Ynon Kreiz said he expects Barbie play houses and fashion dolls to be among the company's best-selling toys for the holiday quarter, but warned of potential overall supply challenges. 
""We cannot be certain we will fully meet the surge in consumer demand,"" Kreiz said on a call with analysts. 
Barbie gross sales rose 29% to $532.2 million, the brand's biggest quarterly sales since 2003, as efforts to make the traditionally white, blonde doll more inclusive with different skin tones and body types struck a chord with an increasingly diverse customer base.
Mattel posted net sales of $1.63 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, beating analysts' estimates of $1.46 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company reported adjusted earnings of 95 cents per share, beating estimates of 39 cents, as cost cuts beefed up profit margins. 

The company forecast mid-single-digit growth in fourth-quarter gross sales on a constant currency basis.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Starboard Value, which now owns 9% of  ACI Worldwide  (NASDAQ:ACIW) Inc, views the payment systems company as an ""attractive"" takeover candidate, the hedge fund's chief Jeffrey Smith said at a conference on Thursday.
""ACI looks equally as attractive when you compare its current revenue multiple to recent transaction comps,"" Smith, Starboard's chief executive officer and chief investment officer, said. 
Smith told the Capitalize for Kids Virtual Investors Conference that the company has underperformed peers including  Blackbaud  (NASDAQ:BLKB), Commvault Systems, and FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) among others, despite its favorable business characteristics and unique collection of assets.
Over the past five years ACI has returned 37%, much less than the 151% gain of its peer group, Smith said, according to the firm's presentation which was obtained by Reuters.
Smith noted an ""unprecedented amount of M&A activity in the payments space in recent years,"" noting that both strategic and private equity buyers have been active. ""The valuations paid for recent acquisitions exceeds the multiple that ACI is currently trading at,"" he said.
ACI's stock price closed at $31.55 on Thursday, roughly where it closed on Monday before Starboard said it now owns 10.5 million shares in the Naples, Florida-headquartered company which is worth $3.7 billion. The company did not comment on Smith's presentation.
Starboard, which invests roughly $6 billion, is known for its operational know how and improving public companies like Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI). Starboard has already won 22 board seats in 2020, including three at data management software maker Commvault Systems, an ACI peer. 

Starboard said there is room for ACI to speed up organic growth with expanding operating margins and said that new management is taking sensible steps. But Smith and his team also want to hear details at the upcoming investor day and understand whether all units are core to the company.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) has asked suppliers to be ready to support a conditional 18% increase in production of its best-selling single-aisle A320 jet family once demand recovers from the coronavirus crisis, the European planemaker said on Thursday.
It is among the first visible moves by aerospace firms to prepare for a possible bounce back from the pandemic and comes days after a major buyer, Wizz Air (L:WIZZ), predicted a quick rebound for the strongest budget carriers.
However, the plan for an increase depends on a comprehensive recovery of the planemaker's biggest customers that have ordered hundreds of jets, including airlines in Southeast Asia which are currently struggling to take deliveries, industry sources said.
Airbus said it had asked suppliers to ""protect"" a production rate of 47 A320-family jets a month, up from 40, meaning it wants suppliers to be ready to support that rate when needed.
It indicated the earliest such a switch could take place would be July 2021, adding no decision had been taken.
""For the A320 family, we plan to maintain 'rate 40' until summer next year and we have asked the supply chain to protect 'rate 47' to be prepared for when the market recovers,"" a spokesman said, confirming a Financial Times report. 
""This decision aims to provide some visibility to our supply chain and ensure that our industrial ecosystem will be adequately prepared to gradually increase production eventually, when the right conditions are met,"" the spokesman said.
LOW-COST TRIO
The industry is still agonizing over a possible recovery with most analysts saying it is still too early to gauge the speed and shape of the flight path out of its worst downturn.
British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) warned on Thursday a travel slump from the pandemic had deepened.
A top Airbus executive told a newspaper earlier this month that the situation in early autumn was worse than Airbus, which is shedding 15,000 jobs, had expected in the summer.
Airbus nonetheless increased jet deliveries in September.
It has said it expects traffic to return to pre-crisis levels between 2023 and 2025, but with a split between in-demand single-aisle A320 jets and plunging demand for bigger models.
Holding the keys to any Airbus production increase are the breadth of available financing and the appetite of a trio of heavyweight budget carriers, industry sources said: India's IndiGo, Malaysia's AirAsia (KL:AIRA) and Lion Air of Indonesia. 
IndiGo (NS:INGL) has taken 29 jets this year as it expands its grip domestically, but deliveries to AirAsia and Lion Air are at a virtual standstill with no immediate sign of a pickup.
Before the crisis, Airbus was making 60 A320-family jets a month to meet rampant travel demand, with plans to reach 63 in 2021 and add a further 1-2 jets per month in both 2022 and 2023.
Worldwide lockdowns forced it to tear up those ambitions.
By restoring an upward bias in its production plans earlier than expected, Airbus may increase pressure on  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to find new homes for up to half of the 400 737 MAX aircraft it has produced while the jet has been grounded during an 18-month safety ban.

Dozens of the jets have been cancelled and only once the MAX is cleared to fly and the jets have been re-sold and delivered can Boeing return to high-speed new production, market sources said. It is in talks with airlines including Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV).

891,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 05:00PM ET</span>","Goldman to pay $3 billion, claw back executive pay over role in 1MDB corruption scandal","By Sarah N. Lynch and Noor Zainab Hussain
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) on Thursday said it was clawing back $174 million in executive compensation and had agreed to pay $2.9 billion over its role in Malaysia’s 1MDB corruption scandal, lifting a cloud that has hung over the bank for years.
The settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and other U.S. and overseas regulators resolves a probe into the role Goldman Sachs bankers played in helping to steal cash, which Goldman helped raise, from the Malaysian state fund.
While the scandal has proved a humbling and costly saga for the Wall Street giant, the long-awaited settlement should allow Chief Executive David Solomon to accelerate his plans to turn the bank around after a decade of under-performance, analysts said. Goldman's shares were up 1.4% on the news.
“Getting this overhang off the back of management and the company in general is a very big win,” said Marty Mosby, an analyst at boutique brokerage Vining Sparks.
Under terms of the deal, Goldman agreed to pay a $2.3 billion fine for breaking anti-bribery laws and to disgorge $600 million of ill-gotten gains as part of a deferred prosecution agreement, which also requires it to improve its compliance controls. 
The bank also agreed for its Malaysia subsidiary to plead guilty in a U.S. federal court on Thursday, in a victory for prosecutors who rarely extract criminal guilty pleas from corporate entities.
Brian Rabbitt, acting head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said the penalty was the largest ever levied for a breach of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and that the settlement reflected the ""seriousness"" of the bank's role ""in a massive global scheme to loot billions of dollars"" from 1MDB. 
The scandal dates to the government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, which set up the 1MDB fund in 2009.
Between 2009 and 2014, Goldman bankers paid more than $1.6 billion in bribes to foreign officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to win 1MDB business, including underwriting $6.5 billion in bond sales, for which it earned $600 million in fees. 
But billions of the fund's money were later stolen by high-level fund officials and their associates to pay for real estate, art and other luxury items, with the help of the Goldman bankers, the Justice Department said.
In 2018, the Justice Department filed criminal charges against two of the former Goldman bankers, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng. Leissner pleaded guilty to the charges last year, while Ng's case is pending in a New York court.
""While many good people worked on these transactions and tried to do the right thing, we recognize that we did not adequately address red flags and scrutinize the representations of certain members of the deal team,"" Solomon wrote in a memo to staff on Thursday, adding the bank had already made several compliance improvements.
He said that the bank would be clawing back compensation from the three bankers involved, and its former executive team ""in acknowledgement of the Firm’s institutional failures."" 
He and other senior executives would also have their compensation for 2020 reduced, bringing the total of clawbacks and pay reductions to $174 million. 
Thursday's deal follows $3.9 billion the bank paid in Malaysia in July to settle charges there related to the matter. 
RESERVES, DEALS
Since 2019, Goldman had set aside $4.39 billion to cover legal and regulatory matters. Some $2 billion was for matters it already resolved with the Malaysian government. On Thursday, it said it would increase its provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for the third quarter by $250 million. 
Odeon Capital analyst Dick Bove scolded Goldman’s management teams for allowing the 1MDB bond deals and commended the board for the clawbacks. He said he expects the financial penalties to affect fourth-quarter results despite Goldman’s existing reserves.
“Every person that participated in the decisions to proceed with these offerings needs their bonuses recaptured by the company. It is very positive to hear that Goldman may actually do this,"" he added.
Despite the costs, analysts anticipated that Thursday's deal should allow Solomon to accelerate his plan to reshape Goldman as a more conventional bank and be less reliant on volatile trading venues. Some investors and analysts viewed the 1MDB probes as an obstacle to Goldman doing transformative deals, since U.S. regulators will often bar banks from making big acquisitions while they're being probed for serious misconduct. 
With clarity over how much the bank needs to pay and a clean slate with regulators, Goldman may be able to be more aggressive on that front, said Mosby.

“When they had this over their heads they didn’t have that opportunity, they had to take a pause. This is a green light to say they can go ahead and do that.”

Investing.com – The Dow closed higher Thursday, as value stocks plugged the gap left by a fall in tech stocks on signs of progress on stimulus after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested a deal was close.
 Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD) jumped 4% in after-hours trading after the FDA approved its anti-viral drug.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.55%, or 154 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.55%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.57%.
Pelosi said a deal on stimulus “just about there,"" though added that key issues including state and local funding as well as liability protection were yet to be resolved.
Still, as any eventual stimulus proposal would need backing from congress, there is likely to be further stumbling blocks ahead. Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell has expressed concerns over the size of the deal on the table, believed to be around $1.9 trillion, still below the Democrats' $2.2 trillion proposal, preferring instead to roll out targeted relief measures.

The Labor Department said 787,000 people filed for unemployment insurance, down 55,000 from the prior week's downwardly revised 842,000, and well above economists' forecast for 870,000.
Some economists, however, questioned whether the trend will continue in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases.
""[W]e doubt it will continue as Covid infections spread rapidly, pushing down demand for discretionary consumer services, especially in the hospitality sector,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note.
The renewed hopes for the economic recovery to continue, however, triggered a climb in value stocks with financials and energy in the ascendency.
Energy jumped 4% as oil prices clawed back some of their losses from a day earlier, when a jump in gasoline supplies intensified fears of demand weakening.
Financials, meanwhile, were pushed higher by a sharp uptick in banking stocks as the favorable backdrop of rising Treasury yields continued.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) added 2%, while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) climbed more than 3%.
The earnings parade gathered pace as mega blue chips reported quarterly performance.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) eased from session highs to end nearly 1% after the electric automaker said it was on track to for 500,000 deliveries this year, and reported quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) added 1% after its better-than-expected quarterly results suggested the worst of the hit from pandemic was in the rearview mirror as sales fell 6% in the quarter, a marked improvement from the 26% slump in the second quarter.

The S&P 500 rose, with banks leading the charge higher and energy stocks rallying along with oil. The NASDAQ Composite eked out a smaller gain.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are ""just about there,"" despite still having some significant differences to work out before a deal is clinched.
On the data front, initial jobless claims surprised by falling more than expected. New filings came in at 787,000 last week, while continuing claims slid to 8.37 million from a revised 9.4 million. 
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. Debate fallout
Ok, so this event is happening tonight, but expect the final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden to weigh on markets tomorrow. The two square off at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. Trump trails nationally and in key swing states -- if you believe the polls.
2. AmEx earnings
 American Express  (NYSE:AXP) highlights an otherwise light earnings calendar. The focus will be on revenue forecasts as the economy rebounds and consumers begin to spend a bit more on travel, but don't expect a return of corporate clients. Loan-loss reserves will also be noteworthy as unemployment remains high. Consensus is for adjusted earnings per share of $1.33 on $8.68 billion in sales.
3. Full steam ahead
Despite a symbolic boycott by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court nomination continues apace. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to hold a vote Friday to advance the nomination to the floor, keep the Senate in session over the weekend and then hold the full confirmation vote on Monday.

Investing.com – The Dow notched gains Thursday, led by value stocks like energy and financials, on hopes the economy is set to get a much needed fiscal boost after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested an agreement on stimulus was nearing the finish line.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.57%, or 160 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.46%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.16%.
Pelosi said a deal on stimulus “just about there,"" though added that key issues including state and local funding as well as liability protection were yet to be resolved. These differences, however, are unlikely to meet a speedy resolution in talks, White House Chief Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow said.
Still, an eventual bill, which requires congress and senate backing, could meet opposition from Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who would need some swaying from President Donald Trump,  Pelosi said on Wednesday. Senate Republicans have bulked at the size of the deal on the table, believed to be around $1.9 trillion, still below the Democrats' $2.2 trillion proposal, as they prefer targeted relief measures.  
In another boost to sentiment on the economy, jobless claims fell below 800,000 for the first since the pandemic struck in mid-March.
The Labor Department said 787,000 people filed for unemployment insurance, down 55,000 from the prior week's downwardly revised 842,000, and well above economists' forecast for 870,000.
Some economists, however, questioned whether the trend will continue in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases.
""[W]e doubt it will continue as Covid infections spread rapidly, pushing down demand for discretionary consumer services, especially in the hospitality sector,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note.
The renewed hopes for the economic recovery to continue, however, triggered a climb in value stocks with financials and energy in the ascendency.
Energy jumped nearly 3% as oil prices clawed back some of their losses from a day earlier, when a jump in gasoline supplies intensified fears of demand weakening.
Financials, meanwhile, were pushed higher by a sharp uptick in banking stocks as the favorable backdrop of rising Treasury yields continued.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were up more than 2%, while JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) climbed 3%.
The earnings parade gathered pace as mega blue chips reported quarterly performance.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) eased from session highs to trade up 2% after the electric automaker said it was on track to for 500,000 deliveries this year, and reported quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) added 1% after its better-than-expected quarterly results suggested the worst of the hit from pandemic was in the rearview mirror as sales fell 6% in the quarter, a marked improvement from the 26% slump in the second quarter.
Airlines, among the hardest hit sectors from the pandemic, reporting mixed results as American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) reported narrower-than-expected results, while Alaska Air Group Inc (NYSE:ALK) revealed deeper losses, though said it had cut its cash burn.
Tech was among the biggest decliners on the day as the fab 5 traded slipped. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were below the flatline, while Goog-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) bucked the trend lower."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares on Wall Street gained on Thursday in choppy trading, as investors cheered the prospect of more fiscal stimulus to support a pandemic-damaged U.S. economy, with more data pointing to a slowing labor market recovery.
Trading on Wall Street this week has been dictated by a flurry of reports related to progress in the stimulus talks. The CBOE Market Volatility index (VIX) rose for the eighth time in nine sessions, and was last up 2.8%.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reported progress in talks with the Trump administration for another round of financial aid and said legislation could be hammered out ""pretty soon"".
""The market remains highly sensitive to a fiscal stimulus deal,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. 
""What we're concerned about is the labor market as we move to the next couple of months. We get the roll-off of the stimulus and the labor market remains suspect. That's why we're looking for fiscal stimulus and the market is looking for fiscal stimulus,"" he added.
Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have been negotiating a relief bill near the $2 trillion mark, a sum opposed by Senate Republicans who have expressed concern about the federal deficit.
Also on Thursday, data showed the number of Americans filing for state unemployment benefits last week dropped more than expected to 787,000, but remained stubbornly high as support from fiscal stimulus faded.
At 2:02 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 164.06 points, or 0.58%, to 28,374.88, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 18.39 points, or 0.54%, to 3,453.95 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 26.11 points, or 0.23%, to 11,510.81.
Energy (SPNY) and financials (SPSY) rose 2.6% and 1.6%, respectively, the steepest percentage gainers among the major S&P sectors.
Investors will monitor the final presidential debate on Thursday night, where Trump will take on Democratic challenger Joe Biden who is ahead in national polls.
Meanwhile, about a fifth of S&P 500 companies have reported third-quarter results of which 84.1% beat earnings estimates, according to IBES Refinitiv data.
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) climbed 2.0% after the electric-car maker reported its fifth consecutive quarterly profit on record revenue of $8.8 billion.
 Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG) fell 4.7% as it posted a drop in quarterly profit, hurt by higher beef prices, delivery costs and coronavirus-related expenses.
Among blue-chip companies,  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) gained 1.3% as it beat quarterly results expectations, while chemicals maker Dow Inc (N:DOW) fell 0.6% even as it surpassed quarterly profit estimates.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.82-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.72-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 48 new highs and 27 new lows.

901,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 01:35PM ET</span>",U.S. airlines lay out COVID-19 damage and renew calls for aid,"By Tracy Rucinski and Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) - American Airlines (O:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) signaled on Thursday that they would continue to hemorrhage cash into next year as revenues hover around a third of 2019's levels due to a collapse in demand from the coronavirus.
Still, both said they had enough liquidity to ride out the crisis, even while renewing calls for another round of government aid after an initial $25 billion to protect jobs through September expired. 
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said negotiators were making progress in talks with the Trump administration for another COVID-19 economic stimulus package and that legislation could be hammered out ""pretty soon.""
Shares of Southwest, which is expanding its network while others have retrenched, were up 4% on Thursday afternoon. The airline said it would stop blocking middle seats in December, enabling it to tap more revenue on each flight.
Shares of American were flat after it said it would issue up to $1 billion of equity to further bolster liquidity, which reached $13.6 billion in September.
British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) warned on Thursday the travel slump from the coronavirus pandemic had deepened in Europe, leading to a larger-than-forecast quarterly loss.
U.S. domestic leisure demand has shown signs of improvement but passenger traffic will remain fragile until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, Southwest said, while highlighting recent studies showing that in-flight COVID-19 risk is low.
The World Health Organization (WHO) told Reuters that the risk of COVID-19 spreading on flights indeed appears ""very low"" but cannot be ruled out, despite studies showing only a small number of cases.
Alaska Airlines (N:ALK), which also posted quarterly results on Thursday, said it is blocking middle seats through early January, like Delta Air Lines (N:DAL).
American and United Airlines (O:UAL) sell all available seats.
EYES ON CASH
American Airlines said it expects its cash burn rate to fall to about $25 million to $30 million a day in the fourth quarter from about $44 million per day in the third quarter and $58 million per day in the second.
To halt the bleed entirely, it would need about 65% to 70% of the $11 billion in revenue it reported in 2019. It drew in just $3.19 billion of revenue in the third quarter, down 73% from a year ago.
American also said it will tap $7.5 billion in federal loans, more than initially forecast.
Southwest said it would need to roughly double the $1.79 billion in revenue it booked in the third quarter to reach cash burn break-even, though CEO Gary Kelly told investors its $15.6 billion in liquidity is enough to last at least three years. 
The airline, whose debt position is among the best in the industry, forecast fourth-quarter average core cash burn of about $11 million per day, compared with $16 million per day in the third quarter and $23 million per day in the second. 
DEFERRED DELIVERIES
With little need for new jets, American said it had agreed with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to defer deliveries of 18 737 MAX aircraft scheduled to be delivered between 2021 and 2024, and said it was discussing delivery delays with Airbus. 
Southwest, which flies only Boeing 737s and had already agreed to take no more than 48 MAX aircraft through 2021, said it was also discussing additional delays.
The MAX has been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes. American has said it could return the jets to service this year pending approval for software and training changes, while Southwest said on Thursday it probably will not fly the jets until at least the second quarter of 2021.

The airlines have also parked jets and retired aircraft due to depressed demand.

The stock opened at $18.60 per share, compared with its IPO price of $20 per share. At the debut price, the company was valued around $8 billion.
McAfee priced its IPO towards the lower end of its targeted range between $19 and $22 per share.
The offering marks a return to public markets for McAfee, which was bought by  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) in 2011. 
It was then turned into a joint venture with TPG Capital in a deal which valued the company at $4.2 billion, including debt. Thoma Bravo took a minority stake in McAfee in 2017.
In the first half of 2020, McAfee's net revenue was $1.4 billion with a net income of $31 million.
""The markets we play in are large, growing and important and we realize there's a great need for what we bring to the table,"" McAfee Chief Executive Officer Peter Leav told Reuters.

(Reuters) -  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) beat revenue and profit expectations on Thursday as a partial reopening of theaters and restaurants boosted demand and helped the world's largest soda maker bounce back from a shattering second quarter.
Declines in ""away-from-home"" sales eased to mid-teens range in the third quarter from about a 50% slump in April at the height of lockdowns, while demand for its trademark Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar also rose.
Coca-Cola makes about half of its revenue by selling its soft drinks at public venues and their closure had forced it to offer voluntary job cuts to about 4,000 workers in the United States.
Chief Executive James Quincey said the situation is ""dynamic"", as rising cases during the winter could result in regional lockdowns, adding the recovery in ""away-from-home"" sales had showed signs of getting stalled in September. 
""We don't expect to return to the peak levels of global lockdown, but we are prepared for setbacks due to the local spikes in cases and targeted restrictions and closures,"" Quincey told analysts.
The company said consumers were buy more sparkling soft drinks and juices from grocery stores and online.
""Coronavirus effects may linger for at least a couple of quarters, but we are seeing better progress than expected,"" Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said. 
Rival PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP) too survived the lockdown-fueled slump with better sales at convenience stores and gas stations as well as good demand for snacks.
Coca-Cola said it will cut the number of brands by half to about 200 and phase out products like ZICO coconut water and TaB sodas as part of its strategy to streamline beverage portfolio and focus more on popular products. 
On a per share basis, the Atlanta-based company earned 9 cents above expectations. Net revenue of $8.7 billion also beat estimates, according to Refinitiv data.

The average for a 30-year, fixed loan dropped to 2.8%, down from 2.81% last week and the lowest in almost 50 years of data-keeping,  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) said in a statement Thursday. It was the 11th record low this year. The previous one held for a week.
The plunge in borrowing costs began in March as the coronavirus roiled financial markets. The lower rates have fueled a housing rally that has boosted the pandemic-battered U.S. economy.
Home sales have surged as Americans look for more space in the suburbs. But the lower mortgage rates have combined with scarce inventory to drive up prices, possibly pushing homeownership out of reach for many.

913,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>","AT&T takes pandemic hit, but surpasses revenue expectations","By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - AT&T Inc on Thursday reported the coronavirus pandemic had taken a heavy toll on its media business, but quarterly results were offset by more new phone subscribers than expected, which executives credited to the improved quality of its wireless network.
That helped AT&T beat revenue expectations. Total revenue was $42.3 billion during the third quarter ended Sept. 30, exceeding the average analyst expectation of $41.59 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Shares of AT&T surged 5% to $28.11 in morning trading.
The company added 645,000 net new phone subscribers during the quarter who pay a recurring monthly bill. Analysts had expected AT&T to lose a net 9,000 customers, according to research firm FactSet.
During an earnings call with analysts, AT&T said it expected its wireless business to continue to do well in the fourth quarter, when customers typically upgrade to new phones or move to unlimited plans.
AT&T, which has spent the past few years investing in media businesses, forecast continued ""choppiness"" for movie theaters in the United States as the pandemic continues. 
""We're not optimistic,"" said AT&T Chief Executive John Stankey during a call with financial analysts. ""We're not... expecting a huge recovery in theatrical moving into the early part of next year.""
WarnerMedia, the segment that contains HBO and the company's movie and TV studio, generated revenue of $7.5 billion, down from $8.4 billion in the year-ago quarter, as movie theaters largely remained shut in the U.S.
The company reported 38 million subscribers in the United States for both its premium TV channel HBO and HBO Max during the third quarter, reaching its 2021 goal a year early, as more people sought entertainment at home. It currently has 57 million subscribers worldwide. 
AT&T said that 28.7 million customers had access to HBO Max during the quarter, and reported 8.6 million HBO Max ""activations,"" which it sees as a sign of engagement. Such activations are defined as customers who had access to the streaming service through their unlimited phone plans, for instance, and then activated their accounts to use the service.
The services had 36.3 million subscribers in the United States in the previous quarter.
Even as the WarnerMedia segment attracts new subscribers, it must also contend with existing HBO subscribers through their pay TV providers who are cutting the cord. 
AT&T is playing catchup to larger streaming video rivals. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) currently serves about 68 million U.S. customers and nearly 200 million worldwide. Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+ has more than 60 million subscribers, reaching its goal four years early. 
Adjusted earnings per share were 76 cents, matching analyst expectations. The figure was down from 94 cents in the same quarter last year.
AT&T said the pandemic eroded earnings per share by 21 cents.

The company added 357,000 net new fiber internet customers during the quarter, as demand for home internet increased with more Americans working from home during the pandemic.

The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index fell 1.6 points to 46.6 last week, data released Thursday showed. Americans’ optimism about their personal finances declined 1.3 points to 60.3, its lowest point since August, while a measure of comfort in the buying climate decreased 2.1 points. Such a decline means that American’s may be growing cautious about their spending.
A measure of confidence in the economy dropped 1.5 points from its six-month high in the prior week. This was the seventh consecutive month where four in 10 Americans or more said the economy is getting worse, the longest since a two-year streak during the Great Recession.
The Bloomberg monthly economic expectations index rose to a seven-month high of 43 in October, as a smaller share of respondents said the economy was getting worse.
Expectations of the economy are largely partisan ahead of the election. Among Democrats, 60% say the economy is getting worse compared to 39% of independents and 22% of Republicans.
The pessimism last week was concentrated among Americans with a household income of $100,000 or more. The index saw a 7.8 point decrease among the cohort.

Investing.com -- Align (NASDAQ:ALGN) Technology soared more than 34% on Thursday, a day after it reported third quarter results at the close that soundly beat expectations.
The maker of Invisalign teeth straighteners posted profit of $1.76 a share on $734.1 million in revenue. Those numbers easily topped analyst expectations for EPS of $1.28 and revenue of $592 million, respectively. Shipments also came in above consensus.
The company said positive signs continued into the fourth quarter: ""Our overall revenue momentum has continued into October and we are encouraged by positive feedback from Invisalign providers,"" Chief Executive Officer Joe Hogan said in a statement.
Analysts praised the results. Piper, SVB Leerink and Stifel all raised their price targets on the stock. Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Brandon Couillard said the ""striking velocity"" of Align's recovery partly reflects an unexpected ""Zoom effect"" of adult consumers using pent-up disposable income on a better smile, according to Thefly.com.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened with modest gains on Thursday, as a sharp drop in initial jobless claims assuaged worries that there will be no agreement on further fiscal support for the economy until after the election.
By 9:35 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 46 points, or less than 0.2%, at 28,257 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite outperformed with a gain of 0.5%. All three indexes had fallen on Wednesday in response to signs from Capitol Hill that progress on a fresh stimulus package wasn't fast enough to allow it to be voted on before Nov. 3. 
The Nasdaq's outperformance was due in part to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which rose 3.0% after the company reported another solid profit for the third quarter after the closing bell on Wednesday. However, it gave up around one-third of its after-hours gains on analysts' concerns that it is losing market share in the electric vehicle segment as the competition heats up.
Earlier, the Labor Department had said that initial jobless claims fell below 800,000 for the first time in over six months last week, a better-than-expected result that reflected up-to-date filings from California for the first time this month. However, with less than two weeks to go before the election, over 23 million people nationwide are still claiming some kind of unemployment-related benefit. 
""The decline is material,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""But we doubt it it will continue as Covid infections spread rapidly, pushing down demand for discretionary consumer services, especially in the hospitality sector.
Shepherdson noted that Initial claims in Wisconsin, which publishes daily claims numbers, have closely tracked the state’s huge surge in Covid-19 cases over the past month.
""We see no reason to expect the national picture to be much different, so we would not be at all surprised to see claims start head higher over the next few weeks,"" Shepherdson said.
On a busy morning for corporate earnings, AT&T (NYSE:T) stock rose 5.7% after it posted a strong quarter for its key wireless unit, adding some 645,000 new subscribers net. The company also reported a sharp acceleration in signups for its HBO Max streaming service, which offset revenue declines at its traditional media business due to the pandemic. 
Coca Cola stock rose 1.9% and Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) stock rose 4.2% after both those companies also reported better-than-expected earnings, but Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) stock fell 6.2% to a four-month low after a set of results that showed how its sales of tissue to offices had slumped as companies asked people to work from home. Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) stock also fell 6.5% after it reported falling profits despite higher revenue, an illustration of how delivery and other pandemic-related additional costs have eaten into margins during the pandemic. The company also declined to give any further guidance, citing pandemic-related uncertainty."

919,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 08:10AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs U.S. settlement over Malaysia 1MDB scandal to lift dark cloud,"By Matt Scuffham
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) this week will agree to pay more than $2 billion to settle U.S. charges over its role in Malaysia's 1MDB corruption scandal, lifting a dark cloud that has hung over the bank for years. 
Under the agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and other regulators, the bank will admit fault for its role in underwriting bond offerings that raised $6.5 billion for the Malaysian state fund, according to media reports on Tuesday. 
One of its Asia subsidiaries is expected to plead guilty for its role in the scandal, but the bank group overall will avoid a guilty plea, which could have crippled its business, the reports said. 
The long-awaited deal would allow Goldman to move beyond a saga that has threatened to derail Chief Executive Officer David Solomon's efforts to turn around the Wall Street investment bank after a decade of under-performance.
""Getting this overhang off the back of management and the company in general is a very big win,"" said Marty Mosby, an analyst at boutique brokerage Vining Sparks. 
Some investors and analysts viewed the 1MDB probes as an obstacle to Goldman doing deals to accelerate Solomon's plan to reshape it as a more conventional bank, and reduce its reliance on volatile trading and investment banking revenues.
U.S. regulators will often not allow a bank to do deals while it is the subject of investigations into past misconduct. With clarity over how much the bank needs to pay and a clean slate with regulators, Goldman may be able to be more aggressive on that front, said Mosby.
""When they had this over their heads they didn't have that opportunity, they had to take a pause. This is a green light to say they can go ahead and do that.""
The settlement may also boost the bank's share price, which has been under pressure due to the probe, said Mosby. Goldman's share price lags its rivals, trading at just 0.8 times the value of its assets. 
In a sign this week's settlement could see the bank tie-up other loose ends related to the scandal, Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Co said on Wednesday it was dropping a lawsuit against Goldman to recover losses it suffered as a result of the bank's 1MBD dealings.
A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment. A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The Justice Department probe focused on Goldman's role in underwriting three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5 billion for 1MBD, which was set up by the government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009. 
The agency estimated that $4.5 billion of the fund's money was looted by high-level fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014. 
Goldman, which in July paid $3.9 billion to settle the Malaysian government's charges against the bank, has said in the past that it was misled by bankers who worked on the bond sales.

Fiat Chrysler (FCA) will start selling a full range of the electric version (BEV) of its popular city car this weekend, after officially unveiling it and offering it in two premium configurations earlier this year.
Olivier Francois, head of the Fiat brand and FCA's chief marketing officer, said that the group would also offer two more expensive versions of the 500 BEV at 23,700 euros and 25,200 euros, including the incentive.
The cheapest version will have a range of 185 kilometres (km), while for others the range will be 320 km.
As well as the baseline incentive, buyers of electric cars in Italy are offered a further 4,000-euro discount if they scrap an old car. 
""If you have an old car to scrap, the new 500 BEV could be even cheaper than its petrol-engined sister, whose most popular version costs around 17,000 euros,"" Francois said.
The 500 BEV, which is part of a plan announced in 2018 to invest 5 billion euros in Italy up to 2021, is FCA's first major step into electric-powered driving.
Competing electric cars include the Mini Cooper SE, which has a starting price of 33,900 euros in Italy excluding incentives, and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY)'s e-208, starting at 33,750 euros.

923,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>",Auto startups chasing Tesla race past red flags to go public,"By Ben Klayman and Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - Missed out on the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rally but still want to surf the electric vehicle wave?
A stream of EV-related startups backed by blank-check firms are lining up to go public so there's plenty of choice. But like Tesla in the early days, few have products ready to sell or any likelihood of generating significant revenue anytime soon.
Instead, investors will be relying on rosy production, sales and revenue forecasts for new cars, trucks and batteries, all set to be jostling for a slice of markets that will be far more crowded than when Tesla's cars first hit the road.
Take Fisker Inc, for example. It was launched in 2016, just three years after the bankruptcy of its predecessor and early Tesla rival Fisker Automobile.
In July, Fisker Inc announced a $2.9 billion reverse merger deal with Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp, a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), and is planning to go public later this year. 
It has no revenue and its Fisker Ocean electric sports-utility vehicle (SUV) is at least two years away from production in a project heavily dependent on nailing down deals with partners who will build the car and provide key components.
That's not particularly unique for young companies in the sector looking to use SPACs to go public and bypass the scrutiny of a traditional IPO process, according to company presentations and interviews with executives and investors.
That also didn't seem to be an issue earlier this year when U.S. electric truck maker Nikola Motors used a SPAC to go public. Shares in the company that hopes to generate revenue next year almost trebled after listing on the Nasdaq exchange.
But they slumped when a short-seller questioned whether founder Trevor Milton had made false claims about Nikola's technology, forcing the 38-year-old entrepreneur to step down as executive chairman - and making some investors more cautious.
Nikola and Milton have publicly rejected the accusations and have threatened to take legal action against the short-seller, Hindenberg Research.
""Good storytelling is an important component of being a good founder and entrepreneur - but it better not be the only component,"" says Evangelos Simoudis, managing partner and founder of startup investor Synapse Partners.
'IT'S A FORECAST'
Fisker Inc's founder Henrik Fisker is well known in the industry, for designing sports cars such as Aston Martin's Vantage, and for his failed EV firm Fisker Automobile that went bust in 2013 after burning through more than $1 billion.
Fisker Automotive missed targets on revenue, pricing, production and sales before the collapse of its battery supplier forced it to suspend production of its Fisker Karma, which first reached customers about two years later than planned and sold for a much higher price than originally announced.
This time around, he is confident he has learned from his mistakes and won't be one of the startups planning to go public that fails to meet investors' expectations.
""A lot of them will not succeed in launching a successful product on time ... that's just a fact,"" he told Reuters. ""The question then is how much are investors willing to forgive?""
He also said Nikola's woes should make potential investors look closer at what they were buying into.
""It probably was a bit of a wake-up call for investors to really dig a little deeper into these deals and maybe think about what are the real costs and effort to take to get a vehicle to market and maybe understand a little more about how difficult and complicated this industry is,"" Fisker said. 
Investors say Fisker Inc shares some characteristics with other young automotive startups, such as a difficulty in raising funds from private investors and optimistic projections for revenue and profits, as well as production.
Its Ocean prototype is a stylish mid-size SUV with a base price target of $37,500 and production set to start in late 2022. It will enter a market that is soon to be crowded by Tesla's Model Y, Ford Motor (NYSE:F)'s Mustang Mach E, VW's (DE:VOWG_p) ID.4 and at least half a dozen other brands.
The Ocean's price target is $2,500 below the ID.4, which goes on sale later this year at just under $40,000.
In its presentation to investors in July, Fisker Inc said it expected to produce 175,000 cars in 2024, earning revenue of $10.6 billion and pretax profit of $2 billion that year.
""This is not only based on the Fisker Ocean. We are planning other vehicles as well,"" said Fisker. ""It's a reasonable, good forecast and at the end of the day it's a forecast. It's not something anybody can guarantee.""
""When you're a new car company and specifically when you make electric vehicles, it's almost impossible to really forecast what your sales will be,"" he told Reuters.
ON SCHEDULE
Bill Rinna, director of Americas vehicle forecasts at LMC Automotive, projects total U.S. EV sales in 2024 will just top 1 million. Tesla could account for half that volume, with GM, Ford and VW taking significant shares as well, analysts say. 
Trade publication Automotive News predicts nearly 100 new pure electric and hybrid electric vehicles will go on sale in the United States by 2024.
Fisker Inc boasts an ""asset light"" business model that is heavily dependent on using partners both for a vehicle platform and a manufacturing plant - neither of which were locked in before it announced its SPAC deal in July.
Fisker also said then it was negotiating with VW to use its MEB electric car platform and related components for the Ocean. 
On Oct. 15, Fisker announced a preliminary deal with Canadian auto parts supplier  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA), which has agreed to assemble the Ocean at one of its European plants and to provide the mechanical platform for the vehicle.
In an SEC filing the same day, Spartan Energy warned investors that Fisker and Magna ""have not entered into a binding definitive agreement"" to build the Ocean. The filing also noted that Fisker does not have a deal with VW to use its platform and is still negotiating a parts supply deal.
Asked whether the Ocean's production timetable was still on track, Fisker said: ""All I can tell you is we are on the time schedule.""
SHARE SLIDE
In the wake of Nikola's setbacks, investor concerns about potential red flags for other auto startups backed by SPACs have started to hit the shares of the blank-check companies.
""When you have no product and zero revenue, it comes down to the story that you're telling,"" said Marc Weiser, co-founder of investor RPM Ventures. ""In the case of companies with unproven potential, it's pure speculation - and huge risk.""
Nikola shares slumped from June high of $93.99 to just $16.15 on Sept. 24 but since have recovered slightly to $22.24. Shares in Fisker's backer Spartan Energy are at $12.27, down from a July peak of $21.58.
Shares in DiamondPeak Holdings, which is backing Lordstown Motors, are down 33% from their September peak and Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp, which is behind battery maker QuantumScape, are down 45%.
Two-year-old Lordstown Motors hopes to pit its $52,500 Endurance electric pickup late next year against rivals from Tesla, Ford, General Motors (NYSE:GM), Rivian, Nikola and others.
Lordstown and DiamondPeak told investors in September the truckmaker projects revenue of $3.5 billion and pretax profit of $300 million in 2023.
Ten-year-old battery startup QuantumScape has a promising new solid-state battery cell and financial backing from Volkswagen, but has said it is years away from commercial production and meaningful revenue.
Whether fund managers dangling blank-check deals will pursue a more cautious approach in the post-Nikola environment, despite the potential red flags, remains an open question.
    But with Nikola as a cautionary tale, and Fisker sparking additional concerns, some investors have become more choosy.

    ""We will spend much more of our time and our focus on companies that are already in revenue or ... are soon to be in revenue,"" Barry Engle, former president of General Motors North America and head of Qell Acquisition Corp, which is evaluating EV-related startups.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening slightly lower Thursday, with investors showing caution amid continued uncertainty over a potential new coronavirus stimulus package and as the earnings season continues.
At 7:25 AM ET (1125 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 4 points, or 0.1%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 29 points, or 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 12 points, or 0.1%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and theS&P 500 are on course for their first losing week in four, and the Nasdaq Composite it’s first down week in five.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will continue discussions Thursday over a new coronavirus aid package to boost the country’s stuttering recovery, but doubts remain that such a deal can be agreed upon before the presidential election.
President Donald Trump sought overnight to blame Democrats for any failure, but the major roadblock for the roughly $2 trillion deal being negotiated by Pelosi and Mnuchin could well be Senate Republicans, some of whom baulk at the idea of a deal of anything approaching that size.
Trump and Democrat rival Joe Biden are set to square off later Thursday in their last debate before the Nov. 3 vote.
Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic continues to stifle economic growth. Wednesday’s Federal Reserve Beige Book pointed to sluggish employment trends, and with this in mind attention will turn to the release of the weekly initial jobless claims, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
Analysts are looking for claims to be 860,000 last week, compared with 898,000 the prior week, remaining around the upper 800,000 range that has largely existed since August. 
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be in the spotlight after the electric car maker reported its fifth consecutive quarterly profit on record revenue of 8.8 billion dollars, after the close Wednesday, sending its stock higher in after-hours trading.
The earnings season remains in full flow Thursday, with Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) reporting a drop in earnings and revenue as the beverage giant makes recent moves to streamline its brand offerings. 
AT&T (NYSE:T) fell just short of consensus forecasts on earnings but topped expectations on revenue in the third quarter, while Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) top the billing after the close. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock rose 0.9% after saying it will burn less cash in the current quarter, after reporting a record loss of over $1 billion in the third quarter.
Oil prices edged higher Thursday, rebounding after the previous session’s heavy losses after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a build of 1.895 million barrels in gasoline supply, against the 1.829 million-barrel draw predicted, suggesting U.S. motorists are increasingly choosing to stay home.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $40.46 a barrel, after dropping 4% Wednesday, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1% to $42.13, after falling more than 3% the previous session.

The first data from late-stage large-scale clinical trials being conducted in several countries around the world, including Brazil, the United States and Britain, are expected to be released before the end of the year.
The vaccine - known either as ChAdOx1 or AZD1222 - is made by taking a common cold virus called an adenovirus from chimpanzees and deleting about 20% of the virus’s instructions. This means it is impossible for the vaccine to replicate or cause disease in humans.
The Bristol researchers’ focus was to assess how often and how accurately the vaccine is copying and using the genetic instructions programmed into it by its designers. These instructions detail how to make the spike protein from the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19.
Once the spike protein is made, the immune system reacts to it, training the immune system to identify a real COVID-19 infection. 
""This is an important study as we are able to confirm that the genetic instructions underpinning this vaccine ... are correctly followed when they get into a human cell,"" Matthews said in a statement about the work.

His team's research was not peer reviewed by other scientists, but was published as a preprint before review.

The company said its third-quarter cash burn rate was about $44 million per day, compared with about $58 million a day in the second quarter.
The airline industry, hard-hit by the virus outbreak has so far failed to secure another $25 billion bailout to help protect jobs and cover payroll costs.
The company posted a net loss of $2.40 billion, or $4.71 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of $425 million, or 96 cents per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, the company lost $5.54 per share. Total operating revenue fell to $3.17 billion from $11.91 billion.

American Airlines ended the third quarter with $13.6 billion in available liquidity.

929,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Apple expands 'Express' retail store format ahead of holiday season,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) is expanding a new physical store format as it tries to get iPhone 12 models into customers' hands, its retail chief told Reuters in an interview.
The new ""Express"" stores come as COVID-19 rates are rising around the United States and Europe. The new format has a wall built in front of the main store with sales counters protected by plexiglass and a few shelves of accessories such as phone cases and AirPods. Customers make an appointment to pick up orders placed online or interact with Apple's technicians for customer service. 
For Apple, which has 271 retail stores in the United States, the new format could help it navigate a holiday sales challenge. 
The company is launching its biggest-selling product of the year as the pandemic flares up again in key markets such as the United States and Europe. The company has taken a cautious approach to re-opening its retail stores, using a team that includes medical experts to make its own calls on a county-by-county basis and sometimes shuttering stores again when local rules would otherwise allow stores to operate. 
The new ""Express"" stores give Apple another option in areas where troubling COVID-19 rates might force it to consider reducing service to curbside pickup. 
That option does not work as smoothly for Apple stores in shopping malls or busy downtown shopping districts where the ""curb"" may be far away from the storefront, said Deirdre O'Brien, senior vice president of retail and people at Apple.
Apple currently has about 20 such stores in the United States and Europe and plans to expand to 50 across the two regions by the end of the month, she told Reuters. 
""It's a swifter way for us to serve customers,"" O'Brien said. ""It allows us to maintain all the appropriate social distancing and maintain all of our health protocols within our stores."" 
Apple's iPhones are arriving a month later than usual because of pandemic-related development delays. Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies, said customers who buy iPhones on Friday are unlikely to be put off by not being able to handle demo devices at the ""Express"" stores.
""People who are buying this early in the cycle, they know what they are buying,” she said. 
Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst who is now a partner at Loup Ventures, said Apple will likely face about 5% fewer iPhone sales because of the retail environment for this year's iPhone launch. And Apple will lose customers who spend more than they planned in physical stores on accessories like cases or headphones. 
But that loss has been offset by Apple's customer service, which Munster said helped drive higher revenues in Apple's most recent quarter. 
""When you’re a parent trying to do school from home or an employer trying to do distributed technology, that’s a positive force,"" he said. 

""That far outweighs the negative of what is going on in their retail stores, and we see that in their numbers.”

AT&T said it added 645,000 postpaid subscribers, net of churn, in the three months through September, after losing over 150,000 users in the previous quarter.
The company also said it had 57 million subscribers for its HBO Max streaming service as of the end of September, with subscriber additions more than doubling from a disappointing level in the second quarter. Domestic subscribers for the HBO/HBO Max services totaled 38 million, already ahead of the full-year target of 36 million.
Net debt edged up slightly to 2.66 times EBITDA, however, as profitability weakened: adjusted earnings per share fell to 76c, from 83c in the prior quarter, and just shy of the 77c consensus forecast.

British Airways said that one of its 747s will fly to Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey, southern England, later on Thursday, where the airport will preserve it as a commercial TV and film set. 
Blaming the coronavirus pandemic, BA said in July it would have to retire its entire jumbo jet fleet, a source of huge regret for aero-geeks and fans of the ""Queen of the Skies"", the aircraft which brought long-haul flights to the masses.
The pandemic has brought financial ruin to the travel industry. BA's owner IAG (L:ICAG) reported a 1.3 billion euro loss earlier on Thursday and warned on future demand.
At Dunsfold, the 747 will form the backdrop for interior and exterior shots and be used for training purposes, a BA statement said, adding that in future it would be opened up as an exhibition for visitors.

BA's last jumbos took off from Heathrow earlier in October, the end of an era for the world's most easily recognised jetliner with its humped fuselage, four engines and 16 main wheels.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Call it Whopper deja vu. Burger King will begin testing reusable containers next year to reduce waste from sandwich and soda packaging, the burger brand said on Thursday.
The chain, a unit of Restaurant Brands International (TO:QSR), hopes customers will ask for their food to come in the reusable packages, pay a deposit, and get the money back after they scan used soda cups and burger boxes through an app before returning them.
Burger King worked with waste management firm TerraCycle Inc's Loop unit on a so-called closed-loop system that creates no waste because special packages are repeatedly cleaned and re-used. Materials used to make the packaging have not been finalized.
The pilot program will launch in the second half of 2021 in some Burger King restaurants in New York City; Portland, Oregon; and Tokyo initially.
Restaurant chains have been experimenting with reusable and recyclable materials in response to environmental concerns. 
 Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) and McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) co-founded the NextGen Consortium in 2018 to address single-use food packaging, including a competition to design new cups, lids and straws that are more compostable, recyclable and reusable.
Its aim is to eventually scale up to mass use of such cups.
Burger King said in a statement that its reusable containers would be cleaned with Loop's ""state of the art"" cleaning systems that are aligned with its own ""rigorous safety procedures around cleanliness and hygiene, all of which have become even more pressing during the current pandemic.""

Loop's website does not specify what products and processes are used to clean its reusable containers.

The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said serious lapses and deficiencies in management controls at Goldman Sachs (Asia) L.L.C. had contributed to the misappropriation of $2.6 billion from funds raised by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) in three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013. 
A Goldman Sachs spokesman said the Wall Street bank would issue a statement in due course. 
The three bond offerings, which raised a combined $6.5 billion, were arranged and underwritten by UK-based Goldman Sachs International, with work conducted by deal team members in multiple jurisdictions, who shared the revenue generated. 
The SFC said Goldman Sachs Asia, the Hong Kong-based compliance and control hub of Goldman Sachs in Asia, had significant involvement in the origination, approval, execution and sales process of the three bond offerings.
The bank's Asia unit had earned $210 million from the offerings, the largest share among the various Goldman Sachs entities. 

""Goldman Sachs Asia fell far short of the standards expected of a licensed intermediary in the 1MDB case and suffered not only reputational damage from its own failures, but also brought the securities industry into disrepute,” said Thomas Atkinson, the SFC’s Executive Director of Enforcement in the statement.

The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has set three principles for the jet to return to service in China, Feng Zhenglin, director at the agency, told reporters in a press conference. 
Design changes need to be certified, pilots need to receive proper training and effective improvements need to be made to address the specific findings of investigations into the crashes, Feng said. 
""Based on these three principles, we have not set a timetable for Boeing 737 MAX's return to service here. As long as these conditions are met, we're happy to see the MAX return to service in China,"" said Feng. 
""But if these conditions cannot be met, we still have to carry out strict airworthiness certification in order to ensure safety.""

Investing.com -- Before the pandemic, it was accepted as an unalterable fact that the fate of luxury goods makers was tied very tightly to that of the travel and tourism industry.
However, the third-quarter reports from the luxury sector suggests that may no longer be the case, or at least not to the same extent.
Hermes (PA:HRMS) became the latest group to report better-than-expected sales for the three months through September on Wednesday, helped by a strong rebound in its Asian business and, importantly, through its online sales.
The latter is something of a novelty for the likes of Hermes and LVMH, which reported a similar trend last week. Buying stuff online has always been a bit beneath the industry. Richemont’s acquisition of Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net-a-Porter, which aimed to make luxury e-commerce a big thing a few years back, has appeared anything but transformational.  
Covid-19 appears to have changed that. With airport and other tourism-related sales decimated by the pandemic, Hermes’ customers have been happy enough to go online to get their handbags and scarves. E-commerce sales have nearly doubled over the first nine months of the year, finance chief Eric du Halgoüet told reporters. The e-store is now the company’s biggest store, he noted.
The company is drawing conclusions. It will be expanding its online ranges “gradually”, holding back only “the very iconic products” such as its $12,000 Birkin bags, du Halgoüet added.
Currency-adjusted sales rose 6.9% on the year in the third quarter, although the euro’s appreciation meant Hermes could only show 4.2% growth. The numbers were rescued by Asia, where sales rose 25% as Chinese customers reopened their wallets and refurbished boutiques in Tokyo reopened.  Chinese customers are, famously, less sniffy about e-commerce in general than their more staid peers in the west.
Conspicuously, growth was fastest in Hermes’ home products. Even accounting for the relatively low base, it shows how its core customer base remains determined to enjoy the finer things in life even when deprived of the social opportunities for exhibitionism that generally drive luxury consumption.
The same picture was evident in the numbers from wine and spirits group  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) on Wednesday. Revenue in the first quarter of its fiscal 2021 year fell only 6%, thanks to “very resilient” sales for at-home consumption in Europe and the U.S.  Chairman and CEO Alexandre Ricard said business “has recovered significantly” from the previous three months.
Pernod Ricard, too, continues to struggle from depressed duty-free sales but while that led to a 10% drop in sales of its strategic brands such as Martell cognac and Ballantine’s and Chivas whisky, customers have consoled themselves by drinking more Jacob’s Creek, Brancott Estate and Campo Viejo: wine sales were up 9%.
The only sector unable to compensate for the loss of travel-related revenue is, naturally, the travel sector. IAG (LON:ICAG), the owner of British Airways and Iberia, said on Wednesday it now expects cash flow to be negative again in the fourth quarter owing to the resurgence of Covid-19 and the measures taken to stop it. Revenue fell 83% in the third quarter, leading the group to swing to an operating loss of 1.3 billion euros, from a profit of 1.4 billion a year earlier."

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares slid to a two-week low on Thursday, and oil steadied after another heavy fall, as a surge in global COVID-19 cases and fractious U.S. stimulus talks kept financial markets cautious.
Europe's early equity falls were their fourth in a row, while a disappointing German consumer morale survey also meant it was the first dip of the week for the high-flying euro. 
The continent has seen the number of coronavirus cases surge to a record high, with Spain becoming the first Western European country to exceed 1 million infections and France, Britain and Italy all setting record increases recently.
Bond market caution also ushered sensitive Italian government debt yields higher ahead of a 30-year bond sale there, as traders drifted back into uber-safe German Bunds.
""In the summer we were in the eye of the storm, I think,"" said Rabobank strategist Piotr Matys, likening the drop in COVID-19 cases to the lull that occurs in the middle of hurricanes. 
""Some governments assumed the worst was over... but now the invisible enemy is hitting even harder and I am worried about the fragile economic recovery.""
Sentiment was also being buffeted after U.S. President Donald Trump accused rival Democrats on Wednesday of being unwilling to craft an acceptable compromise on fresh stimulus, following reports of progress earlier in the day.
It remains unclear whether negotiations will continue ahead of the U.S. presidential and congressional elections on Nov. 3.
""We still think that this deal will remain elusive in the sense that this amount that we are talking about, $1.88 trillion, that's about 9% of GDP, said Carlos Casanova, a senior economist at Union Bancaire Privee (UBP) in Hong Kong.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi's package is even higher at around 10% of GDP.
""Even if both sides do manage to reach an agreement, given the tight deadline ahead of the election it's unlikely that something like that would be able to go through the Senate smoothly,"" said Casanova.
In the currency markets, the dollar was a modest 0.1% higher against the yen at 104.66, while the euro's dip saw it notch down 0.12% to $1.1847.
But against a basket of major peers the dollar appeared relatively unaffected by setbacks to stimulus talks, steadying after touching a seven-week low to trade slightly higher at 92.736.
Overnight, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had slipped 0.3%, while the Nikkei closed 0.7% lower. 
ELECTION LOOMING
Uncertainty over the passage of a bill to stimulate a pandemic-ravaged economy comes as the United States also faces a new wave of COVID-19 cases.
Nearly two-thirds of U.S. states were in a danger zone of coronavirus spread and six, including election battleground Wisconsin, reported a record one-day increase in COVID-19 deaths on Wednesday.
Wall Street's three major averages closed lower on Wednesday after a choppy trading session, and futures markets pointed to another subdued start later.
""The focus is absolutely on how a decisive win in this election can unlock fiscal stimulus,"" J.P. Morgan Asset Management global market strategist Hugh Gimber said, cautioning however that investors needed to treat next month's U.S. vote carefully.
The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes ticked down to 0.8092%, from a U.S. close of 0.816% on Wednesday. 
In commodity markets, oil prices steadied after sharp losses on Wednesday, when higher U.S. gasoline inventories pointed to deteriorating fuel demand again.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures hovered near $40 a barrel and Brent crude futures were 0.3% higher at $41.85. 

Gold eased as the dollar edged up, with spot gold down 0.4% at 1,916 per ounce.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A pandemic-exacerbated surge in Thai bad loans to nine-year highs and the end of a debt payment holiday are prompting buyers of distressed debt to embark on a shopping spree in Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy.
About 6.89 trillion baht ($221 billion) of outstanding Thai debt - or 42% of total lending - has been under relief programmes that include payment deferment and reduction, interest rate reduction and restructuring.
The most significant of these - a government-mandated six month debt payment holiday - ended on Thursday.
The Bank of Thailand has said it does not expect sudden and large defaults, but its former chief Veerathai Santiprabhob, whose term ended last month, warned in August bad debt could jump as the economy slumped. 
The country's biggest distressed debt manager,  Bangkok Commercial Asset Management  (BK:BAM), told Reuters it will spend 12 billion baht to acquire sour loans with a face value of about 40 billion baht this year.
""We will focus on buying debt this year and next,"" Bunyong Visatemongkolchai, the bank's executive board chairman said, adding it planned to issue 25 billion baht of bonds to fund purchases.
Its shares are up 11% this year, versus a 23% drop for the main stock index (SETI).
Easy credit for consumers and businesses for years have prompted many warnings about the dangers of the household debt malaise in Thailand. Those are now proving prescient as the pandemic batters businesses, leaving as many as three million people without work.
Thai household debt is among Asia's highest, at 83.8% of GDP as of June, the highest level since 2003, while the central bank predicts the trade and tourism-dependent economy could shrink by a record 7.8% this year. 
Months of protests against the government and the monarchy could further slow a recovery for the economy.

Thailand's non-performing loans amounted to 509 billion baht as of June, a nine-year high of 3.09% of total lending, versus 2.98% at the end of 2019. Loans with a significant increase in credit risk hit 7.48% of lending, up from 2.79% at the end of last year. 
Banks prefer keeping distressed assets in house to avoid expensive write-downs, but sometimes see no option but to sell.

""We will sell debt of businesses that have no potential,"" said Atipat Asawachinda, first senior vice president of  Kasikornbank  (BK:KBANK), which plans to offload 10 billion baht of bad debt this year. 
JMT Network Services (BK:JMT), the biggest buyer of distressed consumer loans, will spend a record 6 billion baht buying debt this year, CEO Sutthirak Traichira-aporn said. 
""The amount of debt being sold in the market is so great that we don't have time to choose,"" he said, noting it had acquired debt with a face value of 12 billion baht at an average 84% discount in the first half.
JMT's shares have surged 66% this year.

Sutthirak said relief measures had only delayed the souring of loans, likening them to holding water behind a dam, ""If there is too much, it will break out"".

(Reuters) - European stocks hit their lowest level in almost a month on Thursday, as a fall in German consumer morale, worries about soaring coronavirus cases in the continent and a U.S. stimulus impasse weighed on sentiment. 
The German DAX (GDAXI) fell 0.9% and lagged its European peers, as a survey showed consumer morale in Europe's largest economy dropped heading into November.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was down 0.7%, after falling as much as 1.2% to hit its lowest since Sept. 25. 
COVID-19 cases have climbed in Europe, with Spain becoming the first Western European nation to exceed 1 million infections and Italy setting a record increase in daily cases.
The number of confirmed cases in Germany jumped by more than 10,000 in a single day for the first time.
""We are more cautious on Q4 growth than we were a few weeks ago,"" said Julien Seetharamdoo, head of European market investment strategy at Zurich Insurance Group (OTC:ZFSVF).
""We don't expect anything like Q2, but it's more likely that Q4 will be close to stagnation in terms of growth as restrictions impact activity in certain parts, especially the services sector."" 
The broader selloff took a toll on tech stocks (SX8P), the worst performing sector so far this week. Investors have also remained nervous about the slow pace of U.S. stimulus and the Brexit negotiations.
Data showed fund flows into European stocks have surged in recent months as global investors looked away from U.S. equities ahead of the presidential election and on concerns over high valuations.

Investing.com - European stock markets sold off Thursday, as investors fretted about the lack of progress in the talks over a new U.S. stimulus package, German consumer sentiment fell and the region’s earnings season continued apace.
At 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 1%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.7%.
Optimism surrounding the potential for a new coronavirus relief package dissipated late Wednesday after President Donald Trump accused Democrats of being unwilling to come to an acceptable compromise over the size of the package. 
Meanwhile, the second wave of European Covid-19 cases is weighing on German consumer confidence, according to market-research group GfK, its forward-looking consumer-sentiment index fell to minus 3.1 points in November from a revised minus 1.7 points in October.
Around three-quarters of consumers currently assume that Covid-19 poses a major or very major threat, and about half are concerned or very concerned about their personal future, GfK said.
Europe has seen Covid-19 cases climb to a record high, with Spain becoming the first Western European country to exceed one million infections and Italy and Germany setting a record increase in daily cases. Despite that, data from the U.K.. another country with sharply rising infections, suggest that improved hospital treatments have significantly reduced mortality rates in the current wave.
In corporate news, IAG (LON:ICAG) stock slumped 5% after the airline group, which owns British Airways, reported a 1.3 billion euro loss in the third quarter, adding that it no longer expects to break even in cash flow terms in the fourth quarter as it cut its capacity outlook for the rest of the year.
Unilever (NYSE:UL) stock fell 0.4% despite the retailer’s third-quarter underlying sales rising thanks to growth in hand and home hygiene products.
It wasn’t all bad news though.  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) stock rose 1.3% after the French drinks maker said it expects a return to growth in the second half even as sales fell by 6% during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Luxury goods group Hermes (PA:HRMS) also returned to sales growth in the third quarter in constant exchange rates.
Oil prices rebounded slightly Thursday, after suffering heavy losses during the previous session as official gasoline inventories add to worries about the outlook for fuel demand given the surge in Covid-19 cases.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a build of 1.895 million barrels in gasoline supply, against the 1.829 million-barrel draw predicted, suggesting U.S. motorists are increasingly choosing to stay home.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) reported a 1.3 billion euro third-quarter loss on Thursday as coronavirus restrictions depressed travel, forcing it to further cut its flying schedule for the rest of the year. 
The loss was far larger than the 920 million euros forecast by analysts, illustrating the scale of the challenge faced by IAG's new boss Luis Gallego who took over in September. 
As a second wave of COVID-19 infections spreads across Europe, airlines are facing a bleak winter and IAG joins Lufthansa, Ryanair and easyJet (LON:EZJ) in cutting back already anaemic schedules.
IAG said on Thursday that for the fourth quarter it would fly no more than 30% of the capacity it flew a year earlier, lower than previous guidance of 40%. 
With less flying, the group warned it no longer expected to reach breakeven in terms of net cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter, but said that liquidity was strong. 
The company has raised 2.74 billion euros from shareholders and received the funds in early October, raising its total liquidity to 9.3 billion euros.

At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.3%. 
Optimism surrounding the potential for a new coronavirus relief package dissipated late Wednesday after President Donald Trump accused Democrats of being unwilling to come to an acceptable compromise over the size of the package. 
While Trump had previously said he was willing to accept a large aid bill, it was clear that there was also deep opposition among Senate Republicans to such a hefty stimulus bill amid worries that it could hurt their November election prospects by adding to rapidly rising budget deficits.
That said, the two sides are expected to continue talking later Thursday, in what looks an increasingly unlikely hope that a deal can be reached before the Nov. 3 presidential election.
“Neither side wants to be portrayed as the villain in this drama, so both are appearing to be constructive, while simultaneously dragging their feet and counting down to the closing credits,” said ING analyst Robert Carnell, in a research note.
Meanwhile the coronavirus pandemic continues to play havoc. Spain became the first Western European country to exceed one million Covid-19 infections on Wednesday, doubling its tally in just six weeks, while in the U.S., the number of Covid-19 patients in the country’s hospitals hit 40,000 for the first time since August, according to a Reuters tally.
Back in Europe, earnings from the likes of  Unilever  (LON:ULVR),  Michelin  (PA:MICP), L’Oreal (PA:OREP) and STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) will be in focus Thursday, while a fall in the German GfK consumer climate index for November may weigh.
Oil prices weakened Thursday, adding to the heavy losses from the previous session, as official inventories add to worries about the outlook for fuel demand given the surge in Covid-19 cases.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a draw of one million barrels for the week to Oct. 16, much smaller than the previous week’s 3.818 million-barrel draw. But it was more the build of 1.895 million barrels in gasoline supply, against the 1.829 million-barrel draw predicted, that spooked the market, as this suggested U.S. motorists are increasingly choosing to stay home.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) said on Thursday it has invested $100 million in opening new warehouses in Mexico, including its first shipping centers outside the populous capital area, in a bid to offer faster deliveries.
The new sites include two so-called fulfillment centers - one near the northern city of Monterrey and another near the central city of Guadalajara - as well as a support building in the State of Mexico, just outside Mexico City. 
Amazon also opened 12 delivery stations, bringing its total to 27 across the country, it said.
""The construction of a solid infrastructure network allows the company to stay closer than ever to clients, and thanks to that, it's possible to offer fast deliveries,"" Amazon said in a statement. 
Monterrey and Guadalajara are the two biggest metropolitan zones of the country after the sprawling Mexico City area.
The new facilities represent 69,000 square meters (742,710 sq ft) altogether and create 1,500 direct and indirect jobs, Amazon said.
Amazon in total now runs five fulfillment centers, two support buildings and two classification centers in Mexico, where it launched its marketplace in 2015.
Enrique Alfaro, the governor of Jalisco state that is home to Guadalajara, said the new local warehouse would help more small and medium sized businesses ship their products faster and at lower costs. 
Amazon is also striving to make inroads in Brazil, where it recently opened its fifth and biggest fulfillment center in the country, with 100,000 square meters (1,076,391 sq ft).
In both countries, which are the biggest economies in Latin America, Amazon is vying with local rivals for shopper loyalty, despite its ranking as the world's biggest online retailer.

The U.S. market closed lower as hopes dim that the stimulus measures will be passed by Congress ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election. Despite President Donald Trump and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi raising those hopes, stiff Senate Republican opposition to the price tag remains a hurdle to be overcome.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell “might not mind doing it after the election,” Pelosi said, even as she and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin continue talks later in the day and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said that the White House seeks to reach a consensus within the next 48 hours.
However, some investors remain unconvinced.
“We still think that this deal will remain elusive in the sense that this amount that we are talking about, $1.88 trillion, that’s about 9% of GDP, and $2.2 trillion which is Speaker Pelosi’s package, is even higher at around 10% of GDP ... even if both sides do manage to reach an agreement, given the tight deadline ahead of the election it’s unlikely that something like that would be able to go through the Senate smoothly,” Union Bancaire Privee chief Asia investment strategist Anthony Chan told Reuters.
Some investors braced for a tough day ahead.
“We’re looking at a fairly rough day for regional investors, we had a volatile session in the U.S. … futures markets are reflecting a worse day here. We’ll see losses across the region,” CMC Markets chief markets strategist Michael McCarthy told Reuters.
Meanwhile, Trump and Democrat candidate Joe Biden will meet for the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee, later in the day."

SYDNEY/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Shareholders of  Crown  Resorts Ltd (AX:CWN) voted against executive pay at the company's annual general meeting on Thursday, a step toward removing the board, as the Australian casino giant apologised for corporate governance failings.
The vote came amid an ongoing regulatory inquiry into alleged misconduct at Crown which has raised doubts over its fitness to run casinos in the state of New South Wales, just as its A$2.2 billion ($1.6 billion) gaming development nears completion on Sydney's waterfront.
Crown's directors and one-third owner James Packer have admitted under questioning at the inquiry that they had issued misleading public statements about the company's involvement with Chinese junket operators potentially linked to organised crime.
They have also revealed how they failed to act on warnings which might have stopped 16 staff being jailed in China in 2016 for breaching that country's anti-gambling laws, a scandal that derailed Crown's Asian operations.
The inquiry also heard that Packer - who stepped down from the board in 2018 citing mental health issues - continued to receive trading updates and orchestrated takeover proposals despite having no formal role other than shareholder.
""I unreservedly apologise for these failings,"" Chairwoman Helen Coonan told the virtual meeting.
""The vote ... reflects dissatisfaction with the performance of the board and the company, particularly in the context of evidence coming out of the (regulatory) inquiry.""
Owners of 34.3% of Crown's shares voted against a resolution to adopt the remuneration report, according to a slide of proxy votes displayed at the meeting, more than the 25% required to count as a vote against.
Under Australia's ""two strike"" rule, if shareholders vote against a company's remuneration report for two years in a row, they are allowed to call for a new resolution to remove the entire board.
Three Crown directors standing for re-election received more than the 50% vote they needed, but Deputy Chairman John Horvath said he would step down after receiving a vote of 58.4%. He told the meeting it was appropriate to quit because he relied on Packer's vote to be re-elected.
A day earlier, Crown ended an agreement - made public by the inquiry - to share confidential information with Packer. The company is also being investigated by Australia's financial crime agency over suspicion it failed to comply with anti-money-laundering protocols.

Crown shares were down slightly in mid-session trading on Thursday, in line with the broader Australian market (AXJO). The stock is down about 30% since February when concerns about shutdowns associated with the new coronavirus began roiling global markets.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Major Wall Street banks in India raked in their second-highest fee income since the global financial crisis in the first nine months of this year, benefitting from a flurry of private-sector deals despite the coronavirus pandemic.
India has seen a number of multi-billion dollar transactions in 2020 from oil-to-telecom conglomerate  Reliance Industries ' fundraising efforts (NS:RELI) to GlaxoSmithKline's (L:GSK) sale of its stake in  Unilever 's (L:ULVR) Indian business (NS:HLL), the country's largest block trade.
Five U.S. banks including  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS) earned $170 million in investment banking fees in January-September, the highest for that period since 2018, according to Refinitiv data, putting them on course for one of their most profitable years. 
In 2018, those five banks earned $176.5 million in Indian fees in the first nine months of the year, which was the highest for the period since 2007.
It comes as India's economy shrank by nearly a quarter in April-June as the country became one of the worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
""This year we are seeing a tremendous interest from international investors across sectors in India – in tech, real estate, financial and consumer sectors,"" said Dieter Turowski, Asia Pacific investment banking chairman at Morgan Stanley.
""In aggregate, the quantum of capital raising will continue but it'll be more diversified next year. The pipeline is stronger than six months ago.""
India saw $16.8 billion of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in its technology, media, and telecoms (TMT) sector between January and mid-October, up 62% percent from the same time last year, according to Refinitiv data. 
The momentum is expected to continue in 2021 when a series of technology companies such as e-commerce firm Flipkart are expected to list domestically or overseas.
Raj Balakrishnan, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s head of India investment banking, said consumer-tech would be a big deal driver for the country in the near future with more consolidation and initial public offerings (IPOs) to come.
TECH BOOM 
U.S. and European banks received 41.9% of the total investment banking fees earned in India in the first nine months of 2020, up from 37.2% last year, in a highly competitive market with a large number of local rivals.
Some European banks' retreat from the country in recent years has helped Wall Street banks increase the share of fees they earn, bankers said.
Morgan Stanley took home a record $65 million in the first nine months of this year, topping India's M&A league table, thanks to its role as Reliance Industries' financial advisor in the fundraising for its digital and retail units. 
Reliance raised over $20 billion from investors including Facebook (O:FB), Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Google, KKR (N:KKR) and Silver Lake Partners this year, contributing to India' sharp growth in M&A activity in 2020.
Separately, Goldman had earned nearly $30 million in fees this year as of end-September, its highest since 2018, as it got the advisory role on a $7 billion rights issue for Reliance Industries, the largest ever such deal in India.
The lofty returns will be welcomed by foreign investment banks which have long complained in private about the miserly fees they earn on Indian transactions, mainly on state deals.
Goldman Sachs said India was an important and growing market for the bank.

""Continued deal flow will come from financial sponsors, conglomerates strategically redefining and optimising their portfolios, and consolidation in tech and consumer sectors,"" said Sonjoy Chatterjee, the bank's head of India.

964,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 09:18PM ET</span>",China Wealth Link With Hong Kong to Be Capped at $23 Billion Each Way,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s plan to allow investments for private wealth across the border between Hong Kong and its increasingly affluent southern region will be capped at 150 billion yuan ($23 billion) in each direction.
The Wealth Management Connect program, which will allow residents of Hong Kong, Macau and major cities in China’s southern Guangdong province to invest across the border, will also have an individual quota of 1 million yuan, according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
The program will take an “incremental approach, starting with a smooth launch with possibilities for enhancements down the road,” a spokesperson for Hong Kong’s de facto central bank said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg. “At the initial stage, available wealth management products will cover non-complex products with medium to low risk.”
Talks are still going on between regulators in three jurisdictions, as well as with the financial industry.
Hong Kong’s Private Wealth Management Association hopes the the launch of the program, which will initially target retail banking clients, will take place early next year, said its chairman, Amy Lo.
The long-awaited program was announced without details in late June, just before China also unveiled a sweeping new security law in the city to crack down on anti-government dissent.
Hong Kong has sought to reassure investors it will remain a stable place after the introduction of the law, with Chief Executive Carrie Lam lobbying for more financial integration to build the city’s presence as a hub for private wealth and as a prominent offshore renminbi center.
Chinese President Xi Jinping called for deeper integration during a visit earlier this month to Shenzhen, China’s sprawling tech hub that sits just on the Kong Kong border. Lam was in the audience for the speech after she canceled her annual policy address to attend the event. She plans to give the speech late next month or earlier after consulting with officials in Beijing.

The program is at first likely to only allow simple and non-complex products as defined by Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission in areas such as foreign exchange, fixed income and mutual funds, Lo said.

965,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 08:25PM ET</span>","Tesla sets revenue record, makes profit thanks to pollution credit sales to rivals","By Tina Bellon and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc on Wednesday reported its fifth consecutive quarterly profit on record revenue of $8.8 billion, boosted by an uptick in vehicle deliveries and sales of environmental regulatory credits to other automakers.
The electric car maker also affirmed its target to deliver half a million vehicles by the end of this year, a goal that will require it to significantly ramp up vehicle sales in the fourth quarter.
Shares were up 2.5% at $433.88 in extended trade as the carmaker beat analysts' estimates.
Tesla said it had the capacity installed to produce and deliver 500,000 vehicles this year, but added that achieving its goal has become more difficult. 
""Achieving this target depends primarily on quarter over quarter increases in Model Y and Shanghai production,"" the company said.
Asked by an analyst during a conference call whether Tesla aimed to deliver 840,000 to 1 million vehicles next year, based on its factories' current maximum capacity, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk responded the target was ""in that vicinity,"" while another Tesla executive said the company would provide guidance next quarter.
Tesla has defied a downward trend in the wider auto industry in 2020 and bucked a pandemic and economic upheaval with steady sales and profitable quarters, sending shares up around 400% this year. 
At $394.5 billion, Tesla's market capitalization has become the largest among all global automakers, despite the company trailing rivals in sales, revenue and profit. 
Tesla's ascent highlights investor confidence in the future of electric vehicles and the company's shift from niche carmaker to global leader in clean cars.
But Craig Irwin, an analyst with Roth Capital Partners, cautioned that Tesla's lead could soon narrow.
""The company is still valued incredibly richly, like it's operating in a vacuum, yet competitors are working furiously to catch up,"" he said, referring to more than 400 new electric vehicle models scheduled to hit the roads by 2024. 
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Wednesday revealed an electric version of its Hummer pickup truck that will compete with Tesla's futuristic Cybertruck, which is scheduled to go into production next year.
Musk on Wednesday said Cybertruck orders will be delivered in 2022, or toward the end of 2021 the earliest.
Tesla in September outlined plans to cut battery production costs by producing larger cells in-house to power a growing fleet, including heavier, more energy-intense vehicles.
But Musk on Wednesday said the company would not depend on internal cell production before 2022, suggesting that Tesla will continue to rely on its external battery suppliers Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp, LG Chem and CATL.
He also said Tesla would roll out what it calls ""Full Self Driving"" more widely by the end of this year. Tesla on Wednesday launched the feature for an undisclosed number of ""expert, careful"" drivers in a pilot launch. 
Musk has been promising fully autonomous features for several years and Tesla buyers can pay $8,000 in hopes of eventually receiving the upgrade.
Safety groups have criticized the term ""Full Self Driving"" as dangerously misleading, with the system expected to be capable of functioning only in limited-use cases.
Revenue rose to a record $8.77 billion from $6.30 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $8.36 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Excluding items, Tesla posted a profit of 76 cents per share. It reported net income of $331 million, or $874 million excluding stock-based compensation awards given to Musk.
Revenue from the sale of regulatory credits made up $397 million. Without that revenue, Tesla would not have achieved a profitable quarter. 
So far this year, regulatory credits account for $1.18 billion, or 7% of total automotive revenue.
Pollution credits became a more meaningful source of revenue for Tesla about a year ago when California and other U.S. states increased the mandatory share of zero-emission vehicles sold per manufacturer. As competitors begin selling more electric vehicles, that revenue is expected to dry up.
With recovery in the United States sluggish and Europe struggling with a second bout of the virus outbreak, some analysts have pinned their hopes for Tesla on growth on China, which has begun to recover as consumers shake off the pandemic's effects. 
Tesla does not break out regional sales, but data from China's auto industry association, CPCA, showed Tesla Model 3 sedan sales remained roughly flat from July to September. Overall, Tesla sold around 34,100 Shanghai-made Model 3s in the third quarter. 
Tesla on Wednesday said Model 3 production at its Shanghai plant has increased to 250,000 vehicles a year, its targeted production rate.
Its main factory in Fremont, California, has a capacity of 590,000 vehicles, including the Model Y.
The carmaker said it would focus on improving manufacturing cost and efficiency and increase capacity as quickly as possible.
Tesla is building additional vehicle and battery plants in Berlin, Germany, and Austin, Texas, to ramp up production of existing vehicles and launch new models, including its Cybertruck and Semi truck.
Production at the German factory is expected to start in 2021.

966,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 08:05PM ET</span>","In emails, Sacklers fret over wealth, opioid business","By Mike Spector
(Reuters) - Soon after a Purdue Pharma LP affiliate pleaded guilty to misbranding its addictive opioid painkiller OxyContin in 2007, the company's Sackler family owners fretted about possible threats to their wealth.
On May 17, 2007, Jonathan Sackler, who has since passed away, emailed relatives and a financial advisor, triggering an anxious discussion, according to settlement documents U.S. prosecutors disclosed on Wednesday.
He told them an investment banker had once told him that his family ""is already rich, the one thing you don’t want to do is to become poor.” David Sackler responded the same day: "" (W)hat do you think is going on in all of these courtrooms right now? We’re rich? For how long? Until which suits get through to the family?""
Between 2008 and 2019, Purdue transferred more than $10 billion, including roughly $4 billion in cash to Sackler-controlled entities, according to filings. 
Family members on Wednesday said the transfers were proper and that documents scheduled to be released in the future would support that claim. As part of a separate plea deal https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purdue-pharma-opioids-investigations/oxycontin-maker-purdue-to-plead-guilty-over-opioid-practices-deal-sparks-opposition-idUSKBN276236 Purdue agreed to, certain documents produced to the Justice Department and related to criminal and civil settlements unveiled Wednesday will become publicly available through an online repository.
Still, in settlement papers, prosecutors called some of the money movements ""fraudulent transfers.""
On Wednesday, Sackler family members associated with Purdue agreed to pay a $225 million penalty to resolve a Justice Department civil probe alleging they caused false claims for OxyContin to be submitted to federal healthcare programs. They were not criminally charged.
The family denied the civil allegations and said that when they previously served on Purdue's board, they relied on management assertions the company was acting lawfully. They decided to resolve the investigation to facilitate a broader settlement of widespread opioid litigation against themselves and Purdue, they said. They have proposed contributing a separate $3 billion to resolving those lawsuits and ceding control of Purdue, which would dissolve and shift assets to a ""public benefit company"" steering money to U.S. communities suffering from the opioid crisis that have sued the company and family.
The family members said they were not involved in conduct described in Purdue's agreement, disclosed Wednesday, to plead guilty to criminal charges.
The Sacklers associated with Purdue are longtime philanthropists worth billions of dollars whose name has adorned museum wings. But museums began shunning donations and distancing themselves from the family after they surfaced in opioid lawsuits. 
In settlement documents, prosecutors detailed email exchanges among Sackler relatives expressing concerns about the state of Purdue's business, their own finances and the ability to take money out of their company. U.S. officials said their settlement with the Sacklers did not release them from fraudulent transfer claims Purdue's estate could bring. 
David Sackler, in the 2007 email exchange, suggested the family ""lever up"" in case access to money dried up when lawsuits surfaced. 
""My thought is to lever up where we can, and try to generate some additional income,"" he wrote, roughly five years before he joined Purdue's board. ""We may well need it ... Even if we have to keep it in cash, it’s better to have the leverage now while we can get it than thinking it will be there for us when we get sued.""
Purdue eventually filed for bankruptcy last year amid thousands of lawsuits from states, cities, counties and other plaintiffs alleging the company and its Sackler family owners aggressively marketed opioids while minimizing their potential for abuse and overdosing. The company and family have denied the allegations. 
In 2010 and 2011, Purdue attributed 40% of OxyContin prescription declines to so-called ""Region Zero"" doctors, so named because company sales representatives were instructed to avoid them since an internal company system flagged the physicians as suspected of writing improper prescriptions. Those controls failed, prosecutors said.
In a September 2014 email, Mortimer D.A. Sackler said Purdue was in ""a death spiral,"" noting that the company's bottom line had declined, and ""more importantly shareholder value,"" over the past several years. 
Jonathan Sackler responded that ""when the business has more cash flow than is required, I've supported distributions, and we've taken a fantastic amount of money out of the business.""
A Sackler family spokesman said: ""The full email, when it's eventually made public, will clearly show that Jonathan advocated keeping more money in the company and not taking further distributions.""

About a month after the message, in an email to relatives, Jonathan Sackler described Purdue's business ""as more of a smart milking program than a growth program.""

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) is ""very close"" to completing its workforce appraisals in the United States and Canada and expects to unveil job cuts, its chief executive told employees in an email on Wednesday.
The second-largest U.S. oil company by market value lost nearly $1.7 billion in the first six months and analysts forecast a third-quarter $1.17 billion loss, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The job cuts are part of a plan unveiled this spring to redesign how Exxon works and to increase competitiveness, CEO Darren Woods said in an email to its nearly 75,000-person workforce. 
Exxon has exceeded a target of reducing operating expenses by $1 billion and capital budget spending by $10 billion, he wrote. But the COVID-19 pandemic has cut oil demand by about 20%, he said, delivering a ""devastating impact"" on the oil business.
Woods told employees that ""we are very close"" to completing the jobs review and that they could expect details soon after the company's board of directors is briefed.
""I wish I could say we were finished, but we are not. We still have some significant headwinds, more work to do and, unfortunately, further reductions are necessary,"" he said in the email.
Exxon was slower than rivals to react to this year's oil price decline and borrowed $23 billion to shore up a balance sheet strained by the losses and a nearly $15 billion annual dividend payment to shareholders.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP) have outlined up to 15% workforce cuts while  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) has asked employees to reapply for their jobs.
Woods said the demand loss is five times the decline of the 2008 financial crisis, but ""industry under-investment today will increase the need for our products in the near future.""
All oil companies face the same loss of demand, but Exxon has the burden of promising to keep its huge dividend without adding new debt, said Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov. U.S. oil prices must rise another $10 a barrel to cover the payout without borrowing, he estimates. 
""If management has to walk back their pledge"" not to issue new debt to protect the dividend, ""it would damage credibility,"" Molchanov said. 
Exxon's dividend yield, the percent of the share price paid annually to holders, was 10.3%, the largest among major oil companies and another sign of Exxon's weak finances.

Its shares fell 1.6% to $33.14 on Wednesday as oil prices declined on worries that the COVID-19 infections are on the rise globally. The stock is trading near a 18-year low.

SAO PAULO/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Brazilian health authority Anvisa said on Wednesday that a volunteer in a clinical trial of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) and Oxford University had died but added that the trial would continue.
Oxford confirmed the plan to keep testing, saying in a statement that after careful assessment ""there have been no concerns about safety of the clinical trial.""
AstraZeneca declined to comment immediately.
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters the trial would have been suspended if the volunteer who died had received the COVID-19 vaccine, suggesting the person was part of the control group that was given a meningitis jab.
The Federal University of Sao Paulo, which is helping coordinate phase 3 clinical trials in Brazil, said an independent review committee had also recommended the trial continue. The university earlier confirmed the volunteer was Brazilian but gave no further personal details.
""Everything is proceeding as expected, without any record of serious vaccine-related complications involving any of the participating volunteers,"" the Brazilian university said in a statement.
So far, 8,000 of the planned 10,000 volunteers in the trial have been recruited and given the first dose in six cities in Brazil, and many have already received the second shot, said a university spokesman.
CNN Brasil reported that the volunteer was a 28-year-old man who lived in Rio de Janeiro and died from COVID-19 complications.
Anvisa provided no further details, citing medical confidentiality of those involved in trials.
AstraZeneca shares fell 1.8%.
Brazil's federal government has plans to purchase the UK vaccine and produce it at biomedical research center FioCruz in Rio de Janeiro, while a competing vaccine from China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd is being tested by Sao Paulo state's research center Butantan Institute.
Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro said on Wednesday the federal government will not buy the Sinovac vaccine.

Brazil has the second deadliest outbreak of the coronavirus, after the United States, with more than 154,000 killed. It has the third largest number of cases, with more than 5.2 million infected, after the United States and India.

(Reuters) -  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG) on Wednesday posted an 18.6% drop in quarterly profit, hurt by higher beef prices, delivery costs and coronavirus-related expenses. 
Shares of the company, one of the best performers in the restaurant sector following a 60% rise this year, fell as much as 6% after the closing bell. 
Still, the burrito chain reported a three-fold jump in online sales, as consumers ordered more freshly prepared meals and favored to-go orders instead of dining inside restaurants.
Comparable sales rose 8.3%, beating Wall Street expectations of a 7.59% rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Fast food restaurants - particularly pizza and Mexican restaurants - have seen sales increase amid the pandemic as customers craved comfort food, preferred the contactless nature of delivery, drive-thru and pick-up, and got tired of their own cooking at home.
Chipotle's digital sales could exceed $2.5 billion in 2020, more than double the amount in 2019, Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol told analysts during a post-earnings conference call. 
Net income fell 18.6% to $80.2 million for the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $3.76 per share, beating estimates of $3.47.
Chipotle brought back its popular carne asada option mid-September, helping comparable sales during that period grow in the mid-single digits, Chipotle said, adding that the trend continued through October.
The chain charged an extra $1 for its carne asada this year, compared with the 50-cent premium it charged when it launched in 2019 as a limited-time offering, according to Cowen analysts.
It also raised menu prices for delivery items. Even so, that was not enough to offset the higher costs of delivery itself, combined with elevated beef prices.
The average operating margin per restaurant was 19.5% for the quarter, a decrease from 20.8% from a year earlier, also hurt by fewer sales of beverages.
""Between now and next year... if delivery shifts into in-store and shifts into order-ahead and pick-up, then I'd say our margins per share are headed on the way up,"" Chief Financial Officer John Hartung told analysts.
""If delivery stays the same or increases, we'll have some challenges,"" he said.
He also said that labor costs will be around 25% in the fourth quarter as the benefit of menu price increases will be slightly offset by lower seasonal sales.

The 458% gain in Peloton shares since it was added to a Goldman buy list in 2019 suggests that “much of the near term opportunity is priced in,” analyst Heath Terry wrote in a research report cutting the rating to neutral from buy. Peloton fell as much as 3.9% in postmarket trading.
Shares of the New York-based company surged this year as Covid-19 lockdowns led to major growth in the home fitness market, as consumers look for ways to stay fit with many gyms across the U.S. remaining closed. Of the 27 analysts tracked by Bloomberg who cover the stock, now only three have a hold rating with one sell.
Terry also warned that Peloton’s forecast for the quarter ended in December could disappoint when the company reports results on Nov. 5 due to shipping delays caused by congestion at the Port of Los Angeles.

(Reuters) - Exchange operator  Euronext  (PA:ENX) said that there was mix up of buy and sell orders on a number of trades struck on Tuesday and later told Reuters that the issue was resolved by Wednesday evening as it battled to handle trading glitches after a huge outage earlier this week.
""It has been identified that some of the 19/10 trades sent yesterday to the CCPs (central counterparty clearing house) had the wrong buy/sell direction"", Euronext said earlier on Wednesday.
""Reverse trades will be sent after trading hours in order to neutralize the error"", it added.
""The issue is now solved"", the company said in an emailed statement late on Wednesday.
A series of glitches on Monday disrupted several of Western Europe's major stock exchanges and raised concerns about the risk of one operator hosting so many bourses.
The outage was at least the fifth major one globally this year and one of the most widespread as exchange operator Euronext hosts stocks exchanges from Dublin and Amsterdam to Paris and Lisbon. It operates six major stock markets in Europe.
Trading in those locations came to standstill for more than three hours on Monday morning due to a technical failure impacting one of its data management systems. Though it was resolved in the afternoon, it came back during closing auctions.
The outage was concerning for Euronext which is planning a major expansion through a 4.3 billion euro ($5.10 billion) deal to buy Borsa Italiana from  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE).
Euronext will operate exchanges with more than 1,800 listed companies and an aggregate market value of around 4.4 trillion euros after the Borsa Italiana deal.

981,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 04:20PM ET</span>","OxyContin maker Purdue to plead guilty over opioid practices, deal sparks opposition","By Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Purdue Pharma LP agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges over the handling of its addictive prescription opioid OxyContin, in a deal with U.S. prosecutors that effectively sidestepped paying billions of dollars in penalties and stopped short of criminally charging its executives or wealthy Sackler family owners. 
In a far-reaching agreement unveiled on Wednesday, Purdue formally admitted to criminal conduct related to distribution of its painkillers and agreed to pay $225 million to resolve U.S. Justice Department investigations. 
Prosecutors imposed significant penalties exceeding $8 billion against Purdue, though the lion's share will go largely unpaid. 
Purdue agreed to pay $225 million toward a $2 billion criminal forfeiture, with the Justice Department foregoing the rest if the company completes a bankruptcy reorganization dissolving itself and shifting assets to a ""public benefit company,"" or similar entity, that steers the $1.775 billion unpaid portion to thousands of U.S. communities suing it over the opioid crisis. 
A $3.54 billion criminal fine and $2.8 billion civil penalty are likely to receive cents on the dollar as they compete with trillions of dollars of other claims from those communities and other creditors in Purdue's bankruptcy proceedings, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter.
Members of the billionaire Sackler family who own Purdue agreed to pay a separate $225 million civil penalty for allegedly causing false claims for OxyContin to be made to government healthcare programs such as Medicare, according to court records. The Sacklers, which have proposed ceding control of Purdue to settle widespread opioid litigation, denied allegations prosecutors lodged in the civil case. 
Neither the Sacklers nor any Purdue executives were criminally charged. The agreement does not release any individuals associated with Purdue from potential criminal liability. A separate Justice Department criminal investigation scrutinizing individuals is ongoing, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Purdue conspired to engage in criminal conduct over the years that kept medically questionable prescriptions of its opioids flowing, prosecutors said. The Stamford, Connecticut-based company has agreed to plead guilty to three felonies, two of them violations of a federal anti-kickback law and another charge of defrauding the U.S. and violating the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
""Purdue deeply regrets and accepts responsibility for the misconduct detailed by the Department of Justice,"" said Purdue Chairman Steve Miller, who joined the company in July 2018. He noted that Sacklers no longer sit on the company's board. 
Sackler family members, in a statement, said when they were on the board, ""we adopted rigorous policies requiring Purdue to be in full compliance with the law,"" adding that they relied on management assertions the company acted lawfully. 
OPPOSITION FROM LAWMAKERS, STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL
The settlement had already come under fire before its unveiling from Democrats on Capitol Hill calling for Purdue and its Sackler family owners to face more severe consequences for their alleged roles in the opioid crisis, criticism that followed Reuters reporting details https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purdue-pharma-investigations-opioids/exclusive-oxycontin-maker-purdue-nears-guilty-plea-agreement-in-u-s-criminal-probe-sources-idUSKBN26S1P2 of the looming agreement.
Dozens of state attorneys general, meanwhile, oppose https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purdue-pharma-opioids-investigations/u-s-states-oppose-settlement-being-negotiated-by-oxycontin-maker-purdue-and-justice-department-letter-idUSKBN26Z2WJ a plan that would entangle government litigants with a public benefit company that continues to sell OxyContin.
Purdue reaped more than $30 billion from sales of OxyContin over the years, enriching Sackler family members while funneling illegal kickbacks to doctors and pharmacies, U.S. and state officials have alleged.
The cases against Purdue and the Sacklers reflect an attempt by officials to hold accountable alleged perpetrators of an epidemic that has claimed the lives of more than 400,000 people in the United States since 1999, prompting the Trump administration to declare it a public health emergency. 
The settlement comes about two weeks before the U.S. presidential election during an economic recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has so far resulted in more than 220,000 deaths nationwide. Several Democratic state officials lambasted the deal. 
""DOJ failed. Justice in this case requires exposing the truth and holding the perpetrators accountable, not rushing a settlement to beat an election,"" said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who has conducted her own probes https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-opioids-litigation-idCNL1N1ZF0XA, adding that she was ""not done"" with Purdue and the Sacklers.
Purdue's misconduct included paying illegal kickbacks to doctors and to a vendor called Practice Fusion https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purdue-pharma-investigation-opioids-e/exclusive-oxycontin-maker-purdue-is-pharma-co-x-in-u-s-opioid-kickback-probe-sources-idUSKBN1ZR2RY that created a software alert designed to push the drugmaker’s opioids on physicians, prosecutors said. 
Between 2007 and 2017, Purdue also ignored doctors suspected of improperly prescribing opioids that were flagged by its internal controls, and failed to report OxyContin prescriptions from these physicians to the Drug Enforcement Administration as legally required, officials said.
Purdue, which filed for bankruptcy protection last year https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1W1058 under an onslaught of litigation, has proposed settling thousands lawsuits in a deal it values at more than $10 billion. That is contingent on donations of opioid reversal and addiction treatment medications it has under development and a $3 billion cash contribution from the Sacklers.
Purdue asked its bankruptcy judge on Wednesday to approve the Justice Department settlement.
A Purdue affiliate in 2007 agreed to plead guilty to misbranding OxyContin in a deal with prosecutors that resulted in about $600 million of penalties.
In the years that followed, Sackler family members discussed taking money out of Purdue, concerned about declining opioid sales and litigation that could threaten their wealth, according to settlement papers disclosed Wednesday. 

Between 2008 and 2019, Purdue transferred more than $10 billion, including roughly $4 billion in cash to Sackler-controlled entities, according to filings. Family members on Wednesday said the transfers were proper. But in settlement papers, prosecutors labeled some of them ""fraudulent transfers.""

Investing.com -- Stocks struggled for direction on Wednesday as lawmakers waffled over stimulus negotiations and virus cases continued to spike.
The economy expanded at a ""slight to modest"" pace though employment trends were sluggish across the U.S. as companies face rising Covid-related costs, the Federal Reserve said in a periodic survey.
The Beige Book economic report, based on observations by the Fed’s 12 reserve banks, noted most districts continued to see an increase in economic activity, with the ""pace of growth characterized as slight to modest,"" while employment ""growth remained slow."" Inflation remained in check even though food and car prices increased.
More earnings are on deck, including airlines, and unemployment claims should show whether the recovery continues despite a new wave of virus cases that is swamping hospitals across the country.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow:
1. Earnings reports due out from Coca-Cola, American Airlines and others.
Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is expected to report earnings per share of 46 cents on revenue of $8.36 billion, as the beverage giant makes recent moves to streamline its brand offerings. 
 American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) is seen reporting a loss of $5.88 a share on revenue of $2.76 billion, while Southwest Airlines Company (NYSE:LUV) is seen reporting a loss of $2.35 a share on revenue of $1.7 billion.
2. Unemployment trend puts spotlight on recovery
Weekly unemployment claims are due out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Initial jobless claims are expected to be 860,000 last week compared to 898,000 the prior week, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. The number of initial claims has hovered around the upper 800,000 range for several weeks since August, suggesting companies continue to struggle with reopening. 
Continuing claims are expected to be 9.5 million for the week, an improvement from more than 10 million the prior week.
3. Fed officials take to the speech circuit
A couple of Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to appear on the speech circuit. Dallas Fed chief Robert Kaplan will speak around 1:00 PM ET (1700 GMT) while the Richmond Fed's Thomas Barkin has a speech at 6:00 PM ET (2200 GMT). Fed officials in recent weeks have talked about the need for additional stimulus to see the economy through a recovery from Covid interruptions. But lawmakers on Capitol Hill are still in a stalemate, with hopes fading for an agreement before the election.

Investing.com – The Dow struggled for direction Wednesday as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was optimistic over a stimulus package, though flagged Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell as a likely stumbling block to getting a deal over the line before the U.S. election.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.35%, or 98 points. The S&P 500 slipped 0.24%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.28%.
Pelosi said she is optimistic ""over the prospect"" of an agreement, though admitted that President Donald Trump would likely have to sway McConnell to back the deal, Politico reported, citing Pelosi's comments on Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI).
McConnell previously expressed little desire to back a large stimulus package, preferring to roll out a $500 billion skinny relief bill. The Senate GOP, however, failed to garner enough votes to advance Wednesday as Democrats voted against the legislation. 
The latest remarks on a deal come amid mostly positive news on the vaccine front. 
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) are set to resume their U.S. trials this week, Bloomberg News reported. AstraZeneca did, however, report that a volunteer in its Covid-19 vaccine trial in Brazil had died. Brazilian health authorities will allow the trial to continue as the volunteer was not part of the cohort that received the vaccine, according to media reports.      
The downside in the broader market was kept in check by a jump in communication services as social media stocks followed  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) higher.
Snap surged 28% after the social media company reported a surprise quarterly profit, led by a jump in user growth. The better-than-expected performance prompted Wedbush Securities to suggest that growth is likely to continue into Q4.
While Snap did not provide guidance, management did note that ""revenue growth between 47 – 50% appears attainable, and the implied revenue figure of roughly $825 – 841 million is well above our prior estimate of $710 million and the prior consensus figure of $728 million,"" Wedbush said.
""Management also expects total DAUs of approximately 257 million, vs. our prior estimate of 255 million and prior consensus of 250 million,"" Wedbush added and raised its price target on the stock to $34.50 from $25.
Snap's bullish results pointed to signs of robust ad spending and triggered a surge in Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Elsewhere on the earnings front, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fell 7% after third-quarter profit and subscriber growth fell short of estimates as pull-forward demand seen earlier in the year faded.
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), meanwhile, fell more than 3%, despite reporting quarterly results that topped Wall Street estimates. 

Energy was among the biggest losers intraday, paced by a fall in oil prices as data showing a draw in U.S. weekly inventories was overshadowed by ongoing fears about demand weakness amid rising Covid-19 infections."

988,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>",Abu Dhabi's IPIC drops lawsuit against Goldman Sachs over 1MDB scandal,"(Reuters) - Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC) said on Wednesday that it was dropping a lawsuit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc (N:GS) to recover losses suffered from the U.S. investment bank's dealings with Malaysian state fund 1MDB.
The lawsuit had alleged that Goldman conspired with unidentified people from Malaysia to bribe its two former executives - former IPIC managing director Khadem Abdulla al-Qubaisi and Mohamed Ahmed Badawy al-Husseiny, former CEO of Aabar, an IPIC unit - to further their business at its expense.
Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala Investment Co, which controls IPIC, had suspended business dealings with Goldman after the lawsuit.
""Following collaborative discussions, the International Petroleum Investment Company is dismissing its lawsuit against Goldman Sachs, related to issues regarding 1MDB,"" IPIC said in an e-mailed statement on Wednesday. 
Goldman did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
The scandal dates back to the government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, which set up the 1MDB fund in 2009. The Justice Department estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014. 
Malaysia in September dropped criminal charges against three Goldman units after the bank agreed to pay $3.9 billion to settle the probe.
The investment bank has been investigated by regulators in at least 14 countries, including the United States, Malaysia and Singapore, for what its leadership did and did not know about the transactions.
Goldman is expected to settle with U.S. authorities later this week, resolving a probe into the bank's role in underwriting three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5 billion for Malaysia's government. 

According to the U.S. Justice Department, Goldman earned $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 advanced slightly on Wednesday in volatile trading as investors tracked Washington negotiations for a fresh coronavirus stimulus package and appeared skeptical a deal would be reached before the Nov. 3 U.S. elections.
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were scheduled to talk at 230 PM EDT (1830 GMT) about details of a relief package that Democrats want be in the range of $2.2 trillion.
Pelosi, who over the weekend had set a Tuesday deadline for an agreement, said she hoped to resolve the ""appropriations piece"" of the aid bill Wednesday. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell does not want to bring a large coronavirus aid bill to the Senate floor before the election, a senior Republican aide said.
""The market's maybe finally realizing it's not happening or if it does happen its going to happen after the election,"" said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut.
But investors were taking that prospect in their stride as a pre-election agreement has been in question for some time. 
""We're not seeing a lot of panic or fear. Apathy is a good description,"" said O'Rourke. 
At 2:25 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.13 points, or 0%, to 28,308.92, the S&P 500 gained 5.71 points, or 0.17%, to 3,448.83 and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.02 points, or 0.07%, to 11,524.51.
Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with Energy leading the percentage decliners.
Instead of plowing money into the market broadly, O' Rourke said investors picked stocks as they looked at results coming out of the third-quarter financial reporting season.
Of the major industry sectors communications services was the biggest gainer, up nearly 2%, after Snapchat messaging app owner  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) beat user growth and revenue forecasts, as more people signed up to chat with friends and family during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The results boosted the shares of social media companies  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), up around 5%, and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), up around 8%, helped lift the communications services sector along with a 2.7% rise for Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. Smaller social media firm Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc was up 8%.
Dampening the mood, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) was down more than 6% after it kicked off earnings from the Big Tech club. The video streaming service missed expectations for subscriber growth as competition increased and live sports returned to television.
Of the 84 S&P 500 firms that have reported third-quarter results, 85.7% have topped expectations for earnings, according to IBES Refinitiv data.
After touching a one month high early, Wall Street's fear gauge edged lower in afternoon trading.
Investors were also worried ahead of the elections. 
Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden will face off in their second and final debate on Thursday night, with Biden leading the race, according to national polls.
Indexes changed little after the U.S. central bank's ""Beige Book"" report, a snapshot of the economy gleaned from discussions with business contacts, showed that employment increased in almost all districts, though growth remained slow.
Electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc rose 1.4% as investors geared up for its quarterly report after the closing bell.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.42-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.38-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new highs and 28 new lows.

990,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 02:40PM ET</span>","As U.S. election odds narrow, market analysts factor in higher risks","LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A higher risk of a split U.S. Congress and a contested election is being factored into some market analysts' models after some odds on the Presidential election have shown a narrowing. 
European betting exchange Paddypower said on Wednesday that while Biden was clearly ""odds-on"" to win, over the last few days ""punters have started backing Trump again."" 
According to Real Clear Politics' presidential election results betting odds from Sept. 30 through Oct. 12, the probability of a Biden win increased, but have more recently slipped.
Paddypower gives Biden a more than 60% chance of winning, versus Trump at around 40%, and says that the odds have narrowed. 
Analysts at JPM said in a note on Tuesday that risk markets in the first two weeks of October were supported by a widening of U.S. presidential odds, implying a lower probability of a close or contested election, but over the past week, those odds started narrowing again. 
That could pressure risk markets with negative implications for the so-called ""value trade,"" which is seeing a steepening yield curve and prospective shift towards traditional cyclical stocks like banks, said the JPM analysts. 
Brown Brothers Harriman said in a note on Wednesday that with control of the Senate ""very much at stake, there is still a large chance we get the most fiscally conservative outcome for this election,"" with the chance of a Biden victory with a Republican Senate, and no large stimulus package coming after the election. 
RBC equity derivatives strategist Amy Wu Silverman wrote last week that the options market may have ""come too far in the other direction"" in pricing in a Blue Wave and was underpricing the possibility of a Trump victory.

Predictit odds https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/4366/Which-party-will-control-the-Senate-after-2020-election on U.S. Senate control show that while the chances of a Democratic Senate exceed that for Republicans, the odds of GOP control have ticked up slightly recently.

Investing.com – The Dow struggled for direction Wednesday, as investors mulled the latest progress on stimulus and a jump in social media stocks led by Snap following strong results.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.07%, or 20 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.35%, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.32%.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she is optimistic ""over the prospect"" of an agreement, though admitted that President Donald Trump would likely have to sway Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell to back the deal, Politico reported, citing Pelosi's comments on Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI).
Getting a stimulus deal over the line would ""really be up to whether the president can convince Mitch McConnell to do so,"" Pelosi said, according to the report.
McConnell has previously expressed little desire to back a large stimulus package, preferring to roll out a $500 billion skinny relief bill that includes fiscal relief to Americans and small businesses. The Senate GOP failed to advance their $500 billion relief package after Democrats voted against the bill.   
The latest remarks on a deal come just a day after Pelosi conceded that differences over state and local funding, as well as language over insurance liability continued to weigh on talks.
Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are set for talks at 2.30 ET on Wednesday.
The malaise in the broader market was kept in check by a jump in communication services as social media stocks followed  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) higher.
Snap surged 31% after the social media company reported a surprise quarterly profit, led by a jump in user growth. The better-than-expected performance prompted  Wedbush Securities to suggest that growth is likely to continue into Q4.
While Snap did not provide guidance, management did note that ""revenue growth between 47 – 50% appears attainable, and the implied revenue figure of roughly $825 – 841 million is well above our prior estimate of $710 million and the prior consensus figure of $728 million,"" Wedbush said.
""Management also expects total DAUs of approximately 257 million, vs. our prior estimate of 255 million and prior consensus of 250 million,"" Wedbush added and raised its price target on the stock to $34.50 from $25.
Snap's bullish results pointed to signs of robust ad spending and triggered a surge in Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Elsewhere on the earnings front, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fell 6% after the social media company's third-quarter profit and subscriber growth fell short of estimates as pull-forward demand seen earlier in the year faded.
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), meanwhile, fell more than 2%, despite reporting quarterly results that topped Wall Street estimates. 
Energy was among the biggest losers intraday, paced by a fall in oil prices as data showing a draw in US weekly inventories was overshadowed by ongoing fears about demand weakness amid rising Covid-19 infections."
992,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 02:18PM ET</span>","Left Behind in Rally, 21% of Russell 3000 Trades Below Book","(Bloomberg) -- Take a peek under the hood of the Russell 3000 Index and in one way it looks more like it’s in a bear market than the bull that has been raging since March.
About one in five companies within the benchmark still trades below book value, even with the index hovering near all-time highs. Before the pandemic, the number had only been higher during the depths of major market routs over the past 25 years.
It’s the latest sign of how uneven the stock market’s recovery has been since the index plunged 35% to a low in March. The discounted valuations signal that many investors remain concerned that a lot of companies may not recover from the coronavirus pandemic anytime soon.
“This is emblematic of our K-shaped recovery,” Georgetown University finance professor James Angel said. “Some companies like Big Tech are doing well and pulling up the broad market-cap weighted indices. However, large swaths of the economy are still hurting very badly. Anything related to crowds or travel -- restaurants, hotels, airlines, theme parks -- is suffering.”
During a market rout, it’s not uncommon for pessimistic investors to push companies’ market capitalizations below their book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities. What’s striking in this case is how many companies remain below book value even after a full recovery from the bear market earlier this year. The rally has swollen valuations for other companies, pushing the entire index to more than 3.6 times book, near the highest since the dot-com bubble.
Among the 633 companies in the Russell 3000 that are trading below book are household names like Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp., Cinemark Holdings (NYSE:CNK) Inc., Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Macy’s Inc. and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The figure is down from a high of 948 at the end of the March quarter but still almost double the 321 companies trading at a discount to book when the year began.
At the very least, trading at a discount to book value may be a sign that there has been substantial impairment in the value of a company’s assets. Yet it can also mean the market no longer see a viable business model at play.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if there are some companies that are going to struggle to get back to pre-pandemic levels,” UBS equity strategist David Lefkowitz said. Covid-19 has permanently altered some businesses with the acceleration of digital trends -- a phenomenon some companies have found easier to adapt to than others, he said. “There may be a subset of companies that have a really hard time recovering.”
While a price-to-book ratio can provide a meaningful reference point, many investors pay it less mind these days. Some high-tech companies tend not to own a lot of assets, which inflates their valuation under this metric. And  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) mid-cap analyst Scott Chronert said his firm has steered away from it since the 2008 financial crisis, when the need for companies to write down the value of assets distorted its usefulness. As such, when looking for buying opportunities, it’s important to consider both company- and sector-specific explanations for a low ratio, Chronert said.
The two sectors with the most companies priced below book are financials and energy. Within those industries, most should be able to cleanly recover along with the global economy, Chronert said. But for others, the concern is greater.
“The shutdown around the pandemic is going to end up teaching us a lot about different companies and their responses,” Chronert said. “You’re going to have companies that haven’t been able to restructure or have been unwilling to.”

996,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 01:15PM ET</span>",Ant Group to launch $35 billion IPO after final nod from China regulator,"By Colin Qian, Julie Zhu and Meg Shen
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Ant Group has won the final nod from the country's top securities watchdog for the registration of its Shanghai offering, the regulator said on Wednesday, clearing the last regulatory hurdle for its $35 billion dual-listing.
Ant, the fintech company backed by Chinese e-commerce group  Alibaba  Group Holding (N:BABA), plans to list simultaneously in Hong Kong and Shanghai in the coming weeks, sources have said.
The listing could be the world's largest initial public offering, surpassing the record set by  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222)'s $29.4 billion float last December. The IPO would also be the first simultaneous listing in Hong Kong and on the year-old STAR Market in Shanghai.
Ant is set to conduct price consultations for the Shanghai offering on Oct 23 and will set the price on Oct 27 as per its updated prospectus filed with the local exchange. 
The fintech group aims to split the share offering evenly between Hong Kong and Shanghai, selling up to 1.67 billion on each exchange. That would represent up to 11% of its enlarged share capital, before a 15% greenshoe or over-allotment option is exercised, the prospectus showed. 
Strategic investors who agree to accept a 12-month lock-up on investments in Ant's STAR IPO will account for 80% of the domestic float. Among them are Zhejiang Tmall Technology, a wholly-owned unit of Alibaba, which has committed to purchasing 730 million shares, according to the prospectus.
The share sale plan comes after the China Securities Regulatory Commission accepted the registration of Ant's [IPO-ANTG.HK] domestic float on the Nasdaq-style STAR Market, as part of the local rules. The company filed its preliminary prospectus in late August.
Proceeds will be used partly to support Ant's digital economy business and to enhance its research and development capabilities. 
Ant, China's biggest mobile payments company, reported an operating income of 118.2 billion yuan ($17.78 billion) in the nine-months to September, up 42.6% from year earlier, as per the prospectus. 
Nine-month gross profit rose 74.3% to 69.5 billion yuan.
Hangzhou-based Ant on Monday also won approval from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for the offshore leg of its IPO, Reuters has reported.
For the Hong Kong leg, Ant plans to start a brief pre-marketing period this week before opening order books next week. Its shares are likely to start trading a few days after the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, sources have said.
After receiving initial feedback from potential investors, Ant is looking to increase its offering size to $35 billion from up to $30 billion, targeting a valuation of about $250 billion or more, Reuters has reported.
If completed, Ant's IPO would significantly burnish Hong Kong's status as a capital markets hub, with $28.8 billion worth of IPOs and secondary listings between the start of this year and mid-October, Refinitiv data showed.
That helped Hong Kong to take the second spot in the global stock exchange league table - after Nasdaq - despite fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and anti-government protests.
Ant does not plan to offer a cornerstone tranche in Hong Kong in anticipation of strong demand from institutional investors, Reuters has reported.

Andrew Pearse, Detelina Subeva and Surjan Singh, who helped arrange the loans to Mozambique, all pleaded guilty in the United States last year to charges including conspiracy to violate U.S. anti-bribery laws and to commit money laundering and securities fraud in relation to their role in the affair. 
Lawyers for the three bankers did not immediately respond to requests for comment or could not immediately be reached.
Mozambique would now seek their extradition after the country's Supreme Court granted approval for the Attorney General's Office to do so, a representative of the AGO told Reuters via WhatsApp. 
They said following the approval, the next steps would be to go through with the extradition request according to procedure, but did not elaborate on what that meant. 
The representative also did not immediately answer further questions about whether the three bankers had been charged with any crimes in Mozambique, though a report in state-owned newspaper Noticias said the government wants the trio to come to the country to face unspecified criminal charges. 
Hundreds of millions of dollars of the loans the bankers helped arrange went missing. The scandal prompted donors including the International Monetary Fund to cut off support to Mozambique, triggering a currency collapse and debt default. 
The southeast African nation remains on the hook for the money. It has charged a number of people in Mozambique with crimes in relation to the scandal, and is trying to get government guarantees for some of the loans overturned in court.

""We are continuing discussions,"" GM President Mark Reuss said during a conference call with analysts. 
A partnership with Nikola presents ""a big opportunity for us"" to bring fuel cell technology developed by GM and Honda (T:7267) to market in Class 7 and 8 commercial trucks, Reuss said.
GM and Nikola also are discussing a deal under which Nikola would pay GM to build its Badger electric pickup, Reuss said. GM and Nikola in September outlined a deal that would give GM emissions credits from sales of the Nikola Badger, as well as $750 million to fund tooling for production.

Investing.com -- The car market is back with a vengeance, and so is AutoNation (NYSE:AN).
The country's largest auto dealer chain posted record profit in the third quarter, pulling in adjusted earnings per share of $2.38 on revenue of $5.4 billion. Both numbers topped consensus of $1.65 and $5.19 billion, respectively.
Shares jumped as much as 10% before halving those gains as the broader market pulled back.
“It’s our absolute best quarter ever,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said on CNBC. ""The demand for individual mobility has gone through the roof, and I think this pandemic/shelter in place has shifted the American psyche in a long-term way, and it’s hard to predict past five years, but for the next three to five years, there’s been a shift in demand,"" he added.
Jackson pointed to increased demand for both new and used vehicles, and noted that low interest rates are making car-buying more attractive.
Along with the rebound in car sales, AutoNation was able to keep costs under control. The company said SG&A as a percentage of gross profit came in at 64.4%, which was an 800 basis-point improvement over the same period a year ago.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>",United States vs Google vindicates old antitrust gripes from Microsoft,"By Paresh Dave
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - The U.S. government's antitrust suit against Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google on Tuesday could deliver a huge opportunity for  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) to increase usage of its Bing search engine, an unexpected epilogue years after it abandoned a long campaign for legal relief. 
From at least 2007 through 2015, Microsoft lobbied lawmakers, funded private lawsuits, commissioned opposition research and academic papers and even ran TV commercials, all with the aim of getting regulators to bar what it viewed as anticompetitive practices by Google. 
Codenamed ""Appendix A"" inside Microsoft, the campaign failed to change Google's behavior or boost Bing's market share, according to current and former Microsoft officials involved in the effort. Satya Nadella killed Appendix A by cutting funding and staff when he took over as chief executive in 2015, the sources said. 
Yet, the concerns once expressed by Microsoft underlie the Justice Department's new case. 
Google cornered the web search and search ads markets by paying billions of dollars to smartphone makers, wireless carriers and browser makers to promote its search engine and penalizing them for showcasing rivals, the government alleges. 
Google denied the claims in the lawsuit and called it ""deeply flawed.""
The complaint quotes a Google executive as saying without the ""really important"" penalties, Bing could have stolen away the widespread promotion Google enjoyed. Another Google staffer is quoted as noting Google's promotional deals with browsers are ""a good way to keep [a browser] away from Bing.""
About 80% of U.S. web searches go through distribution points that Google now owns or controls, leaving Bing with about 7% of the market as the closest competitor, the lawsuit says.
Though Google said it is prepared to fight the lawsuit for years, the filing of the complaint is likely to motivate its search engine rivals to newly invest in improving their technology and challenging Google's various restrictions to gain greater distribution, technology and legal experts said. 
And if Microsoft's response to a government antitrust lawsuit twenty years ago is any guide, Google may move more cautiously against rivals while the case plays out. 
""Markets work better when firms know there is a sheriff in town,"" said Chris Sagers, law professor at Cleveland State University.
Sridhar Ramaswamy, a former Google executive who now runs Neeva, which is developing a paid, privacy-focused search engine, said that ""we hope the DOJ's actions will create a more equal playing field for search apps like Neeva that want to create real options for customers.""
Microsoft declined to comment for this story. It has answered questions about Google from investigators in several countries over the last two years, according to public records, but has not been proactively bashing Google, two academics and two attorneys once retained for anti-Google work said.
APPENDIX A
The Appendix A effort dated back to Microsoft's frustration with Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, or less than what Microsoft had offered, one source said. 
Then-CEO Steve Ballmer organized a handful of people to understand Google's strategy and fight the deal, which regulators approved over Microsoft's objections.
The codename, according to sources, referred to the section within a paper written by Google's co-founders in which they said ""advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.""
Microsoft tried to make a case to regulators and the public that Google hurt consumers by blocking them from alternatives and instead ironically providing low-quality search results because they were packed with ads.
Microsoft funded and managed anti-Google groups including FairSearch and Icomp, bringing on board other Google foes including  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) Group Inc,  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP) Inc, News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL), sources said.
Microsoft-backed websites, such as SafeCloud.org, promoted articles raising concerns about the security of Google cloud services, one source said. One Microsoft staffer focused on bonding with small business aggrieved by Google, two other sources said, with some of the operations subsisting off Microsoft funding. 
Political campaign strategist Mark Penn later joined in 2012 to produce the widely viewed ""Scroogled"" advertising campaign that criticized Google's privacy practices and its ad-heavy product searches. 
But when Nadella took Microsoft's reins, he expressed concern that fighting the industry darling that was Google had hurt his company's ability to hire, partner and attract new business, according to sources involved in the discussions. Nadella decommissioned the Appendix A team, cleared the air with Google, and began using Google-owned software to power Microsoft's internet browser and some mobile devices.

Bing's ad salespeople are among those inside that have agitated to renew anti-Google lobbying, sources said. 
Meanwhile, Oracle and those other Google critics picked up where Microsoft left off, and have focused over the last five years on Google's control over advertising technology used by publishers - a subject mostly left out of Tuesday's complaint. 
The Justice Department could introduce allegations related to Google's advertising technology as soon as next month, again benefitting Microsoft, according to sources briefed on the investigation.

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) has launched a restructuring of its commercial banking business in Britain, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday, resulting in around 300 job losses.
""In line with the Group strategy announced in February, we continue to restructure and review the roles required to transform the bank,"" a spokesman for HSBC said.
Europe's biggest bank in June resumed plans to cut around 35,000 jobs it had put on ice after the coronavirus outbreak, as Europe’s biggest bank grapples with the impact on its already falling profits.
Chief Executive Noel Quinn has said the moves are necessary to improve the banks profits, as economic forecasts point to a challenging time ahead for the Asia-focused lender.
HSBC's commercial banking business provides loans and other banking services mainly to small and medium-sized businesses.
The unit has in common with its rivals struggled in recent years to improve revenues amid rising competition and rock-bottom interest rates that squeeze the margins between deposits banks take in and loans they make to borrowers.

Mike Wilson, the bank’s chief U.S. equity strategist, said there’s a good chance markets could drop before the election and investors have recently grown complacent about the risks of a drawn-out legal battle between President Donald Trump and Democratic hopeful Joe Biden.
“If the S&P 500 were to go down to 3,100 index points and we didn’t know what was going on with the election yet, we’re going to be adding to risk at that point no matter what,” Wilson said in a phone interview.
That’s because no matter who wins the election, it’s almost a certainty that they’ll unleash more economic stimulus, which would drive asset prices higher, said Wilson, who correctly foresaw the September market pullback.
Morgan Stanley’s expectation is that the election will be decided by the Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 26, which leaves room for three weeks of uncertainty to rattle markets. Fears over another spike in Covid-19 cases, the unknown timing of a vaccine and stalled stimulus talks are also weighing on investor confidence, Wilson said.
“Markets might get more defensive,” before the election winner is declared, he said. “By the time the outcome is known, stock prices might already be lower.”
Worries over whether Biden will hike corporate taxes are overblown, Wilson said, adding that any increase probably wouldn’t go into effect until 2022 and the administration would prioritize fiscal stimulus. It’s unlikely that Democrats would push through tax legislation before June and a lot depends on the state of the economy, he said.
Raising the corporate tax rate to about 28% would only reduce S&P 500 earnings by about 6%, according to Morgan Stanley. By comparison,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). calculates that the profit hit would be roughly 9%.

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - The family owners of Italian fashion house Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER) have held informal talks with financial investors to sell a minority stake in their holding firm as they seek to turn around the luxury brand and cope with the fallout of COVID-19, five sources told Reuters.
The company's chairman Ferruccio Ferragamo, son of late founder Salvatore, held the discussions sometime after the summer, offering about a 20% stake in the holding vehicle that controls the Milan-listed business, banking and private equity sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter is confidential.
A spokeswoman for the company - which has a market value of 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) - denied that the Ferragamo family planned to sell the stake.
The sources told Reuters that the family is still in the preliminary stages of testing market appetite and that a deal might face resistance from investors since the family is not willing to give away any governance control.
Famous for shoes worn by Hollywood stars such as Audrey Hepburn, the Florentine leather goods brand saw its revenues plunge 60% in the second quarter, piling pressure on its family members - who control an overall 65% - to turn around the business.
""They have been calling around for a few months, targeting both private equity investors and sovereign wealth funds for a minority deal,"" one of the sources said.
A stake sale to deep-pocketed financial investors would help resolve internal disagreements over the company's turnaround strategy, allowing some of its family members to cash out, the sources said.
The heirs of founder Salvatore Ferragamo, including his four surviving children and several grandchildren, are all invested in Ferragamo Finanziaria SpA, which owns 54.3% of the company. Other family members hold an additional 10.7%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The new U.S. chief of the Inter-American Development Bank has nominated Reina Irene Mejia, chief executive of Citi Honduras, for the No. 2 job at Latin America's main development bank, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
IDB President Mauricio Claver-Carone, who took over on Oct. 1, is assembling a new leadership team that he promised would be both diverse and represent the smaller countries in the region, which have never held senior leadership positions at the bank.
If confirmed as executive vice president, Mejia would be the highest-ranking Latin American woman to ever serve at the IDB.
The IBD's 14-member board of executive directors will vote on the nomination next week, along with those of former Paraguayan finance minister Benigno Lopez, as vice president of sectors, and Richard Martinez, Ecuador's former finance minister, as vice president of countries, the sources said.
Both men resigned from their government positions this month.
A spokesman for the Bank declined to comment.
Mejia,  Citigroup  's (N:C) corporate and investment bank head for Honduras, joined the U.S. bank in 1996. She was the first Honduran woman appointed as CEO of Citi Honduras, and is the current president of the American/Honduran Chamber of Commerce.
One of the sources described Mejia as ""tough but diplomatic,"" and said she would complement well Claver-Carone, a Cuba hardliner and the first U.S. citizen ever elected to head the IDB in its 61-year history.
Claver-Carone has vowed to strengthen the Bank's funding base, increase transparency and build more unity in the region. He has pledged to serve only one five-year term as president.
Mejia's finance background could help assuage concerns raised about Claver-Carone's lack of banking experience. Before joining the IDB, Claver-Carone had served as U.S. President Donald Trump's senior Latin America adviser, advocating for greater U.S. public and private engagement in the region.
A source familiar with Claver-Carone's thinking said Mejia's extensive work with small- and medium-sized businesses that drive growth in the region - and her focus on female enterpreneurs would be beneficial as he seeks to reshape the bank and expand its capital base.
September's vote on Claver-Carone's nomination was contentious, pitting the Trump administration, which is keen to gain leverage in resource-rich Latin America and counter the rise of China, against Argentina and other regional powers loath to lose control of the lender's top job.
The bank has been led by Latin Americans since its inception in 1959, while the No. 2 position - functionally the bank's chief operating officer - has traditionally been held by a U.S. citizen. If confirmed, Mejia would replace John Scott, who is serving in that role on an interim basis.
In a blog published on Citi's website in 2016, Mejia said she earned both a bachelors degree in economics and an MBA in finance from Southern Illinois University, before joining Citi.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive of Amtrak will tell lawmakers on Wednesday the U.S. passenger railroad expects travel and revenue to fall by more than 70% from pre-coronavirus levels in 2021, as it considers more service and employee cuts.
The railroad projects just 9 million passenger trips and $598 million in revenue for the budget year that began Oct. 1, down from over 32 million trips and $2.35 billion in the 2019 budget year and $1.24 billion in the 2020 budget year that ended Sept. 30, according to testimony from Amtrak chief executive Bill Flynn reviewed by Reuters.
Ridership and revenue are still down more than 80% and Flynn will tell the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday that the budget forecasts assume ""an effective and widely-distributed vaccine becoming available by the middle of next calendar year – which we know is not a guaranteed outcome.""
The U.S. government-supported passenger railroad earlier this month warned that without a new government bailout it could be forced to cut more spending and train services that could lead to the loss of 2,400 jobs.
In September, Amtrak told Congress it needs up to $4.9 billion in government funding for the 2021 budget year, up from the $2 billion in annual support it usually receives.
Flynn will say on Wednesday that without government assistance Amtrak, which has already cut back on train services across the United States, may need to defer key aspects of a series of improvements in the New York City area and some New York Penn Station improvements.
In September, Amtrak said it was eliminating 100 management positions and furloughing 1,950 union employees as a result of the steep decline in revenue. 
U.S. transit and airline demand has been devastated by the pandemic.

In April, Congress gave Amtrak $1 billion in emergency assistance after daily ridership fell by 97%.

The Morgan Stanley HBCU Scholars program will fund the entire cost of attending Howard University, Morehouse College or Spelman College for students in any field of study. The bank has committed to spending $12 million on the program over four years. 
“This is about something much bigger than banking and Morgan Stanley,"" Chief Diversity Officer Susan Reid said in an interview. “This was about helping young adults of color who might not otherwise be able to afford college, regardless of whether they want to be a banker, or a doctor or a lawyer.""
The bank has also tapped its internal network of HBCU alumni to provide career readiness support to the selected students. 
The banking industry has been criticized for its lack of racial diversity since the May 25 death in police custody of George Floyd, a Black man, sparked demonstrations and prompted introspection at companies across the country.
In June, a former diversity officer sued Morgan Stanley alleging racial discrimination, retaliation and violation of equal pay laws, according to a court filing. The bank has rejected the allegations and said the firm will defend itself.
Last month, Morgan Stanley started recruiting for a new program that aims to add more black employees to its trading division.

Full-year employee benefit expenses were 284 million pounds ($371 million), a reduction of about 15% year-on-year, the northwest England-based company said in a statement Wednesday.
United reported a 19% drop in full-year revenue as the virus led to the postponement of matches, which later resumed behind closed doors, resulting in a loss of matchday income and the payment of rebates owed to broadcasters.

United’s shares, which are traded in New York, have given up much of the rebound posted in recent months. The city of Manchester faces some of the U.K.’s tightest social restrictions following a dispute between local leaders and the national government over financial assistance.
The release of the financial results came a day after the team’s 2-1 Champions League group stage win against Paris St-Germain, last year’s competition finalists, in the French capital.

1016,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 08:27AM ET</span>",Stock Pickers Are Getting an Edge Over Passive by Short Selling,"(Bloomberg) -- Active managers seeking respite after years of struggling to beat the market can still find an edge in at least one corner of Wall Street: Short selling.
The business of helping traders bet against companies benefits stock pickers more than passive funds in a few key ways, new research has shown. While both player types earn revenue from lending out shares, managers get an extra boost because they’re able to trade on information they glean in the process.
It’s refreshing evidence that old-school stock pickers can still get a leg up on index funds -- and vindication for those in the business who have been arguing the point for years.
“Funds that have greater portfolio allocation discretion -- namely active funds -- reallocate their portfolios away from stocks that are borrowed from them,” Pekka Honkanen of HEC Paris business school wrote in a paper. “This lending provides funds with not only additional revenue in the form of lending fees, but also valuable information.”
A combination of high fees and underperformance has fed a narrative that no one can beat the market over time, helping drive the global boom in passive investing. Yet when it comes to lending shares, Honkanen demonstrates the limitations of a passive approach.
Short sellers borrow stock to sell in the open market, with the aim of buying it back at a lower price and returning it to the lender.
Since index funds are mainly evaluated by their tracking error -- how much they deviate from the gauge they follow -- they don’t rebalance before or after lending shares. Their aim is simply to keep holdings as close to index weight as possible, meaning they can end up holding on to losers for a long time.

In contrast, when active funds see high demand from short sellers, they can unload the stock.
Honkanen estimates active U.S. mutual funds avoid losses of about 18% of the value of a position on average by rebalancing their portfolios away from equities that are borrowed from them. That saving is worth paying for, so they charge less to lend shares.
The silver lining for passive funds? They can earn more in fees. Shorters may even prefer borrowing shares from them since they can’t trade on the information, according to Honkanen.
“To this end, I show that passive funds are more likely to participate in the lending market than active funds,” he wrote.
Honkanen studied U.S. stock and fund data over 16 years through 2017, and used more than 450,000 observations in that period. His paper arrives shortly after a trio of academics at Virginia Tech published a similar piece of research.
While some of their observations differed -- their sample period was 2006 and 2007, just before the financial crisis -- the ultimate conclusion was the same.
“Participation in the lending market appears to be a viable avenue to both gain additional revenue and receive meaningful signals about future returns,” Fan Li, Andrew MacKinlay and Pengfei Ye of Virginia Tech wrote. “Active equity funds, on average, are informed lenders.”

The move comes at a time when the casino magnate's actions are being scrutinised amid an inquiry into whether Crown should be allowed to operate its A$2.2 billion ($1.56 billion) casino tower in Sydney just months before its scheduled opening.
Packer had earlier this month acknowledged that Crown, in which he holds a 35% stake through his private firm Consolidated Press Holdings (CPH), published false statements by distancing itself from ""junket"" tour operators which brought in gamblers, largely from China.
Media reports had earlier alleged that gamblers serviced by Crown had ties to organised crime.
Crown said in Wednesday's statement it had also terminated a July 2016 services agreement which allowed it to request services by key CPH executives at pre-agreed hourly rates.
The company is set to host its annual general meeting on Thursday.

1019,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 08:16AM ET</span>",Verizon profit beats estimates on remote working boost,"(Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) beat estimates for third-quarter profit on Wednesday, helped by strong demand for its phone and internet services as offices and schools continued to operate virtually amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The health crisis has brought global economies to a halt, but the telecom sector has been relatively less affected. With lockdowns easing, Verizon gradually reopened all of its company-operated retail stores in the quarter, implementing touch-less retail, appointments and curbside pickups.
Verizon added 283,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the third quarter, above the average estimate of 268,000, according to research firm FactSet.
Total operating revenue fell 4.1% to $31.54 billion, which the company attributed to lower customer activity and the timing of certain device launches.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of Verizon's key partners, has delayed the launch of its new iPhones by about a month this year.
Revenue in Verizon's media unit, which includes Yahoo, HuffPost and TechCrunch, declined 7.4% in the quarter to $1.7 billion from a year earlier as companies cut down on advertising to rein in expenses.
Net income fell to $4.50 billion, or $1.05 per share in the quarter, from $5.34 billion, or $1.25 per share a year earlier, with about 5 cents of COVID-19-related net impact, Verizon said.
Excluding items, Verizon earned $1.25 per share, above analysts' average estimate of $1.22.

The company also said it now expects full-year 2020 adjusted EPS growth of 0% to 2%. Its prior guidance range was -2% to 2%.

The new role marks a further step in the company's efforts to address an issue facing all global fashion brands in recent years as consumers, diverse in themselves, become more aware and demanding regarding representation of minorities. 
Prada, Gucci and Dolce & Gabbana have been criticized in the past for products and advertisements that some consumer groups deemed inappropriate. Some Italian fashion houses have been criticised in recent years for creating products deemed racist, including Gucci's 2019 ""Blackface"" sweater, with a mouth cut out and trimmed in red, and a keychain of a monkey with inflated lips by Prada in late 2018. 
In 2018 also, Dolce & Gabbana was forced to cancel a marquee show in Shanghai in the wake of an advertising campaign that was slammed for depicting Chinese women in a racist way. 
Savell, previously director of cultural diversity- partnerships & engagement at French luxury giant LVMH (PA:LVMH), will be responsible for developing policies to ensure diverse representation of cultures and perspectives across the group.

She will work closely with Prada's Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Council, created last year after the brand was accused of racism in relation to some of its products in late 2018.

Separately, the company said its Chief Financial Officer Michael Ptasznik will retire effective February 28 and named Ann Dennison to the role. Dennison is currently the company's senior vice president, controller and chief accounting officer.

Net income attributable to the company rose to $264 million, or $1.58 per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $150 million, or 90 cents per share, a year earlier.
Revenue from information services, Nasdaq's biggest non-trading business, rose 20% to $238 million.
Higher trading volumes helped boost the company's market services unit, its biggest business. Revenue in the segment jumped about 39% to $958 million.
Excluding transaction-based expenses, revenue rose 13% to $715 million, above Refinitiv IBES estimates of $690.92 million.

1022,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>",U.S. banks sweat regulatory exposure from pandemic loans,"By Lawrence Delevingne, Koh Gui Qing and Michelle Price
BOSTON/NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Banks that facilitated the U.S. government's Paycheck Protection Program at first saw the effort as a small revenue booster with a patriotic bonus, shepherding $525 billion in loans to businesses slammed by the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
But as taxpayers begin to take on the cost of forgiving those loans, lenders like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), are girding for what is likely to be years of regulatory scrutiny for their role in doling out the money, according to industry insiders, securities filings and government watchdogs. 
“The sense of anxiety is high,” said Vivian Merker, a management consultant to financial services firms at Oliver Wyman in New York. “They are gearing up for years of requests from regulators and there’s still reputational risk from PPP fraud even if they did all the right things to follow program rules.”
Banks participating in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) issued more than 5.2 million loans, to be repaid by the government as long as borrowers demonstrated financial need and used most of the cash to make payroll. 
Fraud by borrowers popped up almost as quickly as the program, overseen by the Small Business Administration (SBA), began in April. The Department of Justice has so far brought charges against 82 individuals in 56 cases for around $250 million in loans, according to a review by the Project On Government Oversight. 
So far, the burden on lenders has mostly been administrative. One veteran attorney who advises major banks on compliance matters said clients were responding to as many as 20 law enforcement subpoenas a week, producing documents and making employees available for interviews. 
There is increasing concern, though, that the lenders themselves will face legal challenges over PPP, already leading to internal compliance reviews, investor warnings and even the outright sale of loan portfolios, according to public statements and people familiar with the situation.
At least four banks have warned investors in shareholder filings about PPP regulatory and legal risk. Bank of America, for example, said in a July filing that its participation in government stimulus programs “could result in reputational harm and government actions and proceedings, and has resulted in, and may continue to result in, litigation, including class actions.”
""We fully cooperate with government inquiries,"" said Bill Halldin, a  Bank Of America  spokesperson. 
POSSIBLE HAZARDS
Among the possible hazards, experts have pointed to potential violations of the program's first-come, first-served application rules, disadvantaging minority-owned and women-owned businesses; maintaining adequate documentation, especially for loan forgiveness applications; and abiding by broader ""know your customer"" rules, which could have spotted more fraud. 
Congress passed the $2.2-trillion Cares Act bailout in March which included nearly $350 billion for PPP loans, with the pot later increasing. 
Under pressure to get the cash out the door fast, banks were initially concerned they would be taking on too much liability, even if they stood to earn origination fees of up to 5%, and 1% interest payments on government-guaranteed loans. Lenders secured a promise from the government that they would not be held responsible if borrowers broke the program rules.
An October congressional report said that several lenders, including JPMorgan, PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) and Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC) Corp, processed larger PPP loans for wealthy customers at two to four times the speed of smaller loans for the neediest small businesses. 
It also said some banks limited their PPP loan programs to existing customers.
That decision, the report said, had a disproportionately adverse effect on women-owned and minority-owned businesses, because they are less likely to have pre-existing banking relationships, according to U.S. Federal Reserve data. Depending on the circumstances, policies that hurt such “protected” groups - even if inadvertently - can violate fair lending rules. 
Citing an internal April presentation, the report said that  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) identified the negative effect on these businesses as a possible compliance risk, but decided to initially prioritize existing customers because demand was high and it required less manual intervention. Citi declined to comment.
A Truist spokesman said that it handled PPP applications through a single portal on a first-come, first-served basis, ""without any preference to larger or more affluent clients.""
JPMorgan declined to comment. PNC did not respond to requests for comment.
Bank groups pushed back on the House report. The Consumer Bankers Association said lenders were denied waivers that would have made it easier to lend to new borrowers, and that larger borrowers had dedicated staff and documentation that accelerated their applications. 
""When Congress, the SBA and Treasury designed the Paycheck Protection Program they prioritized getting money into the hands of small businesses very quickly, issuing confusing and changing operational and legal guidance for banks,"" said Greg Baer, CEO of the Bank Policy Institute.
REVIEWING PPP LOANS 
People familiar with the situation say that virtually every large PPP lender, including JPMorgan, Citi, Truist and KeyBank, conducted standard internal reviews to spot violations by their own employees of program rules. 
“As we participate in efforts to make critical government stimulus programs available ... we continue to execute on our controls to identify, address and report fraud,” a Truist spokesman told Reuters via email.
KeyBank declined to comment.
Wells Fargo said in a May filing that it had received ""formal and informal inquiries from federal and state governmental agencies regarding its offering of PPP loans.” 
Wells Fargo spokesman Manny Venegas said the filing was referring to industry-wide inquiries from regulators over PPP fraud, which the bank had worked to spot and report. He declined to comment on whether the probes also concerned bank employees or processes. 
Regulators have signaled there’s much more to come. The SBA plans to review PPP loans over $2 million and its inspector general recently said there were ""strong indicators of widespread potential abuse and fraud.""
A recent U.S. House committee analysis found tens of thousands of PPP loans could be subject to fraud, waste, or abuse, including more than $1 billion in multiple loans to the same company, a violation of program rules. 
James Stevens, an attorney who advises lenders at Troutman Pepper in Atlanta, said banks did their best to get money to needy small businesses, but that fast-changing program rules created “fertile ground” for fraud and internal errors.

""Regulatory scrutiny of banks is always in hindsight,"" Stevens said. ""It's going to come.""

1023,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Tesla and Heinz Hit Brexit Snag When Customs Capacity Runs Out,"(Bloomberg) -- Household-name companies including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co. are racing to avoid a Brexit crisis at year-end, as a shortage of customs brokers threatens their ability to move goods between Britain and the European Union.
The carmaker and ketchup producer are among firms that have struggled to find contractors to help fill out the wave of new paperwork that will apply to U.K.-EU trade from 2021, according to a person familiar with the matter. Customs agents are running out of their capacity to meet demand due to Brexit, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential matters.
Shortages of customs brokers and agents is a major headache for big business and the U.K. government’s Brexit preparations because goods without the right paperwork will not be allowed to cross borders from Jan. 1, when Britain quits the EU’s single market and customs union. An additional 400 million customs declarations are expected to be required annually on U.K.-EU trade, at a cost of about 13 billion pounds ($17 billion), even if the two sides sign a trade deal.
“We are working at speed to ensure all necessary readiness plans are in place,” Heinz said in an emailed statement. “As part of our preparations we are considering both internal and external customs support options.” The maker of Heinz ketchup and Philadelphia cream cheese said it’s confident it will fulfill necessary requirements.
Representatives for Tesla in Europe and the U.S. didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Agents Shortage
The logistics industry has predicted 50,000 more customs agents are needed to handle the extra paperwork for Brexit. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove was asked several times in Parliament this week how many have been trained. He declined to give a figure.
“It is a matter for the market,” he said on Monday in the House of Commons. HM Revenue & Customs, the U.K.’s tax authority, also declined to say how many new agents are ready when contacted by Bloomberg News. The government has made 84 million pounds in grants available for customs training, but HMRC declined to comment on how much of that has been drawn down.
The civil servant leading the government’s border Brexit preparations, Emma Churchill, told lawmakers earlier this month that the grants had funded 20,000 customs training courses. The system has been hampered by slow and complex bureaucratic procedures to access the funds, according to a person familiar with the program. Some participants in the courses were already working in the industry, the person said.
Lacking Logistics
Capacity for logistics companies is so limited that several of the world’s biggest firms are turning down Brexit work because they are sold out.
A.P. Moller-Maersk, the Danish shipping giant, is rejecting potential clients while Kuehne + Nagel International AG, the Swiss freight group, is only accepting customs work from businesses for which it carries cargo.
Rosslyn Data Technologies Plc, which provides software that allows companies to file their own customs declarations, said it has seen a fivefold increase in inquiries in recent weeks, but the company has had to turn away some prospective clients whose demands are too complex.
Sam Blakeman, a sales manager at Rosslyn, said businesses have been putting off implementing Brexit solutions because they have been waiting for the outcome of the trade talks, not realizing the paperwork will be required regardless.
“That penny seems to be dropping,” said Blakeman, who described the silence on the other end of the phone this week when he told a major company that he wouldn’t be able to take on their work. “There was a ‘Have we left this too late?’ realization.”

At a board meeting on Tuesday, Black requested that the board's conflicts committee, which comprises independent board members, retain outside counsel to conduct a ""thorough review"" of the information that he had brought forward about his relationship with Epstein, Apollo said in a regulatory filing.
The board committee has appointed law firm Dechert LLP to conduct the review.
Black told Apollo's investors in a letter on Monday that he regretted having had links to Epstein, but denied any wrongdoing or inappropriate conduct related to his business and social relationship with Epstein.
Black told the firm's investors that he wired between $50 million and $75 million to Epstein as far back as 2008. In the letter, Black said that Epstein provided ""professional services"" to his family partnership and related family entities, involving estate planning, tax and philanthropic advice.
In the latest filing, Black said Epstein never did any business with Apollo.
""In light of continued attention, it is in the best interests of Apollo, our employees, our shareholders and our LPs for there to be an independent review,"" Black said in the filing.
""Proceeding in this manner is the best way to assure all of our stakeholders that they have all of the relevant facts, and I look forward to cooperating fully.""

Epstein, who was charged by federal prosecutors with sex trafficking last year, committed suicide in his New York City jail cell in August 2019, before his trial.

1025,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>",Analysis: Green is the color of money for funds betting on a Biden win,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fund managers betting that green-type stocks with environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials will benefit from an expected win by Democrat Joe Biden in the U.S. presidential election are also looking at a swathe of other companies expected to rise along with them. 
Portfolio managers from firms including Gabelli, Fairpointe Capital and   Eaton  Vance  (NYSE:EV) are moving into the shares of companies ranging from semiconductors to industrial equipment to utilities in anticipation of a future Biden administration. The former vice president leads President Trump by 10 points nationally.
Biden has proposed spending https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-climate-change-factbox/factbox-on-climate-its-bidens-green-revolution-versus-trumps-war-on-red-tape-idUSKBN2622NG $2 trillion over his first four-year term to combat climate change, including upgrading buildings for energy efficiency and installing more than 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030. 
That has boosted a number of stocks and ETFs from solar to clean energy. The Invesco Solar ETF (P:TAN) has risen nearly 20% so far this month, the VanEck Vectors Low Carbon Energy ETF (P:SMOG) is up 11.3%, and the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (O:ICLN) is up 14.4%. ​""If there is a blue sweep and it empowers Democrats to put through a significant fiscal stimulus, you would expect a fair amount of that would have ESG-friendly initiatives,"" said Chris Dyer, director of global equity at Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Vance. ""Some of those stocks that benefit might not be traditional ESG stocks."" 
Among his portfolio holdings is French electrical equipment group Schneider Electric SE (PA:SCHN), which sells products ranging from electrical car chargers to home automation systems. He sees upside in those shares which are up less than 3% over the past month - far less than some of the clean energy and solar companies.
""We're looking for companies that are involved in the renovation of buildings and new buildings that are particularly geared into energy efficiency,"" he said. 
Overall, ESG funds have taken in a net of nearly $21 billion in new flows through the second quarter of this year, just under the annual record of $21.4 billion in inflows notched last year, according to Morningstar data. 
That popularity will likely increase during a Biden administration, pushing share prices higher among companies that are popular in ESG funds, said Cheryl Smith, portfolio manager at Trillium Asset Management.
Her funds have been adding to positions in semiconductors and automotive components that would benefit from a push toward electric vehicles, she said. 
""The clean energy space is an obvious space where the market is already pricing in a change in Washington, but there's still a lot to gain in the whole automotive segment and industrial equipment"" sectors, she said. 
The $58 million Global X Autonomous and Electric Vehicles ETF (O:DRIV) is up 5.7% over the last month, well behind the performance of clean energy funds. 
While a resounding Democratic victory would likely bolster ESG stocks, that would not necessarily mean fossil fuel and other carbon-intensive companies would be left for dead. 
Energy stocks have consistently underperformed over the last decade, even as U.S. crude oil production reached an all-time high. The worldwide economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic further pounded oil prices.
In stark contrast to clean energy stocks, oil majors  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) have shed 51% and 40% respectively so far this year.
Still, prospects of a higher stimulus bill could revive companies in a wide variety of sectors if the economy rebounds and demand improves, said Christopher Marangi, co-chief investment officer of the Gabelli Value Team.

""The party in power only has so much influence over the economy and winners and losers in a recovery,"" he said.

Adjusted earnings per share for the three months through September were a touch ahead of expectations at $1.25, compared to a forecast of $1.22, but reported earnings were lower after the company took a $1.1 billion charge to mark its pension liabilities to market.
Revenue fell 4.1% on the year, a slight improvement on the 5.1% drop reported in the second quarter but below expectations. The improvement was due largely to its success in attracting new business customers to its wireless service: Verizon gained 417,000 new business accounts in the quarter, up from 280,000 in the second quarter. In all, net new subscribers rose by 553,000, more than double consensus forecasts ahead of time, although the company’s churn rate also edged up.
Verizon said it now expects full-year earnings per share to be in a range between unchanged and up 2% from a year earlier. The mid-point of 1% is one percentage point higher than previously, while the range has narrowed from -2% to 2%. 
It also said it expects total wireless service revenue to be up at least 2% from last year in the fourth quarter.
Verizon shares are down 6% from the beginning of the year, and down 8% from their 52-week high of $62.22 set on December 20, 2019. They are under-performing the S&P 500 which is up 6.6% from the start of the year.
Verizon shares gained 1.9% in pre-market trade following the report.
""Telecoms may not provide hefty capital gains such as those delivered by high-flying, more volatile technology stocks, but the downside risk during times of distress is also limited,"" said Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar.

(Reuters) - Fund flows into European stocks have surged in recent months, data showed, as global investors look to diversify away from U.S. equities amid concerns over higher valuations and caution ahead of the presidential elections.
Data from Morningstar showed fund inflows into European equities stood at $57 billion in the third quarter, compared with an outflow of $135 billion from U.S. stocks.

U.S. equities have rallied this year, fueled by a surge in technology stocks and economic stimulus measures, while European shares have lagged behind.
That underperformance could now bolster European shares, with investors looking for cheaper, quality stocks outside the United States, analysts said.
""The outcome of U.S. elections could have dramatic and broad reaching impacts, the magnitude of which is unclear. With that in mind, it stands to reason that investors could see Europe as a more favorable destination for their risk assets,"" said Jared Leonard, investment specialist at Hartford Funds.
""For investors thinking those strong performing U.S. stocks could be in bubble territory, that is just another reason to reallocate risk to European equities,"" he added.
Investors are wary about the possibility of U.S. President Donald Trump disputing the election result if he loses, which could lead to market turbulence. Trump is lagging Democrat Joe Biden in his re-election bid, according to opinion polls.
According to Refinitiv data, the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of U.S. equities is 23.6 times, much higher than Europe's 17.3. European equities also offer a higher dividend yield of 2.6%, versus the United States' 1.5%, the data show.

""The weak dollar and rising euro have boosted the returns of European assets for foreign investors,"" said Vincent Deluard, global macro strategist at StoneX Group.
""European valuations are much cheaper than in the U.S., and I would argue that European companies have similar or better prospects than U.S. stocks (excluding FAANMG, which are in a league of their own),"" he added, referring to top performing U.S. tech stocks: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
The optimism over European stocks may, however, be hampered by a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak, with Germany, France, Britain and others announcing preventive measures, including curfews and limits on private gatherings.
But some analysts said the impact on the region's economy would be limited this time.
""As Europe and the UK continue battling the second wave of COVID-19, we don’t expect new widespread and prolonged lockdowns,"" said Citi in a report.

(Reuters) - Investment bankers keen to win lucrative assignments have a new pitch for U.S. corporate owners: hire us to sell your company now or pay at least twice as much in taxes if Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has his way.
Biden has proposed raising the capital gains tax rate from 20% to 39.6% for those making over $1 million. He would also increase the corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%.
Biden would have to win the presidency and his Democratic Party would have to gain control of the Senate and keep control of the House of Representatives in the Nov. 3 election for his tax proposals to become law. While far from certain, this prospect has been seized on by bankers hungry for new business.
""We urge all of our current and potential clients to take note of the potential forthcoming changes, along with their associated consequences, as they consider an exit strategy for their business in the near future,""  Houlihan Lokey Inc  (N:HLI) bankers wrote in a note earlier this month. 
The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The investment bankers' pitch is geared toward individuals and families, as well as private equity firms, who control companies and can decide when to sell them. It also targets company founders, who may only sell one business in their lifetime, making it the most important transaction of their lives.
The strategy appears to be working. Sales of privately held U.S. companies totaled a record $253 billion in the third quarter, up fivefold from the second quarter and up 51% from the third quarter of 2019, according to financial data provider Dealogic. This is despite the COVID-19 pandemic suppressing corporate valuations in some sectors.

""Since the summer we have seen a lot of dialogue from family offices about exploring a sale of some assets. Many of these investors are sophisticated about how they handle their affairs from a tax perspective,"" said David Perdue, a partner in investment bank  PJT Partners Inc 's (N:PJT) strategic advisory group. 
One of the U.S. companies pursuing a deal because of tax considerations is Asplundh Tree Expert LLC, a family-controlled tree-trimming firm, according to people familiar with the deliberations. 
The family that has owned Asplundh since 1928 has been keen to hold onto the company and resisted overtures to sell to private equity firms hungry for a quick flip. When one of these firms, CVC Capital Partners Ltd, convinced the Asplundh family to sell it a minority stake in 2017, it had to use a buyout fund it manages that is dedicated to retaining holdings for a decade or more, rather than cashing out after a few years.
Now the Asplundh family is working with investment bankers to cash out on part of its stake, partly because of its concerns about upcoming changes in the tax system, one of the sources said. It is seeking a valuation for Asplundh of as much as $10 billion, according to the sources. Asplundh did not respond to a request for comment.
Even if Biden wins and implements his tax plan, corporate owners may still have time to cash out. Most of President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts, which were enacted into law in 2017, became effective in 2018, a year after he came into office.
Still, the big uptick in the divestitures of privately owned companies shows how some of their owners view Biden's election victory, and subsequent tax changes, as likely.
 BEST  (NYSE:BEST) PRICE VERSUS TAX SAVINGS 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) advised on more sales of privately held U.S. companies year-to-date than any other, followed by  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), according to Dealogic.
To be sure, getting the best price is still the overriding consideration for corporate sellers, rather than saving on taxes, investment bankers said. Private equity firms, in particular, are wary of being criticized by investors if they think they sold a company for the tax benefit of buyout fund managers, rather than getting the best price.

""There is a tax consideration and there is a more strategic consideration. The tax consideration only applies if you are ready to sell and could attain attractive valuation multiples that could lead to a successful sale,"" said Solon Kentas, co-head of M&A for the Americas at UBS Group AG (S:UBSG)

1032,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 07:12AM ET</span>","Cathay Pacific to slash workforce, end Cathay Dragon brand due to pandemic","By Jamie Freed
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd said on Wednesday it would slash 5,900 jobs and end its regional Cathay Dragon brand, joining peers in cutting costs as it grapples with a plunge in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The airline would also seek changes in conditions in its contracts with cabin crew and pilots as part of a restructuring that would cost HK$2.2 billion ($283.9 million).
Overall, it will cut 8,500 positions, or 24% of its normal headcount, but that includes 2,600 roles currently unfilled due to cost reduction initiatives, Cathay said. 
""The actions we have announced today, however unpalatable, are absolutely necessary to bring cash burn down to more sustainable levels,"" Cathay Chairman Patrick Healy told reporters.
Cathay shares jumped almost 7% during early trading and closed 2.3% higher, with broker Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) saying the announcement removed a key overhang on the stock.
Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) Ltd and Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd have already announced similarly large payroll cuts, as the International Air Transport Association forecasts passenger traffic will not recover until 2024.
Cathay, which has stored around 40% of its fleet outside Hong Kong, said on Monday it planned to operate less than 50% of its pre-pandemic capacity in 2021.
After receiving a $5 billion rescue package led by the Hong Kong government in June, it had been conducting a strategic review.
The airline said it was bleeding HK$1.5 billion to HK$2 billion of cash a month and the restructuring would stem the outflow by HK$500 million a month in 2021, with executive pay cuts continuing throughout next year.
BOCOM International analyst Luya You said she had expected more strategic insight from the airline on its fleet plans and route network as part of the restructuring.
""Had they revealed more on fleet planning for 2021-22, we would get a much better sense of their outlook,"" she said.
Cathay will postpone the delivery of its 21 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 777-9 jets on order beyond 2025, Healy said. 
EXIT THE DRAGON
The decision to end regional brand Cathay Dragon is in line with rival Singapore Airlines' pre-pandemic move to fold regional brand Silkair into its main brand, though in this case 2,500 Cathay Dragon pilots and cabin crew will lose their jobs.
Cathay Dragon, once known as Dragonair, operated most of the group's flights to and from mainland China and had been hit by falling demand before the pandemic due to widespread anti-government protests in Hong Kong.
Plans to merge Cathay Dragon into Cathay's main brand earlier this year hit roadblocks from China's aviation regulator because of infractions during last year's pro-democracy protests, two sources told Reuters in May.
Cathay said the airline would cease operating immediately and it would seek regulatory approval to fold the majority of Cathay Dragon's routes in Cathay Pacific and low-cost arm HK Express. 
Healy said there would be ""substantial savings"" from combining Cathay Dragon's narrowbody fleet with Cathay Pacific's longhaul fleet and focusing on marketing of a single premium brand.
In the short-term, the closure of the Cathay Dragon brand will result in it being unable to carry cargo to Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Kuala Lumpur and Fukuoka, and it will only send dedicated freighters to Xiamen, Chengdu and Hanoi, it told cargo customers in a memo, indicating the routes were cut for now.
Like Singapore Airlines, Cathay lacks a domestic market to cushion it from the fall in international travel due to border closures. 
In September, Cathay's passenger numbers fell by 98.1% compared with a year earlier, though cargo carriage was down by a smaller 36.6%. 
Cathay shares have fallen 41% since the start of January.

The airline's share register is dominated by Swire Pacific (OTC:SWRAY) Ltd, Air China (OTC:AIRYY) Ltd, Qatar Airways and the Hong Kong government, with only a 12% free float.

1034,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 06:56AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Edge Higher; Stimulus Talks and Netflix in Focus,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening slightly higher Wednesday, helped by optimism over a potential coronavirus stimulus package, but gains will be limited by disappointing news from streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
At 07:00 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose just 4 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 24 points, or 0.2%.
Confidence is growing that U.S. lawmakers can come to an agreement over a new coronavirus relief package, after White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said late Tuesday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have made “good progress” on stimulus talks.
President Donald Trump added that he was willing to accept a large aid bill, in opposition to some members of his own Republican party in the Senate, and negotiations are set to continue on Wednesday.
The two sides have struggled for months to overcome fundamental disagreements over additional stimulus, including the size of the deal and the measures covered, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to stunt economic growth.
Elsewhere, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) posted disappointing numbers late Tuesday for paid subscriber growth in the third quarter, adding 2.2 million paid subscribers globally during the quarter that ended Sept. 30, compared with analysts' estimates for 3.4 million. Revenues were also weaker than anticipated.
This sent its shares tumbling over 5.5% in after-hours trading, on concerns that its momentum is slowing.
The earnings season continues apace Wednesday, with electric-vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) poised to post a profit when it reports after the close. 
There are a number of healthcare related stocks due, with  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT), Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO), Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW) and Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) all expected to report.  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ),  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) and CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) are also due.
The main economic release Wednesday is the Federal Reserve's October Beige Book, at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT), which should provide a snapshot from businesses and communities about how the resurgence of Covid is being felt across the country. 
Oil prices fell Wednesday after the American Petroleum Institute reported Tuesday a surprise increase in crude inventories last week. Investors are now looking to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later in the day, for corroboration.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% lower at $41.01 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.5% to $42.53.

1036,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 06:36AM ET</span>",Texas Oil Deal Must Navigate Potential Father-Son Conflict,"(Bloomberg) -- The latest merger between two U.S. shale producers is dealing with an unusual family dynamic that has raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest.
 Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) Co. said Tuesday it agreed to buy rival  Parsley Energy  (NYSE:PE) Inc. for $4.5 billion in stock. Pioneer is run by Scott Sheffield while his son Bryan is Parsley’s founder and chairman.
Pioneer Chief Financial Officer Richard Dealy told analysts and investors on a conference call the two Sheffields were intentionally kept out of takeover talks, which were led by the lead independent directors of both companies.
“Given the related-party nature of it, this was a transaction that was managed independently, so Scott and Bryan were not involved,” Dealy said. “We very much made sure we had a robust process of them not being involved in the negotiations.”
The deal comes amid a growing wave of consolidation in the U.S. shale industry, which is struggling with low energy prices and pressure from investors to realize cost savings and a more stable financial footing. One such combination was confirmed Monday when ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) announced its acquisition of Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) Inc.
The Sheffields’ history as Texan wildcatters spans several generations and multiple cycles of boom and bust. Pioneer’s origins go back to the business run by Scott’s father-in-law, Joe Parsley. Scott, 68, is a veteran oil executive who first took the top job at Pioneer predecessor Parker & Parsley in 1985. Bryan, 42, became a billionaire at the time of Parsley Energy’s 2014 initial public offering, months before the oil price crashed from $100-a-barrel levels.
The Sheffields have more of their wealth tied up in Parsley than they do in Pioneer, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Bryan is Parsley’s 11th-largest holder of Class A shares, with a 2.7% stake valued at about $106 million. He’s also the largest owner of the unlisted Class B stock, holding 21.2 million of those shares. Scott’s stake in Pioneer is worth about $52 million.
The U.S. shale industry has been a lightning rod for accusations of poor corporate governance over the past few years. Executives have raked in millions of dollars in pay, bonuses and stock awards while stock performance languished, and in some cases their companies went bankrupt.
“There are some investors who worry this could be an outrageous conflict of interest and there are others who really believe if the deal’s in everyone’s interest then it’s fine,” said Paul Sankey, a New York-based analyst at Sankey Research.
Parsley executives stand to share $13.8 million in stock payments for a change of control, filings show, with CEO Matt Gallagher -- a former Pioneer employee -- receiving $5.6 million. Gallagher would also be entitled to $7.8 million if he was ousted from the merged entity. Gallagher will join the board of directors for the new company, Pioneer said, while Scott Sheffield will continue as chief executive. Pioneer is still evaluating senior executives from Parsley for including in the new company, it said Tuesday.
Bryan Sheffield, who retired last year as CEO, was removed from the list of Parsley executives entitled to payouts resulting from a merger or acquisition earlier this year. The statement Tuesday announcing the Parsley deal made no mention of Bryan.

1037,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 06:36AM ET</span>",Link Mobility Becomes Europe’s Newest Unicorn Startup,"(Bloomberg) -- Mobile messaging platform Link Mobility Group Holding ASA rose as much as 19% on its first trading day in Oslo amid surging demand for the company’s services as more people embrace e-commerce during the pandemic.
The stock climbed 11% to 52 kroner at 9:24 a.m. in Norway from the 47-kroner sale price of its 6 billion-krone ($653 million) initial public offering. The listing, the largest in the country since silicone producer Elkem ASA’s March 2018 debut, gives Link Mobility a market value of 12.6 billion kroner.
Link Mobility raised 2.5 billion kroner in the share sale, with the rest of the proceeds going to existing holders, including private equity firm Abry Partners. Seven cornerstone investors, including DNB Asset Management and the Government Pension Fund of Norway, took up 2.3 billion kroner, or a third, of the offering.
Online Commerce
Demand for the company’s messaging technology, which allow companies to communicate with and invoice their customers, has soared as the coronavirus outbreak has confined people to their homes and driven up use of online commerce. Video-conferencing firm Pexip Holding AS’s Oslo IPO in May cashed in on the same trend.
Investors have been keen to participate in tech-oriented stock offerings, as well as deals geared toward changing attitudes and consumer behaviors in the pandemic. Pexip’s shares have gained about 26% since its debut, among the first to thaw an iced over European IPO market.
Since then, Norway has seen a deluge of listings with more to come. In 2020, Oslo has hosted 29 IPOs worth $2.4 billion, the highest number of deals on record at this stage of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The Nordic region in general, which also encompasses Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland, has had a good IPO year. New stocks are supported by strong local equity indexes, which have been among Europe’s best performers.
ABG Sundal Collier ASA, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) International Limited are joint global coordinators on Link Mobility’s IPO, while Carnegie AS is a joint bookrunner and SpareBank 1 Markets AS is co-lead manager.
If underwriters exercise in full their option to sell more shares, the deal size would increase to 6.9 billion kroner.

LOS ANGELES/CHICAGO (Reuters) - This time last year, shoppers on Chicago's Magnificent Mile were waiting for Louis Vuitton to debut its whimsical holiday window decorations. Now those same windows are hidden behind a wall of wood panels painted bright orange. 
While still open for shoppers, stores like Gucci (PA:PRTP), H&M (ST:HMb) and Nordstrom (N:JWN) are also boarded up after looters targeted the city's famed retail district in the spring and summer, when protests gripped more than 100 U.S. cities. 
As security experts warn that the U.S. presidential election could spark renewed civil unrest, those stores remain clad in plywood as retailers seek to keep property and employees safe in the event street violence flares anew. 
""You have to ask: 'Do we want to be safe?'"" said Andy, 50, the owner of Vickie's Nail Salon. The Magnificent Mile shop was broken into and robbed during early morning mayhem that erupted after the police shooting of a young Black man in August. 
Andy, declining to provide his full name, has kept plywood on his windows ever since. He also puts a panel over the front door at closing time. ""Let's see how things turn out after the election. If we don't feel it's safe, then we'll have to keep boarding up every night.""
Aon Plc (N:AON), the world's largest insurance broker, told Reuters the majority of retailer clients it surveyed are considering boarding up stores because they are worried about looting around the election. Aon executive MaryAnne Burke said about 70% of these retailer clients did so during protests in May and June.
Many retailers including Gucci, H&M,  Under Armour  (N:UAA) and Apple (O:AAPL) declined to comment on their election security plans. More than two dozen security consultants, insurers, contractors and store employees told Reuters that companies are installing reinforced glass, hiring security guards or retaining on-call teams that barricade and board up buildings. 
Retailers are on edge after raiders earlier this year smashed windows, stole merchandise and, at times, set stores ablaze in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Portland and other U.S. cities - often under the cover of peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrations that were rekindled by the May 25 police killing of George Floyd, a Black man. 
 Foot Locker  (N:FL) in its quarterly report on Aug. 21, said it racked up $18 million in costs from ""recent social unrest."" Looters target sneaker sellers like Foot Locker because their products are easy to carry away and turn into cash.
After avoiding a commitment for weeks, U.S. President Donald Trump last week said he would accept a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the Nov. 3 presidential election to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. But Trump has continued to make claims about voter fraud and raise doubts about election integrity. 
""Companies operating in the United States should anticipate the risk of social unrest and political violence to remain elevated before, during and after the upcoming presidential election,"" Jonathan Wood, a lead analyst at specialist risk consultancy Control Risks, wrote in a recent assessment.
""You'd be foolish to think the worst is over. We all watch the news,"" said Bob Moraca, principal at Rock Security Group and former vice president of loss prevention for the National Retail Federation. 
MAKING PREPARATIONS
Construction scaffolding provider Starr Industries sheltered Apple's all-glass ""Cube"" store on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue behind heavy barricades and chain link fencing on June 1. It is now on standby for several companies with stores in that upscale section of New York City. 
""Because of the election, they are worried that the same thing will happen,"" said Marian Bobelea, Starr's president. He would not say which companies retained on-call protection services. 
Riot Glass founder Brad Campbell said the security glass maker and a sister firm that installs reinforced windows are rushing to finish jobs at hundreds of U.S. stores.
""Everybody wants something done before the election,"" said Campbell.
Alumatec Pacific Products, which provides roll-down doors used by large retailers, said it is seeing election-related demand from smaller businesses like liquor stores and marijuana shops. 
Meanwhile, private security-guard provider Pinkerton (ST:SECUb) said its hiring is up 50% in Chicago this quarter.
Under Armour covered its Magnificent Mile store windows with clear protective film, store manager Kyle Domzalski told Reuters. 

Meanwhile, Chicago police are running response drills and warning retailers to beef up security, Police Superintendent David Brown said.

1041,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Nestle's Health and Pet Foods Drive Another Strong Quarter,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Swiss consumer giant Nestle (SIX:NESN) provided further evidence on Wednesday of one of the less-talked about trends of the pandemic: the rising importance of pets in a world of more isolated humans.
Sales of pet foods, notably its Purina brand, rose 11% in the third quarter, helping the company post its fastest quarterly sales rise in a decade and allowing it to raise its outlook for the year.
Overall, organic sales are now set to grow 3% this year, after a 4.9% increase in the third quarter. Nestle also expects underlying margins to improve.
The stunning growth of pet foods, already a well-established and mature business, is widely seen as reflecting an increased desire to treat or spoil one’s closest companions at a time when visiting family and friends has become more difficult. Think about all the people you have heard complaining they haven’t seen their parents and/or children in months and that makes plenty of sense.
(It may make less sense to those who would cheerfully starve a yowling annoyance that is a constant allergy risk and distraction from work, but the author supposes himself to be in a minority here.)
In another entirely understandable development, Nestle’s health science arm also grew organic sales at over 10% year-on-year in the quarter. “Demand for vitamins, minerals and supplements that support health and the immune system remained high,” it noted.
That statement requires little explanation but does raise questions as to whether such momentum can be sustained in the new year if, as seems likely, the pandemic recedes as vaccines become available to the general public.  
Such risks are, for now, a minor concern. Arguably of more concern is the stock’s failure to build on the summer recovery. It fell 0.3% on Wednesday in response to the news to its lowest level since July. It’s now on course for a third straight weekly loss after failing to breach resistance around the 110 franc level on three occasions. The momentum behind chief executive Marc Schneider’s drive to squeeze more value out of its stable of global brands appears to be stalling. At 23 times trailing earnings, it's no longer cheap, even though its 2.5% dividend yield seems attractive on a risk-adjusted basis.
Part of the trouble with Nestle is that, like its big rival Unilever (NYSE:UL), developments have been extremely lumpy since the pandemic erupted. Steep gains in one division have been offset by losses in others, especially in sales tied to public venues such as cafes and movie theaters.
But the bigger problem for Nestle shareholders is arguably a broader one. The stock performs best, in a relative sense, as a defensive play. The stock still outperformed the broader market on a day when concerns about the Covid-19 virus again dominated. But with a new U.S. administration seemingly inbound, hell-bent on massive reflation, and with similar moves afoot in the euro zone, the temptation to rotate out of Nestle and into other consumer-focused stocks that offer more value will surely grow."
1042,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>","Iberdrola, PNM to create $20 billion U.S. clean powerhouse","By Isla Binnie and Jose Elías Rodríguez
MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE) announced a deal worth $8.3 billion including debt on Wednesday, adding PNM Resources (N:PNM) to its Avangrid (N:AGR) business to create the third-largest U.S. renewable energy operator.
Absorbing PNM into Avangrid will create an operator present in 24 states, Iberdrola said, and bring together firms with a combined market value topping $20 billion.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that the deal was being discussed. 
PNM's board unanimously approved the $4.3 billion offer to its shareholders of $50.3 per share, the filing said. Iberdrola expects the deal to close in 2021 and start boosting financial results from the first year.
Green energy targets and increasing investor interest in protecting the environment have buoyed Iberdrola and other renewables-focused utilities.
The pandemic has also seen U.S. utilities look harder at consolidation to cut costs and spur investment.
Active in New Mexico and Texas, PNM gives Avangrid a route to expand its regulated business beyond the U.S. northeast. 
PNM could also benefit from Avangrid's renewables experience as it works to cut emissions. A plan has now been approved to close its coal-fired San Juan plant in 2022, Iberdrola said. 
Iberdrola said the merged company would have assets worth $40 billion, generate core earnings of around $2.5 billion and net profit of $850 million.
This is Iberdrola's eighth deal this year as part of a 10 billion euro ($11.85 billion) investment drive of which it has already spent more than 6.6 billion euros. It has shopped for assets in France, Australia and Japan. 
CEO Ignacio Galan said his strategy consisted of: ""Friendly transactions, focused on regulated businesses and renewable energy, in countries with good credit ratings and legal and regulatory stability, offering opportunities for future growth"".
Separately on Wednesday, Iberdrola reported nine-month net profit growth of 4.7% and said it still expected growth of mid to high-single digit in 2020. 

Iberdrola's Madrid-listed shares were down around 0.5% against a broader market 0.14% lower at 0753 GMT.

1043,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>","European stocks fall as healthcare, construction sectors drag","By Sruthi Shankar
(Reuters) - European shares fell for a third straight session on Wednesday, as losses in healthcare and construction stocks countered a lift from encouraging earnings from consumer giant Nestle and telecoms equipment maker Ericsson (BS:ERICAs).
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 1.0%, in sharp contrast to Asian markets and Wall Street futures that steadied on hopes of a fresh U.S. stimulus package.
Most European sectors slipped, with healthcare stocks (SXDP) proving the biggest drag, while banking stocks (SX7P) were supported by rising U.S. and European government bond yields.
Nestle (S:NESN) lifted its 2020 sales forecast following a quarterly beat, but shares inched lower after early gains.
Sweden's Ericsson (ST:ERICb) jumped 5.5% as higher margins and China's 5G rollout helped the company beat quarterly core earnings estimates. 
""Earnings have been generally well above expectations, and guidance has been a positive surprise,"" said Patrick Moonen, principal strategist in the multi-asset team at  NN  (NASDAQ:NNBR) Investment Partners. 
""But there are other elements that are currently at play and may have a bigger impact on the market performance than earnings.""
Moonen pointed to many European countries reimposing mobility restrictions following a surge in COVID-19 cases that could weigh on fourth-quarter economic activity. 
The STOXX 600 has struggled to break out of a trading range since June, when it recouped a large part of the early pandemic-driven losses. The benchmark is still about 16% below its all-time high.
London markets underperformed, with the exporter-heavy FTSE 100 (FTSE) hit by a surge in pound after bullish Brexit comments. (L) 
 Vivendi  (PA:VIV) rose 2.9% after the French media group reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly sales and unveiled plans to list its most-prized asset, Universal Music Group, in 2022. 
Third-quarter profits for companies on the STOXX 600 are expected to drop 34.8%, according to Refinitiv data, a slight improvement from the 36.7% predicted at the start of the earnings season.
Of the 29 companies that reported so far, 75.9% have topped earnings expectations. 
Gold miner Centamin Plc (L:CEY) slumped 20.7% to the bottom of STOXX 600 after cutting its 2020 production forecast. 

Construction companies also took a knocking, with  Assa Abloy  (ST:ASSAb), the world's biggest lockmaker, falling 3.9% after it reported a drop in quarterly sales.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks and bond yields rose on Wednesday as Washington moved closer to agreeing a coronavirus stimulus package, pinning the dollar at its lowest for a month. 
The MSCI world equity index, which follows shares in nearly 50 countries, gained 0.1%, buoyed by a 0.5% gain for Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan. 
Wall Street was also set for gains, with U.S. stock futures up 0.3%. 
European shares were however dragged down by the healthcare and real estate sectors. The broad Euro STOXX 600 fell 0.2% in early trading, with Paris and London shares down 0.2% and 0.4% respectively. 
The White House and Democrats in the U.S. Congress moved closer to agreement on a new coronavirus relief package as President Donald Trump said he was willing to accept a large aid bill despite opposition from his own Republican Party.
With just two weeks until the U.S. presidential election, Trump signaled a willingness to go along with more than $2.2 trillion in new COVID-19 relief, a figure Democrats have been pushing for months.
In response, U.S. Treasury yields hit a four-month high and the yield curve steepened as expectations grew for more fiscal spending. Investors also sold benchmark euro zone debt, with German Bunds rising to their highest for a week at -0.571%.
The moves in stocks and bonds highlight how importantly new stimulus is viewed for the U.S. and global economies, said Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. 
""Everyone knows that more stimulus needs to come through,"" he said, cautioning that any package may struggle to pass the Republican-controlled Senate. ""But markets are perhaps not always right to be bouncing on speculation."" 
Still, bond investors are pricing in a stimulus package, either by the election or early next year should the Democrats win the White House and Senate,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts wrote. 
The chances of such a ""Blue Wave"" have risen notably in the last 3 weeks, they said.
DOLLAR DOWN, YUAN UP
The dollar hit a one-month low against a basket of currencies as optimism over a pre-election U.S. stimulus package bought riskier currencies. 
The greenback was last down 0.2% at 92.849, with the doubts over whether any package can pass the Republican-controlled Senate kept the dollar from breaching last month's two-month lows. 
Underlying the potential for the Senate to dash investors' hopes for more stimulus, a senior Senate Republican aide told Reuters that majority leader Mitch McConnell has privately told his fellow Republicans that he did not favour a deal before the Nov. 3 elections. 
Still, underscoring appetite for risk among currency traders, the Chinese yuan hit a more than-two year top as the world's No.2 economy rebounds strongly from the pandemic, dragging riskier Asian currencies along with it. 
The yuan was up 0.4% at 6.6480, taking gains against the dollar this year to around 4.5%. Its rise helped lift the Australian dollar, weighed down by expectations of a rate cut in November, from Tuesday's three-week low.

Alternative assets also fared well. Bitcoin, which is often sought during periods of appetite for risk, climbed nearly 3% to break $12,000 for the first time since August and was not far off its highest this year.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle (S:NESN) raised its guidance for 2020 organic sales growth to around 3% after beating third-quarter expectations on Wednesday with 4.9% growth driven by strong demand for pet food and health products.
The world's biggest food group has weathered the COVID-19 pandemic better than some peers thanks to its broad portfolio helping offset a slump in food sales to restaurants and cafes.
Shares in Nestle, up 2.5% so far this year, were indicated to open 2.7% higher in pre-market trading .
Demand for food and drinks consumed at home remained strong during the pandemic, while sales of products destined to out-of-home venues struggled, the maker of Nescafe coffee and KitKat chocolate said in a statement.
Nestle said it wanted it keep developing its portfolio, notably expanding its health science business recently bolstered by the $2 billion Aimmune Therapeutics (NASDAQ:AIMT) acquisition.
For the first nine months of the year, Nestle's organic sales grew by 3.5%, beating the 2.8% in a company-supplied consensus analysts' estimates.
Nestle had previously expected organic growth of 2-3% for this year. It confirmed it wanted to improve its margin.
Sales in the Americas posted the strongest growth rate in the nine-month period, while Asia was only slightly positive.
Sales in Swiss francs fell 9.4% to 61.9 billion Swiss francs ($68.33 billion) hit by divestitures.
Under Chief Executive Mark Schneider, Nestle divested its skin health unit, Herta meat and U.S. ice cream brands and has put North American waters and peanut milk label Yinlu under strategic review.
Nestle said both reviews were on track and were expected to be completed in early 2021.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines (O:UAL) is set on Wednesday to test a digital health pass under a global pilot program seeking to establish a common international standard for COVID-19 test results and eventually vaccine records that could help reopen borders. 
The nonprofit initiative, called CommonPass, is backed by the World Economic Forum and Swiss-based foundation The Commons Project. If successful, it could persuade governments to ease the restrictions and quarantines that have slammed air travel since the coronavirus starting spreading across the globe.
The United flight from London Heathrow to Newark Liberty International in New Jersey follows a pilot by Cathay Pacific (HK:0293) this month, and other large airlines are also planning international trials in November and December.
""The goal of these trials is to demonstrate to governments that they can rely on someone getting tested in one country and present their credentials in another country,"" Paul Meyer, chief executive of The Commons Project, told Reuters.
Broad deployment is targeted for January, he said.
Volunteers on the United flight, which will be observed by the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will upload COVID-19 test results from a certified lab to their smartphones and complete any required health screening questions to generate a verified QR (quick response) code that airline staff and border officials can scan.
They will present the code, which can be printed for passengers without mobile devices, before departing and on arrival.
The project aims to build a network of trusted labs and would rely on those results and vaccination records to be certified across borders, replacing the current method of sharing paper-based and easily falsified test results from unknown labs.
The labs would verify a person's identity for the app, which is designed to protect personal data and privacy, said Meyer, who is in a dialogue with airlines and countries across the globe for the project.

""The model only works if countries agree to trust health data from other countries,"" he said.

Investing.com – Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) said on Wednesday that it would axe up to 8,500 positions and cease operations of its sister airline Cathay Dragon with immediate effect, as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact demand.
Cathay Pacific’s Hong Kong shares were up 4.02% at HK$5.95 ($0.77) by 1: 02 AM ET (5:02 AM GMT), after seeing an almost 7% increase earlier in the day on the back of the news.
A restructuring program set to cost HK$2.2. billion ($283.86 million) will see the airline seek amendments in conditions in its contracts with pilots and other cabin crew, a stock exchange filing said.
The 8,500 positions, or 24% of Cathay Pacific’s normal headcount, includes 5,900 staff losing their jobs worldwide, of which 5,300 are jobs in Hong Kong, and 2,600 unfilled roles.
“The global pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on aviation and the hard truth is we must fundamentally restructure the group to survive, “Cathay Pacific Chief Executive Officer Augustus Tang.
“This is a heart-wrenching decision to have to make, for which I am truly sorry,” Tang added.
In its decision to end Cathay Dragon, formerly known as Dragonair, Cathay Pacific emulates Singapore Airline’s pre COVID-19 move to fold its own regional brand SilkAir into its main brand. Cathay Dragon had also seen falling demand in its China routes even before COVID-19 hit, with 2019’s protests in Hong Kong in 2019 deterring travellers from China.
Cathay Pacific said that it will seek regulatory approval to fold most of Cathay Dragon’s routes to be absorbed by itself and low-cost carrier arm HK Express.
“Now that Cathay has decided on staff count and the elimination of the Dragon brand it knows the size of the airline and the structure going forward and can complete its new fleet and network plan,” independent aviation analyst Brendan Sobie to Reuters.
Cathay Pacific saw a 98.1% fall in passenger numbers year-on-year in September. However, cargo carriages declined by a less steep 36.6% in the same month."
1053,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 12:36AM ET</span>","Huawei, China Firms Are Said to Seek Curbs on Nvidia’s Arm Deal","(Bloomberg) -- Chinese technology companies including Huawei Technologies Co. have expressed strong concerns to local regulators about Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp.’s proposed acquisition of Arm Ltd., people familiar with the matter said, potentially jeopardizing the $40 billion semiconductor deal.
Several of the country’s most influential tech firms have been lobbying the State Administration for Market Regulation to either reject the transaction or impose conditions to ensure their access to Arm technology, the people said. Chief among their concerns is that Nvidia may force the British firm to cut off Chinese clients, they said, asking not to be identified discussing private deliberations.
China’s fear is that Arm -- whose semiconductor designs and architecture are central to most of the world’s electronics from smartphones to supercomputers -- will become yet another pawn in a U.S.-Chinese struggle for tech supremacy. Nvidia is buying the British firm from Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp., bringing it under American jurisdiction and theoretically threatening its cherished status as a neutral party in the chip industry.
Any review of the deal in Beijing is likely to be colored by what it perceives as growing U.S. attempts to contain its largest technology companies. It has the power to approve the deal because China is by far the world’s largest consumer of semiconductors, importing about $300 billion worth of chips annually. That dependence on foreign silicon may convince regulators there to try and wring major concessions from Nvidia to preserve the Arm relationship, for instance by keeping the business independent and separate.
Read more: Nvidia Deal Threatens Arm’s Role as the Switzerland of Chips
A Huawei representative declined to comment. The Chinese regulatory agency didn’t respond to calls and a faxed request for comment. Nvidia representatives pointed to remarks this month from Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang, who expressed confidence the deal will pass muster.
“As soon as we explain the rationale of the transaction and our plans, the regulators around the world will realize that these are two complementary companies,” Huang said at Arm’s developer conference. “The two companies being complementary when combined will create new innovations, which is good for the market.”
Nvidia’s record deal to buy Arm was always expected to encounter major hurdles from regulators in countries sparring over trade, as well as customers concerned the transaction will limit competition and unfairly favor Arm’s future owner. The Chinese watchdog has yet to view a formal application for approval, but the opposition there is likely to be fiercest given its reliance on American technology at a time of mounting U.S. hostility. Beijing’s authority has proven fatal for at least one previous chip deal: Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. gave up its pursuit of  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) in 2018 after failing to win approval from China over more than 21 months.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Clearance in China will likely be the biggest challenge and take the most time. Because China’s government could use Nvidia’s deal approval as a pawn in its trade conflicts with the U.S., as some believe it did with Qualcomm-NXP, it’s difficult to predict yet whether the purchase will clear there. Still, the ability to impose conditions allows China to extract advantageous licensing terms for Chinese companies, which may be viewed as the better route.
- Jennifer Rie and Aitor Ortiz, analysts

China has determined it must build its own world-class chip industry, given rising tensions with the U.S. administration of Donald Trump. That goal is unlikely to be affected by the American elections in November, although the outcome may change the dynamics between the two countries and by extension the Arm review.
Read more: China Said to Plan Broad Chip Sector Support to Fight Trump
Nvidia is a major provider of processors for computers and high-end computing, pitting it against players from  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). to Qualcomm and Huawei. And Arm’s designs and instruction set -- the code used by chips to communicate with software -- are an integral element of phones, self-driving cars and billions of sensors. They’re also growing more essential for servers and laptops.
The Cambridge, U.K.-based company has thrived on its neutrality as the Switzerland of the industry: it licenses technology to hundreds of companies, competing with none of them. While the Nvidia acquisition threatens this, executives have argued it’s in their best interest to maintain Arm’s neutrality to avoid alienating potential customers.
The deal still needs sign-offs from China, the U.K., the European Union and the U.S., a process that often requires government agencies to solicit or be open to comment from customers and competitors. Nvidia and Arm have said they’re confident they’ll get through it but it may take as long as 18 months to secure the necessary approvals.

1054,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 12:05AM ET</span>",Meet the lawyers behind the U.S. versus Google antitrust showdown,"By Jan Wolfe
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Justice Department and 11 states have filed an antitrust lawsuit accusing Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google of maintaining an illegal monopoly over internet search and search advertising.
Here are some of the lawyers handling the landmark case, which could remake one of the most recognizable U.S. companies.
RYAN SHORES
Shores joined the Justice Department last year to spearhead the Google investigation. He is working closely with Jeffrey Rosen, the second-in-command at the department behind Attorney General Bill Barr.
Shores has spent his career at elite law firms, most recently Shearman & Sterling, where he defended corporations like Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and the oil company Equinor (N:EQNR) against antitrust claims.
Shores grew up in the Florida Panhandle, attended Huntingdon College in Alabama, and graduated at the top of his class from the University of Virginia School of Law.
After law school he clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, an influential conservative who died in 2005.
Lawyers close to Shores said much of his work happens outside the courtroom: advising companies on investigations and negotiating with regulators to get transactions approved.
Shores' background as primarily a corporate defense lawyer makes him an odd pick to lead an antitrust case against Google, said David Balto, a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer who has done consulting work for Google.
David Boies, the famed litigator who tried the U.S. government's antitrust case against  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), had significant plaintiff-side experience before taking that case, Balto noted.
""Switching sides is going to be a difficult task,"" Balto said. ""He does not have the background that would naturally lend itself to this case.""
David Higbee, a friend and former law partner of Shores, said Shores was a skilled lawyer and up for the task.
""I don't think he took the case with any agenda,"" Higbee added. ""I don't think of him as a partisan.""
KENT WALKER
Walker joined Google as an in-house lawyer in 2006 and has steadily expanded his portfolio while keeping a relatively low profile.
Walker took control of Google's legal affairs as part of the 2015 reorganization that created a new parent company, Alphabet.
In 2018, Google promoted Walker from general counsel to senior vice president for global affairs, overseeing legal affairs, public policy and corporate philanthropy.
Walker has some courtroom experience, thanks to a five-year stint as a federal prosecutor early in his career in which he won the first federal criminal copyright infringement case.
He worked at companies including Netscape Communications Corp and eBay Inc (O:EBAY) before joining Google.
Silicon Valley attorneys see Walker as an important voice on big-picture ethical issues facing the technology industry, said Doug Melamed, a former in-house lawyer at  Intel Corp  (O:INTC).
""He's as good as they come,"" said Melamed, now a professor at Stanford Law School.
Walker will likely lead a team of outside lawyers and direct Google's legal strategy and any potential settlement.
While Walker did not lead Google's antitrust settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in 2013, he oversaw a later settlement with European Union regulators.
JOHN SCHMIDTLEIN
Leading the defense for Google will be John Schmidtlein, an experienced antitrust litigator at the Washington law firm Williams (NYSE:WMB) & Connolly.
Many antitrust lawyers focus on advising companies on how to get mergers approved by regulators, but Schmidtlein has built a practice around defending clients in high-stakes litigation.
Schmidtlein is deeply familiar with Google's business, having successfully defended it against a class action over its Android smartphone operating system in 2014. That lawsuit accused Google of unlawfully forcing handset makers using Android to make Google's own applications the default option.
SUSAN CREIGHTON
Google has also tapped longtime adviser Susan Creighton, a partner at the company's go-to law firm of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati. She served as lead outside counsel to Google in the earlier FTC investigation.
Creighton is known for playing a role in the landmark Microsoft antitrust case. In 1996, while in private practice, Creighton wrote a lengthy memo on behalf of Netscape that laid out how Microsoft was dominating the personal computer software industry. The white paper is credited with prompting the Justice Department to open its investigation.
In the early 2000s, after the Microsoft case, Creighton joined the FTC, where she spearheaded antitrust enforcement.

1055,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 11:21PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Up, to See “Mixed Day” Over Cautious Stimulus Hopes","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning, seeing gains as optimism over the latest stimulus measures being passed by the U.S. Congress, but with those gains capped by a wobbling tech sector.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.48% by 11:14 PM ET (3:14 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.22% with data released earlier in the day showed that Korea's Producer Price Index (PPI) rose 0.4% year-on-year and 0.1% month-on-month, both lower than August’s readings.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.52%. The city relaxed social distancing measures to permit local tours of up to 30 people each and wedding ceremonies of no more than 50 guests, to come into effect from Friday.
In Australia, the ASX 200 inched up 0.10%. Data released earlier in the day showed a 0.2% growth in the Westpac/Melbourne Institute (MI) Leading Index, a preliminary indication of retail sales figures, month-on-month. However, the growth was smaller than the last reading of 0.5%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.44% and the Shenzhen Component slid 1.19%.
“It will be quite a mixed day … people are digesting the potential for a stimulus bill, and markets are very cautious on the back of that,” CommSec senior economist Ryan Felsman told Reuters.
Both U.S. and Asian stocks rallied after President Donald Trump indicated on Tuesday that he was willing to accept a package with a larger price tag, saying, “I want to do it even bigger than the Democrats.”
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi also raised hopes that the stimulus measures would be passed before the Nov. 3 presidential election, saying, “I hope so. That’s the plan,” for an agreement to be reached the following week. Pelosi will continue talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin later in the day.
However, other investors were more cautious about the prospects of a deal, as Republican opposition to the measures’ price tag remains and the Federal Reserve calls for more fiscal support to complement unprecedented monetary aid. The Fed is due to release its ‘Beige Book’ economic survey later in the day,
“Equity markets are under some pressure following limited advances in stimulus talks … the odds of a deal being low, tells us much about the battle between hope and the reality of an economy still under severe shock but recovering,” Nordea Investment Funds SA senior macro strategist Sebastien Galy said in a note.
Investors are also keeping an eye on the tech sector after the U.S. Justice Department sued Alphabet’s Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on Tuesday over Google’s alleged abuse of its online search market monopoly, the most significant antitrust action against an American company in more than 20 years.
Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned that the unexpectedly early pickup in COVID-19 infections is a “clear risk” to the economic outlook in Europe, with the region seeing a surging number of new cases."
1056,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 09:40PM ET</span>",Shale producer Pioneer Natural to buy rival Parsley for $4.5 billion in all-stock deal,"By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co (N:PXD) said on Tuesday it would buy smaller rival  Parsley Energy  Inc (N:PE) in a deal valued at about $4.5 billion, the latest consolidation among U.S. shale producers slammed by the rout in oil prices during the pandemic.
Many shale companies have been mired in losses because of weak crude prices, hovering around $40 a barrel since June. But unlike in past downturns, companies have struggled to raise new capital to restructure heavy debts.
The all-stock deal would create the largest Permian Basin-only focused shale producer and is expected to add annual cost savings of $325 million. Pioneer shareholders will own about 76% of the combined company. https://refini.tv/3kmSrSc
Pioneer aims to increase cost savings and cash flow, positioning it as one of ""a few investable independents,"" Chief Executive Scott Sheffield said on an analyst call on Tuesday.
""There’s only going to be three or four survivors,"" Sheffield said, naming his own company, ConocoPhillips (N:COP), EOG Resources Inc (N:EOG) and ""maybe""  Hess Corp  (N:HES) as likely winners that could lure investor interest.
The deal is part of ""a historic winnowing"" of U.S.-based oil firms, said Andrew Dittmar, senior M&A analyst at Enverus.
“Shale companies are looking for ways to regain their market footing,"" Dittmar said, adding: ""Smaller companies don’t want to be left out in the cold.""
A combined company would pump about 328,000 barrels of oil per day. Neither company holds federal acreage, which is seen as riskier than state or private lands in case drilling rules change after the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election.
One of Parsley's founders in 2008 was now-Chairman Bryan Sheffield, the son of Scott Sheffield. Both Pioneer and Parsley have criticized widespread natural gas flaring in the Permian oil field, saying wasting the natural gas and emitting greenhouse gas methane give the industry a black eye.
On Monday, ConocoPhillips agreed to buy U.S. shale oil producer  Concho Resources Inc  (N:CXO) for $9.7 billion. That followed  Chevron  Corp's (N:CVX) $4.2 billion purchase of  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL), and  Devon Energy  Corp's (N:DVN) $2.6 billion all-stock buy of rival  WPX Energy Inc  (N:WPX). 
Such deals have increased pressure on oil and gas producers to buy up smaller rivals.
Parsley CEO Matt Gallagher will join Pioneer's board. 

The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on Tuesday told employees whose work can be done from home that they can do so until June, extending the timeline on a return to office due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Employees who work in a role that can effectively be done from home are welcome to do so until June 30, 2021"", an Amazon spokeswoman said in an emailed statement on Tuesday, adding the guidance is applicable globally.
Amazon had earlier allowed that option until January.
The development comes less than three weeks after the world's largest online retailer said more than 19,000 of its U.S. frontline workers contracted the coronavirus this year. 
Some staff, elected officials and unions in recent months have said that Amazon put employees' health at risk by keeping warehouses open during the pandemic. 
""We have invested significant funds and resources to keep those who choose to come to the office safe through physical distancing, deep cleaning, temperature checks, and by providing face coverings and hand sanitizer,"" the Amazon spokeswoman said on Tuesday.
In May,  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) became the first major tech company to allow employees who can work remotely to do so indefinitely. 
Other tech giants have extended the work from home option for their employees with  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) saying earlier this month it will let most employees work remotely for up to half their weekly working hours.
 Facebook Inc  (O:FB) had said it would allow its employees to work from home till July next year, while Google (O:GOOGL) had extended the remote working period for employees who do not need to be in the office till June.

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 08:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. trial of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine may resume this week - sources,"By Julie Steenhuysen and Marisa Taylor
CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc's (L:AZN) COVID-19 vaccine trial in the United States is expected to resume as early as this week after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration completed its review of a serious illness in a study participant, four sources told Reuters.
AstraZeneca's large, late-stage U.S. trial has been on hold since Sept. 6, after a participant in the company's UK trial fell ill with what was suspected to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.
The sources, who were briefed on the matter but asked to remain anonymous, said they have been told the trial could resume later this week. It was unclear how the FDA would characterize the illness, they said.
An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment.
The agency is requiring researchers conducting the trial to add information about the incident to consent forms signed by study participants, according to one of the sources.
UK regulatory officials previously reviewed the illness and determined there was “insufficient evidence to say for certain” that it was or was not related to the vaccine. It permitted the trial to resume in the UK, according to a draft of the updated consent form shared with Reuters.
“In this case, after considering the information, the independent reviewers and MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) recommended that vaccinations should continue,” the draft consent form stated. “Close monitoring of the affected individual and other participants will be continued.”
Regulators in Brazil, India and South Africa also previously allowed AstraZeneca to resume its vaccine trials there.
AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with Oxford University researchers, had been seen as a frontrunner in the race to produce a vaccine for COVID-19 until its trials were put on hold to investigate the illness. Early data from large-scale trials in the United States of vaccines from  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) are expected some time next month.
Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) last week paused its Phase III COVID-19 vaccine trial to investigate an unexplained illness in a study participant. At the time of the announcement, the company did not know whether the volunteer had been given its vaccine or a placebo.
A J&J spokesman on Tuesday said the study remains on pause as the company continues its review of medical information before deciding to restart the trial. J&J noted last week that its ""study pause"" was voluntary. By contrast, AstraZeneca's trial is on ""regulatory hold,"" which is imposed by health authorities.
Vaccines are seen as essential to helping end the pandemic that has battered economies around the world and claimed more than 1 million lives - over 220,000 of them in the United States. 
Responding to a request about the AstraZeneca trial, British regulators shared with Reuters a draft of a form letter to UK vaccine trial participants, dated Oct. 14 and signed by the Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Team. It says the U.S. FDA had “completed their analysis” and said vaccination under the study in the United States would resume shortly. 
FDA ""has come to the same conclusion as the other drug regulators including the MHRA,"" the letter states.
The Health Research Authority, which helps oversee UK medical research, said in an email to Reuters that it vetted the communication to make sure it was suitable to ensure informed consent among study volunteers. It could not confirm that the letter had been issued.
An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said the communication is not from the company and it ""cannot verify the content,"" referring to the draft letter to study participants.
""We also cannot comment on a pending FDA decision,"" she said. The Oxford study team did not respond to requests for comment.
NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE
In another of the documents directed at trial participants, the Oxford vaccine study team noted that there was not enough evidence to link the neurological problem seen in the UK trial to the vaccine.
Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who reviewed the document, said it can be difficult to link a rare side effect specifically to a vaccine to the exclusion of other potential causes.
Transverse myelitis, which the study volunteer is believed to have developed, typically occurs at a rate of 1-in-200,000 people, Offit said, so it would be unusual to see it in a trial of 9,000 individuals.
Other viruses including those that cause West Nile and polio can trigger the condition, as can physical trauma.

The regulators have to weigh whether a rare side effect is vaccine-related and could occur again against the sickness and deaths linked with COVID-19, Offit said. ""That's always the line that you walk.""

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 08:10PM ET</span>","U.S. shale mergers accelerate, as Pioneer-Parsley deal joins roster","By Jennifer Hiller and David French
HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Consolidation in the U.S. shale industry is accelerating, ratcheting up pressure on oil and gas producers to gobble up smaller rivals, analysts and executives said.
 Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) Co, one of the largest independent shale operators, joined the ranks of dealmakers as it announced on Tuesday a low-premium $4.5 billion buyout of  Parsley Energy  (NYSE:PE) Inc.
The coronavirus pandemic has slashed oil demand and forced struggling shale producers to cut costs. Crude prices have slid about a third this year but drillers still must invest to maintain the same rate of production as the output of existing shale wells decline. Global majors are not likely to step in, so analysts expect the dwindling universe of notable producers to seek out deal partners.
""The universe of companies with which you can combine is shrinking by the day,"" said Matthew Portillo, managing director at investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.
On Monday, Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) Inc agreed to sell to ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) for $9.7 billion. That followed  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX)'s $4.2 billion purchase of  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL) this month, and  Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN)'s $2.6 billion all-stock, low premium buy of rival WPX Energy (NYSE:WPX) Inc in September. European majors are avoiding new oil and gas purchases and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) is cutting costs, making them unlikely candidates for a deal. 
""It seems like the best companies have been picked off,"" said Scott Sheffield, CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources, in a call with analysts on Tuesday, adding that he did not see many more deals to come. ""Leverage is going to prevent consolidation in the next few years."" 
""Those without very strong balance sheets are trying to survive,"" Concho Resources Chief Executive Tim Leach said in an interview on Monday, when the Conoco deal was announced. Leach said companies with stronger balance sheets will buy weaker firms.
Investors are increasingly looking for companies with market values of at least $5 billion, preferably those that pay dividends. While most of the larger shale firms pay dividends, a Refinitiv Eikon index of U.S. oil-and-gas producers has lost 55% this year, compared with the S&P 500's 7.4% rise.
""The outlook for the smaller companies in the sector has diminished,"" Portillo said.
Buyers could include  Marathon Oil  Corp (NYSE:MRO),  Apache Corp  (NASDAQ:APA) and EOG Resources Inc (NYSE:EOG), while  Cimarex Energy  Co (NYSE:XEC) and  PDC Energy  (NASDAQ:PDCE) Inc are top consolidation candidates, Portillo said.
Financial firms could emerge as buyers, as many companies carry heavy levels of debt. North American producers have around $86 billion of rated debt maturing through 2024, according to Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service.
""It's going to take the banks to take over companies and consolidate them into bigger companies,"" said one shale executive.
Bankruptcies are up 21% so far this year among energy producers, according to law firm Haynes and Boone.
Even combined companies would ""still have to walk the tightrope"" between trying to return capital to shareholders and spending to keep depleted shale fields pumping, said Andrew Dittmar, M&A analyst at Enverus. 
Shale output rebounded during the summer after the initial pandemic-induced lockdowns, but companies are investing less now. Shale production is expected to fall by 123,000 barrels per day in November, the largest drop since May, according to U.S. Energy Department figures.

Deals must add to cash flow, not add too much debt and have small premiums, said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones. ""Any deal that requires significant cost savings or a higher oil price to justify the price paid will not be well-received,"" she said.

1060,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 07:40PM ET</span>",Analysis: What monopoly case? DOJ lawsuit unlikely to knock Google from pole position,"By Raphael Satter
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice and 11 states filed their long-awaited competition lawsuit against Google on Tuesday - the most momentous antitrust showdown since Washington took on  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) more than two decades ago - but experts warn that anyone expecting a major shake-up of the tech industry is likely to be disappointed. 
Antitrust specialists see the upcoming action as more of a tremor than an earthquake. Even if the Justice Department takes the case to trial and wins, which is not guaranteed, any changes to the role played by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google in people's lives are likely to be incremental - and years away.
""They shouldn't see this as 'the beginning of the end,'"" said Eleanor Fox, a professor of trade regulation at the University of New York's law school. ""It certainly wouldn't go to the guts of what some people think is wrong with Google.""
Critics have argued for years that Google and other Big Tech companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) have too much power and routinely abuse their dominant market positions.
But government efforts to rein in powerful technology companies have historically proven challenging.
In Europe, regulators have filed three different antitrust actions against Google over the past decade and imposed more than 8 billion euros ($9.46 billion) in fines in response to complaints over Google's price comparison service, its Android mobile operating system, and its AdSense platform.
Christian Bergqvist, a professor of law at Denmark's Copenhagen University, said the U.S. antitrust action showed the U.S. government was belatedly adopting the more tech-skeptical European approach. 
""I think we are converging in some positive ways,"" Bergqvist said.
Still, he said the European example held cautionary lessons. In a study published last month, an academic advising Google's European competitors said the company's price-comparison service was still flouting the EU rules.
Google denies the allegation. But it is clear that years of hefty fines have had limited impact on the market dynamics in Europe, where Google's Chrome browser has an even larger share of the market than in the United States and Android remains dominant.
Previous U.S. antitrust lawsuits against Big Tech companies have also yielded mixed results. Microsoft largely prevailed in its 1990s showdown with the government, though many industry analysts believe the company's troubles in the 2000s stemmed in part from the pressures and distractions of the antitrust case.
Similarly, the government ultimately dropped a 1980s antitrust lawsuit against  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), though the company subsequently struggled. The government breakup of AT&T in 1984 is the counterpoint: that case brought a wholesale restructuring of the U.S. telecoms business that had broad impact on consumers and businesses alike.
FINE AND FORGET
The perceived failure of the fine-and-forget approach to Big Tech regulation has some critics pushing for solutions that look more like the AT&T breakup.
Ryan Shores, a U.S. Justice Department official, said on Tuesday that ""nothing is off the table"" when asked on a conference call what specific action should be taken. But legal observers were skeptical that government lawyers would go so far as to push for a breakup and in any case Bergqvist doubted the solution was workable.
""What is there to break up?"" he asked. ""Everything is free."" 
Bergqvist said Google's services were organized like a series of money-losing trenches protecting advertising, the company's ""cash cow."" Even if a couple of those trenches were taken over by competitors or transformed into a standalone business - such as YouTube or the Chrome browser, for example - Bergqvist said it was hard to see how they would survive on their own.
Absent an aggressive dismemberment of the company, experts believe a government victory or a settlement would likely lead to changes in how Google search works. But odds are they will not be sufficiently far-reaching for most people to notice a lot of difference.

""Google won't be unaffected by this, but it's unlikely that there's going to be substantial shifts in market position – in any of its markets,"" said Jonathan Rubin, whose Washington-based firm, MoginRubin LLP, specializes in antitrust law.

(Reuters) - Shares of  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) rallied 23% on Tuesday after the Snapchat messaging app owner beat user growth and revenue forecasts as more people signed up to chat with friends and family during the coronavirus pandemic.
Daily active users (DAUs), a widely watched metric by investors and advertisers, rose 18% year-over-year to 249 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, the company said in a statement. Analysts had expected 244 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company said it expected continued momentum in user growth and forecast about 257 million daily active users in the fourth quarter, exceeding analysts' current estimate of 249.81 million.
Revenue, mainly from selling ads on the app, jumped 52% to $679 million, widely beating analysts' consensus estimate of $555.9 million.
Snap has positioned itself as a safe place for brands to advertise because it focuses on one-on-one messages which disappear once they are read.
That reputation served Snap well in the third quarter, when over 1,000 advertisers boycotted larger rival  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) for the month of July in response to issues of hate speech on the platform, and as popular short-form video app TikTok faced the possibility of a U.S. ban over national security concerns.
It opened an opportunity for Snap as companies reviewed their ad spending, and helped contribute to revenue growth, said Jeremi Gorman, Snap's chief business officer, during an earnings call with analysts.
Snap has ""unique ad offerings, such as augmented-reality advertising,"" that helped its performance, said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst at research firm eMarketer.
The app has been able to grow its user base outside the United States and Europe by partnering with local telecommunication providers and building features like photo filters and lenses that are locally relevant, Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said during the earnings call. 
Average revenue per user was $2.73, up 28% from the year-go quarter.
Snap's net loss narrowed to $199.8 million, or 14 cents per share, from $227.37 million, or 16 cents per share, a year earlier.
Snap said current-quarter revenue could grow between 47% to 50% over the year-ago period, but cautioned that it was unclear how the pandemic would affect year-end holiday advertising.
Snap rose to $35.00 after closing 0.7% lower at $28.45.

Shares of Facebook,  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) and  Pinterest Inc  (N:PINS) also rose in after-hours trading.

Shares of the company, which also forecast current-quarter sales above estimates, were up nearly 2%.
TI, which supplies chips for everything from smartphones to automobiles, often reports quarterly results before its peers. Investors watch its numbers closely as a proxy for both the health of the industry and other sectors where semiconductors are key components.
The Dallas, Texas-based company said its sales also benefited from a notable rebound in demand from the automotive market, which grew 75% from the preceding quarter as North American and European vehicle assembly plants resumed operations. 
""While visibility for the near-term demand has improved, we remain cautious as the broader economic impact of the global pandemic could continue for several years,"" Dave Pahl, head of the company's investor relations, told analysts.
TI also fielded questions on the repercussions of a U.S. ban on sales to China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL].
Under rules issued in 2019, American chipmakers such as TI were allowed to keep shipping some chips to Huawei from their factories outside the United States. But new rules that took effect in September cut off virtually all sales to the firm.
TI said Huawei accounted for about 2% of its third-quarter sales. ""We are in compliance with U.S. export restrictions and stopped shipping to them (Huawei) on Sept. 14, and they are not included in our fourth-quarter revenue guidance,"" Pahl said.
TI expects fourth-quarter revenue of $3.41 billion to $3.69 billion, above expectations of $3.34 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Revenue in the third quarter rose 1% to $3.82 billion, beating estimates of $3.45 billion.

(Reuters) - When Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) reports results for the third quarter after the bell on Wednesday, it will be the next three months, and whether Chief Executive Elon Musk can achieve the company's ambitious year-end goal, that analysts will be interested in.
The electric carmaker has stuck to its forecast of delivering half a million vehicles in 2020 despite a global pandemic and economic upheaval that has sunk most of its internal combustion rivals deep into the red.
That means Tesla must deliver more than 181,600 vehicles in the last three months of the year - a 30% increase from record third quarter deliveries of 139,300 vehicles.
While several analysts believe that goal is attainable, others see a worsening macroeconomic environment ahead.
""I'm ... cautious about demand given the recessionary environment and accelerating pace of coronavirus infections, making it tough for the company to hit its 500K car sales target for the year,"" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at investing.com.
Analysts on average expect Tesla to report net income of $593 million in the third quarter on revenue of $8.4 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
Several analysts, including Frank Schwope at Nord/LB, believe the positive numbers are due to regulatory credits - payments Tesla receives from other carmakers to offset their emissions. 
Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said in July the carmaker expected credit revenue in 2020 to double from 2019 levels, but said that cash flow will eventually decline.
With recovery in the United States sluggish and Europe struggling with a second bout of the virus outbreak, Tesla analysts had pinned their hopes for growth on China, which has begun to recover as consumers shake off the pandemic's effects.
While Tesla does not break out regional sales, data from China's auto industry association CPCA showed Tesla Model 3 sedan sales remained roughly flat from July to September. Overall, Tesla sold a total of around 34,100 Shanghai-made Model 3s in the third quarter. 
Third-quarter registration data from California, Tesla's largest U.S. market, on Tuesday showed Tesla vehicle registrations dropped 13% compared with last year.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said in a note they hoped Tesla would provide investors with more details on Wednesday about the Chinese market and which countries compensated for lackluster demand in the world's second-largest economy.
Tesla plans to ramp up production over the coming years by expanding output at its Shanghai plant to 250,000 vehicles a year, including its crossover Model Y.

It is also building new vehicle and battery factories near Berlin, Germany, and Austin, Texas.

1065,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 05:15PM ET</span>",Former Goldman executive Chavez reflects on diversity on Wall Street,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Imani Moise
(Reuters) - Former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) executive Marty Chavez said on Tuesday Wall Street's position on diversity has evolved since he started at the megabank in the 1990s.
Chavez, who is Latino and openly gay, said he hesitated when he was first offered a position on Wall Street, fearing Goldman Sachs might see his identity as a gay man as a liability.
""I just blurted out to the gentleman who was hiring me - I think I need to tell you that I'm gay. And this was 1993,"" Chavez said, speaking on SALT Talks, a series of digital interviews with ""investors, creators and thinkers.""
""All he could think of to say was, 'Hey, do you have a boyfriend?' Which is I think maybe not the response you would have in 2020, but I took that to mean, woah, this must be a gay friendly place,"" he said.
""I think it would have been more accurate for me to have concluded that this was a place that didn't care if I was straight or gay. It just cared that I was good at math and software.""
Chavez retired as Goldman Sachs' co-head of the securities division at the end of last year. 
The banking industry has come under fire for a lack of racial and gender diversity in the wake of the ""Me Too"" movement and global protests over racial injustice.
Once considered a potential CEO candidate, Chavez held a number of roles during his 19 years at the firm, including chief information officer and chief financial officer.
Chavez said during his time on Wall Street, firms ""began to understand that diversity of your workforce was like diversification of your portfolio.""
But he said that there was a long way to go, and noted that his mentors were all ""straight white Jewish males.""

""If I had been waiting for a Latino mentor, or an LGBT mentor, or God forbid, one who is both Latino and LGBT, I'd still be out there waiting.""

1066,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 05:10PM ET</span>",Yield-starved investors aid Illinois' $850 million bond sale,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A yield-hungry U.S. municipal market brushed aside Illinois' massive fiscal challenges and snapped up $850 million of general obligations bonds the state sold on Tuesday. 
Illinois pays the market's biggest yield penalty among states, but the spread for its bonds over Municipal Market Data's (MMD) benchmark triple-A yield scale, which widened ahead of the issue, narrowed post-sale. 
The spread for five-year bonds shrunk by 50 basis points to 231 basis points, while the 10-year bond spread narrowed by 12 basis points to a still-hefty 269 basis points. 
""Everybody's so yield-starved even though (Illinois is) barely on the fringe of investment-grade at this point,"" said Greg Saulnier, MMD managing analyst.
Illinois is the lowest-rated state at a notch above junk due to its huge unfunded pension liability and chronic structural budget deficit. All three major credit rating agencies assigned negative outlooks to their ratings in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
The state's fiscal woes have been compounded by the economic fallout from the pandemic, which has seen a resurgence with an increase in cases. There is also uncertainty over a constitutional amendment on the Nov. 3 ballot to replace Illinois' flat income tax rate with graduated rates -- a move that would tax high earners more and raise about $3.1 billion annually.
Illinois, which has already borrowed $1.2 billion through the U.S. Federal Reserve's Municipal Liquidity Facility, is hoping to avoid borrowing up to $5 billion more if unrestricted virus aid to states is approved in Washington.
Saulnier said the bond sale also might have been helped by speculation about a ""blue wave"" in the general election, with a Democratic president and Congress expected to approve more aid to states and local governments.

Investing.com - Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported on Tuesday third quarter earnings missed Wall Street estimates as subscriber growth fell short after pandemic-led demand seen earlier in the year faded.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fell 5%.
Netflix announced earnings per share of $1.74 on revenue of $6.44 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $2.13 on revenue of $6.39 billion.
Subscriber numbers grew by 2.2 million during the three months that ended September 30, below its guidance of 2.5 million net adds.
""As we expected, growth has slowed with 2.2m paid net adds in Q3 vs. 6.8m in Q3’19. We think this is primarily due to our record first half results and the pull-forward effect we described in our April and July letters. In the first nine months of 2020, we added 28.1m paid memberships, which exceeds the 27.8m that we added for all of 2019,"" the company said.
Netflix's aggressive spending on content has placed increased scrutiny on its cash burn, but the company upgraded its outlook on cash generation following improved third-straight quarter.
Cash generated by operating activities in Q3 was $1.3 billion, compared with a decline of $502 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow, meanwhile, was positive for a third consecutive quarter following an increase of $1.1 billion, compared with a decline of $551 million in Q3 2019. Free cash generation was $2.2 billion year-to-date, a sharp contrast from the $1.6 billion decline seen in the first nine months of 2019.
""As productions increasingly restart, we expect Q4’20 FCF to be slightly negative and therefore, for the full year 2020, we forecast FCF to be approximately $2 billion, up from our prior expectation of break-even to positive,"" the company said.
Looking ahead to the final quarter, Netflix forecast 6.0 million paid net adds, down from 8.8 million the prior year. The streaming giant also acknowledged increased competition after Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS)restructured operations to focus more on its streaming business.
""Disney’s recent management reorganization signals that it is embracing the shift to streaming entertainment. We’re thrilled to be competing with Disney and a growing number of other 5 players to entertain people; both consumers and content creators will benefit from our mutual desire to bring the best stories to audiences all over the world,"" Netflix said.
Netflix is up more than 53% for the year so far, but will likely see near-term pressure, experts said.
""Netflix net additions clearly show that the pandemic-induced boom is tapering off and it will be hard for the company to repeat a similar or better performance next year. In that scenario, there is no reason for its stock to continue its upward journey in the short-run. That said, Netflix continues to remain the dominant player in the streaming business and further strengthening its lead during the pandemic,"" Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said.

1068,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 04:45PM ET</span>",Pioneer to Buy Parsley for $4.5 Billion in Latest Shale Deal,"(Bloomberg) --  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) Co. agreed to buy Permian Basin peer  Parsley Energy  (NYSE:PE) Inc. for $4.5 billion in stock, the latest in a flurry of mergers that’s quickly reshaping the beleaguered U.S. shale oil industry.
Pioneer said Tuesday in a statement the transaction represents a 7.9% deal premium for Parsley holders based on closing prices from a day earlier, just before talks between the companies were first reported. The deal will lead to $325 million of cost cuts and add to earnings in its first year, the Irving, Texas-based company said.
The sector is in full-on merger mode with more than $30 billion of transactions announced or completed in the past few weeks. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) announced Monday its $9.7 billion takeover of Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) Inc., while earlier this month  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) completed its takeover of  Noble Energy  Inc (NASDAQ:NBL).
A plunge in oil prices to around $40 a barrel due to the Covid-19 pandemic is putting pressure on energy companies all around the world, particularly in the U.S., where many debt-laden shale operators are losing money. Investors have increasingly lost patience with the sector and some have called for consolidation to reduce costs and borrowing costs.
“The inevitable consolidation in the Permian marches on,” Wil VanLoh Jr., a Parsley director and chief executive officer of Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Energy Partners, the largest investor in the company, said in the statement.
A Pioneer-Parsley combination creates one of the largest players in the prolific Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, which produces more oil output than every OPEC member except Saudi Arabia. The newly enlarged Pioneer’s production in the shale formation would grow by more than 40% to the equivalent of roughly 558,000 barrels of oil a day, according to regulatory filings and data from energy analysis firm Enverus compiled by Bloomberg, rivaling only Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). and Chevron Corp.
Shares of Parsley fell 2.1% to $10.38 at 4:29 p.m. in New York after the close of regular trading, while Pioneer dropped 0.6% to $83.
Initial reports of the deal talks between Pioneer and Parsley raised eyebrows among some onlookers because Pioneer Chief Executive Officer Scott Sheffield is the father of Parsley chairman Bryan Sheffield. More of the family’s wealth is tied up with Parsley than Pioneer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The deal already appears to have strong support from two of Parsley’s top shareholders. Bryan Sheffield’s stake in Parsley is amplified by his holdings of Class B shares, which give him overall voting power of 7.8%. Quantum Energy Partners holds a further 17% of the stock and said it supports the deal.

1069,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 04:30PM ET</span>","Less carbon, more electric vehicles: automakers prepare for potential Biden win","By David Shepardson and Tina Bellon
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Automakers are gearing up for tough new vehicle emissions rules and policies favoring electric vehicles if Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden wins the White House. 
Biden and U.S. President Donald Trump both need the votes of auto workers in Midwestern swing states such as Michigan and Ohio, and both say they want automakers to create more auto jobs in the United States, rather than Mexico or China.
From there, Trump's and Biden's policies for autos and transportation diverge, presenting automakers with very different sets of risks and rewards. 
If elected, Biden is expected to quickly reinstate the legal basis for California's zero-emission vehicle rules and begin the process of reversing the Trump administration's decision to ease fuel efficiency and carbon emission requirements through 2025. 
Automakers could also face sharply higher penalties for failing to meet fuel-efficiency requirements. The Trump administration rolled back those penalties, which the industry said saved at least $1 billion in annual compliance costs, but a federal appeals court in August reversed the administration action. 
However, Biden's positions offer the auto industry some offsetting gains. Under Trump, the White House rejected new tax credits for electric vehicles while making it easier to sell gas-guzzling SUVs. 
Biden promises new tax incentives including rebates to buy EVs and a dramatic expansion of charging stations for electric vehicles - policy measures automakers have long advocated. 
Days after Trump won the 2016 election, the trade group representing major automakers in Washington called on him to reconsider fuel-efficiency standards proposed by the outgoing Obama administration, and backed by California and other coastal states. 
Now, the industry is divided. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Honda Motor Co, Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and others struck a compromise deal with California on emissions requirements, while General Motors Co (NYSE:GM),  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV sided with Trump in an effort to freeze out California and roll back emissions requirements. 
One question will be whether automakers who backed the Trump rollback continue their legal fight in the courts should he lose his re-election bid. 
John Bozzella, who heads an auto industry trade group, said in a statement automakers are ""committed to a cleaner, safer, smarter future and we understand the importance of working with all parties to achieve these goals."" 
Who constitutes ""all parties"" could change if Biden wins. Environmental groups and unions want more prominent roles in determining auto policy. 
ENDORSEMENTS, DONATIONS
The automotive industry traditionally donates more to U.S. Republican lawmakers. And while 60% of automotive campaign contributions have flowed to Republican candidates in 2020, the gap has narrowed from 2018, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
GM in 2019 drew the ire of Trump for its decision to close an Ohio car assembly plant as part of a larger plan to shut down four North American factories and cut 15,000 jobs. Trump eventually took credit for GM selling the plant to an electric pickup truck company and promising to invest $700 million in the battleground state.
On Tuesday, GM said it is investing $2 billion in six U.S. facilities and would build its new Cadillac electric SUV at its Spring Hill, Tennessee, assembly plant.
U.S. Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who represents thousands of auto workers, said Biden is committed to bringing various groups together to reach agreement on emissions rules.
Dingell added if automakers made an emissions proposal it would be seen as a ""floor"" for negotiations, ""so I think it's got to come out from the environmentalist community and the unions working together."" 
The United Auto Workers (UAW) union, representing more than 400,000 active members, in April reliably endorsed the presidential Democratic candidate. But nearly a third of UAW members defied their union's recommendation in the 2016 election by voting for Trump. 
SHIFT TO EVs
UAW members are skeptical of open trade deals, and are concerned a shift to electric vehicles, combined with tougher emissions standards for the trucks and SUVs many of them build, will mean fewer jobs. 
The UAW told Reuters that what is needed is ""a transition to EV production that takes full advantage of economic opportunities and ensures that there are quality manufacturing jobs for tens of thousands of American workers that currently work on gas and diesel powered engines.""
California wants to ban all gasoline-powered passenger vehicles by 2035 and on Friday a New Jersey state environmental agency recommended the state ensure all passenger vehicles sold by 2035 are electric to meet emissions goals. 
Some lawmakers are considering tax credits to help convert some engine and other auto facilities into building electric vehicle components. 
""Climate-friendly policies and a good economy are not at loggerheads,"" said U.S. Representative Andy Levin, a Michigan Democrat whose district just north of Detroit is a presidential campaign battleground. 
Trump has sought to capitalize on fears about electric vehicles. He has falsely said Biden backed a ban on gasoline-powered vehicles. Trump told Fox Business News in an interview last week that Democrats would ""like to go one car per family and make it all electric."" 

Democrats have not called for any limit on cars per family.

Nancy King, global head of commodities, and Jay Rubenstein, head of commodities trading, are leaving, the Bloomberg report said. The departures were first reported by energy news service SparkSpread.
The move has stoked concerns among some market participants about use of different communications services. Commodity trading brokers across the world commonly use messaging services including WhatsApp, WeChat and Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) chat to communicate with traders who put in orders and execute trades.
However, banks, oil majors and commodity merchants have long had strict compliance rules when it comes to communications and several sources have expressed concerns about being monitored by companies when using chat services. 
Shell (LON:RDSa) Trading, for example, records and monitors communications (including those by telephone, mobile phones, IM, e-mail and other media) for legal, regulatory and/or business purposes, where it is legally permissible to do so. 
This month, Reuters reported  BP  (L:BP) terminated four trading and operations staff responsible for Chinese crude oil sales as a result of an internal investigation into trades with Singapore's Hontop Energy.
One of the sources said that a factor behind the terminations was improper use of the WeChat messaging platform as a tool for commercial discussions with counterparties. 
Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. King and Rubenstein did not respond to requests for comment. 
The bank did not find any wrongdoing, but the use of those communication channels went against policy, according to the Bloomberg report.
King joined Morgan Stanley as an oil trader in 1986 and was named the sole global head of commodities in June 2016.

Rubenstein joined in 2007 as a power trader and was named global head of commodities trading in June last year, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.

1076,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 03:40PM ET</span>",U.S. says Google breakup may be needed to end violations of antitrust law,"By Diane Bartz and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. sued Google on Tuesday, accusing the $1 trillion company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals in the biggest challenge to the power and influence of Big Tech in decades. 
The Justice Department lawsuit could lead to the break-up of an iconic company that has become all but synonymous with the internet and assumed a central role in the day-to-day lives of billions of people around the globe. 
Such an outcome is far from assured, however, and the case is likely to take years to resolve.
The lawsuit marks the first time the U.S. has cracked down on a major tech company since it sued  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) for anti-competitive practices in 1998. A settlement left the company intact, though the government's prior foray into Big Tech anti-trust - the 1974 case against AT&T - led to the breakup of the Bell System.
The federal government's complaint against Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's, which alleges that Google acted unlawfully to maintain its position in search and search advertising on the internet, was joined by 11 states. ""Absent a court order, Google will continue executing its anticompetitive strategy, crippling the competitive process, reducing consumer choice, and stifling innovation,"" the lawsuit states.
The government said Google has nearly 90% of all general search engine queries in the United States and almost 95% of searches on mobile.
Attorney General Bill Barr said his investigators had found Google does not compete on the quality of its search results but instead bought its success through payments to mobile phone makers and others.
""The end result is that no one can feasibly challenge Google's dominance in search and search advertising,"" Barr said.
When asked on a conference call if the department was seeking a breakup or another remedy, Ryan Shores, a Justice Department official, said, ""Nothing is off the table, but a question of remedies is best addressed by the court after it's had a chance to hear all the evidence."" 
In its complaint, the Justice Department said that Americans were hurt by Google's actions. In its ""request for relief,"" it said it was seeking ""structural relief as needed to cure any anti-competitive harm."" ""Structural relief"" in antitrust matters generally means the sale of an asset.
""Ultimately it is consumers and advertisers that suffer from less choice, less innovation and less competitive advertising prices,"" the lawsuit states. ""So we are asking the court to break Google's grip on search distribution so the competition and innovation can take hold."" 
Google called the lawsuit ""deeply flawed,"" adding that people ""use Google because they choose to - not because they're forced to or because they can't find alternatives.""
Investors seemed to shrug off news of the lawsuit, sending shares Alphabet up 1.9% to $1,563.51 on Tuesday afternoon. 
""It's like locking the proverbial door after the horse has bolted,"" said Neil Campling, head of tech media and telecom research at Mirabaud Securities in London, who added Google has already invested billions of dollars in infrastructure, technologies and talent. ""You can’t simply unwind a decade of significant progress.""
POLITICAL ELEMENT
Tuesday's federal lawsuit marks a rare moment of agreement between the Trump administration and progressive Democrats. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted on Sept. 10, using the hash tag #BreakUpBigTech, that she wanted ""swift, aggressive action.""
Still, coming just days before the U.S. presidential election, the filing's timing could be seen as a political gesture since it fulfills a promise made by President Donald Trump to his supporters to hold certain companies to account for allegedly stifling conservative voices.
Republicans often complain that social media companies including Google take action to reduce the spread of conservative viewpoints on their platforms. Lawmakers have sought, without explaining how, to use antitrust laws to compel Big Tech to stop these alleged limitations.
The complaint pointed to the billions of dollars that Google pays to smartphone makers such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) , Samsung (KS:005930) and others to make Google's search engine the default on their devices.
This means that rival search engines never get the scale they need to improve their algorithms, and grow, the complaint said.
""General search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising require complex algorithms that are constantly learning which organic results and ads best respond to user queries,"" the government said in its complaint. ""By using distribution agreements to lock up scale for itself and deny it to others, Google unlawfully maintains its monopolies.""
Google has been successful at protecting its profit derived from the Android mobile operating system, which is officially open source but companies that change it are barred from lucrative revenue-sharing agreements.
Justice Department investigators found an internal Google analysis of restrictive agreements determined that just 1% of Google’s worldwide Android search revenue was at risk of being lost to competitors.
""This analysis noted that the growth in Google’s search advertising revenue from Android distribution was 'driven by increased platform protection efforts and agreements,'"" the complaint found.
OTHER CHALLENGES
The 11 states that joined the lawsuit all have Republican attorneys general.
More lawsuits could be in the offing since probes by state attorneys general into Google's broader businesses are under way, as well as an investigation of its broader digital advertising businesses. Attorneys general led by Texas are expected to file a separate lawsuit focused on digital advertising as soon as November, while a group led by Colorado is contemplating a more expansive lawsuit against Google.
The lawsuit comes more than a year after the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission began antitrust investigations into four big tech companies: Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) , Apple,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Google.
Seven years ago, the FTC settled an antitrust probe into Google over alleged bias in its search function to favor its products, among other issues. The settlement came over the objections of some FTC staff attorneys.
Google has faced similar legal challenges overseas.

The European Union fined Google $1.7 billion in 2019 for stopping websites from using Google's rivals to find advertisers, $2.6 billion in 2017 for favoring its own shopping business in search, and $4.9 billion in 2018 for blocking rivals on its wireless Android operating system.

Pelosi suggested progress had been made with the White House on recent stimulus talks and she was hopeful a deal could be brokered by the end of the day. The house speaker conceded, however, that state and local money along with business liability remained sticking points.
Both sides resumed talks at 3PM ET today, after negotiations a day earlier helped chip away at differences.
Stocks tied to the economy like industrials, materials and financials racked up gains intraday.
Financials got a boost from rising banking stocks, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in the spotlight, up more than 2%, after the latter was reported to have reached a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice to pay over $2 billion for its role in the 1MDB scandal.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) were up more than 1%, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) added more than 2%.
In tech, meanwhile, further signs of a government crackdown on the monopoly power of large cap tech did little to dent investor sentiment on the sector.
The U.S. government filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google on allegations it had violated competition law to preserve its monopoly over internet searches and online advertising.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL rose more than 2%, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) jumped 3%.
Elsewhere in tech, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) fell 6% after reporting a third straight quarterly decline in revenue and keeping its guidance sidelined amid uncertainty from the ongoing pandemic.
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) was up more than 0.5% after raising its guidance and reporting quarterly results that topped Wall Street estimates in the wake of a pandemic-led boost to demand for its household products.
In other news, cash-strapped move chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) slumped more than 12% after warning of possible bankruptcy as it continues to seek additional liquidity to plug the financial hole as a result of the pandemic."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares on Wall Street climbed on Tuesday on growing optimism that talks among U.S. lawmakers are progressing with respect to a U.S. stimulus package aimed at cushioning the economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic.
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was optimistic Democrats could reach a deal with the White House that could get aid out by early next month. She added there should be an indication of a possible agreement later on Tuesday.
Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will also talk at 3 p.m. ET (1900 GMT) on Tuesday, according to a source.
King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco, said he doesn't believe a full stimulus package would be passed though.
""It's kind of hard to bridge the gap between $1.8 trillion and $2.3 trillion, but a deal could at least get us through the elections or until December,"" Lip said. ""By that time, we may have a comprehensive package.""
Uncertainty over the coronavirus aid package weighed on Wall Street's main indexes on Monday and analysts expect market turbulence to increase with only two weeks left until Election Day.
Latest national opinion polls pointed to a victory for Democratic challenger Joe Biden, though the contest is closer in swing states that decide elections, including Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.
The U.S. Justice Department and 11 states, meanwhile, filed an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google for allegedly breaking the law in using its market power to fend off rivals. Alphabet's shares were up 2.4%.
""It's like locking the proverbial door after the horse has bolted,"" said Neil Campling, head of TMT research at Mirabaud Securities in London.
""Google has already got the monopolistic position, has invested billions in infrastructure, AI, technologies, software, engineering and talent. You can't simply unwind a decade of significant progress, or create new alternative powerhouses or tech ecosystems out of thin air.""
In mid-afternoon trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 285.28 points, or 1.01%, to 28,480.7, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 38.65 points, or 1.13%, to 3,465.57 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 114.73 points, or 1%, to 11,593.61.
Meanwhile, the third-quarter earnings season has gathered momentum. Of the 66 S&P 500 companies that have reported results, 86.4% have topped expectations for earnings, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos Inc (N:TRV) gained 4.9% as it beat quarterly profit expectations, while consumer products giant Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) advanced 0.6% as it raised its full-year sales and earnings forecasts.
Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) was flat ahead of its third-quarter earnings report.
International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) edged past estimates for quarterly revenue on Monday, bolstered by higher demand for its cloud services. The company's shares, however, fell 5.8% after it stayed away from issuing a current-quarter outlook, citing economic uncertainty related to the pandemic.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.33-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.53-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 25 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 63 new highs and 26 new lows.

1079,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 02:18PM ET</span>","Bitcoin Pushes Past $12,000 Mark for First Time Since September","(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin climbed above $12,000 for the first time in more than a month, breaching a key level that chartists and technicians say might set the largest cryptocurrency up for further gains.
The digital token increased as much as 2.7% to $12,052 in New York on Tuesday, before retreating slightly from the high from the day. That’s Bitcoin’s highest level since Sept. 2.
“Before investors look to the next bull run, we need to see the price remain above $12,000 for an extended period of time,” said Simon Peters, analyst at investment platform eToro. “Then investors should look to $14,000 as the next target.”
Though Bitcoin’s remained volatile all year -- often moving up when U.S. equities do and selling off during risk-off stretches -- it’s been buoyed by a string of positive catalysts in recent weeks. Bulls cite greater institutional acceptance, for instance, with Fidelity Investments launching a Bitcoin fund and a couple of public companies investing in the coin.
“We see a significant increase in institutional players entering the crypto market,” said Eric Demuth, co-founder and chief executive officer of Bitpanda. “There is a lot of capital available that is not only going into the traditional financial market.”
This week, many crypto fans pointed to a panel hosted by the International Monetary Fund during which Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank is evaluating the costs and benefits of a digital currency.
Bitcoin last traded above $12,000 in September though it didn’t hold above that level for long. September was its worst month since March, with the coin losing more than 8%.
Though peer coins tend to move in tandem with Bitcoin, many fell during Tuesday’s session. Dash and Monero each lost about 4%.

1081,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 01:50PM ET</span>","Canada working on possible aid for the airlines and travel sector, says finance minister","OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian government is very aware of the challenges facing airlines and the travel sector during the coronavirus pandemic and is working on possible aid, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday.
Freeland said she had spoken to the heads of Canada's major airlines and unions last week but did not give details. Carriers and travel industry executives have repeatedly urged Ottawa for assistance as passenger numbers slump.
""We are obviously aware of the particular challenges that the travel sector, the airlines are facing right now,"" she told a news conference when asked about an aid package.
""It's definitely an issue we are looking at closely and working on,"" she said.
Airlines have already received more than C$1 billion ($763 million) from a wage subsidy program that Ottawa introduced to help businesses deal with the pandemic, she said.
Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc told CTV on Sunday that Ottawa might take a stake in major airlines such as Air Canada and WestJet Airlines. Both carriers have suspended dozens of routes.
The Canadian branch of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers on Tuesday urged Freeland to consider partially or fully nationalizing Air Canada. 
Earlier this month major labor unions said the aviation sector would suffer permanent damage unless Ottawa provided a C$7 billion 10-year low-interest loan to offset the effects of the pandemic.

1082,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",Waiting for aid: U.S. airline workers 'pawns' in stimulus battle,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - When she is not helping her kids with remote school or worrying about her next mortgage payment, Jessica Trujillo spends her days rallying friends and co-workers to lobby Washington for federal aid to protect airline workers who feel their fates are trapped in a political tug-of-war.
The industry has so far failed to secure another $25 billion bailout for coronavirus-slammed airlines; however, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday she was optimistic Democrats could reach a deal with the Republican Trump administration on additional COVID-19 relief that could get aid out by early next month.
Airlines had pushed for broad COVID-19 legislation or a standalone bill before Sept. 30, when a first package tied to job protections expired despite wide bipartisan support as Democrats and Republicans wrestled with conflicting agendas and priorities before the Nov. 3 election.
""We're pawns,"" said Houston resident Trujillo, one of at least 50,000 airline workers - along with her flight attendant husband Rene - without a paycheck. Both are members of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which is among the airline unions that has helped organize lobbying efforts.
United Airlines (O:UAL) and American Airlines (O:AAL), two of the top three U.S. carriers, have furloughed 32,000 workers. At least 20,000 other employees of the two companies have taken unpaid leaves of absence while watching rollercoaster negotiations in Washington that have seen prospects for more aid rise and fall on a daily, and even hourly, basis.
""We are bare-bones right now and the emotions back and forth are really really hard,"" said Trujillo. She and her husband both chose unpaid leave from United in order to ensure medical coverage after Rene's brother, who did not have health insurance, died from coronavirus in September. 
Employees from gate agents to pilots have spent the past three months bombarding lawmakers with phone calls, letters, emails, social media posts and marches pleading for more airline payroll support either through a large COVID-19 relief deal or a standalone bill.
President Donald Trump on Tuesday pushed for a comprehensive COVID-19 relief package, saying he would accept a deal worth more than the $2.2 trillion floated by Pelosi despite opposition to large spending measures among his fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate.
""I think I can speak for a lot of my colleagues when we say we’ve lost faith in our elected officials,"" said Miami-based Phillip Delahunty, one of 19,000 furloughed American Airlines employees. ""I feel like our livelihoods and our well-being are being used for political gain in this country right now."" 
Congressional aides said Monday the chances for a standalone measure to provide payroll assistance to U.S. airlines before the Nov. 3 election had dimmed. 

United and American have both vowed to bring back employees if lawmakers extend relief. ""It's like we're in purgatory,"" said Jennyne Trani, a single mom in Las Vegas who was furloughed by United and has held off on moving her family somewhere more affordable while she awaits news from Washington. ""Just tell us,"" she said. ""I gotta figure my life out.""

1083,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 01:35PM ET</span>",Wall Street backs Intel's $9 billion sale of NAND unit to Hynix,"(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s $9 billion sale of its NAND memory chip unit will help the U.S. chip giant focus on its core business in higher-margin processors, Wall Street analysts said on Tuesday, after its deal with South Korea's SK Hynix Inc.
Intel, best known for making computer processors used in desktops and laptops, has been trying to focus more on its strengths, including the Optane memory business, which is smaller but lucrative as it taps more advanced technology.
Exiting the NAND chips business will also help the chipmaker fend off the impact on profit from being in a cut-throat commodity memory market, where prices cycle through booms and busts.
Cowen and Co analysts said the deal was critical for Intel as it would lessen ""the product and manufacturing variables"" required to get its core PC/server processor businesses back on track.
SK Hynix had 11.7% market share in the NAND Flash market in the second quarter, while Intel occupied 11.5%, according to technology research firm TrendForce, placing the two companies in fourth and sixth places, respectively.
The deal, the biggest acquisition for SK Hynix, will help it overtake Kioxia in the NAND memory market, while narrowing the gap with market leader Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd.
Analysts said with only six players in the market, the value of  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) Technologies' NAND assets are on the rise.
Evercore ISI, however, said the deal may not alter the industry dynamics as six players are still too many. ""Further industry consolidation necessary,"" said analyst C.J. Muse.
Twenty-one of the forty-two analysts rated the stock at ""hold"", while 10 rated it at ""buy"" or higher. The median price target is $55, down from $62 in July, Refinitiv data showed.

Intel shares, which have fallen nearly 8% so far this year, were marginally down in morning trading on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc agreed to pay $4.14 million to settle civil allegations that a Turkish subsidiary committed ""egregious"" violations of U.S. sanctions against Iran, the U.S. Treasury Department said on Tuesday.
The department's Office of Foreign Assets Control said Iscar Turkey sold 144 shipments of cutting tools and related inserts worth $383,443 to two Turkish distributors from December 2012 to January 2016, knowing they would be shipped to a distributor in Iran for resale, including to Iran's government.
OFAC said the sales occurred under the direction of some senior managers, after Iscar Turkey's general manager concluded it was ""inevitable"" that U.S. and European Union sanctions against Iran would be lifted and sought to be ""well positioned"" to capitalize.
It also said Iscar Turkey took steps to ""obfuscate"" its dealings with Iran and concealed them from Berkshire, despite warnings that the sales would violate its compliance policies.
Berkshire voluntarily reported the apparent violations in May 2016 after receiving an anonymous tip, replaced employees who were involved, and upgraded compliance procedures for its foreign subsidiaries, OFAC said.
The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Iscar Turkey, also known as Iscar Kesici Takim Ticareti ve Imalati Limited Sirket, is a unit of IMC International Metalworking Cos, a maker of metal cutting tools.
Berkshire paid $4 billion for 80% of Israel-based IMC in 2006, and $2.05 billion for the remainder in 2013.
IMC remains Buffett's largest acquisition of a non-U.S. company. Berkshire also owns dozens of other companies including the BNSF railroad and the Geico auto insurer.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Washington's decision to impose financial sanctions on the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is overshadowing the search for her successor, with countries deadlocked over a post that has new visibility as the target of American anger.
The court's 123 member countries are due to meet in New York on Dec. 7, when they are meant to pick a successor for Fatou Bensouda, the court's Gambian chief prosecutor whose term expires in June. A shortlist of four candidates has been drawn up for the nine-year term, narrowed down from a list of 14 by a panel of diplomats and experts.
But in a letter, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, the court's oversight body wrote to inform members that none of the four nominees had enough support. It proposed widening the search to include all 14 of the original candidates.
Diplomats say the U.S. sanctions are not the main reason for the disagreement over the body's leadership. But the sanctions have drawn greater international attention to the process, added to the objections some countries have with the shortlist, and raised the stakes of a potentially damaging fight.
""Its been a refrain from the U.S. that the ICC is not a judicial institution but a political one. It will haunt us for nine years if the decision of who will be the new prosecutor is a political one and not a merit based one,"" said one diplomat.
According to diplomats, who discussed the selection process on condition of anonymity, some countries argue the four shortlisted candidates lack the international stature needed to stand up to Washington.
But other countries say any decision to change the procedure so late in the process would only make the situation worse, by adding to criticism that the court has become politicised.
In a letter sent to all members on behalf of Sierra Leone and a dozen other African states, signatories objected to a ""striking deviation from the principles of inclusiveness, transparency, fairness and informed decision-making"".
Liz Evenson, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, said: ""We would see a real risk in deviating from the procedure which was put in place to de-politicise the election of the prosecutor. Any process going forward needs to ensure a close look at all candidates with merit in mind.""
PERSONAL SANCTIONS
President Donald Trump's administration announced personal financial sanctions on Bensouda in September, citing the court's decision to look into activities of U.S. troops as part of a wider investigation into potential war crimes in Afghanistan.
The U.S. move was criticised by a number of countries as a misuse of sanctions powers, targeting the head of a major international justice body with measures normally reserved for terrorists, drug lords and human rights abusers.
The four lawyers on the shortlist to succeed Bensouda are Morris Anyah of the United States and Nigeria, Fergal Gaynor of Ireland, Susan Okalany of Uganda and Richard Roy of Canada.
Gaynor and Roy told Reuters they were committed to going forward with a transparent election process. Anyah and Okalany did not respond to requests for comment.
""My understanding is that of the four short-listed candidates I have the most support from states parties,"" Gaynor told Reuters.
Though the identities of the ten candidates who failed to make the shortlist have not been released publicly, one of those said to have been interested in the job is Serge Brammertz, a Belgian now serving as UN chief prosecutor for the Rwandan and Yugoslav war crimes tribunals. 
Diplomats supporting his candidacy have argued he has more senior international experience than those on the shortlist, making him better able to withstand U.S. pressure, according to sources close to the process.
After the U.S. sanctions were imposed, Bensouda, a former minister of justice of The Gambia and trial attorney at the UN tribunal for the Rwandan genocide, abruptly found her bank accounts frozen and credit cards cancelled.

Though so far none of the candidates to replace her has withdrawn, diplomats say the U.S. action changes the personal calculation of anyone up for the job, knowing that they and their family members could be caught up in any U.S. reprisals.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen Group (DE:VOWG_p) is hosting preliminary talks with potential bidders for its Ducati brand to gauge potential interest in the motorcycle maker ahead of a November planning round, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
During the five-year planning round, VW will review the future of its Ducati brand as well as of its super sports car brands Lamborghini and Bugatti, they said. 
Volkswagen is analyzing the future of Lamborghini, Bugatti and Ducati as part of broader quest for more economies of scale as it shifts to mass producing electric cars and as the company tries to more than double its value to 200 billion euros.
The review could result in technology partnerships for the high-performance sports car and superbike brands, restructuring, or other options up to and including a listing or sale, the people said.
Whether Volkswagen agrees to kick off a formal sales process at that meeting is still uncertain, but for a sale to be possible early next year, investors and bankers need to gauge price expectations and potential strategic fit, a second person familiar with the discussions said.
""There is some movement here,"" one of these sources said, commenting on the potential kick-off of a Ducati auction. No decision has been taken yet, the source added. 
Two other people close to the matter said that Volkswagen is expected to launch the sales process in early 2021 and may mandate a sellside advisor before Christmas.
Volkswagen declined to comment.
Volkswagen attempted to sell Ducati in 2017, when peer  Bajaj Auto  (NS:BAJA) in a tie-up with KTM, as well as Polaris (N:PII) and private equity groups Bain, PAI and Investindustrial expressed interest in buying the Italian motorbike brand.
A sale met oppostion from labour leaders and was shelved.
As part of its next strategy review Volkswagen is also drawing up plans to carve out Lamborghini and has sounded out bankers and potential investors about listing the Italian sports car maker on the stock market, sources told Reuters.
A listing could be attempted in 2021, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.

Italian supercar rival  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) saw its valuation more than treble since  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) listed it in 2016 though shares in rival  Aston Martin  (L:AML) have slumped since its IPO in 2018.

(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) raised its annual sales and earnings forecasts on Tuesday, as coronavirus-driven home cleaning pushed sales of the consumer goods giant's home care products as much as 30% higher.
P&G's shares, up 14% this year, rose another 2% after the numbers suggested consumers are spending the cash they have saved by traveling and socializing less this year on its higher-priced branded goods.
The maker of Tide and Ariel detergent has also benefited from people washing their clothes more often and its organic sales overall rose 9% in the first quarter.
Grooming products also saw their first rise in sales growth since the start of the year, as electronic stores in Europe placed more orders for trimmers and other styling products.
Although demand from retailers remains elevated, the company cautioned it would not stay at levels seen during the July-September period, when most economies relaxed lockdowns and orders picked up.
Sales of home care products like Mr Clean rose by double-digits percentages across its regions and those of personal cleansing products were up 30%, P&G's finance chief, Jon Moeller, said.
That showed the resilience of its branded goods, Moeller said, while calling out a decline in the share of store-branded labels in the United States and Europe.
P&G said it now expects full-year sales to rise 3% to 4%, compared with earlier forecasts of 1% to 3%.
Earlier in the day, Lysol maker  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) also lifted its full-year outlook, showing demand was still healthy in the industry despite tough economic conditions.
""There's just ... a willingness to spend just a little bit more to ensure that I'm using a product that ... will work for me and for my family,"" Moeller said on a media call.

P&G also expects full-year core earnings per share to be up 5% to 8%, compared with 3% to 7% earlier, and said it would aim to buy back $7 billion to $9 billion in shares in fiscal 2021.

(Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc on Tuesday said it will produce chips for 5G telecommunications networking gear, marking the first entry by a major American technology company into a market dominated by European and Chinese firms.
San Diego-based Qualcomm is already the largest supplier of chips for mobile phones, including the modem chips that connect handsets to newer 5G wireless data networks capable of faster speeds than LTE networks. But the market for the 5G base stations and other infrastructure purchased by telecommunications carriers has been dominated by players such as Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and, before the U.S. government moved to cut off its ability to secure semiconductors, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL].
Qualcomm does not plan to challenge those players directly. Instead, it is aiming to potentially become a supplier of chips to those companies and others as the technology in 5G base stations shifts.
Today, 5G base stations are much like early cellular phones, where a single player designs the entire device from top to bottom, ordering up custom chips and writing custom software. But the smart phone sector eventually exploded when Qualcomm began supplying industry standard phone processor chips and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Android operating system enabled hundreds of phone makers to enter the market by basing their devices on the Qulacomm-Android combination.
Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm's president, said a similar trend is now playing out with 5G base stations, where companies like  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and others are working to write software that will run ""virtualized"" 5G base stations. Qualcomm wants to supply the chips for those stations to both existing makers and any new entrants.

""I think we have the advantage in thinking about the next generation infrastructure. We don't have to worry about any legacy products, so we can start designing something from scratch,"" Amon told Reuters in an interview.

“The problem is, the banks over the last 30 years have focused their attention on things like issuing derivatives, CDSs, trading, commodities: They found a lot more lucrative ways of making money,” Stiglitz said in an interview Tuesday on Bloomberg Television Tuesday with Tom Keene and Lisa Abramowicz.
“So if we stop some of their bad activities -- market manipulation, predatory lending -- and encourage them to do what their mandate is, which is lending to small businesses, I think it would actually create much more opportunity,” said Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University.

(Reuters) - Wall Street expects U.S. automakers to report strong results for the third quarter, as a recovery in sales after this year's initial coronavirus lockdowns tightens inventory for an industry watching cases in Europe and the United States rise. 
Starting with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Wednesday, investors will be most focussed on what executives have to say about the quarters ahead, as signs grow that the pandemic, which halted work earlier in the year, is again worsening.
""It's going to be pretty strong earnings across the board,” said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) industry analyst Emmanuel Rosner, adding he expected all suppliers and carmakers to beat current forecasts. 
""Investors want to know what early 2021 is going to look like.""
The pace of U.S. car and light truck sales has increased each month since shutdowns were lifted, and plants are working at close to full speed to rebuild inventories for high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
In China too, General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) are recovering, registering double-digit sales growth for the quarter.
For GM, 12% year-on-year growth in July-September, marked the Detroit automaker’s first quarterly sales improvement in two years in the world's biggest market. For Ford, the 25% volume growth was its second consecutive quarterly sales increase in China after almost three years of decline.
Most analyst also see automakers firming up their cash flow positions and repaying debt. GM indicated in July it would generate enough cash to pay off a $16 billion loan by the end of the year. But only if the U.S. economy continued recovering and there were no further significant production shutdowns.

Shares of GM, down 9% so far this year, have recovered since hitting a low of $16.8 in March. Ford shares have fallen about 19% and were as low as $4 in mid-March.

1100,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>",Big Banks Need a Year’s Worth of Liquidity Under New U.S. Rule,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street banks will have to show their funding can withstand a full year of economic stress under a rule set for approval Tuesday, even as industry lobbyists contend the demand would have exacerbated this year’s market strains.
The final rule up for a vote at a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. meeting in Washington requires that 20 of the biggest U.S. lenders be able to rely on stable funding sources -- such as long-term debt and customers’ deposits -- in the event of a 12-month liquidity drought. The measure, which the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are also planning to approve, could also require that some lenders gather billions of dollars more in liquid assets.
The so-called net stable funding ratio, proposed by U.S. regulators four years ago, started brewing in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis as a global effort agreed to by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The final rule -- which would take effect on July 1 of next year -- is similar to the earlier proposal, though it gives Treasuries and cash reserves the same treatment to eliminate an incentive for banks to dump Treasuries under pressure.
The banks subjected to the rule -- including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). -- have been operating under a related requirement known as the liquidity coverage ratio, which calls for shorter-term liquidity stockpiles. Most of the big lenders already meet the demands of the net stable funding ratio, the regulators said. The industry is more than $1 trillion above its liquidity needs, though a small number of unnamed institutions remain below their marks, according to agency officials.
At least one bank needs to come up by 8%, and the lenders with liquidity shortfalls may require as much as $31 billion more in total, according to the agencies.
The Bank Policy Institute and other industry lobbyists have long criticized the net stable funding ratio as unnecessary. A recent note from the BPI amplified that criticism, calling the effort “reckless” in arguing that it would have made it even harder for banks to contribute liquidity to Treasury markets under strain -- as they were in September and March.
Regulators are also preparing to approve a final rule on Tuesday meant to limit how interconnected the largest banks can be. Lenders will be subjected to higher capital charges if they buy up another bank’s debt designed to meet requirements for total loss-absorbing capacity. That debt is meant to be used to recapitalize a lender if it fails.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden on Tuesday banned on security grounds the use of telecom equipment from China's Huawei [HWT.UL] and ZTE (SZ:000063) in its 5G network ahead of a spectrum auction scheduled for next month, joining other European nations that have restricted the role of Chinese suppliers. 
Telecoms regulator PTS said https://www.pts.se/en/news/press-releases/2020/four-companies-approved-for-participation-in-the-3.5-ghz-and-2.3-ghz-auctions the decision followed advice from the country's armed forces and security service, which described China as ""one of the biggest threats against Sweden"".
European governments have been tightening controls on Chinese companies building 5G networks, following diplomatic pressure from Washington, which alleges Huawei equipment could be used by Beijing for spying. Huawei has repeatedly denied being a national security risk. 
The United Kingdom in July ordered Huawei equipment to be purged completely from Britain's 5G network by 2027, becoming one of the first European countries to do so.
China said that no ""concrete evidence"" that equipment from its companies pose threats to national security in Sweden had been provided.
""We urge the Government of Sweden to comply with market principles of open development and fair competition, revisit its decisions,"" the Chinese embassy in Sweden said in a statement on its website.
Huawei and ZTE did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""The ban leaves network operators with less options and risks slowing the rollout of 5G in markets where competition is reduced,"" said Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight.
In a potential sign it might retaliate, its telecoms regulator also issued a notice on Tuesday calling for stricter supervision of foreign telecoms companies in the country.
Sweden is home to Ericsson (ST:ERICb), one of Europe's leading telecoms equipment suppliers and Huawei's biggest rival. 
It has won contracts from all three major operators in China to supply radio equipment for 5G networks and could be at risk if the Chinese government decides to retaliate https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-huawei-europe-idUSKCN24L1NW.
""It could be that some of the European vendors will sell less in China going forward if the Chinese are selling less in Europe going forward,"" CEO Kjell Johnsen of Swedish-based telecom operator  Tele2  said in a post-earnings conference call. 
LIKELY BENEFICIARIES
Ericsson and Finland's Nokia (HE:NOKIA) are likely to benefit from the ban locally. The Swedish company said it would not comment on national security issues while Nokia declined to comment.
PTS gave companies taking part in the auction until Jan. 1, 2025 to remove Huawei and ZTE equipment from their existing infrastructure and core functions.
It has approved the participation of Sweden's Hi3G Access, Net4Mobility - a consortium of Tele2 (ST:TEL2b) and  Telenor  (OL:TEL) - Telia Sverige (ST:TELIA) and Teracom in the planned spectrum auction of 3.5 GHz and 2.3 GHz, bands crucial for the 5G rollout.
Tele2, which uses Huawei equipment in its network and had earlier called Huawei an important vendor, said the ban ""does not change our plans substantially"".

""Many operators have already proven that when they rip and replace Chinese equipment, it doesn't have a negative impact on their capital spending,"" said industry consultant John Strand.

Worst hit will be traditional carriers relying on a hub-and-spoke network and business traffic, but Wizz expects demand for its own cheap fares and direct routes to snap back quickly once the pandemic fades, the Hungarian airline's co-founder said.
Wizz aims to widen a gap in unit costs compared to the rest of the airline industry thanks to regular deliveries of new Airbus (PA:AIR) aircraft, Chief Executive Jozsef Varadi added.
Co-founded in 2003 by Varadi, a former head of Hungary's defunct national carrier Malev, Wizz Air is one of Europe's largest budget carriers with a focus primarily on central and eastern parts of the continent.
Speaking in a webinar hosted by the UK-based Aviation Club, he bemoaned a lack of political coordination over travel restrictions and other measures to tackle the crisis and urged policymakers to pay more attention to the economic impact.
Dozens of countries worldwide, including France and Germany, have given various forms of public support or taken increased government stakes in their flag carriers to help them survive the crisis, which has sharply reduced travel demand.
But the industry has also faced a tangle of inconsistent travel and quarantine rules which airlines partially blame for putting people off taking the reduced number of flights.
""As far as Wizz is concerned, the moment COVID falls away I think we will be back to 2019 levels,"" Varadi said.
""We can go very quickly, but the issue is not underlying consumer demand; the issue is restrictions imposed by governments.""
Wizz is operating on half normal traffic now, he said.
While aircraft deliveries are down sharply as airlines struggle to preserve cash, Wizz Air has continued to add to its Airbus fleet during the crisis. Together with India's IndiGo (NS:INGL) it makes up about a quarter of Airbus deliveries.
Finance remains available for the small number of airlines like Wizz that have investment-grade status, Varadi said.
He also said Wizz was open to other foreign ventures after forming a startup in Abu Dhabi and expanding in the UK, where it would continue to invest after Brexit.

Wizz Air Abu Dhabi, a joint venture between the Hungarian budget airline and Abu Dhabi state holding company ADQ, has received an air operator certificate, though its launch has been hampered by a coronavirus ban on foreign visitors. [nL8N2H80C8]

The company, whose shares fell nearly 8% in premarket trading, said it would sell up to 15 million of its Class A common stocks.
The move follows a grim evaluation by ratings agency S&P earlier this month, which said the company has six months of cash unless it raises more capital.
Big theater chains such as AMC, rival Cineworld Group and others have reopened many locations, but audiences have been thin due to virus fears and delays in major releases by studios. Small and mid-sized theater companies have said they may not survive the impact of the pandemic.
AMC said it expects revenue for the third quarter to be about $119.5 million, below market expectation of $155 million. The company had raked in $1.32 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Earlier this month, it had said more than 80% of its theaters in the United States would remain open, but the number of people visiting its cinemas has slumped 85% compared to last year.
Last week, Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron told Reuters it may need to raise additional capital either entirely or mostly through equity.
""In the event the Company determines that these sources of liquidity will not be available to it or will not allow it to meet its obligations as they become due, it would likely seek an in-court or out-of-court restructuring of its liabilities,"" the company said in a filing on Tuesday.

(Reuters) - U.S. weapons maker  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) reported a better-than-expected third-quarter profit, helped by higher sales in its aeronautics unit which makes the F-35 fighter jet, and raised its full-year earnings forecast.
The U.S. defense sector has fared better compared with other industries amid a slump in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic, as the government has continued to purchase weapons while also providing support to defense contractors to pay the salaries of highly skilled workers. 
Lockheed said deliveries of F-35 jets rose to 31 aircraft in the quarter ended Sept. 27, from 28 a year earlier. 
Earlier in the year, Lockheed warned of a possible delay in delivery of between 18 and 24 F-35 jets due to a parts shortage as the coronavirus hampered production across the supply chain.
The company said it now expects 2020 earnings per share of about $24.45, compared with its previous forecast of between $23.75 and $24.05 per share.
Lockheed also raised it full-year net sales outlook to $65.25 billion, from $63.5 billion to $65 billion previously.
Lockheed forecast sales in 2021 to increase 3% to at least $67 billion with similar profit margins as the company recovers from the impact of the pandemic.
The Bethesda, Maryland-based company said it assumed the corporate rate would stay at 21%, something U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden has said he would change if elected. Currently, Lockheed pays taxes at a 14.7% rate. 
Net earnings from continuing operations rose to $1.75 billion, or $6.25 per share, in the quarter, from $1.61 billion, or $5.66 per share, a year earlier.

Analysts on average expected Lockheed to earn $6.09 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

1109,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Russia’s Lukoil Looks Beyond Covid to Boosting Iraq Oil Output,"(Bloomberg) -- Lukoil PJSC is seeking to develop new oilfield projects in Iraq even as slumping crude prices and OPEC+ supply cuts have compelled the company to slash production in the country.
Russia’s second-biggest oil producer pumped 400,000 barrels a day last year at its West Qurna 2 project in southern Iraq, and it had planned to boost output there in 2020. Instead, Lukoil has reined in production to 280,000 barrels a day to help Iraq comply with its quota under the global supply-cuts agreement, said Egor Zubarev, managing director of the company’s Middle Eastern business.
While it expects for now to keep output levels unchanged, Lukoil will “soon” submit proposals to Iraqi authorities to develop a separate area in the south known as Block 10, Zubarev said in an email.
Oil prices are 36% lower this year since the coronavirus gutted fuel demand, and Lukoil, like other producers, has had to postpone its immediate plans to raise output. Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer, ordered international companies working at its fields to pump less oil after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia agreed in April to take nearly a 10th of the world’s supply off the market.
“The current situation forces us and our partners to revise our plans to see how they correspond to the needs of the time,” Zubarev said. Still, Iraq is “undoubtedly” one of Lukoil’s “prioritized regions,” he said. Lukoil has a 75% stake in West Qurna 2 and is working on projects to explore other parts of the field as well as the separate Block 10 area.
Iraq’s financial constraints present a challenge. Lower crude prices are putting pressure on the government’s budget, and some oil projects have slowed due to Baghdad’s shortage of cash, Oil Minister Ihsan Abdul Jabbar said Tuesday in an online conference.
When the country is ready once again to ramp up production, it will need upgraded export facilities and pipelines, according to Zubarav.
Iraq’s current output is limited to about 3.6 million barrels a day, under the OPEC+ deal. It has long targeted production of 5 million barrels daily, with a capacity to export about the same amount.

Nancy King, global head of commodities, and Jay Rubenstein, head of commodities trading, are leaving, the people said, asking not to be named discussing internal matters. Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
The bank is one of the biggest commodities dealers on Wall Street alongside  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).
The veteran executives’ departures come after the bank discovered the use of unauthorized electronic means of communication. It didn’t find any wrongdoing, but the use of those communication channels went against policy, the people said.
King and Rubenstein didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
King joined Morgan Stanley 34 years ago, trading oil and rising through the commodities division to become the most senior woman in the business on Wall Street. Rubenstein, who many considered her likely successor, joined in 2007 to trade power and later became head of power and gas, according to their LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profiles.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Tuesday, rebounding after the sharp losses in the previous session, with investors watching Capitol Hill as a deadline on stimulus talks draws near.
At 7:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 24 points, or 0.7%, higher, the Dow Futures contract was up 196 points, or 0.7%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 78 points, or 0.7%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Monday over 400 points, or 1.4%, lower and the S&P 500 fell 1.6%, their biggest one-day losses since Sept. 23, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.7%. The Dow and the S&P have fallen on four of the last five trading days, while the Nasdaq is now on a five-day losing streak.
Investors have their focus firmly set on Washington, looking for U.S. lawmakers to agree on fresh coronavirus stimulus before the presidential election. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said they had made progress in their latest talks Monday, and are set to talk again Tuesday. 
Still, time is running short. On Sunday, Pelosi set a 48-hour deadline to reach an agreement, and the two sides seem to still be far apart on a handful of key issues. With the election just a couple of weeks away, it seems likely an agreement wouldn’t be reached until later this fall. 
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) kicked off Tuesday's earnings roster in style, with the consumer products giant benefiting from demand for its household cleaning products during the pandemic. Streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) also reports on Tuesday, after the closing bell. This is another stock that racked up gains during the lockdowns as people were forced to spend prolonged periods at home.
The main economic release Tuesday is the housing starts number for September, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Analysts are looking for 1.457 million new starts, up slightly from 1.416 million in August, continuing the housing bounce as the pandemic prompts people to move out of cities to less densely populated areas where space is cheaper.
Oil prices traded largely unchanged Tuesday, after three consecutive days of losses, with worries about the demand for oil remaining given the growing number of Covid-19 cases in the U.S. and Europe.
Traders will be watching for crude and product inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute later on Tuesday, with analysts expecting U.S. oil and distillate stockpiles to have fallen in the latest week.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $41.08 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $42.54.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,907.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% higher at 1.1810.

Procter & Gamble announced earnings per share of $1.63, an increase of 20% versus the prior year, on revenue of $19.32 billion, an increase of 9%.
The company's stock rose 2% pre-market, also up over 13% from the beginning of the year.
“We delivered another strong quarter of organic sales growth, core earnings per share and cash returned to shareowners, enabling us to increase our outlook for fiscal year results,” said David Taylor, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
P&G raised its outlook for fiscal 2021 all-in sales growth from a range of 1%-3% to a range of 3%-4%ersus the prior fiscal year. It raised also its outlook for organic sales growth from a range of 2%-4% to a range of 4%-5%.
P&G expects to pay approximately $8 billion in dividends in fiscal 2021. The Company increased its outlook for common stock repurchase from a range of $6-$8 billion to a range of $7-$9 billion for the year. All told, P&G now plans to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareholders in this fiscal year.
""P&G has had a great run this year as it benefits from robust at-home consumption of cleaning products, but that blistering organic growth could slow down in the fourth quarter as the pandemic-driven buying tapers off,"" said Haris Anwar, an analyst at Investing.com.
""But that doesn’t mean P&G has run out of steam. In the post pandemic economy the company’s grooming unit and beauty lines should benefit and recover from the ongoing slump. P&G’s diversified portfolio and its defensive nature will keep its stock well-supported this year and beyond.""

1118,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>","Cathay Pacific to cut 6,000 jobs, axe Cathay Dragon brand: SCMP","(Reuters) - Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) will cut around 6,000 jobs, or 18% of its workforce, and axe regional brand Cathay Dragon to help it weather the coronavirus pandemic, the South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday, citing sources.
The airline said in June it was reviewing its strategy in light of the travel downturn, with ""tough decisions"" to be announced during the fourth quarter and analysts expected it would announce major job cuts.
That month the Hong Kong government also led a $5 billion rescue package for the airline, which has been burning through around HK$1.5 billion ($193.55 million) to HK$2 billion of cash a month.
The South China Morning Post said the airline was expected to announce the job cuts on Wednesday, adding the figure had been reduced from 8,000 layoffs after government intervention. 
The newspaper, citing unidentified sources, said the airline will sacrifice Cathay Dragon but staff and resources of the two airlines would be merged. Cathay declined to comment.
The airline last month said it would not apply for further government employment subsidies for its main business units, allowing it to make job cuts at Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon, though not at budget carrier HK Express.
Cathay had refrained from major job cuts but Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) has announced plans to cut around 20% of positions, while Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) has said it will cut nearly 30% of its pre-pandemic staff.
Cathay has sent around 40% of its passenger fleet to less humid locations outside Hong Kong for storage. On Monday, the airline said it expected to operate less than 50% of its pre-pandemic passenger flight capacity in 2021.

Passenger numbers in September fell 98.1% compared with a year earlier due to border closures, though cargo carriage was down by only 36.6%.

1119,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",Daimler chief eyes China growth as trade tensions rise,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Daimler 's (DE:DAIGn) Chief Executive said China will remain Mercedes-Benz's biggest growth market in the next decade and the German carmaker will adjust production locations to capture shifts in demand as global trade tensions continue to rise.
The remarks by Ola Kaellenius come against a backdrop of increasingly strained relations between the United States, China and Europe after almost a decade of growth that has helped Mercedes to emerge as the world’s biggest-selling luxury car brand.
""The situation has become much rougher, with a tendency toward rougher talks, right up to and including trade conflicts,"" Kaellenius told the Frankfurt-based ICFW Journalists association late on Monday.
""We need to look at our production footprint and where it makes sense, shift our production,"" he said during the video call meeting. 
""Last year we sold around 700,000 passenger cars in China. The next biggest market is the U.S. with between 320,000 and 330,000 cars.""
Thanks in large part to a strong rebound in demand from China, Daimler and German rival BMW (DE:BMWG) both pre-released forecast-beating third-quarter results.
""In the next 10 years we also expect the biggest growth in China,"" Kallenius added, explaining that the luxury carmaker will follow the market.
But with international trade tensions on the rise, the outlook for global sales remains uncertain. 
Britain's Brexit negotiations could end without tariff-free trade with the European Union and serves as an example of how things can go wrong, the Swedish executive explained.
""I am hoping for last-minute common sense,"" Kallenius said in response to a question about his expectations on the outcome of Brexit talks. 
If Britain and the European Union fail to clinch a deal, World Trade Organization (WTO) rules would apply, resulting in tariffs. 
""In the event of a so-called hard Brexit, we would not open factories, because this would not be worth it, given our sales numbers,"" Kaellenius said, referring to sales in Britain. ""We would have to learn to live with WTO rules.""
Increasingly fragmented global markets make it harder to build cars at a profit because it reduces economies of scale in production, he said. 
Mercedes-Benz, for example, only builds its top-of-the line S-Class model in Germany. With global sales of only 100,000 vehicles, it hardly makes business sense to build new production lines in the United States and China to build these cars locally, he said. 
However, tensions between United States and the rest of the world are likely to remain, regardless of whether the Republicans or Democrats win the U.S. election next month.

""What the two (presidential) candidates are saying is that they have an interest in improving the trade balance, and we need to be ready for that,"" Kaellenius said.

1120,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>",StockBeat: UBS Smashes Expectations to Send Ermotti out on a High,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Shares in UBS Group (SIX:UBSG) hit their highest in over a month on Tuesday after the Swiss banking giant ‘s world-beating wealth-management unit drove it to a much higher-than-expected profit in the third quarter.
The bank posted net earnings of $2.1 billion, some 35% ahead of expectations, allowing it to make the optically pleasing gesture of setting aside $1.5 billion for future buybacks just as soon as the pandemic emergency passes.
The result was due in large part to the wealth management unit, which managed to rake in $10 billion in new money from ultra-rich clients in the Far East, all but offsetting outflows in Europe and the U.S. (the latter reflecting the fact that the deadline for personal taxes fell in July this year rather than April, due to the pandemic).
Most of the rest of the upside surprise came from UBS’s investment bank, which generated $632 million in profit, three times what was expected. That’s yet more proof that the banks with the biggest trading operations are seeing them sustain the bottom line at a time when profits from plain vanilla lending and deposit-taking are under intense pressure.
UBS stock rose 3.1% in response, making it one of the best-performing bank stocks in Europe for the day. The move will please investors, who have been starved of returns from Europe’s banking sector since regulators imposed an effective ban on buybacks and dividends early on in the pandemic, but it will also satisfy the regulators too, in so far as the cash remains on the balance sheet to deal with any unexpected turns for the worse.  
Sergio Ermotti, who is about to vacate the CEO’s chair for former ING boss Ralph Hamers, told Bloomberg TV that he doesn’t expect to be able to deploy the buyback reserve until at least early next year. 
The results ensure that Hamers - if he wishes to pursue a merger with either  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) or local rival Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) - will be able do so from a position of relative strength. After such a strong quarter by its bigger rival, CS in particular can ill afford to slip up when it reports a week on Thursday.
It would be nice to think that UBS’s results were a herald for a better-than-expected bank earnings season in Europe. Nice, but naïve. UBS is not a major lender to European businesses and households, so its figures have little read-across for the rest of the sector. Moreover, the European Central Bank’s top supervisor Andrea Enria all but told the Eurozone banks under his watch to start shoveling bad loan loss provisions into this quarter’s earnings in an interview last week.  
Given how much bad news is already priced into European bank valuations, it may be tempting to see UBS’s results as a buy signal, but wiser heads will likely hold back until somewhat more representative names have reported."

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Logitech  (NASDAQ:LOGI) International (S:LOGN) shares led Europe's gainers on Tuesday as the computer peripherals maker reported a big jump in second-quarter profit and again hiked its guidance amid a work-from-home boom. 
Its stock gained more than 18% in early trading, the highest riser on the STOXX 600 index (STOXX), to a record for the Swiss-U.S. company.
The maker of keyboards, mice webcams and headsets said it was benefiting from a shift to working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
It now expects annual sales to increase between 35% and 40% in constant currencies, up from its previous view for a 10% to 13% increase.
For the year to the end of March it expects non-GAAP operating income of between $700 million and $725 million, up from its previous forecast of $410 to $425 million.
Logitech has been profiting from people working from home, which has driven a rise in video calls, and companies refitting their offices to comply with social distancing restrictions.
""The growth trends that drive our business have accelerated as society adjusts to its new reality,"" Chief Executive Bracken Darrell said in a statement.
""The organization leaders I speak to envision people increasingly working from multiple locations, a hybrid work culture that is emerging as the norm."" 
The company has also plugged in to the rise of so-called esports - where players compete in games like Fortnite and League of Legends - to sell more products.
During the three months to the end of September, Logitech sales rose 75% to $1.26 billion. Net income rose to $266.9 million from $73 million a year earlier.

Logitech had a ""brilliant acceleration in growth"" during the second quarter, Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Andreas Mueller said, rating the results as ""strongly positive overall"".

Record COVID-19 cases in Europe also weighed on sentiment.
MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, slipped as much as 0.2%.
By 0825 GMT, MSCI's main European Index was up 0.4% and Europe's STOXX 600 was up 0.2, after initially falling as fears about the economic impact of lockdown restrictions outweighed some strong earnings.
With just two weeks until the U.S. presidential elections on Nov. 3, analysts said that investors were reining in their riskier bets.
President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden will debate each other in an event on Thursday which will feature a mute button to allow each candidate to speak uninterrupted.
U.S. fiscal stimulus talks are in focus, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set today as a self-imposed deadline for reaching a deal on a coronavirus aid package.
Pelosi said over the weekend that differences remained but that she was optimistic legislation could be pushed through before the election. But markets doubted fiscal stimulus would be passed in the near term.
""The likelihood of a deal taking place appears no more likely now than it was a week ago,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. The lack of action is particularly concerning in light of rising COVID-19 cases in the United States, he said.
""While equity markets appear to be struggling in the short term, the lack of a fiscal stimulus deal in the next two weeks is probably neither here nor there,"" he added.
""Most investors expect to see some sort of fiscal stimulus in the next six months, whoever gets in, with the only unknown being around the size and scale, and the timing. The problem for stock markets is that they want to see it now.""
New, tougher restrictions to limit the spread of coronavirus in Europe also weighed on sentiment. Ireland announced some of Europe's strictest constraints on Monday, telling people not to travel more than five kilometres from home. New restrictions were also approved in the Lombardy region of Italy.
France reported a massive increase in the number of people hospitalised.
The U.S. dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, flat on the day at 93.435 at 0742 GMT. Riskier currencies such as the Aussie and Kiwi dollars were down.
Minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's last policy meeting confirmed it had discussed cutting rates and buying longer-dated debt to support the economy and restrain the currency.
The pound edged down versus the dollar and euro, as Brexit negotiations were stuck in limbo. The British government has said it sees no basis to restart trade talks with the European Union unless there is a fundamental change in approach.
Euro zone government bond yields rose, with the benchmark 10-year German yield holding near recent seven-month lows at -0.623%.
Gold edged down while oil prices were little changed after three days of declines on fears that a resurgence of COVID-19 infections would stifle the recovery in fuel demand.
Brent crude futures were trading down 2 cents, or 0.4%, at $42.44 a barrel by 0748 GMT, recovering ground after falling as low as $42.19 earlier in the session.

Many global economies are seeing a rapid revival in consumer demand. U.S. retail sales rose in September at the fastest pace in three months, with China also seeing a rebound. Good monsoon rains and resumption of business activity following the world’s biggest lockdown helped Hindustan Unilever, which sells its products through 8 million outlets in India. The maker of Dove soap and Surf detergent also benefited from the integration of GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) Plc’s local consumer business in April.
“Over the past few months, there has been a steady improvement in the overall economic activity,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) India Pvt. analysts led by Vivek Maheshwari wrote in a report on Thursday. “With further improvement in macro, we expect that there should be an improvement in HUL’s earnings.”
The optimism is yet to translate into gains for investors. Hindustan Unilever’s shares have added 8.1% since Prime Minister Narendra Modi first imposed the lockdown in March, underperforming the S&P BSE Sensex’s 52% advance in the period.
Britannia Industries Ltd., India’s biggest maker of packaged food, on Monday reported a lower-than-estimated 23% jump in profit from the year ago period, while sales rose 12% to 34.2 billion rupees.
“We got our full range of products to the market,” in the quarter, Varun Berry, managing director at Britannia said in a statement. The company “inched closer to normalcy in advertisement & promotions.”
Still, India’s economic growth forecast was slashed further by the International Monetary Fund this month. Gross domestic product will shrink 10.3% in the fiscal year to March 2021, the Washington-based lender said.
“The underlying weakness in the labor market is worrying,” Sonal Varma, chief economist for India and Asia, ex-Japan at Nomura Holding Inc. in Singapore said in a report. “It reflects continued pressure on household incomes, which can be a medium-term headwind for consumer demand.”

1124,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>","UBS quarterly profit doubles, a crescendo for CEO Ermotti's swan song","By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS (S:UBSG) on Tuesday posted a 99% jump in third-quarter profit as heavy turnover in global markets helped the bank to a strong performance in investment banking and an unexpected rise in wealth management earnings.
In Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti's last month at the helm, net profit for the world's largest wealth manager climbed to $2.1 billion for July-September, handily beating expectations for $1.557 billion.
""Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate that our strategy is differentiating us,"" Ermotti, who will be replaced in November by former ING (AS:INGA) head Ralph Hamers, said in a statement.
""UBS has all the options open to write another successful chapter of its history under Ralph's leadership.""
Shares opened 2.2% higher, also bolstered by 2021 buyback hopes.
Investment banking saw earnings more than triple during the quarter thanks to a spike in trading and equity capital markets work which more than offset a fall for its advisory business.
Revenue in both its equities and foreign exchange, rates and credit units was up just over 40% compared to a year earlier. 
Asset management saw profits grow six times from a year ago.
Despite a client shift into lower-margin funds which put pressure on recurring fees, wealth management posted an 18% rise in pre-tax profit thanks to high levels of client transactions and $10 billion in net new loans. Analysts had expected earnings to fall in the bank's core division.
Assets under management in the wealth division rose to an all-time high of $2.754 trillion, while net new money fell to $1.4 billion following a $4 billion withdrawal by a single client in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.
UBS said it has so far accrued $1 billion for a cash dividend to be paid out next year, and has also set aside $1.5 billion in capital reserves for potential share repurchases.
The sharp profit rise for Europe's first major lender to report third-quarter results follows a mixed performance for big U.S. banks that saw those focused on trading clocking big gains while retail banks took a hit from the pandemic.
NOT WITHOUT IRONY
The robust showing by UBS' investment bank marks an ironic sendoff for Ermotti, who during his near-decade at the helm radically shrank the division and ramped up its focus on serving the world's rich.
He also wound down most of UBS' fixed income business, a source of volatile earnings and the biggest trading fraud in British history, to focus on wealth management in a strategy soon followed by cross-town rival  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN).
But, as Ermotti hands over to Hamers, wealth management is contending with fierce margin pressure as well as rising global competition from powerhouses including U.S. giant  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS). 
Morgan Stanley last week crushed Wall Street profit estimates, with wealth management revenues up 7%, while smaller Swiss wealth management rival  Julius Baer  (S:BAER) on Monday beat expectations on stronger client inflows.
So far this year, UBS' shares have dropped around 12%, better than the 25% plus falls experienced by Credit Suisse and JPMorgan (N:JPM) but underperforming Morgan Stanley stock which is up around half a percentage point.
Since Ermotti took the reins in September 2011, the bank's stock has seen a total 10% price gain. But its value has more than halved from a peak above 22 francs per share in 2015 under the weight of negative Swiss interest rates and geopolitical pressures.

Over that same period, Credit Suisse shares have halved in value, while JPMorgan (N:JPM) and Morgan Stanley shares have each more than tripled, reflecting the stronger position of Wall Street lenders in the wake of the global financial crisis.

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>",Euronext's markets resume trading after Monday's glitches,"By Sudip Kar-Gupta and Thyagaraju Adinarayan
PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - The European cash, derivatives and commodity futures markets run by  Euronext  (PA:ENX) resumed normal trading on Tuesday, a day after two technical glitches caused widespread disruption to several of Western Europe's major stock exchanges. 
A glitch on Monday morning caused problems across all of Euronext's markets, which span from Dublin and Amsterdam to Paris and Lisbon. Trade resumed normally in the afternoon but there were then major price swings during closing auctions, prompting the exchange to cancel all orders placed after 1730 Central European Time (CET). 
It was the latest in a number of breakdowns on international exchanges this year ranging from Tokyo to Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn). 
Euronext said the root cause of the issue was a technical failure impacting one of its data management systems, denying any possibility of there being a cyber attack.
While the problems looked to have been resolved in Tuesday morning trade, the outage will be embarrassing for Euronext which is planning a major expansion through a 4.3 billion euro ($5.07 billion) deal to buy Borsa Italiana from  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE).
""(We) sat on the sidelines for most of the morning,"" said Mark Taylor, a sales trader at Mirabaud, adding it had to cancel a couple of orders due to a ""mass confusion"" on the close.
The problems at the close are likely to have been particularly problematic as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and hedge funds typically use prices set during closing auctions for their daily pricing, making the final five minutes of trade crucial. 
The glitches caused the share price of Dutch healthcare technology company Philips (AS:PHG) to fall almost 4% at Monday's close to less than 40 euros. The company later said it was informed by Euronext that their closing price would actually be set at 42.3 euros. 
A Euronext spokesman declined to comment on the value of trade orders cancelled on Monday's close. Closing auctions across Europe's major bourses have on average accounted for a fifth of daily average volumes, analysts say.

(Reuters) - European stocks inched higher on Tuesday as strong earnings from Swiss bank UBS, consumer giant  Reckitt Benckiser  and others offset concerns from tighter coronavirus curbs across the continent and doubts over fresh U.S. stimulus.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.2%, reversing from losses at the open.
Ireland announced some of Europe's toughest COVID-19 constraints on Monday, while Italy, Spain and Britain also imposed curbs to limit the spread of new coronavirus cases that now threaten to derail a budding economic recovery.
""What we're likely to see is concerns about near-term growth, and I wouldn't be surprised if we saw weakness in markets on the back of that,"" said Nick Peters, multi-asset portfolio manager at Fidelity International.
""Thinking 6-12 months out, we're assuming that local lockdowns will be successful and there should be better news about vaccine."" 
Earnings were a bright spot. UBS (S:UBSG) rose 2.6% as it posted a 99% jump in quarterly profit, while Swedish bank  Swedbank  (ST:SWEDa) gained 0.3% after it reported a bigger-than-expected rise in quarterly net profit.
Computer peripherals maker  Logitech  (NASDAQ:LOGI) International (S:LOGN) surged 18.9% after it raised its full-year forecast.
Reckitt Benckiser (L:RB) added 2.5% after it lifted its full-year outlook as the coronavirus pandemic boosts demand for its cleaning products.
Meanwhile, European stock markets run by  Euronext  (PA:ENX) resumed normal trading after it was plagued by technical glitches the previous day. France's CAC 40 (FCHI), one of the markets hit by the glitch, rose 0.5%.
Robust demand in the United States and China helped cognac maker  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) post a broader recovery in second-quarter sales, but its shares slipped 1.3%, while those in  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) gained 1.8%.
Swedish telecoms operator  Tele2  (ST:TEL2b) fell 6.2% after it stuck to its outlook for roughly unchanged operating profit in 2020.
""The numbers themselves are relatively unimportant. What most investors are looking at it is how strong 2021 recovery will be,"" said Peters. 

Third-quarter profits for companies on STOXX 600 are expected to drop 36.7%, according to Refinitiv data, improving from a 51% plunge in the previous quarter when economic losses from the pandemic peaked.

1127,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 04:41AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Didi lines up 2021 IPO in Hong Kong, targets more than $60 billion valuation, sources say","By Julie Zhu and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's top ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing is considering Hong Kong for a multibillion-dollar initial public offering next year, dropping previous aims to list in New York amid rising Sino-U.S. tension, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Didi, backed by technology investment giants SoftBank (T:9984),  Alibaba  (N:BABA) and Tencent (HK:0700), has started initial talks with investment banks for the long-awaited IPO, according to three people. It's looking to formally appoint lead banks for the float in the coming months, two of them said. 
The people spoke on condition of anonymity as the information, including the identity of the banks, was private. 
The people said Didi is targeting a valuation of more than $60 billion by the time of IPO launch, expected as soon as in the first half of 2021. Founded eight years ago, Didi began generating healthy profit in the second quarter this year and some investors are now keen to cash in, said one of the people.
Didi is also considering a new fundraising round ahead of the IPO in a bid to boost its valuation, two of the people said. In the private secondary market, some of its shares are trading well below a valuation of $56 billion it reached in 2017. (https://tinyurl.com/y6ojxhpd)
The new timetable for the IPO and the private fundraising round ahead of it have not been reported before. 
Asked by Reuters to comment, Didi said it doesn't have any ""definitive"" IPO plan or timeline. The people familiar with the matter cautioned the IPO plan could change due to market conditions. 
The plan also comes after Didi walked away from talks on merging with domestic rival Meituan (HK:3690), according to four separate sources, amid disagreement on the valuation of the merged business and management lines. These four people declined to be identified because the information was private. 
Meituan declined to comment. Didi said it had not engaged in any merger discussion with Meituan.
TRANSFER FROM MANHATTAN
Didi, which merged with then main rival Kuaidi in 2015 to create a smartphone-based transport services giant, counts as its core business a mobile app, where users can hail taxis, privately owned cars, car-pool options and even buses in some cities. (https://tinyurl.com/y2baugu5)
Didi had for years aimed for a U.S. IPO because of the prestige of a New York listing, the presence of comparable peers like Uber (N:UBER) and  Lyft  (O:LYFT) and a deeper capital pool, according to two of the people. 
Uber and Didi have long-standing links: Uber in 2016 sold its operation to Didi in exchange for a 17.5% stake in the Chinese firm, which in turn made a $1 billion investment in Uber.
All three people familiar with the matter said Didi has now opted to consider Hong Kong for the listing amid deteriorating U.S.-China relations that have left tech firms like TikTok owner ByteDance in the crosshairs.
U.S.-listed Chinese companies now also face tightened scrutiny and stricter audit requirements there.
Uninspiring stock performances by Uber and Lyft have also discouraged Didi from seeking a U.S. IPO, said two of the people. Uber and Lyft are both trading below their IPO price, with Lyft shares down more than two-thirds since listing.
If completed, Didi's IPO would further burnish Hong Kong's status as a capital markets hub, with $28.8 billion worth of IPOs and secondary listings carried out in the city between the start of this year and mid-October, Refinitiv data showed.
That helped Hong Kong grab the second spot in the global stock exchange league table - after Nasdaq - despite the city reeling from a coronavirus pandemic-hit economy and anti-government protests. 

Didi's listing plan comes as Ant Group prepares to raise about $35 billion in a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai in the coming weeks, in what would be the world's largest IPO.

The consortium will invest up to $100 million and Eat Just will invest up to $20 million to build and operate the factory, its first in Asia.
""Once built, the first factory will generate thousands of metric tons of protein, adding to existing large-scale protein facilities in North America and Germany,"" Eat Just said in a statement.

Its existing distribution partners in Asia include South Korea's SPC Samlip and Thailand's Betagro.
Demand for plant-based meat substitutes and proteins has grown as customers have become increasingly health conscious and are concerned about the environmental impact of industrial animal farming.

1129,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 04:00AM ET</span>",Volatile Year-End May Put a Cap on European Equity Gains,"(Bloomberg) -- European equities may not catch a break from being stuck in neutral as they head into a volatile end of the year, according to strategists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index will end the year at 371 points, leaving just 1% upside against yesterday’s close, based on the average of 18 strategists polled in the study. They forecast a year-end level of 3,295 for the euro-area gauge Euro Stoxx 50, similarly leaving little room for progress.
Investors face a cocktail of risks in the final months of a volatile year, from a resurgence in Covid-19 cases across Europe to the U.S. election and Brexit talks. The uncertainty is reflected in the wide range of strategist forecasts, with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. predicting the Stoxx 600 will fall more than 9% by year-end, while Makor Capital Markets SA expects a 13% rise. Volatility and short-term hedging demand are on the rise, even as the Stoxx 600 has remained in a tight range since early June.
“We broadly expect equity markets to trade sideways in a wide range over the coming quarters, if not years,” says James Gutman, head of investment portfolios at Dolfin Financial. His year-end target of 340 implies a 7.2% drop for the Stoxx 600. “In the very near term we think markets could have a bit of a headache as the pain relief from subsidies and furloughs starts to wear off.”
Among notable changes since Bloomberg’s September survey, Cie. Financiere Tradition SA and Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) cut their targets by around 9%, while Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY) increased its by 9%.
“The ‘recovery’ will not only be incomplete but also will stall,” said Stephane Ekolo, strategist at Tradition. “Even with all this stimulus, the global recession is unlikely to end as fast as anticipated by many market participants.”
Ekolo said the U.S. relief package is unlikely to come before the presidential election, while also noting a pending “Brexit mess,” and likely more bankruptcies and job losses. “Markets ought to decline,” he added.
The Stoxx 600 dropped 0.4% on Tuesday, trimming its October advance.
Most Overweight
Fund managers are still backing European stocks. Cash levels fell the fastest since 2003 to reach a two-year low in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).’s October survey. Now at 4.1%, they are close to the “greed” threshold that BofA estimates at 4%. The euro area remained the most overweight region for equities globally, with allocation rising by four percentage points to a net 26%. U.K. equities retained the most underweight spot.
“The door is open for European stocks to perform well over the next three to six months,” said Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA head of European equity strategy Rolan Kaloyan. “We’ll see what happens with Brexit and the U.S. vote,” he said, noting that positioning in European stocks is still very weak, compared with the U.S. “so there could be a rotation.”
He doesn’t see “a big trend for the year-end,” though, and has a 370 index target for the Stoxx 600, saying gains are limited by the uncertainty around the U.S. election, the resurgence in Covid-19 cases and Brexit.
Strategists predict a year-end level of 12,713 for Germany’s DAX Index, suggesting a drop of 1.1% from Monday’s close. The benchmark has rallied about 52% since its March low, outperforming both the Stoxx 600 and the S&P 500 Index.
The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index, on the other hand, has lagged the wider recovery amid Brexit worries and a heavy weighting of value shares. It’s predicted to finish 2020 at 6,158 on average, implying a gain of about 4.6%.

1130,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 03:50AM ET</span>",European Stocks Mixed; UBS Helps Mitigate Early Losses,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded mixed Tuesday as losses due to worries about the impact of the Covid-19 surge and doubts over U.S. stimulus were mitigated by positive corporate news, including from banking giant UBS.
At 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% lower, the CAC 40 in France was up 0.3%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.1%.
Europe has been hardest hit with the second wave of the Covid-19 virus, with new cases growing at over 150,000 a day. Ireland late on Monday declared a six-week lockdown of non-essential businesses in the latest indication that European authorities are struggling to bring the virus back under control. 
The number of new cases in the United States last week also rose 13% to more than 393,000, approaching levels last seen during the summer peak, according to a Reuters analysis. 
Even with these numbers, most investors doubt U.S. lawmakers will reach a stimulus deal ahead of a Tuesday deadline imposed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as the gap between what the two parties are offering is still too wide, and the bad feeling too deep seated.
Still, the early weakness on European stock exchanges--back up and running smoothly after Monday’s mishap--has been largely mitigated by some strong earnings news.
UBS (NYSE:UBS) stock rose 2.2% after the Swiss banking giant reported its third best quarter for a decade, with net profit soaring 99%.
Staying in Switzerland, Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) stock surged 12% after the computer hardware maker raised its full-year forecast, while travel retailer Dufry (SIX:DUFN) gained 2.1% after Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) took a 6.1% stake.
In the U.K.,  Reckitt Benckiser  (LON:RB) stock rose 1.8% after saying that its third-quarter revenue rose thanks to its disinfection business. It also raised its full-year guidance for net revenue growth.
On the flip side, BMW (DE:BMWG) stock fell 0.6% despite the German car manufacturer posting strong third-quarter free cash flow numbers for its automotive division. It had already said unit sales rose 8.6% in the quarter. 
Oil prices weakened Tuesday on continued worries about the demand for oil going forward, particularly in the large oil-consuming nations in Europe and the U.S. A meeting of the OPEC+ bloc on Monday gave no clear indication that the world's biggest exporters were about to delay their scheduled output in January.
Traders will be watching for crude and product inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute later on Tuesday, with analysts expecting U.S. oil and distillate stockpiles to have fallen in the latest week.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $41.03 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $42.55.

Shipments fell 12% to 1.6 billion francs ($1.76 billion) in September, dropping an eighth consecutive month, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry.
Exports to China surged 79%, while falling almost everywhere else. China has been one of the few bright spots amid the gloom this year, and the country is replacing Hong Kong as the top destination for Swiss luxury timepieces.
Hong Kong had been the biggest market for more than a decade, as wealthy Chinese often traveled there to buy watches to avoid China’s luxury taxes. Swiss watchmakers in turn overly relied on that market, and suffered when pro-democracy protests erupted on the island and China started trying to engineer a shift of luxury consumption to the mainland.
Now Swiss watchmakers are eyeing the southern Chinese province of Hainan as business there is booming amid its resorts and casinos, according to Julien Tornare, the head of LVMH’s Zenith brand. China in July increased the tax-free shopping limit in Hainan to 100,000 yuan ($14,930) annually per person, up from 30,000 yuan.
Swiss watch exports dropped 28% in the first nine months of the year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are once again chasing upside in shares of tech companies after a sharp sell-off in U.S. equities last month.
Despite last week's market dip, the tech-heavy Nasdaq remains around 3% away from its record high. Traders - many of them retail investors - have plowed back into call options, used to position for gains in shares.
""There hasn't been that catalyst to really move the market down,"" said Matt Amberson, principal at options analytics firm ORATS. ""Starting from late September, we've seen call buying come back.""
Since its recent trough on Sept. 23, the Nasdaq has climbed nearly 10%. The index includes many growth-oriented companies, whose shares remain in favor in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic as their businesses have remained largely intact.

Moreover, volume has rebounded in equity call options, particularly for single-stock contracts. The ratio of call options relative to put options, a measure of how bullish traders are, has climbed since late September and is close to the peak reached just before the sell-off that month.
Previously, activity in single-stock options had surged as a large investor, later reported to be SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), made significant option purchases in August.

Skew, a measure of demand for puts versus calls, is near its lowest levels over the past year for those companies, according to Trade Alert, meaning investors are positioning for more upside.

1136,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 02:15AM ET</span>","Analysis: After America First, some investors bet on a Biden boost abroad","By Karin Strohecker, Sujata Rao and Elizabeth Howcroft
(Reuters) - After four years of America First, some money managers outside the United States looking for big post-election investment winners are quietly confident it is the turn of the rest of the world to shine.
With several opinion polls pointing to a Joe Biden presidency, these investors are leaning towards assets such as emerging markets or European bank stocks, as potential beneficiaries of a Democrat win while turning cautious on markets such as Russia which might be hurt by the change. 
A stimulus-fuelled U.S. growth pickup, accompanied by corporate tax hikes -- both expected under Biden -- could push capital out of the S&P 500 into other markets, especially if a coronavirus vaccine becomes available early next year.
A consensus for a weaker dollar, driven by more predictable trade and foreign policies under Biden, will add to the big positive for emerging markets. 
Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, chief investment officer at asset manager  NN  (NASDAQ:NNBR) IP, said the ties between U.S. and China were key for markets.
""Biden will not be increasing (tensions) further but also not be pulling back aggressively - I do expect the relationship to stabilise rather than escalate, and that will be a benefit for the market and that will give some further room for the rest of the world.""
Many investors said they favoured European cyclicals - companies which do well in a buoyant economy and stand to gain when a spending boost lifts bond yields. 
Cyclicals - oil companies, autos and banks - typically outperform ""growth"" stocks when bond yields rise. U.S. markets are dominated by growth stocks, notably tech.
Graphic - Bonds cyclicals: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjpqakbzpx/bonds%20cyclicals.JPG
Meanwhile a potential Biden win could be a ""game changer in the relationship with Europe at a geopolitical and security level,"" said van Nieuwenhuijzen, who expects such an outcome could benefit European exporters from Italy to France as well as German car makers. 
MSCI's European auto shares index  for instance, less vulnerable to U.S. tariffs under Biden, has outperformed broader regional equities <.dMIEU00000PUS> more than twofold since June.
Graphic - European auto shares and Blue Wave: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxanyqpx/Pasted%20image%201603038999285.png
There is still a huge amount of uncertainty for investors as opinion polls may shift as the U.S. election day approaches. 
Jonathan Bell, chief investment officer of Stanhope Capital, is increasing exposure to Asia. He reckons that while a Biden win would be a positive, Asian markets are resilient enough to withstand a surprise Trump win.
""If Trump wins you could perhaps make more money in the United States ... but Asia will probably still benefit. Whereas if Biden wins, perhaps U.S. (market) comes off and Asia benefits,"" Bell said. 
If Trump does win, investments in U.S. companies in line to benefit from additional corporate tax cuts could be among the winners, fund managers said. 
AMERICA FIRST
Trump's America First policies are often blamed for a dramatic decline in U.S. outbound investment. 
Figures from the Department of Commerce show U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) rose around $94 billion last year -- less than half the amount seen in 2015. Net flows to Europe were just $8.3 billion, versus $152 billion in 2015, the data showed.
    
Graphic - America First: foreign direct investment shrinks: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTIONS/yxmvjjgljvr/chart.png
U.S. investment into foreign stocks and bonds has also fallen. U.S.-domiciled accounts tracked by consultancy eVestment pulled out some $23 billion from European equities in the past five years, $21 billion out of Asia Pacific equities, and $20 billion from emerging market equities.
There were net outflows from European and emerging market fixed income of $2.2 billion and $18.2 billion respectively, eVestment said.
Dirk Willer, global head of emerging markets at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), predicts U.S. foreign flows will recover if trade war noise ebbs. And even if Biden sticks to a hardline China stance, it is likely to be a less erratic one. 
""At least you won't wake up in the morning and check Twitter to see if you need to worry about your yuan trade,"" Willer said, referring to Trump's late-night tweets that can frequently send markets sprawling.
    
EMERGING WINNERS
Investors said a persuasive Biden win would especially benefit emerging markets, an area that has historically outperformed during Democrat presidencies. 
Graphic - EM and US elections: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgvdjrqjvo/EM%20and%20US%20elections.PNG
Now, it may also benefit from dollar weakness and less pressure on companies to return business operations to the United States. Latin America – particularly Mexico -- will gain from a shift in immigration and trade policies as well as FDI, investors expect.
Graphic - Rouble, Peso, Biden: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovaylmqva/Pasted%20image%201603035390464.png
But peso gains since early-June, when betting odds swung decisively towards Biden, came at the Russian rouble's expense. 
A Biden win may spell bad news for Moscow in the form of a tougher U.S. administration and weaker oil prices if Biden pushes ahead with his green agenda or allows Iran to resume crude exports. Russian equities too have lagged other emerging markets since early June.

""There are currently more than enough reasons why Russia might see more sanctions. You have Biden who is more than willing to punish Russia,"" said Amundi's head of emerging markets, Yerlan Syzdykov, who has turned ""cautious"" on Russia.

1137,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 02:03AM ET</span>",European Stocks Seen Lower; U.S. Stimulus Doubts Weigh,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening a little lower Tuesday, weighed by weakness on Wall Street as time begins to run out on a new U.S. stimulus package while European governments continue to tighten public health measures to stop the spread of Covid-19.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.7% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.4%. 
In the U.S., stocks closed lower Monday amid doubts the country’s lawmakers will reach a stimulus deal ahead of a Tuesday deadline imposed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4%, the S&P 500 closed 1.6% lower and the Nasdaq Composite settled down 1.7%.
Pelosi’s statement late Monday that differences were narrowing in talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin did briefly increase hopes that a deal could be passed before the presidential election. But most investors seem to think that the gap between the two parties is still too wide, and the bad feeling too deep seated, for a package to be agreed upon today.
Meanwhile, the number of global Covid-19 cases also continues its incessant rise, topping 40 million, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Ireland late on Monday declared a six-week lockdown of non-essential businesses in the latest indication that European authorities are struggling to bring the virus back under control. 
Europe has been hardest hit with the second wave, but the number of new cases in the United States last week also rose 13% to more than 393,000, approaching levels last seen during the summer peak, according to a Reuters analysis.
Returning to Europe, exchange operator  Euronext  (PA:ENX) said its stock exchanges should open smoothly, after a software glitch caused its worst outage in two years on Monday that culminated in a failed closing auction.
In corporate news,UBS (NYSE:UBS) will be in the spotlight after the Swiss banking giant posted a doubling in its third-quarter profit, helped by a strong performance in investment banking as well as an unexpected rise in earnings for wealth management.
Oil prices weakened Tuesday on continued worries about the demand for oil going forward given the number of Covid-19 cases continues to mount, particularly in the large oil-consuming nations in Europe and the U.S..
Traders will be watching for crude and product inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute later on Tuesday, with analysts expecting U.S. oil and distillate stockpiles to have fallen in the latest week.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $40.91 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.4% to $42.46.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,903.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1775."
1138,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 01:05AM ET</span>","Stock market boom, new listings mint China billionaires at record pace","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China is minting new billionaires at a record pace despite an economy bruised by the coronavirus pandemic, thanks to booming share prices and a spate of new stock listings, according to a list released on Tuesday.
The Hurun China Rich List 2020 also highlights China's accelerated shift away from traditional sectors like manufacturing and real estate, towards e-commerce, fintech and other new economy industries.
Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba (HK:9988), retained the top spot for the third year in a row, with his personal wealth jumping 45% to $58.8 billion partly due to the impending mega-listing of fintech giant Ant Group.
Ant is expected to create more mega-rich through what is likely to be the world's biggest IPO, as it plans to raise an estimated $35 billion through a dual listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong.
The combined wealth of those on the Hurun China list - with an individual wealth cut-off of 2 billion yuan ($299.14 million) - totaled $4 trillion, more than the annual gross domestic product (GDP) of Germany, according to Rupert Hoogewerf, the Hurun Report's chairman. 
More wealth was created this year than in the previous five years combined, with China's rich-listers adding $1.5 trillion, roughly half the size of Britain's GDP. 
Booming stock markets and a flurry of new listings have created five new dollar billionaires in China a week for the past year, Hoogewerf said in a statement.
""The world has never seen this much wealth created in just one year. China's entrepreneurs have done much better than expected. Despite Covid-19 they have risen to record levels.""
According to a separate estimate by PwC and UBS, only billionaires in the United States possessed greater combined wealth than those in mainland China. 
China has accelerated capital market reforms to aid a virus-hit economy, accelerate economic restructuring and fund a ""tech war"" with the United States. 
To expedite initial public offerings (IPOs), regulators launched a U.S.-style IPO system on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market and Shenzhen's ChiNext. Chinese corporate listings in Hong Kong and Nasdaq have also turbocharged the fortunes of company founders. 
Zhong Shanshan, who recently listed his bottled water maker Nongfu Spring Co (HK:9633) in Hong Kong, shot straight into the top 3 with $53.7 billion, trailing Tencent (HK:0700) founder Pony Ma. 

The wealth of He Xiaopeng surged 80% to $6.6 billion after the listing of his electric vehicle maker Xpeng Motors (N:XPEV) in New York during the summer.

Wisconsin said last week that Foxconn's planned factory in Mount Pleasant did not create enough jobs in 2019 to earn its owner Foxconn tax credits, the second year it has missed its targets.
""Foxconn re-asserts it will continue to work with President Trump and state and local government officials to create more jobs and to attract new investment to Wisconsin,"" said Foxconn founder Terry Gou in an e-mailed statement on Tuesday.
""Market conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic have altered the timing of our expansion, the specifics of our manufacturing plans, and our product lines have changed. But through it all, Foxconn has pressed forward with its Wisconsin plans.""
The planned $10 billion, 20-million-square-foot campus was hailed by the White House as the largest investment for a brand new location by a foreign-based company in U.S. history and had been cited by Trump in 2017 as proof he was reviving U.S. manufacturing. 
However, for many the factory has become a symbol of failed promises in Midwestern states like Wisconsin that were key to Trump’s 2016 election and are now closely watched swing states in the Republican's bid to be re-elected on Nov. 3. 

""The world has changed a lot since Foxconn’s partnership with Wisconsin began, but Foxconn’s commitment to the state has not wavered,"" Gou said in the statement, adding that the firm had so far invested $750 million in the state and had become the largest property taxpayer in Racine County.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 11:55PM ET</span>",New Virgin Australia strategy spells end of business travel arms race,"By Jamie Freed
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Virgin Australia looks set to cut basic fares and start charging fees for items like checked baggage and food under new chief executive Jayne Hrdlicka, prompting a wider industry shake-up as the country's airlines reawaken from the coronavirus crisis.
Virgin's shift from being a full-service carrier will also mark the end of a decade-long arms race with Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) for corporate travellers involving lavish airport lounges, celebrity chefs and lie-flat business seats on longer domestic flights.
Unusually for airlines globally, both carriers include free checked baggage allowances, free Wi-Fi and complimentary food and drinks even in the cheapest economy class tickets on domestic flights. 
Virgin, which entered voluntary administration in April, is repositioning itself in a mid-market spot under new owner Bain Capital as it looks to weather ongoing low demand from the pandemic. 
Company sources and industry experts said they expect Hrdlicka will re-introduce fees the airline had cut when it went upmarket under long-serving former chief executive John Borghetti. 
Unbundling, or charging fees for previously included services like checked baggage, seat selection, Wi-Fi, food and in-flight entertainment is a strategy that helps airlines attract price conscious travellers with a low base fare while allowing them to pay extra for chosen add-ons.
This could become even more important post-pandemic due to the economic downturn, analysts say, with Virgin's move downmarket also opening options for Qantas to stop providing an international-style business class service on transcontinental flights and to consider charging for some add-ons on its cheapest sale fares without losing customers.
Corporate fares are more likely to be all-inclusive, but Virgin plans to reduce its airport lounge network and will no longer attempt to match Qantas' premium product when it unveils its new offering in around two weeks, according to a company source who said the details were not finalised. Virgin and Bain declined to comment.
""I think at least it allows the optionality for Qantas to go downmarket,"" said John Thomas, a Boston-based former senior executive at Virgin who helped introduce baggage fees in the United States more than a decade ago as an airline consultant. 
""You can take costs out, you can do some unbundling, but that doesn't mean that you have got to unbundle all of your passengers,"" he told Reuters. ""For your corporates and for your business clients and your premium passengers, you can still keep it as a bundled offering.""
Virgin's fleet reduction under Bain will widen Qantas' advantage in network size and flight frequency, which can be even more important to corporate travellers than creature comforts, said a Qantas source who was not authorised to speak with media. Qantas declined to comment.
VARYING FARE PACKAGES
One potential model for Virgin's fare structure is Air New Zealand Ltd (NZ:AIR). For domestic flights and those to and from Australia, it offers fare packages starting from a seat without checked bags and rising to ""worksdeluxe"", including two checked bags, food and seatback entertainment.
""That would allow Virgin to straddle both sides of the divide,"" said Judson Rollins (NYSE:ROL), managing partner of Auckland-based consultancy Propel Aviation Solutions. 
Hrdlicka, a former head of Qantas low-cost arm Jetstar, said in 2015 that Virgin had lost customers to Jetstar when it included baggage and food in its fares, because ticket prices rose. 
""Virgin just became too expensive,"" she said at an aviation summit.
Tony Webber, a consultant and former Qantas chief economist, said he expected both household and business customers would be price sensitive for the next few years, meaning it made sense for Virgin to gravitate more toward a Jetstar type of model.

Jetstar earned nearly 24% of its revenue from add-ons in 2019, according to IdeaWorksCompany, the 10th highest proportion among airlines globally and equating to $26.32 per passenger.

Malaysia in September dropped criminal charges against three Goldman Sachs units after the bank agreed to pay $3.9 billion to settle the probe.

Goldman Sachs had generated about $600 million in fees for its work with the Malaysian Sovereign wealth fund, which included three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5 billion.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Tuesday morning, reacting to the U.S. market’s poor overnight performance as the Nov. 3 presidential election approaches and time runs out to pass the county’s latest stimulus measures.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.45% by 10:58 PM ET (2:58 AM GMT), while the Shenzhen Component edged up 0.13%, continuing to react to Monday’s mixed quarterly data. The data showed a less-than expected 4.9% growth in GDP year-on-year in the third quarter, indicating challenges ahead for what looks to be a strong Chinese economic recovery overall.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched down 0.07%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.56% and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.77%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.58%, with the minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)’s October meeting and comments from Assistant Governor Chris Kent widening expectations that RBA will introduce further monetary easing measures soon.
In the U.S., House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi’s statement on Monday that differences were narrowing in talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for the stimulus measures increased hopes for a deal to the be passed before the presidential election.
Despite Pelosi’s optimism, skepticism on whether Democrats will concede on their priorities for local governments, workers, schools and health care, and whether Pelosi will meet her self-imposed Tuesday deadline to reach a deal, remains.
Some investors pointed to other explanations for the decline.
“Risky assets are losing their mojo after disheartening virus updates, countless stimulus banter that will not yield anything until after the election, and central banks remain stuck in wait-and-see mode,” Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said in a note.
“The QE for life trade appears like it is not going away anytime soon, but that is not enough of reason to buy stocks now,” the note added.
Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston acknowledged investor worries over the stimulus measures, but said the recent declines were likely due to positioning ahead of the presidential election.
“Do you really want to hold those exposures into what could be a volatility event? We’re getting into the Wild West territory where it becomes whippier,” he told Reuters.
With only two weeks left until Americans head to the polls, investors will be tuning into the final debate between President Donald Trump and Democrat candidate Joe Biden, scheduled for Thursday.
An uptick in COVID-19 cases in the Midwest, including Wisconsin and other battleground states, is one challenge facing Trump as he stands for re-election.
Meanwhile, the number of global COVID-19 cases also continues its incessant rise, topping 40 million as of Oct. 20, according to Johns Hopkins University data."

The accord, part of an international action, will let the parent company avoid a U.S. criminal conviction, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing the confidential talks. The payment to the Justice Department is broadly in line with the bank’s prior reserves and analysts’ estimates.
The deal, expected to come just weeks before the U.S. presidential election, would remove uncertainty for the bank following years of investigations and negotiations with the Justice Department over the firm’s fundraising for the 1MDB investment fund. It follows an agreement in July to settle a related probe with Malaysia, in which the bank promised to pay $2.5 billion. Malaysia dropped criminal charges against the New York-based company in early September.
A representative for Goldman Sachs declined to comment, and representatives for the Justice Department didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.
In all, Goldman Sachs may pay roughly $5 billion once accords with Malaysia, the Justice Department and other agencies are tallied together.
In Singapore, authorities plan to levy a financial penalty and issue a warning with conditions, and if the company breaches them, Goldman Singapore could be prosecuted, people familiar the matter said. The Monetary Authority of Singapore, Attorney-General’s Chambers and police didn’t immediately reply to an email seeking comment.
Probes of the Wall Street firm focused on its work raising $6.5 billion in 2012 and 2013 for the fund formally known as 1Malaysia Development Bhd., much of which was later allegedly siphoned off by people connected to the country’s former prime minister, Najib Razak. Goldman’s investment-banking group, led at the time by now-Chief Executive Officer David Solomon, collected $600 million from the bond sales.
Authorities in Asia, the U.S. and Europe have spent years tracing out the conspiracy and tracking down cash and assets around the globe, including condos, jewelry and art.
Goldman has long blamed rogue employees, asserting it had no idea the money it helped raise would be diverted from development projects. One former Goldman Sachs partner, Tim Leissner, pleaded guilty in the U.S. to conspiring to launder money and violating foreign bribery laws. Another executive was charged with foreign bribery offenses.

Its Asian launch comes as the maker of plant-based meat said it was still awaiting approval from Chinese regulators. Its key ingredient, heme, made from genetically modified yeast, requires approval in China. 
""We are optimistic it could happen in the next year or even in the next several months,"" chief executive Pat Brown told an online news conference. 
In September, rival Beyond Meat (O:BYND) said it had signed a deal to open a production facility near Shanghai, as the company ramps up its focus on the rapidly growing Chinese market. 
Brown said Impossible wanted to build a complete plant-based supply chain in the country and make it a domestic industry. 
""They (China) could have an entirely domestic meat supply which would be great for food supply, better from a public health standpoint and vastly reduce the environmental footprint,"" he said. 
Nick Halla, senior vice president for international at Impossible Foods, said the use of heme in Impossible's products was key and trying to find a substitute would not be scalable or affordable to achieve the same taste. 

Impossible said it launched in about 200 grocery stores in Hong Kong and Singapore this week, a move that was accelerated by COVID-19 in the face of subdued sales to restaurants.

The report released on Monday showed registrations in California, a bellwether for the electric-car maker and its largest U.S. market, recovered from a second-quarter low of roughly 9,800 vehicles to around 16,200 vehicles in the three months ended September. But third-quarter numbers lagged some 13% behind last year's due to a large drop in Model 3 registrations.
California registration for Tesla's Model 3 mass-market sedan, which in the past accounted for more than half of total registrations, fell 60% on a yearly basis to 6,500.
At nearly 7,300, registrations in the state for Tesla's Model Y compact crossover utility vehicle surpassed those for the Model 3.
Earlier this month, Tesla said it delivered 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, an all-time record, yet shares fell as some analysts doubted if the world's most valuable carmaker could hit its ambitious year-end target of half a million deliveries.
Total third-quarter vehicle registrations in the 23 states where data was collected and which Cross-Sell said account for 65% of the U.S. market, remained roughly equal to last year at around 32,800 vehicles.
Registration figures might not accurately reflect the number of vehicle deliveries during the quarter as registrations in the United States typically take about 30 days from the time of sale.

Tesla, whose shares have surged more than five-fold this year, is expected to report third-quarter results after market close on Wednesday.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Starboard Value boosted its stake in  ACI Worldwide  Inc (O:ACIW) to 9%, according to a regulatory filing made on Monday that helped push the payment systems company's stock up more than 3% in afterhours trading. 
The New York-based hedge fund now owns 10.5 million shares in the Naples, Florida-headquartered company which is worth $3.7 billion, the filing said.
Starboard began building its stake during the first quarter of the year and owned 2 million shares or 1.77% at the end of the second quarter, earlier regulatory filings show. 
Speculation has swirled in the last weeks that Starboard, which launched three new campaigns in the first nine months of 2020, would unveil a larger stake in ACI Worldwide before the company reports third-quarter earnings.
In the filing, Starboard said the company's shares, which have lost 17% since the start of the year, were undervalued when the hedge fund bought them and may propose a variety of changes that could include board changes or a strategic review. 
A spokesman for ACI Worldwide did not have an immediate comment.
Earlier this month, Starboard's CEO, Jeffrey Smith, announced positions in agricultural and chemical company  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA) and ON Semiconductor.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) is expected to announce on Tuesday significant investments to expand production of electric vehicles at a factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee and potentially other sites.
GM said in a statement Monday that it planned to make a ""major U.S. manufacturing investment announcement"" on Tuesday. The Detroit News reported that the automaker planned to begin building the Cadillac Lyriq electric SUV at its Spring Hill, Tenn. plant. AutoForecast Solutions, which tracks industry production plans, said it expects the Lyriq to go into production in late 2022.
GM could move production of vehicles to other plants, resulting in new investments in other locations. AutoForecast Solutions said it expects some electric vehicle production will also be announced for a factory in Mexico.
The automaker's plans for investing in U.S. factories comes with two weeks left in the U.S. presidential election campaign. U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden are competing for support from auto workers in Midwestern swing states.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has outlined plans to invest $20 billion by 2025 in new electric vehicles and electric vehicle battery technology.
The automaker plans to spend $2.5 billion overhauling and retooling its Detroit-Hamtramck factory to build a GMC Hummer EV electric pickup truck, an automated robotaxi and other vehicles.
That plant was formally rechristened on Friday as ""Factory Zero,"" a reference to Barra's goal of ""zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion."" 
GM currently builds its electric Chevrolet Bolt at a large assembly plant in the northern suburbs of Detroit.

At the same time, GM is investing in its large, gasoline-fueled pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, which earn the bulk of the profits the automaker needs to fund its electric vehicle programs.

1148,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 05:55PM ET</span>",ConocoPhillips to buy Concho Resources for $9.7 billion in 2020's top shale deal,"By Arunima Kumar
(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (N:COP) on Monday agreed to buy U.S. shale oil producer  Concho Resources Inc  (N:CXO) for $9.7 billion, as the energy sector consolidates further on the back of lower fuel prices and demand.
The low-premium, all-stock deal comes as many U.S. shale companies have been mired in losses due to weak crude prices and, unlike in past downturns, have struggled to raise new capital to restructure heavy debts.
The deal swaps 1.46 shares of ConocoPhillips for each Concho share, at a premium of about 1.5% over its Friday price. Shares in Concho and ConocoPhillips on Monday fell amid a market selloff, with Concho off 2.8% at $47.26 and ConocoPhillips down 3.2% to $32.70. Concho had sold for as much as $93 a share in January before the COVID-19 pandemic cut oil demand and prices. 
""Size, scope and scale has become more important,"" said Concho Chief Executive Timothy Leach, who will run the combined company's U.S. production excluding Alaska. ""This combination with ConocoPhillips was the best thing for our shareholders."" 
The purchase propels ConocoPhillips to the ranks of the top producers in the Permian Basin, the prime U.S. oilfield, and makes it the largest U.S. independent oil and gas producer, pumping 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd).
The fifth-largest producer by volume in the Permian, Concho pumps about 319,000 bpd, from wells spread across more than half a million acres. ConocoPhillips is a major producer in two other U.S. shale fields but pumps about 50,000 bpd in the Permian.
""Concho has been on the short list of big Permian companies attracting interest due to its large production, vast acreage and relatively low debt,"" said Andrew Dittmar, M&A analyst at consultancy Enverus. 
It has scant drilling acreage on federal lands, a plus given Democratic party presidential candidate Joe Biden's proposal to ban new fracking permits on government property, he said.
ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance said the two executives have a shared vision for building a business that can endure volatile markets. ""We're focused on low-cost supply,"" he said, adding Concho has ""a low-cost supply that fits."" 
The sector has been consolidating after many shale producers borrowed in a bet on higher prices. Prices tanked instead, leaving shale investors with little to show for the rising output and companies struggling to pay down debts. 
The deal continues a trend of all-stock, low-premium combinations, including the WPX Energy-Devon merger and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX)'s purchase of  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL). 
ConocoPhillips said the premium was 15% based on Concho's price on Oct. 13, before news reports on the deal talks surfaced. 
Concho had $3.9 billion in long-term debt at the end of June and has not posted an annual profit since 2018. Its second quarter loss was $435 million, wider than a loss of $97 million a year earlier.
The combined company will hold about 23 billion barrels of oil and gas with an average cost of supply of below $30 per barrel of U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude, ConocoPhillips said.

The deal, which faces shareholder votes, is expected to provide $500 million in annual cost and capital savings by 2022. A closing is expected in the first quarter next year.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois is scheduled to sell $850 million of bonds on Tuesday as investors demand fatter yields for the state's debt due to increased worries over its deep financial woes, which were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.
Ahead of the competitive sale of general obligation bonds due over the next 25 years, the spread for Illinois 10-year bonds over Municipal Market Data's benchmark triple-A yield scale has widened by 10 basis points to 281 basis points since Oct. 1. 
Howard Cure, director of municipal bond research at Evercore Wealth Management, pointed to ""a legitimate fear that the state could go into junk status – although not default on its debt."" 
""The state continues to delay tough decisions with a number of speculative revenues as part of its current budget, including additional federal aid, voter approval for a progressive income tax, and more Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) debt,"" he said, referring to the possibility Illinois, which took out a $1.2 billion cash-flow loan in June from the Federal Reserve's MLF, could borrow more.
Illinois is the lowest-rated state at a notch above junk due to its huge unfunded pension liability and chronic structural budget deficit. All three major credit rating agencies assigned negative outlooks to their ratings in the wake of the pandemic.
Earlier this month, a Citi research report said Illinois is ""almost guaranteed"" a credit rating downgrade to junk if a constitutional amendment to replace its flat income tax rate with graduated rates fails to pass on Nov. 3. The ability to tax high earners more would increase revenue by an estimated $3.1 billion annually.
In addition to uncertainty over congressional passage of unrestricted federal virus aid to states, Andrew Richman, senior fixed income strategist at Sterling Capital Management, said Illinois was experiencing a surge in virus cases ahead of its sizeable bond sale. The state reported its highest one-day total of 4,554 cases on Friday. 
""Illinois had problems before the pandemic,"" Richman said. ""Things are getting worse not better.""
Still, John Mousseau, president and CEO of Cumberland Advisors, said the high yields will attract buyers.
""People will buy it. They are yield-starved,"" he said.

Investing.com - PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) reported on Monday third-quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines as firmer margins helped ease the pandemic-led dent to growth.  
PPG Industries announced earnings per share of $1.93 on revenue of $3.69B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.76 on revenue of $3.64B.
Sales volumes were down about 5% versus the prior year, which ""reflect ongoing negative economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the company said.
Operating margins were about 300 basis points higher than the prior year, thanks to continued efforts to cut costs.
PPG Industries shares are down 0% from the beginning of the year, still down 2.76% from its 52 week high of $138.39 set on October 16. They are under-performing the S&P 500 which is up 6.08% from the start of the year.
Looking ahead, the company said it is ""likely to experience normal seasonal trends"" in the fourth quarter, especially in its European and North American architectural coatings businesses.
“Even with the continued uncertainty from the pandemic we expect overall economic activity to continue to recover, but in an uneven manner. The pandemic is still significantly impacting the demand for certain coatings products – most notably, global commercial aerospace, marine, and protective coatings that support the oil and gas industry,"" it added."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Monday as Washington lawmakers still appeared to struggle to reach an agreement on coronavirus stimulus ahead of a Tuesday deadline that would make a relief package possible ahead of the Nov. 3 elections. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that in order to push through an agreement before the election, it would have to be settled on by Tuesday.
Pelosi and Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin ""continued to narrow their differences"" in conversations on Monday and Pelosi was hopeful that by the end of Tuesday there will be ""clarity"" on whether coronavirus stimulus is possible before Nov. 3 election, according to a spokesperson for Pelosi. 
Investors were also worried about rising coronavirus cases in parts of the United States and about whether U.S. President Donald Trump might end up contesting the election results. 
""The lack of news on stimulus is worrisome compounded by worsening virus trends and uncertainty ahead of the elections,"" said Mona Mahajan, U.S. Investment Strategist, Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, New York.
Last week, the White House proposed a $1.8 trillion stimulus package that Pelosi rejected because it fell short of her demand for $2.2 trillion in aid. 
""There's a decent case that regardless of who wins if stimulus doesn't happen before the election it'll happen afterward,"" said Mahajan but she added, ""with (virus) cases rising again stimulus will be important."" 
As Wisconsin battled one of the worst coronavirus surges in the United States, a judge on Monday reinstated restrictions. In New Mexico, the governor warned that the state's healthcare resources might not be sufficient if cases keep rising at the current pace.
The number of new COVID-19 cases in the United States last week rose 13% to more than 393,000, approaching levels last seen during a summer peak, according to a Reuters analysis. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 410.89 points, or 1.44%, to 28,195.42, the S&P 500 lost 56.89 points, or 1.63%, to 3,426.92 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 192.67 points, or 1.65%, to 11,478.88.
All 11 major S&P industry sectors closed lower, with energy , down 2%, leading the percentage declines followed by the communication services index, down 1.9%. Only the defensive utilities sector, down 0.9%, finished with a decline of less than 1%. 
High flyers stocks Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) all fell more than 2% and created the biggest drags on the S&P 500.
Wall Street's fear gauge closed higher for a sixth straight session and finished above 29 for the first time since Oct. 6 as U.S. election campaigns kicked into high gear.
Nearly 30 million Americans have cast early ballots, shattering records as voters adjust to the coronavirus pandemic, including in Florida, battleground state that on Monday opened polls to early voting.
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden will debate for a final time on Thursday.
The election is ""weighing on investor sentiment a bit and maybe there's incremental concern there will be a contested election,"" according to Mahajan citing poll stabilization and betting odds reflecting higher expectations for a Trump win. 
The Dow Jones Transport Average closed down 1% after reversing course late in the afternoon as hopes dimmed for stimulus deal during the session. 
Still it outperformed the broader market as the U.S. Transportation Security Administration said it screened more than 1 million airline passengers on Sunday for the first time since mid-March.
After the financial sector set a mixed tone for the start of the third-quarter earnings season last week, investors will look to results from about 91 S&P 500 companies this week.
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp was down 1% in choppy after-the-bell trading when it reported results. 
ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) shares fell 3.2% after it agreed to buy U.S. shale oil producer Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) Inc for $9.7 billion as the energy sector continued to consolidate.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.67-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.30-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 25 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 101 new highs and 29 new lows. 

On U.S. exchanges, 8.698 billion shares changed hands compared with the 9.213 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

1153,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 04:30PM ET</span>",AMC to reopen more theaters in the United States,"(Reuters) - AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (N:AMC), the world's largest theater chain, said on Monday it plans to open more cinemas in the United States this week, offering some hope to an industry hammered by pandemic restrictions and sending its shares up 24%.
The company said it will reopen about a dozen locations in New York state starting Oct. 23, following guidance from Governor Andrew Cuomo over the weekend, and plans to have more than 530 theaters open in the country by the end of the month.
While big theater chains such as AMC Entertainment, Cineworld Group (L:CINE) and others have reopened many locations, audiences have been thin due to virus fears and delays in major releases by studios. Small and mid-sized theater companies have said they may not survive the impact of the pandemic.
AMC's shares have slumped nearly 60% this year and last week Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron told Reuters the company may need to raise additional capital either entirely or mostly through equity.
The company last week said it continued to explore sources of additional liquidity, as it sees its cash resources largely depleted by the end of 2020 or the start of 2021 at its existing cash-burn rate.
Earlier this month, AMC had said more than 80% of its theaters in the country would remain open.
The number of people visiting AMC's cinemas has slumped 85% compared to last year, since they reopened after lockdowns were eased, the company said.

Cineworld, the world's second-biggest cinema operator, said earlier this month it would close all its screens in the United States and Britain after studios delayed major releases including the latest James Bond film.

1154,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 04:18PM ET</span>",Ant IPO Pushes Demand for Hong Kong Dollars to Most on Record,"(Bloomberg) -- Demand for Hong Kong dollars hasn’t been this strong since before the global financial crisis, when the U.S. Federal Reserve flooded markets with liquidity.
Stock sales from Chinese megacaps such as Ant Group’s anticipated offering have drawn so much cash to Hong Kong that the city’s currency has remained near the strongest it’s allowed to trade against the greenback since April. This year’s inflows have forced the de facto central bank to sell local dollars, interventions that will have helped replenish the cash pool by about HK$280 billion ($36 billion) by Wednesday. The record annual increase is more than 2008 and 2009 combined.
Back then, a credit squeeze globally forced Hong Kong’s businesses to repatriate funds to meet their liquidity needs, while the Fed’s quantitative easing program weakened the greenback. In March this year, Hong Kong dollar assets became more attractive versus the greenback after the Fed aggressively slashed rates to zero in the wake of the pandemic, a move that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority did not replicate.
Like in 2009, the currency’s strength has persisted because there’s so much investor interest in firms queuing up to list on Hong Kong’s stock exchange. Ant’s listing is expected to be so popular that Hong Kong brokers are offering mom-and-pop investors 20 times leverage to buy the shares, with only 5% cash as a down payment.
Share sales in Hong Kong have raised a combined $23.4 billion through late September, the third-most globally, according to a research note from accounting firm KPMG. The city has emerged as an alternative venue for overseas Chinese firms facing rising regulatory risks amid U.S-China tensions. JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc., NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc. and Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC) Inc. are among the U.S.-listed Chinese companies that have sought to list closer to home in Hong Kong this year.
Money is also pouring from across the border. Stock links with mainland exchanges -- the first of which didn’t exist until 2014 -- earlier this year was attracting a record pace of inflows from investors in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
“The development of Hong Kong’s stock market will attract capital inflows,” said Raymond Yeung, chief Greater China economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “More listings of Chinese firms have helped boost demand for the Hong Kong dollar.”
The city’s dollar has been steadfast also because of its yield advantage over its U.S. counterpart. The Hong Kong dollar’s interest rate premium over the greenback was more than 100 basis points earlier this year -- the widest since 1999. Although the gap has shrunk significantly in recent months, borrowing in the U.S. currency to buy the Hong Kong dollar remains lucrative given the low interest rate environment in the U.S., said Tommy Ong, managing director for treasury and markets at DBS Hong Kong Ltd.
Hong Kong has pegged its currency to the greenback since 1983. In 2005 policy makers decided to keep the currency within a trading range between HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 per dollar. The HKMA intervenes when the dollar trades at one end or the other, either by buying or selling the city’s dollars.
Authorities have intervened 70 times this year to prevent the currency from strengthening past its permitted trading range with the U.S. dollar, including Monday’s HK$20.4 billion sale, the biggest since 2015. More interventions are to be expected if the Hong Kong dollar continues to hit the strong end of its trading band.
“It’s just the beginning of an up-cycle,” said ANZ’s Yeung. “I see the Hong Kong dollar’s strength persisting for a long period of time.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.43%, or 408 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.63%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.65%.
As talks between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin got underway earlier today, the house speaker reportedly signaled both sides remain apart on a deal.


The White House's $1.8 trillion deal tabled earlier this month fell short of the $2.2 trillion package proposed by the Democrats. Senate Republicans, meanwhile, will vote on a narrower $500 billion bill on Tuesday.

Investing.com -- Stocks took a beating on Monday to kick off a big week of earnings reports that should act as a barometer of the economic recovery so far, though lawmakers continue to struggle with finding agreement on a new stimulus bill.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank more than 400 points in the afternoon session after it became clear a Tuesday deadline for that agreement would likely not result in solid progress. 
With the election just a couple of weeks away, it seems likely an agreement wouldn’t be reached until later this fall. 
Procter & Gamble and Netflix report Tuesday, and data on housing starts for September are due out.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow. 
1. Household demand for cleaning products likely boosts P&G
Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) reports before the opening bell, and analysts tracked by Investing.com expect earnings per share of $1.41 on revenue of $18.3 billion.
The consumer products giant is seen benefiting from demand for its household cleaning products, with brands like Swiffer, Mr. Clean and Comet, as households spruced up from Covid-19 lockdowns. 
2. Video streaming a big pandemic winner, though analysts listen for the outlook
Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), the popular streaming video service also reports on Tuesday, after the closing bell. Analysts expect earnings per share of $2.13 on revenue of $6.4 billion.
This is another stock that racked up gains during the lockdowns that forced people to hunker down at home, leading to big gains in subscribers. By comparison, new subscriber numbers from the second half aren’t likely to be as great. Analysts will be listening for Netflix’s outlook. The much-anticipated fourth season of The Crown is due out in November.
3. Housing starts for September expected to grow
One of the confirmed trends of the pandemic is that people are moving out of cities to suburbs or more rural areas, boosting existing real estate as well as new construction.
Housing starts for September are due out at 8:30 AM ET (1230GMT). Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect 1.457 million, up slightly from 1.416 million in August. Home building bounced back strongly during the summer after a lull in the spring.

(Reuters) - Unions representing over 10,000  Disney  theme park workers have told California Governor Gavin Newsom that the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, can safely reopen when its location moves into the state's ""orange tier"" of COVID-19 test positivity and adjusted case rate.
""We wrote you in June 2020 to tell you that we were not yet convinced that it was safe to reopen the parks on Disney’s timetable,"" the unions wrote in a letter dated Oct. 17. ""Since then, Disney has taken safety measures we advocated, and engaged with their workers’ representatives, (such that) our original position has changed."" 
The unions urged Newsom to direct the state’s task force in charge of theme park reopening to meet with them as part of the reopening process.
Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Co closed Disneyland in March in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The company had announced it would reopen the resort on July 17 but later delayed the move indefinitely, saying it had to wait for the state's guidance.
Disney has reopened all of its other theme parks, including Walt Disney World in Florida, with limited attendance, mask requirements and other safety measures.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - The trading arm of the Toyota Group has invested $4 million in Ugandan start-up Tugende, saying it hopes the firm's loans to small, independent businesses will also help customers buy the carmaker's vehicles.
Launched in 2012 in Uganda, Tugende began by offering motorcycle loans to riders and has since expanded to offer loans for everything from fishing boats and minibus taxis to sewing machines and refrigerators for small shops. It opened a branch in Kenya last November.
The investment in Tugende came from Mobility 54, the investment fund for Toyota Tshusho Corporation as part of $6.3 million Tugende raised in its Series A investment round this month.
""We see a huge potential for Tugende business in the taxi market,"" Mobility 54's chief executive officer Takeshi Watanabe told Reuters, noting that many minibus taxis were Toyotas.
Watanabe said the group aimed to invest $45 million in transportation and asset-financing start-ups like Tugende in Africa next year. 
Tugende's ""mortgages"" - the bikers wouldn't get a title to the bike until the final payment was made - target people like Mark Yaweh. 
The 25-year-old motorcycle taxi driver had scraped by riding someone else's bike for three years, but put a downpayment on a new one and hoped to own his own after 18 months.
""I’m excited, I yearned for this,"" said Yaweh, wearing a mask and a pink reflector jacket.
Banks are often reluctant to lend money to small or informal businesses in Africa because of the high rate of default. 
The financing gap for micro, small and medium enterprises in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated at $331 billion, according to a 2017 report by the International Finance Corporation, the private investment arm of the World Bank.
Development organizations say the kind of microlending Tugende is providing is key to closing that gap. 
With an asset base of $30 million, the start-up has handed out about 35,000 bike ""mortgages"" so far in Uganda, which Tugende estimates has about 800,000 riders.
More than three-quarters of the borrowers pay off the two-year loans off early using mobile money service or other digital platforms, said Michael Wilkerson, Tugende's chief executive. 
Wilkerson said Tugende was seeking further $40 million in debt and equity to expand its existing motorcycle mortgages, grow its new motor vehicle financing product and enter new markets in the region.

Free cash flow amounted to 3.07 billon euros ($3.61 billion) in the third quarter, up from 714 million euros ($840.16 million) in the year-earlier period, the carmaker said late on Monday. 
""This was due in particular to a faster recovery in several markets, which led to higher sales growth,"" BMW said in a preliminary earnings release which was published ahead of the company's scheduled quarterly earnings on Nov. 4.
An optimisation of working capital and a reduction of fixed costs and capital expenditure had helped to bolster earnings, but earnings forecasts for the individual segments and the multi-brand carmaking group remain unchanged.
""Economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic continues to significantly impair forecasting and leads therefore to considerable uncertainty in providing an accurate outlook,"" BMW said.

Investing.com – The Dow fell Monday, as U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reportedly signaled that a deal was not imminent, denting hopes of a deal somewhat with just a day to go until the Tuesday deadline imposed by the house speaker. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.37%, or 391 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.56%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.46%.
As talks between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi got underway, Pelosi reportedly said that negotiators are still trying to reach consensus on a deal. Both sides had previously touted optimism they can get a deal over the line before the U.S. election.
White House Spokeswoman Alyssa Farah said Monday that the White House was ""cautiously optimistic"" Pelosi may be moving toward making a deal on the new stimulus package.
The White House's $1.8 trillion deal is short of the $2.2 trillion package proposed by the Democrats. Senate Republicans, meanwhile, will vote on a narrower $500 billion bill on Tuesday.
The selling in the broader market was led by tech as investors seemingly continue to ditch growth. Netflix kicks off earnings for FAANG stocks on Tuesday.
Ahead its quarterly earnings report, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) rose more than 1%, despite some on Wall Street expressing concern the streaming giant's pace of content creation may struggle to keep up with demand, leading to a slowdown in subscriber growth.
""The extraordinary level of consumption of Netflix content multiplied by its large subscriber base suggests to us that some meaningful percentage of subscribers will 'finish' Netflix before a large quantity of new content can be produced,"" Wedbush said in a note.
Other mega-cap tech names were also lower. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) traded in the red.
Financials started the week on a sour note, led by Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and   State Street  (NYSE:STT) with the latter down more than 3%.
 Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS), turned negative after rising intraday after  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) lifted its price target on the stock to $262 from $255.
In other news, AMC Entertainment  (NYSE:AMC) jumped 14% after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said theatres in most of New York, but excluding New York City, could reopen on Oct. 23. The cash-strapped theatre chain has warned it could run of cash by year-end of the first quarter of 2021 as delays to blockbuster movies and reduced box office sales owing to the impact of the pandemic.
Sentiment was also weighed down by signs infections across the U.S. are gathering pace, with nearly 70,000 new cases recorded Friday, the highest one-day rise since July.
On the economic front, housing activity shows no sign of slowing after the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose  two points to 85 in October."
1163,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>","Verizon signs up Microsoft, Nokia to help clients build private 5G networks","By Supantha Mukherjee and Kenneth Li
STOCKHOLM/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon (N:VZ) said on Monday it has struck deals with Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Nokia (HE:NOKIA) to improve the telecoms giant's ability to target business customers by offering clients the ability to automate factory floors, lower costs and speed up data traffic through private 5G networks.
Private 5G networks remove the need for businesses to jostle for speed with others on a public network and help enable data-intensive applications that use computer vision, augmented reality and machine learning to increase productivity. 
Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing business, will run on top of Verizon's 5G network to processes the data generated by machines at the local facility and use artificial intelligence to automate operations. Microsoft launched the new service late last month directed at telecom operators. 
U.S.-based logistics company Ice Mobility is the first customer for the new partnership, allowing it to track employees packing the products into the right boxes to skip quality control. https://youtu.be/XOgax6kgOr0 
""This is about creating a new business opportunity for everyone,"" Verizon's Chief Strategy Officer Rima Qureshi said. She declined to disclose how the revenue would be shared between Verizon and Microsoft.
While 4G helped create multi-billion dollar businesses ranging from music and video streaming to cab hailing and food delivery, telecom operators seldom got a share of that growth. 
Verizon is now keen on taking a share in new businesses that 5G might enable, either by partnering with bigger companies or by buying stakes in smaller ones such as virtual reality company 8i to Swiftmile, which makes charging systems for electric scooters.
In international markets, where Verizon doesn't have its own network, it is working with Nokia to build private networks for manufacturing and logistics companies. 

""Next year will be all about deploying private 5G and not about commercial success and we will start seeing early monetization from 2022 onwards,"" Sowmyanarayan Sampath, president of Verizon's global enterprise business, told Reuters.

1164,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>",Biotech Investor Sees Covid-19 Drug Shaking Off Company’s Tarnished Past,"(Bloomberg) -- Biotech investor Dale Chappell was looking to start Humanigen Inc. with a clean slate when his hedge fund assumed control in 2016, but things took longer than expected.
The stock has swelled over 500% this year after positive early results from an experimental treatment for a potentially lethal side-effect of Covid-19. The shares have been volatile since July when it reached a more-than four-year high, though results expected this quarter from a late-stage study may be the ticket to keep Humanigen on track after a roller coaster ride.
Chappell, who has a medical degree from Dartmouth College and served a fellowship with the National Cancer Institute, saw promise in the pipeline of Humanigen, then known as KaloBios, when he first took a stake in 2016. Investors may remember KaloBios as a company teetering on the edge of bankruptcy before the now disgraced and jailed Martin Shkreli swept in and took it over in 2015. Shkreli’s one-month stint as CEO left the company badly scarred before it fell into insolvency.
That’s when Chappell and the fund he founded, Black Horse Capital LP, stepped in to provide financing to get the company back on its feet.
“Maybe naively, I thought that reputational damaged could be fixed pretty quickly with a change in management and board,” Chappell said in a phone interview. “It’s taken a long time, but I think we’re now on the other side of that.”
Along with being Humanigen’s top holder with a 27% stake as of Sept. 18, he’s also the California-based company’s chief scientific officer who once studied the mechanism behind its lead drug candidate.
Cytokine Storm
The medicine, a lab-made molecule known as lenzilumab, targets inflammation and an extreme immune response called cytokine storm. Results from a Humanigen-sponsored study in 300 hospitalized Covid patients are expected this quarter. Lenzilumab was also selected for testing in combination with  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD).’s remdesivir by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The agency-funded study is looking to speed up development of promising medicines for Covid-19.
If positive, results from Humanigen’s study could be enough for an emergency authorization from U.S. regulators and the biotech has manufacturing pacts in place with Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc., Catalent (NYSE:CTLT) Inc. and the Swiss Lonza Group AG to ramp up production if an authorization is granted.
The company also recently moved up the food chain to the Nasdaq Capital Market after years trading over-the-counter. Since the move, two analysts kicked off coverage of Humanigen, both with a buy rating and more initiations may follow. All of this should be good news for shares, which have pulled back 40% from its July high because some investors had expected a faster move to the Nasdaq.
“I wouldn’t focus so much on the stock price, look at the execution since we’ve moved into Covid-19, one of the most competitive areas of all of biopharma,” Chappell said, pointing to the company’s manufacturing contracts and advancement to late-stage study.
Chappell is looking for the Phase 3 trial to show lenzilumab gets patients out of the hospital in roughly six days, while the control arm -- where patients receive the current standard of care will likely take about nine days to recover. A much smaller study run by the Mayo Clinic showed patients getting lenzilumab recovered in five days.
Furthest Along
Other companies are also working on similar treatments although Humanigen appears furthest along. Shanghai-based I-Mab, as well as another entrepreneur-backed company, Vivek Ramaswamy’s Roivant Sciences are testing medicines that also target granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, a substance that spurs on the production of white blood cells.
A mid-stage study of a medicine from Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:KNSA) Ltd. in Covid patients with pneumonia and hyper-inflammation will also have results in the fourth quarter. GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) PLC is testing otilimab in Covid patients with severe pulmonary disease and expects results early next year.
Lenzilumab has an edge as Humanigen has been developing it for the past four years for cytokine release syndrome, according to Chappell. It’s also being tested in a partnership with Gilead’s Kite for use with CAR-T cancer medicines which are known to trigger the immune overreaction.
“We’re all trying to make an impact on this pandemic; there’ll probably be more than one solution,” he said. “I don’t think that we should be thinking about this as a winner-take-all type of strategy.”

1165,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 02:09PM ET</span>","Bitcoin Approaches $12,000 After Snapping Equities Correlation","(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin’s biggest rally in more than a week has pushed it to the brink of $12,000, a key level watched by chartists and technicians.
The world’s largest digital currency rose as much as 3.4% on Monday to around $11,835. Crypto fans are closely watching the $12,000 level as a major hurdle to cross before it can embark on a bigger rally.
The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which tracks some of the largest digital coins, also rose, gaining 4.5% at one point. Dash and Monero were among the biggest advancers, each rising more than 5%.
On Monday, the International Monetary Fund hosted a virtual panel on cross-border payments and digital currencies which featured BIS General Manager Agustin Carstens as well as the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, among others. Powell said the central bank is evaluating the costs and benefits of a digital currency but has not decided yet on whether to issue one. He also nodded to  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).’s Libra as a catalyst for focusing more attention on the issues.
The discussion at least partly helps explain Bitcoin’s move higher as it was closely watched by the crypto community, said Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Economics.
“Comments from Jerome Powell and the other participants made it clear just how far apart the various countries are when it comes to CBDCs,” said Greenspan, referring to central bank digital currencies. “Many on social media were quick to point out that a truly global and decentralized digital currency already exists.”
The coin’s trading Monday also helped it buck a recent trend of moving in tandem with U.S. equities, whereby it was often rising when they were and falling on risk-off days. The S&P 500 Index dropped as investors weighed the latest progress on a new government spending bill meant to help shore up the economy.
Many analysts remain bullish on the cryptocurrency, heartened by its limited supply and comforted by greater institutional acceptance in recent weeks.  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ)., for instance, said earlier this month that it has made an investment of about $50 million in Bitcoin.
ICYMI: Square Puts $50 Million in Bitcoin on Crypto ‘Empowerment’ Bet
“We see Bitcoin emerging as a relative oasis of calm and outperformance,” wrote Mike McGlone, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, in a note. “There should be little doubt technology and digitization will continue advancing, yet Bitcoin’s supply will keep shrinking, supporting its price.”

Cerberus Telecom Acquisition Corp is now looking to raise $300 million, selling 30 million shares at $10 apiece, its regulatory filing https:// showed.
Earlier, the company had aimed to sell 40 million shares at $10 apiece.
The special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) is being backed by Cerberus Telecom Acquisition Holdings LLC, an affiliate of Cerberus Capital.
A blank-check firm, also known as a SPAC, uses IPO proceeds to buy another company, in a deal that takes the other company public.
The year has seen many companies prefer the SPAC route to public markets over a traditional IPO. Earlier on Monday, payment services provider Billtrust also said it would go public through such a merger with a blank-check company.
SPACs have so far raised $55 billion through IPOs in 2020, by far the largest haul on record and more than the prior five years combined, according to SPAC Research.
However, SPACs like Spartacus Acquisition Corp  and ArcLight Clean Transition Corp (O:ACTCU) also had to downsize their IPOs earlier this year, indicating there is a limit to the amount of capital investors have to back new SPACs.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities are the underwriters for the Cerberus offering.

1169,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 01:20PM ET</span>",Lawsuit accuses Indian hackers of leaking businessman's emails,"(Reuters) - Iranian-American businessman Farhad Azima has accused a pair of Indian companies of stealing his emails and publishing them to the web, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court in North Carolina.
Azima's suit alleges that Indian security company CyberRoot Risk Advisory and New Delhi-based BellTroX InfoTech Services carried out the hack-and-leak at the behest of American private intelligence company Vital Management Services, which in turn had been hired by the international law firm Dechert on behalf of the Ras Al Khaimah Investment Authority (RAKIA), an investment fund based in the United Arab Emirates.  
Reuters reported in June that BellTroX was at the center of a years-long hacking campaign that targeted more than 10,000 accounts across the globe, citing three former employees, outside researchers and a trail of online evidence.
BellTroX founder Sumit Gupta could not be reached. Gupta, who is a fugitive from U.S. justice in connection with a separate hacking case, has previously told Reuters he would sometimes ""download some mails"" on behalf of private investigators but didn't elaborate and has denied wrongdoing.
The Ras Al Khaimah Economic Zone, which took over RAKIA in 2017, didn’t return messages. Dechert's global head of communications, Saira Zaki, and Vital's president, Nicholas del Rosso, also did not respond to messages seeking comment. Dechert and del Rosso have previously denied wrongdoing in relation to the stolen Azima emails. CyberRoot and its executives did not respond to messages.
The lawsuit is the latest skirmish in a battle between Azima – a 79-year-old tycoon with longstanding ties to the Middle East – and RAKIA, which accuses him of fraud in relation to various business deals, including a luxury hotel sale in Georgia and a training academy in Ras Al Khaimah. Azima denies the claims, accusing RAKIA in a U.K. lawsuit of basing its case on emails that he says the authority stole and then leaked. 
In May a British judge ruled in favor of RAKIA, ordering Azima to pay more than $4.1 million. The judge also rebuffed Azima's claim of hacking, saying that while the allegation was ""not impossible,"" evidence for it was ""far from conclusive."" Azima has since been granted permission to appeal the judgment. 
Azima also took his case to Washington D.C., where he alleged that RAKIA had violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The U.S. suit was dismissed last year on jurisdictional grounds.
Although the U.K. litigation has previously mentioned del Rosso, Azima’s new case – filed Thursday – is the first time he has publicly identified the hackers he says are directly involved, naming CyberRoot and BellTroX as the firms responsible for the digital break-in.
Azima alleges in the lawsuit that Chapel Hill, North Carolina-based Vital and del Rosso “paid CyberRoot more than $1 million for the hacking of Azima and the dissemination of his stolen data” and that CyberRoot drew on BellTroX’s assistance in carrying out the work. The suit further states that del Rosso was “hired to do so” by Dechert “on behalf of RAKIA.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and Poland have struck a nuclear power agreement in which Poland will likely buy $18 billion in nuclear technology from U.S. companies, the U.S. energy department said on Monday.
The United States has been competing with China and Russia and other countries to supply nuclear power technology to countries hoping to build their first reactors, or boost their programs.
""We are hopeful that the ultimate decisions that are made by Poland ... over a period of time will result in them choosing U.S. technology,"" U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette told reporters in a teleconference. 
Brouillette said the reactors would help lessen Poland's dependence on Russia for energy security. 
Poland, traditionally a large purchaser of Russia's natural gas, which competes with nuclear power, aims to halt those purchases after 2022. Instead, it will take pipeline deliveries from Norway and liquefied natural gas, from the United States and others. 
Over the next 18 months, the United States and Poland will work on an a report for the program that seeks to build six reactors, as well as potential financing arrangements, the department said. 
The first reactors are planned to be in operation by 2033 in a program that will potentially be worth $40 billion, a senior U.S. energy department official said. Poland would buy at least $18 billion from U.S. companies, the official said. 
Westinghouse, owned by  Brookfield Asset Management  (TO:BAMa), Bechtel and  Southern Co  (N:SO) and the U.S. government, will participate in a first step in the agreement, an engineering study for planned plants, the official said. 
This month the United States and Romania came to an initial $8 billion agreement on the construction of two reactors on the river Danube. Romanian state-owned nuclear power producer Nuclearelectrica (BX:ROSNN) ended talks with China General Nuclear (CGN) about the construction of the reactors after they had dragged on for six years.

Bridgestone, which announced its plans to close the facility one month ago, is willing to examine the proposal, according to Pannier-Runacher.
She said the bailout involved a roughly 100 million euro investment that would safeguard the jobs of more than half of the 863 employees at the Bethune site.
""I had a shareholder who wasn't interested in reexamining the case. Now it is,"" Pannier-Runacher told a press conference, adding she did not exclude the involvement of the French state.
Bridgestone said in mid-September that shutting down the plant was the only response to excess capacity and safeguarding competitiveness.
There was no immediate reaction from Bridgestone on Monday.
Xavier Bertrand, who heads the Hauts-de-France regional authority and is a candidate for the conservative ticket in the 2022 presidential election, said he wanted a quick answer from the company.

""If it's a no, we'll enter into a battle to get the most for (the plant's) employees,"" Bertrand told the same news conference. ""Because that's not how you pull out in France.""

1178,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",Social bond issuance soars on back of coronavirus crisis,"By Clara Denina 
LONDON (Reuters) - The volume of social bonds issued in 2020 has jumped eight-fold from a year ago, as interest in ethical investment rises and more governments and agencies see them as a key funding tool for specific projects. 
Issuance of social bonds, a type of debt that channels proceeds to specific socially beneficial projects, has surged to $85 billion this year so far, compared with $10.6 billion in the same period of 2019, according to Refinitiv data. 
While still much less-prevalent than green bonds, social bonds' popularity has jumped as the COVID-19 crisis led investors to place more emphasis on the ""social"" component of environmental, social and governance-driven (ESG) investing. 
""The pandemic has strengthened the link between humanitarian and economic crises, so you saw a sharp increase in bonds targeting societal issues from April onwards,"" said David Katimbo Mugwanya, a fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management. 
French government agency Cades, which manages debt from the social security system, and unemployment insurance fund Unedic have been the biggest issuers of social bonds this year at a combined $22 billion, using them to fund projects aimed at tackling unemployment.
Other issuers include governments, supranational organisations such as the Asian Development Bank, and an increasing number of companies. 
Bank of America (N:BAC) issued a $1 billion bond in May, the proceeds of which will be lent to not-for-profit hospitals, nursing homes and manufacturers of healthcare equipment. It separately issued a $2 billion sustainability bond, aimed at providing more affordable finance to Black and Hispanic-Latino communities.
Spain's CaixaBank (MC:CABK) issued a 1 billion euro bond last month aimed, in part, at helping provide more loans to low-income households to help with healthcare, education and household repairs. 
For a graphic on Social bonds issued:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/xegvblmbnvq/Social%20bonds.PNG
Social bonds emerged in 2010, when Social Finance, a British not-for-profit consultancy, raised 5 million pounds ($6.5 million) to help reduce reoffending among short-sentenced offenders leaving prison in Peterborough, eastern England. 
In 2017, the bonds were judged to have helped reduced reoffending by 9%, above the project's 7.5% target, so the Ministry of Justice and a fund run by Britain's national lottery paid investors back their money plus a return equalling 3% a year. 
Since then, social bond issuance has increased relatively steadily globally, until this year's sudden leap. 
Development banks have used social bonds to fund COVID spending, the data shows, while the first social bond of the European Union's SURE unemployment scheme is expected as early as Tuesday. The up to 100-billion-euro SURE scheme is one of the coronavirus recovery plans for EU members that offers loans as financial support.
""Investors are likely to continue to show appetite for that type of issuance, with a preference for companies that use it to fund long-term solutions to the crisis, like a vaccine for example,"" Katimbo Mugwanya added.

Companies like British healthcare property owner Assura Group and luxury fashion house Burberry also issued their first social and sustainability bonds respectively in September.
Burberry's sustainability bond aims to finance projects such as ensuring its cotton comes from sustainable sources and improving employment conditions for manufacturing its products.

The U.S. carmaker, which started delivering vehicles made in its Shanghai factory in December, will export China-made cars this month to countries including Germany, France, Italy and Switzerland, it said in a statement.
Elsewhere, German rival BMW is preparing to export its electric iX3 model, made at a joint venture plant in Shenyang, China, to Europe, while Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) is shifting production of its Smart branded city cars to Hangzhou Bay.
Tesla has been expanding in China even as tensions between Washington and Beijing have been escalating. The Shanghai factory, Tesla's first car plant outside of the United States, aims to build 150,000 vehicles this year.
""Support from Chinese government towards the industry, innovative local companies and customers embracing new technologies make China the best market for smart electric vehicles,"" Tesla said, adding it would expand car production, charging and sales networks in China.
The electric vehicle maker, which sold more than 11,000 Model 3 cars last month in China, the world's biggest auto market, is also building new car manufacturing capacity in Shanghai to make its Model Y sport-utility vehicles. 
Reuters reported in September that Tesla was planning to export Model 3 vehicles made in China to Asian and European markets, citing people familiar with the matter.

The export of the Model 3 to Europe comes as Tesla is in the process of building a German factory on the outskirts of Berlin and after the German government announced a subsidy of up to 9,000 euros for buyers of electric cars, including the Model 3.

1181,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 11:11AM ET</span>","Mnuchin, Pelosi to Talk Fiscal Stimulus Again Monday Afternoon","(Bloomberg) -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will hold a call Monday afternoon on a fiscal-stimulus package, a day before Pelosi’s deadline for a pre-election package expires.
The two main negotiators will speak at 3 p.m., according to a person familiar with the plan who asked not to be named as the schedule isn’t public. Mnuchin and Pelosi have in recent days been trying to nail down agreement on a national coronavirus testing program -- one of several issues that’s prevented a stimulus compromise.
“We remain committed to negotiating and also committed to making sure that we get a deal as quickly as possible,” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said on Fox News Monday. “If Nancy Pelosi will be reasonable, she’ll find the president of the United States to be reasonable and we’ll get something across the finish line.”
A welter of dividing lines remain between the two sides, including the scale of assistance to state and local authorities, tax credits Democrats want for lower-income families, liability protections that Republicans are pushing but Democrats oppose, and a repeal of a credit for past business-tax losses that Republicans want to keep.
Before she talks to Mnuchin, Pelosi is set to hold a closed call with House Democrats at 2 p.m. on the current status of stimulus negotiations.
Senate Roadblock
While President Donald Trump said he’s ready to match the $2.2 trillion spending level demanded by Democrats -- or go higher -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has consistently warned that most GOP senators will oppose any coronavirus relief package that big.
Tuesday’s deadline “relates to if we want to get it done before the election, which we do,” Pelosi said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” indicating they could continue talking about passing a stimulus measure after Nov. 3.
Amid the continuing stalemate in negotiations, lawmakers have been voting on single-party proposals in an effort to demonstrate to voters that they’re determined to do something to help households and businesses that continue to be hammered by the Covid-19 crisis.
After House Democrats early this month voted on a $2.2 trillion package, Senate Republicans will try to stage two votes in coming days on separate, smaller relief efforts. Both are expected to be blocked by Democrats.
Tuesday Attempt
First up on Tuesday in the Senate is a standalone bill to allow unused money left over from a $2 trillion March stimulus deal to reinvigorate the Paycheck Protection Program, which provides help to small businesses facing the risk of layoffs.
On Wednesday, McConnell plans to proceed with a broader package, on a scale that Democrats say isn’t sufficient. His last attempt at such a move, in September, was blocked.
Trump has repeatedly expressed confidence that reluctant Republicans will follow his lead. If Pelosi would go along with the administration’s offer, “I think they would too on stimulus,” he told reporters in Reno, Nevada on Sunday. “So let’s see what happens.”
Meadows said if Pelosi and the administration get an agreement, McConnell “will bring it to the floor, it will get a vote and hopefully we’ll get stimulus on the way to the American people.”
Post-Election
Most forecasters say nothing will be done before the Nov. 3 election. The question then is whether relief could get wrapped into an overall spending bill, which is due by Dec. 11. Without passage of such a stopgap funding package, the federal government faces a shutdown.
But it’s uncertain how Trump would approach post-election talks if he loses to Democrat Joe Biden, or whether he could drive a harder bargain if he’s re-elected.
“Anybody who would want to predict what President Trump will or won’t do is doing so at their own risk,” said former Republican House Speaker John Boehner.
Boehner, now a senior strategic adviser at lobbying and law firm Squire Patton Boggs, said if Trump wins it’s likely that a smaller stimulus bill will be included in government funding legislation that has a Dec. 11 deadline.
“If Joe Biden wins the election they’ll hold off on a stimulus bill of any size until after the inauguration, and then you’re likely to see a rather large stimulus bill pass the Congress and get signed into law,” Boehner said Friday during a virtual event on the post-election outlook held by his firm.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's biggest supermarket chains this week joined a growing boycott of Turkish imports proposed by business leaders and Saudis on social media, as political tensions spilled into trade between the two regional powers. 
Turkey and Saudi Arabia have been at loggerheads since the 2011 ""Arab Spring"" over Ankara's support for Islamist political groups. The 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate escalated tensions sharply.
Othaim Markets (E:4001), Danube Supermarkets, Tamimi Markets and Panda Retail Company issued statements announcing they would stop carrying Turkish goods once existing stocks are sold off.""Our leaders, our government and our security are a red line and they do not accept to be harmed,"" Othaim Markets said in the statement on its company Twitter account.
Saudi Arabia's government media office has said authorities have not placed any restrictions on Turkish goods.
However, in an apparently informal boycott of imports of Turkish goods, signs urging customers not buy Turkish goods were seen in some retail stores in the capital Riyadh last week. 
The head of Saudi Arabia's non-governmental Chambers of Commerce, Ajlan al-Ajlan, called for the boycott earlier this month. 
On social media, the hashtags #Boycott_Turkish_Products and #Turkish_Products_Boycott_Camapaign have been trending over the last month. 
""I came to the supermarket and have avoided all of the Turkish products, because we have to be with the government, all of us should be like one hand,"" said Oum Nasser al-Harbi, a Saudi woman shopping at Othaim Markets. 
TRADE HUB 
In Turkey, exporters said they had experienced growing difficulties with Saudi Arabia, although they faced fewer problems with regional trade hub the United Arab Emirates, which is also opposed to Turkish foreign policy in the region.
""It has been going on for a year, but in the recent period, the pressure on businessmen in Saudi Arabia 'to not buy made in Turkey' has come up,"" said Ferdi Erdogan, head of the Association of Turkish Construction Material Producers.
On Oct. 10, eight leading Turkish business groups urged Saudi Arabia to act to improve trade relations.
""Any official or unofficial initiative to block trade between the two countries will have negative repercussions on our trade relations and be detrimental to the economies of both countries,"" the business groups, including textile exporters and contractors, said in a statement.
In 2019, Turkish exports to the kingdom amounted to some $3.1 billion. So far this year, neither Turkish nor Saudi trade data show an unusually large drop in two-way trade, even allowing for strains on global commerce from the coronavirus pandemic.
In the second quarter, Turkey was Saudi Arabia's 12th trade partner by total import value. The latest data shows Saudi imports from Turkey were worth about $185 million in July, up from roughly $180 million in June.
Some Saudis still see value in bilateral trade even with Turkish, Saudi and Emirati officials trading barbs over the Libya conflict and Ankara's support for Qatar in a dispute with its fellow Gulf states.

""As a consumer, I see that the Turkish products have high quality at a reasonable price,"" Obaid Alosaime said, adding that a boycott would hurt Saudi consumers by limiting their options.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A plan by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to lift the reporting threshold for a minimum of assets under management from $100 million to $3.5 billion has been soundly rejected by the public, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
A 13F filing is a quarterly report required to be submitted by all institutional investment managers within 45 days of the end of a calendar quarter that discloses their equity holdings. 
As the public comment period for the rule has recently ended, Goldman reviewed the 2,262 letters filed with the SEC and found 99% of those to be opposed to the changes, with only 24 in favor. 
According to Goldman Sachs, if the new rule were to be adopted the number of hedge funds required to disclose their long stocks positions would be cut by 89%. 
However, the firm now expects the proposal to be withdrawn given the stiff opposition, which included submissions by ""one of the five SEC Commissioners, the Chair of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, the CFA Institute, the Business Roundtable, the Investment Company Institute, NYSE, and Nasdaq, along with many companies."" 
Goldman said it has used the data disclosed in 13F filings since 2007 to help identify crowded positions along with portfolio and market concentration risk. 
Should the proposal be installed, the new threshold would go into effect with positions at year-end, which would require those positions held on Sept. 30 to be filed by Nov. 15. 
Goldman noted that in an unusual move, SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee released a statement of her own against the proposed change, alongside the public comments. 

In a prior note in August, Goldman said the proposed requirement was justified as ""the assets covered under the new threshold would reflect proportionally the same market value as $100 million represented in 1975."" In addition, the firm said it amounted to regulatory relief related to compliance costs.

(Reuters) - Technology companies led by their founders have been the standout winners in share price performance and profit growth this year, beating companies led by other managers, according to a Reuters analysis.
Major founder-led tech firms have seen their share prices double so far this year, comfortably beating a 7.8% gain for the S&P 500 index (SPX). 
They have also outperformed rival tech firms led by hired managers, enriching investors and adding billions of dollars to the wealth of the founders themselves, including Amazon's (O:AMZN) Jeff Bezos, Netflix's (O:NFLX) Reed Hastings and Tesla's (O:TSLA) Elon Musk.

Profit growth has outperformed too, with founder-led tech firms seeing growth of around 30% over the past five years versus 6.7% for companies led by other managers.
Founder-led tech firms have a history of higher returns and faster recovery in the aftermath of a financial crisis. For instance, in the last bull cycle Amazon's shares surged fifty-fold, while those of Netflix's rose by 100 times.
""Great entrepreneurs thrive in down periods when tectonic shifts are occurring in how business is done. Resetting periods allow visionaries to do more with less,"" said David Brown, co-founder of venture capital firm Impellent Ventures.
""We believe the next few years will create some absolutely amazing businesses. I would posit that investors will be well rewarded by backing a portfolio of entrepreneurial leaders in the coming years.""

This year, the top 400 founder-led stocks from all sectors have registered an average share price gain of 58.4% versus a 10% return for the top 400 stocks led by others.
With many companies' operations hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, investors are scouring for firms likely to recover the quickest. Analysis of capital expenditure (capex) plans suggests why investors think founder-led companies might have an edge.

According to Refinitiv data, founder-led firms are expected to post average net income growth of 22.8% in the next three years, compared with 7.1% growth for non-founder led companies.

Ric Marshall, executive director of MSCI ESG Research, said most founder-led firms would outperform non-founder led companies in both price performance and profit growth this year. 
But while they provide greater opportunities for investors, founder-led companies also come with higher risks, he said.
""In my experience the widely held CEO-led companies were the safer bet – less likely to outperform, but also much less likely to result in dramatic losses,"" he said.

1188,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 09:44AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Higher on Last-Ditch Stimulus Hope; Dow up 150 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Monday, buoyed by hopes for a last-minute agreement on a comprehensive fiscal stimulus package before the elections on November 3.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at the weekend that there were still two days to bridge what appear to be still-wide differences with the Republican administration and Senate over a package, while Senate Leader Mitch McConnell said he would schedule votes on a suite of individual relief measures. While that is unlikely to be enough in itself to get any such measures enacted, it keeps the two sides at least superficially moving towards each other.
Trading is increasingly being overshadowed by the looming elections on November 3, with the consensus expectation of a 'Blue Wave' outcome encouraging expectations of a major fiscal stimulus package in the new year. 
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) argued in a weekly preview that the size of future stimulus will depend largely on the margin of victory, adding that things depend ""more on the outcome of Senate elections than the presidential election result."" Should the Republican Party keep control of the Senate, Jan Hatzius and his team argued, then the ultimate package is likely to be closer to the Senate's current proposals than to the House's.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 78 points, or 0.2%, at 28,676 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.5% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.8%. 
Oil and gas stocks were supported somewhat by the confirmation of ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) agreeing to buy shale producer Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) for $9.7 billion, the biggest acquisition in the sector this year.  However, a fourth straight quarterly loss and grim outlook from Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) underlined the problems the sector continues to face. ConocoPhillips stock was down 1.0%, on perceptions that it may have overpaid. Concho stock, which had risen over 10% last week on reports of the deal happening, gave up 0.2%.
Earlier, the day's only data release of note, the NAHB housing market index, leaped to another all-time high of 83, underscoring the strength of the momentum in a housing market where the pandemic appears to have caused a wave of generational shift in preferences for larger, if less central, properties.
There were a couple of bright performances amongst beaten-down cyclical stocks, with Hertz Global (NYSE:HTZ) stock rising another 14% as its securing of debtor-in-possession financing carves out a path for it to leave Chapter 11 bankruptcy. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock also rose 3.2% in anticipation of the FAA approving the return to service of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX. 
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock meanwhile rose 15% after New York Governor Andrew Cuomo gave the go-ahead for theaters outside New York City to open from Friday. AMC said it will have some 530 theaters open by the end of the month, although whether that will be enough to convince the big studios to resume big releases over the holiday period will still depend on how the pandemic develops. The rate of new infections and hospital admissions in the U.S. has been rising constantly since mid-September.

1189,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 09:09AM ET</span>","Cheaper Renewable Power May Drive Economic Recovery, Lazard Says","(Bloomberg) -- Wind and solar power have become even cheaper compared to fossil fuels in the past year, making them an attractive way to stimulate economies recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Ltd.
Without subsidies, the cost of energy from onshore wind has fallen to as low as $26 a megawatt-hour while utility-scale solar is as cheap as $29, according to the New York firm’s annual levelized cost of energy analysis released Monday. That undercuts even the most efficient type of new gas-fired turbines. The declines have been so significant for renewables that they’re becoming competitive against, or cheaper than, existing gas plants. The gap becomes even wider when considering tax credits.
While solar and wind have been cheaper than new fossil-fuel plants for years, the continued declines come at a pivotal time. Countries are developing more aggressive plans to battle climate change while also looking for ways to revive economies battered by the pandemic. That wasn’t the case during the financial crisis more than a decade ago, especially in the U.S. as the shale gas boom starting to take hold.
“It’s striking how the costs continue to go down,” George Bilicic, Lazard’s vice chairman of investment banking and head of global power, energy and infrastructure, said in a telephone interview. “If you look at the global economy, unemployment rates and the need for investment, that renewables are economic and hydrogen is emerging is promising.”
In its annual report, Lazard also looked for the first time at using hydrogen as a fuel to decarbonize the natural gas system and store excess electricity generated by renewables. So-called blue hydrogen, which is produced from gas, eliminates 90% of the carbon dioxide emissions that come from burning the fuel directly by generators, and green hydrogen, that uses wind and solar electricity to get hydrogen from water, is carbon free.
Lazard looked at blending 20% of hydrogen into the gas stream as an achievable goal. The unsubsidized cost of blue hydrogen came in at $88 a megawatt-hour and green hydrogen at $127. That’s based on blended fuel costs of $5.20 to $10.05 per million British thermal units, compared to gas at $3.45.
Looking at hydrogen, “it feels very much to us where wind and solar were 15 years ago,” Bilicic said. Using existing gas pipelines and storage caverns for hydrogen could help slash costs, he said.
Hydrogen development is also getting a bit of a tailwind as coal is getting squeezed out in some regions. “Coal is under bone-crushing pressure or is fundamentally dead,” he said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Ant Group Co Ltd [IPO-ANTG.HK] has won approval from the Hong Kong stock exchange for the offshore leg of its IPO, two sources said, clearing the last key regulatory hurdle to launch its dual-listing expected to be worth about $35 billion.
Backed by Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, Ant passed the hearing with the exchange's Listing Committee on Monday, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the information is not public.
The company plans to list simultaneously in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's STAR Market in the coming weeks, sources said, in what could be the world's largest IPO, surpassing the record set by oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222)'s $29.4 billion float last December.
Ant and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The move comes one month after Ant won approval from the Shanghai Stock Exchange for the domestic leg of the dual listing.

The company also looks to receive the final nod from China's top securities regulator for its Star IPO this week, said one of the people.

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 08:10AM ET</span>",Weakened U.S. consumer watchdog expected to bite back if Biden wins election,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A decade-long Republican campaign to weaken the consumer watchdog's independence is set to backfire if Democrat Joe Biden wins the presidential election, by handing him the power to swiftly replace the agency's director with a consumer champion, said nearly a dozen lawyers, lobbyists and policy experts.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has been a political lightning rod since it was created following the 2009 financial crisis, beloved by Democrats as a guardian of ordinary Americans but reviled by Republicans as too powerful and unaccountable. 
The Trump administration has clipped the agency's wings, relaxing enforcement and some rules, and asking the Supreme Court to decide whether the president should have discretionary power to fire its director, as Republicans have long argued. 
In June, the court ruled that he could.
That landmark decision, however, would also give a Biden presidency the power to fire current CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger, a Trump appointee Democrats accuse of bowing to industry lobbyists. 
Kraninger, whose term ends in 2023, declined to be interviewed but has said the agency should focus on policing bad actors rather than penalizing companies for minor, procedural violations.
""Given the recent Supreme Court ruling, if Biden wins the White House and the Senate flips too, I think there's a very high likelihood that Kraninger will be quickly replaced,"" said Christopher Willis, a partner at law firm Ballard Spahr, adding that some banks, anticipating new leadership, were becoming more risk-averse on consumer issues. 
Powerful progressives like Senator Elizabeth Warren believe the CFPB should play a key role in tackling wealth inequality and racial justice problems underscored by the pandemic, and policy experts expect Biden to nominate a progressive pick who would ramp-up enforcement and review some of Kraninger's rules.
Chief among them are payday-lending and proposed debt-collection regulations, which influential consumer groups say won't protect Americans. They also hope Biden's director would scrap proposals that they say could make it harder for low-income Americans to get mortgages. 
Other priorities should include stamping out exorbitant lending rates and abusive debt-collection practices, addressing the student debt burden and gaps in minorities' access to credit and overhauling the credit reporting system, they said. 
""This will be one of the most important jobs for progressives to ensure that one of their own takes over so he or she can begin to quickly rebuild the bureau,"" wrote Washington research group Beacon Policy Advisors in a client note.
Potential candidates floated in Democratic circles include Warren's protégé Representative Katie Porter, Federal Trade Commissioner Rohit Chopra and Bharat Ramamurti, Warren's former aide who sits on a pandemic congressional oversight panel.
Thomas Pahl, Kraninger's deputy and longtime CFPB staffer, is a likely contender to lead the agency in the interim while Biden's pick is vetted by the Senate, said the sources. 
Porter, Chopra, Ramamurti and Pahl declined to comment.
""As president, Biden will put an end to Republican assaults on the CFPB and he'll work to revitalize its efforts to hold big banks and financial institutions accountable and ensure that hard-working Americans are treated fairly,"" said Michael Gwin, a campaign spokesman for Biden.
See a FACTBOX here https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden-finance-factbox/factbox-what-a-joe-biden-win-could-mean-for-financial-policy-idUSKBN26Q1NB of what a Joe Biden win could mean for financial policy. 
PANDEMIC PAIN
As millions of unemployed Americans struggle to make ends meet, the CFPB is more important than ever, say consumer groups. 
From March to July, complaints to the agency jumped 50% over the same five-month period a year ago, led by credit reporting problems, according to an analysis by U.S. PIRG and the Frontier Group. 
The agency has launched a campaign educating consumers on how to protect their finances during the pandemic, but it could be doing more to help Americans confronting foreclosures, evictions and repossessions, said Diane Thompson, of counsel at the National Consumer Law Center and founder of the Consumer Rights Regulatory Engagement and Advocacy Project.
Generally, though, CFPB has taken a softer stance on the industry under Trump, bringing an average of 20 enforcement actions annually compared with 31 under former President Barack Obama, according to a Reuters analysis. And in some of the Trump administration enforcement actions, companies walked away without paying the full penalty. 
""Companies can wink, nudge and walk away disregarding the law,"" said Ed Mierzwinski, a director at PIRG.
A spokeswoman for Kraninger pointed to agency data that showed in 2019, the bureau obtained the third highest amount of total consumer redress and total consumer relief in its 10-year history.
When enforcing penalties, staff have to weigh the benefits and costs of pursuing litigation, Kraninger has said. She has also said it is better to rely on strict, behind-the-scenes supervision of financial firms to prevent wrongdoing.

Lawyers, though, said clients were taking a potential Biden CFPB more seriously.
Quyen Truong, partner at law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan and former CFPB lawyer, said some companies were starting to beef up compliance teams.
""Proactive clients are already identifying areas or practices that might raise questions under a new CFPB leader,"" she added.

1192,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 08:09AM ET</span>",A $1 Trillion Manager’s Europe Boss Says ESG Stood the 2020 Test,"(Bloomberg Markets) -- Marie Dzanis, head of  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Asset Management for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, had no idea how much environmental, social, and governance investing would be put to the test when she announced at a company press briefing in January that the 2020s would be the “decade of ESG.” What followed were months of market turbulence, a global economic crisis during a brutal pandemic, Black Lives Matter protests, and wildfires in the U.S. Almost every theory about why ESG matters and works has been played out before the world’s eyes this year.
The 53-year-old native of Harrisburg, Pa., who moved to London from the U.S. for her current role in early 2018, says she was glad to see the market embrace investing values that both she and the $1 trillion asset manager have long promoted. Companies abiding by ESG rules turned out to be more resilient during the coronavirus crisis than others and treated their employees better, she says, offering their investors an extra layer of protection in a pandemic-rocked market.
From its yearly low on March 23, the MSCI Europe ESG Leaders Index has returned 46% through Oct. 14, compared with 43% for the MSCI Europe gauge, in U.S. dollar terms. According to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., about 50% of all new exchange-traded funds in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa this year were ESG-related, accumulating about $4.2 billion in assets, compared with $3.8 billion for new non-ESG funds. Seeing a surge in demand for ESG products, Northern Trust in July launched two new ESG bond indexes.
In two interviews with Bloomberg News’s Ksenia ­Galouchko—one in person in early March right before the U.K. went on lockdown, the other one over a video call in July, after restrictions had been relaxed—Dzanis talked about starting in finance in the 1980s, being a female leader, hiring people that think differently, flexible work arrangements, and Northern Trust’s ESG actions.
First interview: March
Ksenia Galouchko: What was it like coming from the U.S. to lead the EMEA business?
Marie Dzanis: With any new assignment, I think you have to take a lot of time upfront to understand where you can add value. So the first thing I did was sit down and have 150 hours of meetings with people and the staff. There’s a lot of things that you need to do, from regulatory preparations to understanding the dynamics of the business. I like to pride myself as being an engaged manager. I actually walk around very slowly when I’m visiting an office. I think that’s important because when you do, you make yourself available. If you look like you’re rushing through something, people will be hesitant to say: Would you mind if I ask you a question? That was a little tip and trick that I’ve learned after many years in management.
KG: Why do you think there are still very few female CEOs of major asset management firms?
MD: I fully anticipate that we’re going to see more women and ethnically diverse [people]. That’s important to us as a firm. That’s one of the things about this firm that resonates with me: It understands talent and knows how to coach talent. It starts with the hiring process—having a diverse slate of candidates, being creative with how you source candidates, and also moving away from the traditional “hire the people that look like me” and seeing the value in hiring people that are cognitively diverse. [You have to ask yourself:] Do I hire someone who I get along with great or another candidate who can bring something different because that will elevate our business? That’s why when we think about diversity, it’s diversity in gender and ethnicity, but it’s also in cognitive diversity, which is key.
KG: Do you think the finance industry is becoming more flexible toward employees with little kids and other personal factors since people are able to work from home?
MD: I see the future to be more about managing to outcomes. I will share a story. In the U.S. we had this one person, a very successful individual, who we were managing to outcomes. We decided that once they hit a certain level of metrics and they’re doing well and they surpassed that, we will [allow them to] have a little bit more latitude, and they would not have to work 9 to 5. What wound up happening is this individual wound up working longer hours, becoming more successful because they felt empowered. 
KG: How did it feel starting out in the finance industry when there were very few women? 
MD: So with my first job, I cold-called the company, got through to the gatekeeper … and got the job. And at the time, this was 1989, it was very different: It was myself and there was another woman. I was in sales, and they gave me an extensive training program on the phone and the phone book. I would cold-call people and say, “Hi, it’s Marie.” But the interesting thing was the dynamics in the office: Everyone was beating their chests, and saying buy, buy and sell, sell. [When I found the one woman in the room] she was curled up and wearing a flouncy skirt. Back then women tried to wear ties and dress like men, and she was very feminine. She would call up and say [in a friendly voice]: “Hi, I have a municipal bond that I think you’d like. I only have $10,000 of it, but I think you’d like it.” Guess (NYSE:GES) who was the No. 1 salesperson in the office? She was. What that taught me from an early day was that your style can be one of the most powerful things that you have. 
KG: Now, years later you’re head of asset management for EMEA for a massive financial institution. One of your firm’s keen interests is in ESG. What differences, if any, have you noticed between ESG investing in Europe and the U.S.? 
MD: It has been a longer part of everyday life by far. The ­strongest example would be in the Netherlands and Nordics. This is a ­critical mission for them. And we look at Ireland and the U.K., which have made profound moves to understand metrics and have transparency around ESG reporting. They have a lot of programs that they’re looking at that are fossil fuel-free, ex-nuclear, and clean and green, and those are strategies that we actively work on with consultants. And even the once fossil fuel economy of the Middle East, they truly do look to things like climate change to be a moment that they can springboard off of and implement differently in their portfolio. The reality is, ESG is the future.
Second interview: July
KG: We’re now in July, which seems years away from our meeting in March. Back then you were quite excited about the prospect for ESG investing. How have ESG strategies overall performed during the pandemic?
MD: Hopefully I’ll be able to quantify that for you a little bit, but I want to take a step back. First of all, I think globally people are convinced that ESG works because they saw it in action. When you think about the E aspect here, there were distinct trade-offs that people saw when there was no traveling, no commute, no pollution. The fish came back into the canals of Venice, and parts of the Earth revitalized. The letter S, we learned that diversity at the leadership table [was] better for employees. People realized that this thing works. And from a governance standpoint, if you have companies that are well set up operationally, they’re able to have business resiliency.
So ESG funds actually did outperform in the second quarter. There was a Morningstar study that had 72% of sustainable equity funds ranked in the top half of their category, and 43% ranked in the best-performing quartile. The companies that were set up that way did very well. The proof point to this is if you look at the MSCI World ESG Leaders Index, it outperformed the ­cap-weighted MSCI index. This was across all ESG. It was not just an equity occurrence; there were tighter spreads in fixed income. I threw down a gauntlet a year ago, I said it was the year of ESG. Then I said it was the decade of ESG. Through market volatility and the most extreme times, we’ve learned this is indeed the case.
KG:  How have Northern Trust’s environmental, social, and ­governance products been doing?
MD: Over the past one and a half years we launched about nine products that were all ESG in their constructs. Most recently, we launched the IG Euro-corporate ESG fund, and that’s very successful on the back of the high-yield fund that we launched in December. Both of those look at risk measures and incorporate ESG [by excluding companies that don’t meet certain standards], but then it adds the best-in-class process with an in-house optimization. With fixed income, in [the] ESG [category] spreads have been tight throughout market volatility and uncertainty. That’s been a very good early [indication] the investment thesis worked. 
It’s a really good time, and we’re super excited that the world is waking up to the proof that ESG does work. And there’s logic and sustainability in this strategy. It’s a perfect convergence of conviction and client needs. Galouchko is a European stocks reporter at Bloomberg News in London.

(Reuters) -  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) posted its fourth straight quarterly loss on Monday, as the world's second-largest oilfield services firm struggled with a plunge in demand and lower oil prices.
Halliburton, the largest hydraulic fracturing provider in the U.S., still beat analyst estimates, earning 11 cents a share versus expectations of 8 cents per share. The Houston, Texas-based company has undertaken aggressive cost-cutting measures, including cutting thousands of jobs. 
Oil prices have recouped some of their losses from the historic lows of March and April, but fresh lockdowns in some parts of the world due to a resurgence in COVID-19 infections are threatening that recovery. U.S. oil futures were trading around $40.75 on Monday morning (CLc1). 
""The pace of activity declines in the international markets is slowing, while the North America industry structure continues to improve, and activity is stabilizing,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller said in a statement. 
Larger rival Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) on Friday posted a third straight quarterly loss and warned that the recent economic recovery remained ""fragile"".
Halliburton, which last year recorded more than half of its business from North America, saw revenue from the region drop 66.6% to $984 million in the third quarter. 
Revenue from its completion and production business was $1.57 billion for the quarter, compared with $3.51 billion a year ago, a decline of roughly 55%. Total revenue fell 46.4% to $2.98 billion.
Shares were down 0.25% in premarket trading at $12.21. They have declined roughly 50% in the year to date. 
Net loss attributable to the company was $17 million, or 2 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of $295 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier.

The company took $133 million in severance and other charges.

1196,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>",France adds $23 billion scheme to aid measures for company finances,"PARIS (Reuters) - France is set to expand its aid measures to help small businesses hit by the coronavirus pandemic with a 20 billion euro ($23.5 billion) scheme of quasi-equity loans partially backed by the state, the government said on Monday. 
The programme, which would involve funding from institutional investors such as insurers, comes on top of a 300 billion-euro package of state-backed loans made available earlier this year as the pandemic spiralled and many firms had to halt operations or tap emergency cash. 
The new scheme, which would be up and running in the first quarter of 2021, aims to give small, unlisted companies financing options that would not entail taking on more pure debt, which could risk tripping them up as a recession bites. 
French firms were already saddled with record levels of debt before the crisis, and the government fears overburdened companies will pull back even more on their investment plans just as it tries to jumpstart the economy. 
Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Monday the latest programme, which is still being discussed with EU state aid regulators, would make between 10 billion and 20 billion euros of equity-style instruments available to firms. 
Banks would first lend to small and mid-sized firms and then sell on 90% of the loans to institutional investors, people familiar with the proposals told Reuters last week, while the plan will benefit from a partial state guarantee.
Details including on the proposed interest rates would be finalised in the coming weeks, Le Maire added. The programme would run until the end of 2022. 
Unlike the state-backed loans, which were meant to help businesses resolve pressing cash flow problems, the quasi-equity loans would be more geared towards helping promising firms which were held back by the crisis accelerate investment plans.

1197,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 07:27AM ET</span>","Conoco to Buy Concho for $9.7 Billion, Creating Permian Giant","(Bloomberg) -- ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) agreed to buy Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) Inc. for $9.7 billion in stock, the largest shale industry deal since the collapse in energy demand earlier this year and one that will create a heavyweight driller in America’s most prolific oil field.
Investors will get 1.46 Conoco shares for each Concho share, the companies said Monday in a statement. The transaction represents a 15% premium over Concho’s closing price on Oct. 13, the last trading session before Bloomberg News first reported the companies were in talks.
The pandemic-induced price crash and lackluster global economic recovery have accelerated the push for consolidation across the shale patch, which is under severe financial strain after years of debt-fueled growth. The combination Conoco and Concho will be one of the dominant operators in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, rivaling only the likes of Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). and  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) in terms of crude output.
It’s Conoco’s biggest deal under its current chief executive officer, Ryan Lance, who until now has sought to position the company almost as an anti-shale option for Wall Street, touting little-to-no-growth, steady cash flow and disciplined spending.
While Lance has made no secret of his desire to take advantage of the downturn to expand in shale, he said in July that any transaction must meet Conoco’s criteria of having a low cost of supply while being able to compete with the rest of the company’s portfolio.
Houston-based Conoco emerged from the oil market slump in a relatively strong position with about $7 billion of cash on hand. It recently resumed share buybacks. But its growth outlook is challenged: second-quarter production was down by almost 25% from a year earlier after it joined many other U.S. drillers in curbing output in response to lower prices.
Adding Concho will dramatically alter its production profile. The Midland, Texas-based shale company is entirely focused on the Permian and pumped 319,000 barrels in the second quarter, about six times what Conoco produced there.
The Conoco-Concho deal may also signal further mergers and acquisitions in the sector will now follow. Despite a compelling rationale for more consolidation in order to cut costs, a lack of cash and Wall Street’s antipathy toward the sector has made it hard to get deals across the line.
But with oil stable at around $40 a barrel, there are signs that M&A may be picking up. Chevron Corp. completed its acquisition of  Noble Energy  Inc (NASDAQ:NBL). in early October, and in late September  Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN). announced it was buying Permian operator WPX Energy (NYSE:WPX) Inc. Unlike some shale deals in 2019, Devon’s tie-up with WPX was well-received, with both companies agreeing on a small deal premium. That follows investor criticism of some deal premiums last year for being excessive.

1200,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",More False Data Emerges From Firm That Took Over Takata,"(Bloomberg) -- Joyson Safety Systems Japan, a unit of the company that took over failed airbag maker Takata Corp., discovered that falsified production data at its Japanese seatbelt factory was used to pass safety standards for a European certification agency, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The issue comes on top of revelations last week, confirmed by Japan’s transport ministry, that Joyson Safety Systems Japan, or JSSJ, had given faulty data to automakers on seatbelts shipped from its factory in Hikone, Shiga prefecture, which it took over from Takata in 2018. The Nikkei newspaper reported on Oct. 15 that as many as nine million seatbelts supplied by JSSJ to Japanese automakers fell short of strength standards.
JSSJ is ultimately owned by Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp., the Chinese company whose subsidiary acquired the bankrupt Takata in 2018. The Japanese firm became aware of the faulty inspection data at the Hikone factory in April, with certain data also appearing to have been manipulated to pass product safety requirements imposed by the International Automotive Task Force, a Europe-based certification body, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. It’s unclear when the alleged data falsification took place, the people said.
“We are investigating the issue and would like to formally address the facts and numbers being circulated by the media, but it is difficult to do so at the moment,” a representative for Hisayoshi Iwamitsu, president of JSSJ, said by phone Oct 16, declining to comment further when asked about the IATF issue.
U.S.-based Joyson Safety Systems, JSSJ’s immediate parent, dominates about 30% of the global seatbelt market, competing with other auto-parts makers such as Sweden’s Autoliv (NYSE:ALV) Inc. and Germany’s ZF Friedrichshafen AG. A seatbelt recall in Japan could potentially impact 2 million vehicles, according to the Nikkei.
Reputational Risk
Evidence of further issues at the factory could put the manufacturer at risk of losing the confidence of customers and businesses globally. The faulty seatbelt data underscores the painful legacy left by Takata, which filed for bankruptcy three years ago after it supplied more than an estimated 100 million defective airbags worldwide.
What Takata’s Bankruptcy Means for Airbag Recalls: QuickTake Q&A
After the Nikkei’s revelations, Joyson Safety Systems said it is looking into “reporting inaccuracies” at the Hikone factory, according to a statement last week from company spokesman Bryan Johnson.
“The reporting issues arose long before the acquisition of the plant from Takata in April 2018,” Johnson said in the statement, posted on the parent company’s website Oct. 14. “JSS is currently reviewing available and relevant data over a 20-year period on a test-by-test and product-by-product basis, which is a substantial undertaking. The investigation is ongoing and JSS is focused on clarifying the issues with urgency to identify the causes and take appropriate corrective measures.”
Global Users
The “data integrity issue” flagged in media reports mainly occurred between 2000 and 2010, when the factory belonged to Takata, Ningbo Joyson Electronic said in a statement to the Shanghai stock exchange Monday. The company is looking into practices after it took control of the plant.
A spokesman for the transport ministry said it was investigating the case following the Nikkei report.
The audit and supervisory committee established to strengthen governance at JSSJ after it assumed control of Takata’s operations had sought for an inquiry into the seatbelt issue, people with knowledge of the probe said. JSSJ’s corporate disclosure documents show that several members of the committee left their positions on Aug. 20.
Standards such as “IATF 16949” set by the organization are designed to prevent product defects and differences in quality throughout production, and are considered a prerequisite for supplying equipment to automakers. BMW,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles NV, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co., General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)., Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc,  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP), Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY), Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and various trade associations are members of IATF.
Child Seats
Takata’s annual sales before declaring bankruptcy were about 660 billion yen ($6.3 billion). Ningbo Joyson Electronic reported sales of 61.7 billion yuan ($9.2 billion) last year, the bulk of which came from JSS, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan.
The Nikkei newspaper also reported Oct. 15 that there was evidence of tampering with data for seatbelts used in child-safety seats at the Hikone factory.
The Takata scandal unleashed one of the most significant recalls in automotive history. The company sold defective air bag inflators using ammonium nitrate, which were at risk of exploding violently in a crash and injuring passengers with metal shards. They were linked to at least 23 deaths worldwide and more than 200 injuries in the U.S. alone. Takata pleaded guilty to a wire-fraud charge as part of a $1 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over the air-bag problems, and later went out of business.

LONDON (Reuters) - Exchange operator  Euronext  (PA:ENX) said it halted trading in all its products on Monday due to a technical issue, affecting equities trading in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris.
The widespread outage has hit trading in cash equities, derivative products and commodity futures across Europe.
""No one can trade at the moment, everything is on standstill,"" said Mikael Jacoby, head of continental European equity sales at Oddo Securities in Paris. 
The outage follows a severe one on the Tokyo Stock Exchange earlier this month, which brought stock markets in Japan to a complete standstill, in the worst ever outage for the world’s third largest equity market.
""We are working to resolve this issue and we will provide an update as soon as possible regarding the expected pre-opening time and resumption of trading,"" said Euronext, which operates France's blue-chip index CAC 40.

1203,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>","Wall Street bullish on Netflix results despite return of live sports, more competition","By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) will tell investors on Tuesday how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affected membership in the third quarter - a period when analysts remain bullish on the company despite the return of live sports and more streaming competition. 
Shares of the online video pioneer, trading close to an all-time high at $530.79 on Friday, have jumped more than 75% since mid-March, when governments around the world imposed stay-at-home orders to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. During the same time, the S&P 500 has gained 44.8%.
In July, Netflix forecast it would add 2.5 million new paid streaming customers globally between July and September, based on the expectation that its strong first-half performance - in which it added almost 26 million subscribers - likely pulled forward some demand from the second half of the year.
Analysts have been more optimistic, citing stronger Netflix content in the quarter and the fact that many people are still staying home because of the pandemic. As of Oct. 18 they projected 3.4 million new subscribers, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Hurdles for Netflix in the third quarter included the return of live sports, the easing of restrictions in some economies, and competition from Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp-owned NBCUniversal streaming service Peacock and AT&T-owned WarnerMedia’s streaming entry, HBO Max. Peacock fully launched in the United States on July 15 and as of September had over 15 million sign-ups, according to Comcast. AT&T said in July that HBO Max attracted 4.1 million customers in its first month; investors are awaiting subscriber updates during AT&T’s Oct. 22 third-quarter earnings release.
Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak wrote in an Oct. 7 note that Netflix’s guidance of 2.5 million new paid subscribers appears “reasonable” given these factors. “Our view remains that the unfortunate COVID-19 situation simply accelerated trends already in place... and Netflix is likely to remain as the dominant global SVOD player for the foreseeable future,” he wrote.

As of Oct. 18, analysts were forecasting Netflix third-quarter profit of $968.6 million on revenue of $6.38 billion.

Morning trading in some European markets, including Paris' CAC 40 (FCHI) and Amsterdam's AEX (AEX), was hit by a technical issue at exchange operator  Euronext  (PA:ENX), which halted trading in all its cash and derivatives products.
The CAC 40 was up 0.8% at 4,976.15 points before the halt, while other European bourses pared some gains.

The broader financial services sector (SXFP) rose 1.2%, with  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and UBS (S:UBSG) up between 2.8% and 4.2%.
Health technology company Philips (AS:PHG) reported a better-than-expected jump in core earnings. 
European third-quarter earnings are forecast to recover from a pandemic-led slump, with analysts expecting companies on the STOXX 600 to report an average 36.7% drop, compared with a 51% drop in the previous quarter, according to Refinitiv data.
Also lending support was hopes of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year and a fresh U.S. stimulus package before the November presidential election.
""Markets, for now, are merely relieved that at least the two sides continue to talk,"" wrote Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda.
That encouraged investors to look past concerns about new curbs in various parts of Europe and their impact on a nascent economic recovery.
As daily cases in Italy hit a new record over the weekend, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte gave mayors the power to shut public squares from 9 p.m. to halt gatherings.

LONDON (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange (LME) aims to improve its electronic trading system because it expects the COVID-19 pandemic will keep its open-outcry ring closed for many more months, its chief executive said on Monday. 
CEO Matthew Chamberlain told a virtual seminar that he was aware the LME might be accused of trying to shut the ring permanently, but he emphasised the need to enhance its electronic trading capability in the face of the pandemic. 
The 143-year-old exchange temporarily closed what is the last open-outcry trading floor in Europe in March because of coronavirus restrictions, shifting activity to its electronic system.
""Now I understand that by raising these questions the LME might be accused of trying to further electronify the market or perhaps even close the ring right down,"" he said.
The world's oldest and largest market for industrial metals has imposed three conditions for reopening the ring, including the end of social distancing in Britain and the broad rollout of a coronavirus vaccine.
""We must acknowledge that it seems unlikely that any of those criteria will be met any time soon,"" Chamberlain said.
""If we are going to be out of the ring for a long period and pricing our market electronically, there is perhaps more that we can do to make that process even more efficient.""
The LME is setting up a working group to look at improving electronic trading and examine the broader balance of electronic, ring and telephone trading, he added.
The ring closure was the first since World War II and ended the theatre of arcane hand signals and frenzied shouting by traders.
Floor dealers on the exchange, which is owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HK:0388), have resisted the shift to full digital trading during the pandemic.

On Oct. 1 trading was halted due to a hardware failure in the worst-ever outage for the world's third-largest equity market.
The trading halt tarnished the exchange's credibility just as new prime minister Yoshihide Suga has prioritised digitalisation, and could dent Tokyo's hopes of luring more financial services companies to Japan's capital.
The exchange previously said the glitch was the result of a hardware problem and a subsequent failure to switch to a back-up. It caused the first full-day suspension since the exchange switched to all-electronic trading in 1999.

1207,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 05:53AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Danone Shake up Aims to Steer Away From Troubled Waters,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Dairy giant  Danone  SA (PA:DANO) is planning its biggest shake-up in recent times as it tries to turn around a losing battle for market share in the U.S. and China, its most important non-European markets.
The French group said on Monday it’s restructuring itself along geographical lines, creating new regional CEOs for North America (Shane Grant) and for the rest of the world (Veronique Penchienati-Bosetta) and parting with its long-time chief financial officer, Cecile Cabanis.
It will also step up its disposal of underperforming brands as it tries to find a way back to a medium-term target of 3%-5% annual sales growth – a target that will be missed this year. The inclusion of Vega is among those to be put up for sale, a disappointing end to what should have been a profitable venture into plant-based dairy substitutes.
The pandemic has been hard on Danone, a company that has bet aggressively on rising dairy and water consumption in emerging markets in the past. The crisis has borne out many cynics’ belief that it depended too much on overpriced bottled water brands Evian and Volvic to sauce profits and mask underlying profitability problems in the dairy business. The closure of restaurants and bars across the world this year, along with the suspension of many other kinds of corporate hospitality, has led to a collapse in water sales, which are down 17% over the first nine months of the year.
To make things worse, China’s restrictions on imports of dairy produce and infant formula have ravaged the company’s other big money-spinner. The euro’s appreciation hasn’t helped either. It accounted for 7.1 percentage points of a 9.8% drop in third-quarter sales.
The market took the news of restructuring with what can best be termed cautious optimism: a rise of 1.4% is not much compared to the largely uninterrupted slide of over 40% since Donald Trump stepped up his trade war against China 14 months ago.  The new guidance of a 14% recurring operating margin, while an improvement from the first half of this year, is still nearly a full point below where it was less than two years ago. While it talked of delivering 1.8 billion a year in free cash flow, it said nothing about returns to shareholders.
The reset may be welcome, but some investors will feel it could have set the bar a little higher for its new management team.
That it chose not to is due overwhelmingly to the effects of the virus. The guidance for the rest of this year was full of caution: “Looking into the remainder of the year, business remains difficult to predict as the environment is still volatile and much uncertainty remains about the implications of the pandemic as to how exactly lockdown easing, channel dynamics and consumer habits may evolve.”
It flagged the ongoing margin pressure generated by the shift to home consumption and the continued unpredictability of exporting into China.
It looks like a long road back."

(Reuters) - Foreign investors poured over $1 billion into Asian government and corporate bonds in September, more than doubling their investment in local currency debt from the previous month, attracted by higher yields and some signs of economic recovery.
Asian local currency bonds received a combined total inflow of $1.26 billion last month, data from regional central banks and bond market associations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea and India showed. That was down from $2.13 billion in September 2019 but up from $489 million in August. 
Graphic - Foreign flows into Asian bonds - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopayjlbpa/Foreign%20flows%20into%20Asian%20bonds.jpg
Asian countries have had mixed success in containing the coronavirus outbreak and protecting their economies, but foreigners became net sellers of Asian equities in September on concerns about a virus resurgence, prompting them to sell $6.5 billion worth of regional equities.
Bonds markets in places such as Thailand and India could therefore be benefiting from a portfolio rebalancing, analysts said. 
""The strong inflows into Thai debt in September could be due to some extent to portfolio rebalancing from equities to debt securities,"" said Duncan Tan, a strategist at DBS Bank, adding that Thai equities had seen ""heavy outflows"" in recent months.
Foreigners purchased $807 million worth of Thai bonds last month, the highest in over a year, according to Thai bond market association data.
Foreign investors meanwhile poured $538 million into Indian bonds in September, the first inflow in seven months.
Tan said September inflows ""could be a sign of foreign capital returning"" to India. He said India's high-yielding government debt had become attractive for foreigners with the Reserve Bank of India reluctant to ease monetary policy further to avoid fuelling inflation.

Malaysian bonds also received $132 million worth of foreign capital last month, but foreign investors sold Indonesian bonds on concerns over rising coronavirus infections.
Khoon Goh, head of Asia Research at ANZ, said inflows to the region in general should resume once uncertainty around the highly-contested U.S. election in November is ""out of the way"" given the economic backdrop.
""Asia's economic recovery is well underway. Monthly PMIs have gained further traction and exports are recovering well,"" he added.

1211,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 05:26AM ET</span>",'Bad math': Airlines' COVID safety analysis challenged by expert,"By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - A campaign by coronavirus-stricken aviation giants to persuade the world it's safe to fly has been questioned by one of the scientists whose research it draws upon.
Dr David Freedman, a U.S. infectious diseases specialist, said he declined to take part in a recent presentation by global airline body IATA with planemakers Airbus, Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Embraer that cited his work.
While he welcomed some industry findings as ""encouraging"", Freedman said a key assertion about the improbability of catching COVID-19 on planes was based on ""bad math"".
Airlines and planemakers are anxious to restart international travel, even as a second wave of infections and restrictions take hold in many countries. 
The Oct. 8 media presentation listed in-flight infections reported in scientific studies or by IATA airlines - and compared the tally with total passenger journeys this year.
""With only 44 identified potential cases of flight-related transmission among 1.2 billion travellers, that's one case for every 27 million,"" IATA medical adviser Dr David Powell said in a news release, echoed in comments during the event.
IATA said its findings ""align with the low numbers reported in a recently published peer-reviewed study by Freedman and Wilder-Smith"".
But Freedman, who co-authored the paper in the Journal of Travel Medicine with Dr Annelies Wilder-Smith of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said he took issue with IATA's risk calculation because the reported count bore no direct relation to the unknown real number of infections.
""They wanted me at that press conference to present the stuff, but honestly I objected to the title they had put on it,"" the University of Alabama academic told Reuters.
""It was bad math. 1.2 billion passengers during 2020 is not a fair denominator because hardly anybody was tested. How do you know how many people really got infected?"" he said. ""The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.""
IATA believes its calculation remains a ""relevant and credible"" sign of low risk, a spokesman said in response to requests for comment from the industry body and its top medic Powell. 
""We've not claimed it's a definitive and absolute number.""
Wilder-Smith could not be immediately reached for comment.
CLOSING RANKS
While the pandemic has seen some airlines leave middle seats empty to reassure customers, the industry has opposed making such measures mandatory.
Plane cabins are considered lower-risk than many indoor spaces because of their powerful ventilation and their layout, with forward-facing passengers separated by seat rows. Ceiling-to-floor airflows sweep pathogens into high-grade filters.
That understanding is supported by simulations and tests run by the aircraft makers as well as a U.S. Defense Department study released on Thursday.
The joint presentation with all three manufacturers signalled a rare closing of ranks among industrial archrivals, behind a message designed to reassure. 
Sitting beside an infected economy passenger is comparable to seven-foot distancing in an office, Boeing tests concluded, posing an acceptably low risk with masks. Standard health advice often recommends a six-foot separation.
Airbus showed similar findings, while Embraer tested droplet dispersal from a cough. Some 0.13% by mass ended up in an adjacent passenger's facial area, falling to 0.02% with masks.
Dr Henry Wu, associate professor at Atlanta's Emory School of Medicine, said the findings were inconclusive on their own because the minimum infective dose remains unknown, and risks increase in step with exposure time.
""It's simply additive,"" said Wu, who would prefer middle seats to be left empty. ""A 10-hour flight will be 10 times riskier than a one-hour flight.""
Nonetheless, a commercial jet cabin is ""probably one of the safer public settings you can be in,"" he added. ""Sitting at a crowded bar for a few hours is going to be much riskier.""
'SUPERSPREADER EVENTS'
Scientists are poring over dozens of on-board infection cases, as well as flights with contagious passengers but no known transmission.
In March, 11 infectious passengers on a five-hour Sydney-Perth flight passed the virus to 11 others, according to a paper in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.
Among those infected, two were seated three rows away from a contagious passenger and one was six rows away, suggesting that typical two-row contact-tracing might have missed them. 
One sufferer on a 10-hour London-Hanoi flight the same month infected 16 others including 12 in her business-class cabin, according to a study by Vietnamese and Australian academics.
""Long flights ... can provide conditions for superspreader events,"" the study said, adding that its findings ""challenge"" the airlines' assertion that on-board distancing is unnecessary. 
IATA points out that many of the flights examined by scientists in published studies occurred before mask-wearing became widespread and reduced infection risks.
Its presentation conceded that the 1-in-27 million statistic ""may be an underestimate"", while maintaining that in-flight infections remained less likely than a lightning strike, even if only 10% of actual cases had made the count.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) has successfully tested an aerial base station in the earth's stratosphere, it said on Monday, hoping to bring mobile coverage to remote areas that ground-based networks fail to reach.
The German telecoms group and its partner, British startup Stratospheric Platforms, said that a remotely piloted aircraft flying at 14,000 metres (45,000 feet) had successfully connected with its terrestrial 4G network from an on-board antenna.
The airborne base station, which can cover an area up to 140 km (87 miles) across, handled voice and video calls, data downloads and web browsing from a smartphone user on the ground during trial flights this month.
""We won't stop until everyone is connected,"" Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges told a video presentation on the project, which has been in development for the past five years.
""A stratospheric network can help reach areas that have been difficult to supply up to now.""
Hosting base stations in the stratosphere promises the fast reaction times that next-generation 5G networks will need to support innovations such as self-driving cars.
But, while aerial antennas offer a speed and cost advantage over satellites, keeping them aloft poses a design challenge.
Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) rival Loon venture uses high-altitude balloons to run wireless networks and Facebook (O:FB) grounded an experimental solar-powered internet drone two years ago after concluding it was not feasible. 
PILOT-FREE PLATFORM
Deutsche Telekom's test flights were staged over the state of Bavaria in southern Gemrany using an adapted H3Grob 520 propeller plane because Stratospheric Platforms is still developing its own pilotless aircraft.
The UK startup says its lightweight ""platform"" will have a wingspan of 60 metres - as big as a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747 - but weigh only 3.5 tonnes and be able to stay aloft for nine days. 
It will use an emission-free hydrogen fuel-cell system, which can generate far more power than solar cells. The on-board antenna, weighing 140 kg, will be capable of doing the job of 200 terrestrial towers.
Richard Deakin, chief executive of Stratospheric Platforms, said the platform would make its first flight in 2022 with operational deployment expected around 2024.
Deakin said he plans to build a factory that can produce up to 200 of the aircraft a year, adding that the challenge will be to supply enough.
The startup was founded in 2014 and Deutsche Telekom came on board as an investor two years later and holds a 38% stake.
Stratospheric Platforms said it was holding talks with other potential investors to raise about 50 million pounds ($65 million) in a so-called Series B funding round. Funding to date is in double-digit millions of pounds.

Partners for its aerial platform include  Northrop Grumman  (N:NOC) and  Thales  (PA:TCFP). It is also working with QinetiQ (L:QQ) and others on the hydrogen power system.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks rallied on Monday as rising hopes of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year and a U.S. fiscal package before elections offset concern over record daily infections in the region.
Wall Street futures rose 0.9% on the 33rd anniversary of the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) lost 22.6% in one day, equivalent to a drop of about 6,500 points in the index today.
European blue-chip stocks index (STOXX50) rose 0.8% even as new COVID-19 cases were growing at over 150,000 a day in Europe. Parts of the UK were put into lockdown and France imposed curfews.
Those worries and no breakthrough in the Brexit stalemate failed to curb risk appetite among investors, after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday she was optimistic about a coronavirus relief deal before Election Day.
Boosting overall sentiment, drugmaker  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) said on Friday it could have a coronavirus vaccine ready in the United States by the end of this year.
""A vaccine will be broadly available from the second quarter of next year, with markets moving to price in the economic benefits well ahead of that,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. 
""The on-off fiscal talks have injected near-term volatility into risk assets, but instead of staying on sidelines, we suggest investors consider ways to build up long-term positions in these market conditions.""
Investors also took comfort from China's economic recovery in the third quarter as consumers shook off their coronavirus caution, although the weaker-than-expected headline growth capped stock market gains in Asia.
""The rebound in Q3 GDP was less strong than expected, but was still a decent 4.9% year on year. September data beat expectations, suggesting a pick-up in momentum towards the latter part of Q3,"" said Frances Cheung, head of macro strategy for Asia at Westpac in Singapore.
""The pick-up in momentum was broad-based, which bodes well for the Q4 outlook.""
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.5% for a second straight day of gains, paring back following third-quarter gross domestic product data from China.
Separate monthly indicators pointed to an expansion in economic activity. Industrial output accelerated 6.9% in September from a year earlier, when analysts were looking for a 5.8% gain from a 5.6% rise in August.
Later in the week, key risk events, include minutes of Australia's central bank meeting, the final U.S. presidential debate and global manufacturing indicators.
Action in currencies was muted with the U.S. dollar (=USD) flat at 93.696 against a basket of six major currencies. [USD/]
The euro (EUR=) traded higher at $1.1725 and the sterling held above a 10-day low on Monday. Investors cut their holdings as British and European negotiators tried to salvage post-Brexit trade talks.
""EU-UK trade talks are flirting with collapse,"" ANZ economists said.
""UK Prime Minister Johnson said the UK needs to prepare for a no-deal outcome, as both sides cannot agree on a Canada-style FTA. Talks resume in London on Monday, but without the political willingness to shift ground, there is little the negotiators can achieve."" 
In commodities, Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were flat at $42.92 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLC1) traded at $40.91 a barrel.

Spot gold  rose 0.6% to $1,909.6 an ounce.

The EU won the right to retaliation in its dispute with the United States over subsidies to planemaker Boeing (N:BA) this month, potentially deepening a record trade spat that has already prompted Washington to slap duties on EU goods.
Under WTO rules, the European Union needs to formally notify its plan to impose tariffs to the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), a committee on which all 164 WTO members sit. According to the DSB agenda released on Monday, the EU plans to do so at the next meeting on Oct. 26. 
This does not necessarily mean the bloc will impose tariffs immediately. The European Commission, which coordinates EU trade policy, also has to consult with the 27 EU governments on the issue.
The U.S. government has said there was no legal basis for the EU to impose tariffs since the contested tax break had been eliminated, a view echoed by Boeing which has said it had already complied with WTO findings.

U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to ""strike back"" against the European Union if it puts tariffs on U.S. goods.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ant Group Co Ltd has received approval from China's securities regulator for the Hong Kong leg of its roughly $35 billion dual listing, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Monday.
The Chinese financial technology firm plans to list in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's STAR Market simultaneously in what could be the world's largest initial public offering (IPO), surpassing  Saudi Aramco 's (SE:2222) $29.4 billion record set in December.
The firm plans to seek listing approval from Hong Kong's stock exchange on Monday, said one of the people, who declined to be identified as the matter was not yet public. 
Ant, backed by Chinese e-commerce major  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) (HK:9988), declined to comment.
Refinitiv publication IFR reported the approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) earlier on Monday. It also said the CSRC is set to approve Ant's Star Market IPO this week.
Ant plans to start a brief pre-marketing period this week before opening order books next week, IFR reported, saying Ant's shares are likely to start trading ""a few days"" after the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election.
Ant originally aimed to meet Hong Kong's bourse on Sept. 24 and launch the IPO after the week-long Chinese National Day holiday that ended on Oct. 8, sources previously told Reuters.
Last week, sources said the CSRC was probing a potential conflict of interest in the planned listing, delaying approval.
The regulator was looking into the role of Alipay, Ant's flagship payment platform, as retail investors' only third-party channel to buy into five Chinese funds investing in the IPO.

Ant aims to sell 10% to 15% of its enlarged share capital in the IPO, split evenly between Hong Kong and Shanghai. It does not plan to offer a cornerstone tranche in Hong Kong in anticipation of strong demand from institutional investors.

The e-commerce giant is hoping to further leverage its digital presence to support Sun Art's 481 hypermarkets and three mid-size supermarkets in China. The move comes as Alibaba steadily expands its presence in China's offline retail sector, as growth in traditional e-commerce slows.
Alibaba, which already owned 21% of Sun Art through a unit, will raise its stake to around 72% through the acquisition of a similar stake in A-RT Retail Holdings, who owns 51% of Sun Art. 
""As the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating the digitalisation of consumer lifestyles and enterprise operations, this commitment to Sun Art serves to strengthen our New Retail vision and serve more consumers with a fully integrated experience,"" Alibaba Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said in a statement. 
Alibaba added that Peter Huang would be appointed chairman of Sun Art on top of his current role as chief executive officer.
Shares of Sun Art soared more than 27% by lunchtime on Monday after Alibaba made the announcement.
Alibaba has expanded outlets across China for Freshippo, a supermarket chain that doubles as an online delivery service. Alibaba operates 214 Freshippo outlets as of its most recent earnings report.
It also has worked with mom-and-pop convenience store owners to offer technology and data analytics services.
Alibaba's e-commerce rivals in China have made similar forays into brick-and-mortar retail.
Online retailer JD (NASDAQ:JD).Com Inc (HK:9618) runs a brick-and-mortar grocery store called 7Fresh.

 Pinduoduo  Inc (O:PDD), the fast-growing e-commerce site known for budget deals on bulk purchases, bought a stake in home-appliance retailer Gome Retail Holdings Inc (HK:0493) in August for $200 million.

1217,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 03:50AM ET</span>","Japan to join forces with U.S., Europe in regulating Big Tech firms: antitrust watchdog head","By Leika Kihara and Takahiko Wada
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will join forces with the United States and Europe to take on any market abuses by the four Big Tech companies, the new head of its antitrust watchdog said on Monday, a sign Tokyo will join global efforts to regulate digital platform operators.
Kazuyuki Furuya, chairman of Japan's Fair Trade Commission (FTC), also said Tokyo could open a probe into any merger or business tie-up involving fitness tracker maker Fitbit (N:FIT) if the size of such deals are big enough.
""If the size of any merger or business-tie up is big, we can launch an anti-monopoly investigation into the buyer's process of acquiring a start-up (like Fitbit),"" he told Reuters. ""We're closely watching developments including in Europe.""
EU antitrust regulators in August launched an investigation into a $2.1 billion deal by Alphabet (O:GOOGL) unit Google's bid to buy Fitbit that aimed to take on Apple (O:AAPL) and Samsung (KS:005930) in the wearable technology market.
Japan is laying the groundwork to regulate platform operators. Among them are big tech giants dubbed ""GAFA"" - Google, Apple, Amazon (O:AMZN) and Facebook (O:FB) - that face various antitrust probes in western nations.
Multi-national companies like GAFA have similar business practices across the globe, which makes global coordination crucial, Furuya said.
""We'll work closely with our U.S. and European counterparts, and respond if to any moves that hamper competition,"" he said.
""This is an area I will push through aggressively,"" he said, adding the FTC was ready to open probes if digital platformers abuse their dominant market positions against consumers.
Furuya, who assumed the post in September, also said the FTC would conduct research into Japan's mobile phone market to see whether there is any room for improvement to spur competition.
Any such move would help Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's push to slash Japan's mobile phone charges, which he has repeatedly criticised as too high.
Furuya countered the view that helping the government meet its policy priorities could undermine the FTC's position as a body mandated to act independently from political meddling.
""If there's a policy priority for the government, there's no doubt the FTC should think about what it can do on that front,"" Furuya said.

""By participating in the government's debate on policy issues, we have been reflecting our thinking in the process. This is something our organisation should do.""

The costs would include additional provision expenses related to the South Korean car makers' ""Theta"" engines, the companies said in separate regulatory filings.
Hyundai Motor said a cost of 2.1 trillion won will be reflected in its earnings, while Kia Motors flagged an earnings hit of 1.26 trillion won. They did not provide further details.
U.S. safety regulators in 2017 launched an investigation into the recall of nearly 1.7 million vehicles by Hyundai Motor Co and affiliate Kia Motor Corp over an engine defect that increases the risk of a crash.

Hyundai was being investigated by U.S. prosecutors over whether vehicle recalls were conducted properly, Reuters reported in 2018.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Monday, helped by positive corporate news from the likes of Philips and Danone, overshadowing disappointing Chinese growth data.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.9%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.4%.
The third-quarter earnings season is starting to kick into gear, on both sides of the Atlantic, and the news so far has tending to be positive, especially compared with the horror show that preceded it.
Philips stock rose 2.6% after the Dutch medical-technology group said Monday that third-quarter net profit exceeded expectations, and offered up positive guidance.
Danone stock rose 1.4% after the French food giant, in reporting that sales fell in the third quarter, restored its full-year guidance and detailed a reorganization of its structure.
Julius Baer gained 5.3% after it indicated an improvement in profitability for the first nine months of 2020 as client activity increased and it cut costs.
Also helping was news from Atlantia, with the Italian infrastructure company selling a 49% stake in its highway toll-collection business Telepass to investment manager Partners Group, for 1.06 billion euros ($1.24 billion). Its stock rose 2.8%.
Earlier Monday, China reported that its gross domestic product grew 4.9% in July-September from a year earlier, slower than the median forecast of 5.2%. 
“The market is a bit upset by the 4.9% YoY growth as the consensus has been 5% or more,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. “But the market should recover these losses when it has time to digest the substance of the GDP report instead of just reacting to the headlines.”
The fight for a wide-ranging coronavirus relief package in the U.S. remains a key interest for European markets, while European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told a French newspaper that Europe must distribute its 750 billion euro recovery fund for the pandemic-hit economy promptly.
Also boosting sentiment was Friday’s news from drugmaker  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) that it could have a coronavirus vaccine ready in the United States by the end of this year. 
The need for a vaccine is apparent, with the global total of Covid-19 cases rapidly approaching 40 million. 
Europe currently accounts for over 17% of the global cases and nearly 22% of the deaths. New cases are growing at over 150,000 a day, with many countries reporting record daily increases in the number of coronavirus infections. On the brighter side, India's government said on Monday that the virus had peaked in that country. New infections and fatalities have been steadily declining since the middle of September, according to John Hopkins data.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Monday morning, with quarterly growth data released by China showing growth, and optimism over the latest U.S. stimulus package.
The world’s second largest economy’s GDP grew 4.9% year-on-year during the third quarter, with industrial production growing 6.9% year-on-year and retail sales growing 3.3% year-on-year in September. The unemployment rate stood at 5.4%, down from the previous quarter’s 5.6% reading. Although the growth in GDP was larger than the previous quarter’s 3.2% growth, it was smaller than the 5.2% predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
“The GDP numbers came in slightly below expectations, but the monthly data shows there is no reason to be overly pessimistic. China’s economy remains on the recovery path, driven by a rebound in exports. Consumer spending is also headed in the right direction, but we cannot say it has completely shaken off the drag caused by the coronavirus. The problem is that the labor market and wages remain a little weak, and this is holding back consumption. China needs to continuously roll out more policies to support domestic demand,” Dai-ichi Life Research Institute chief economist Yoshikiyo Shimamine told Reuters.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.24% by 11:04 PM ET (3:04 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.07%, giving up some earlier gains.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.88%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.06%. Japan also released data earlier in the day that showed exports fell 4.9% year-on-year in September, the smallest margin in seven months. Imports dropped 17.2% year-on-year, and the trade balance stood at JPY675 billion.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.90%
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.99%. The Reserve Bank of Australia will release the minutes from its latest meeting on Tuesday.
In the U.S., House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi set a Tuesday deadline for Congress to pass the stimulus measures before the Nov. 3 presidential election, negotiating details with Treasure Secretary Steven Mnuchin during their phone call on Saturday. Pelosi and Mnuchin have also scheduled a phone call for later in the day.
Some investors remained optimistic about the measures regardless of whether voters choose incumbent President Donald Trump or Democrat Joe Biden on Nov. 3.
“It seems that the market is optimistic that indeed stimulus will follow whether that is tax cuts under a Trump presidency or spending under a Biden presidency,” Medley Global Advisors managing director Ben Emons told Bloomberg.
However, with Mnuchin on a tour of the Middle East and Pelosi’s team sending mixed signals after she set the deadline, others were less optimistic about the measures’ prospects.
Trump also renewed an offer to increase the price tag on the measures over the weekend. He and Biden will participate in the final presidential debate on Thursday."
1224,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2020 10:50PM ET</span>",Mining billionaire Forrest buys famed Australian bootmaker RM Williams,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian mining billionaire Andrew Forrest said his private company bought bootmaker R.M. Williams (NYSE:WMB) from a fund backed by French fashion giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (PA:LVMH), returning ownership of the famed fashion label to its home country after six years.
In a statement, the  Fortescue Metals  Group Ltd (AX:FMG) founder and major shareholder said he was ""incredibly proud and humbled"" to bring back the manufacturing icon which had ""a long and proud history of high-quality Australian craftsmanship"".
Forrest did not disclose a price but the Australian Financial Review reported it was about A$190 million ($135 million). That would represent a mark-down from the roughly A$500 million that local media reported was R.M. Williams's valuation when LVMH-backed private equity firm L Catterton put the asset up for sale in 2019.
When L Catterton took over R.M. Williams in 2014, the Outback-themed company was valued at about A$104 million. The unit of the French fashion giant was not immediately available for comment on Monday.

For 88-year-old R.M. Williams, which has 900 staff in Australia, that meant temporarily closing its Adelaide factory. It has since reopened most of its 68 retail outlets which are largely on the country's east coast.

Canadian private equity firm Brookfield is taking a 19.9% stake in American Equity at $37 per share for an initial investment, the company said in a statement https://refini.tv/3o2vkhI.
Brookfield is purchasing its American Equity shares in two installments, the first at a price of $37 per share and the second at a variable price where the floor is $37 a share.
It will also reinsure up to $10 billion of American Equity fixed index annuity liabilities.
Brookfield will also receive a board seat on American Equity following the initial investment.
The board of American Equity rejected the unsolicited acquisition proposal from Athene and MassMutual made public on Oct. 1, saying it significantly undervalued the company. That deal was valued at more than $3 billion.
""Since the board of directors of American Equity has decided to reject our joint proposal, we will continue with the execution of our standalone strategy,"" Athene Holdings said in response to the rejection.
The American Equity board has also authorized the share repurchase of up to $500 million of common shares to be funded with the proceeds of the Brookfield equity investment and cash on hand, the company said.
The repurchase is expected to offset dilution from the issuance of common shares to Brookfield, the company added.

Altice USA Inc said it had sweetened its unsolicited offer to acquire Cogeco by adding a premium for shares held by the Audet family, which had rejected the previous offer.
""As we did on September 2nd, 2020, following the announcement of their first unsolicited proposal, members of the Audet family unanimously reject this further proposal,"" Louis Audet, president of Gestion Audem said in a statement. ""We repeat today that this is not a negotiating strategy, but a definitive refusal. We are not interested in selling our shares.""
Gestion Audem is the holding company of the Audet family that holds 69% of the voting share of Cogeco.
Altice offered C$11.1 billion to acquire Cogeco, up from the C$10.3 billion bid that was rejected by the Audet family last month. 
New York-based Altice said the revised offer included C$900 million to the Audet family for their ownership interests, from C$800 million previously.
It also revised its offer to Cogeco's second-largest shareholder, Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Communications Inc (TO:RCIb), to sell it all of Cogeco's Canadian assets for C$5.2 billion.
Upon completion of the overall transaction, Altice USA would own all the U.S. assets of Cogeco and Rogers would own the Canadian assets, Altice said in a statement.
Altice said it would withdraw its revised offer if a deal was not reached by Nov. 18.

Alibaba will raise its direct and indirect stake in the grocery chain to about 72% by acquiring equity from Auchan Retail International SA, then make a general offer to shareholders to buy out the rest of Sun Art.
Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang has made the expansion into physical retail and the grocery business a cornerstone of his growth strategy, an effort that paid off during the coronavirus pandemic. Sun Art operates hundreds of hypermarkets across China under the Auchan and RT-Mart brands, a massive distribution and storage network that can supplement Alibaba’s own efforts in grocery delivery.
The Chinese e-commerce giant is grappling with intensifying competition from the likes of JD, food delivery giant Meituan and startups such as Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.-backed Missfresh, all chasing a market for groceries and fresh produce that HSBC expects to grow 2.5 times to 690 billion yuan ($103 billion) by 2022 from 2019. Alibaba was among the pioneers in that arena, announcing in 2017 it would spend about $2.9 billion for a 36% stake in Sun Art.

As Alibaba increases its stake to a majority, Sun Art’s financial statements will be consolidated into the larger company’s. Peter Huang, Sun Art’s CEO, will add the title of chairman for the business.
Zhang has been directly involved in the expansion into what the company calls its “new retail” strategy, combining e-commerce with physical stores. He helped launch a startup called Freshippo within Alibaba that aimed to combine a grocery store, a restaurant and a delivery app, a business that’s underpinned an overall new retail division that’s grown into a $12 billion business, contributing a fifth of total revenue in the June quarter.
The online groceries segment has leapt to the forefront during Covid-19 when shoppers shunned restaurants and physical stores, though the industry -- which requires more complex logistical structures such as so-called cold chain storage -- has proven difficult to crack in years past.

Williams (NYSE:WMB) from French fashion giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (PA:LVMH), returning ownership of the famed fashion label to its home country after six years.
In a statement, the  Fortescue Metals  Group Ltd (AX:FMG) founder and major shareholder said he was ""incredibly proud and humbled"" to bring back the manufacturing icon which had ""a long and proud history of high-quality Australian craftsmanship"".
Forrest did not disclose a price but the Australian Financial Review reported it was about A$190 million ($135 million). That would represent a mark-down from the roughly A$500 million that local media reported was R.M. Williams's valuation when LVMH, via its investment arm L Catterton, put the asset up for sale in 2019.
When L Catterton took over R.M. Williams in 2014, the Outback-themed company was valued at about A$104 million. The unit of the French fashion giant was not immediately available for comment on Monday.
Fashion retailers around the world have experienced a sharp decline in sales since the COVID-19 outbreak prompted border closures and stay-home orders as governments attempted to slow the spread of the virus.

The airline said it will operate a daily 737 Max flight between Miami and New York from Dec. 29 to Jan. 4, with flights available for booking from Oct. 24.
""We remain in contact with the FAA and Boeing on the certification process and we'll continue to update our plans based on when the aircraft is certified,"" the company said in an statement.

(Reuters) - Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) has launched two inquiries into  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) after concerns were raised about the social network giant's handling of children's personal data on Instagram. 
The DPC, the main data privacy regulator in the European Union, received complaints from individuals and had identified ""potential concerns"" in relation to the processing of children's personal data on Instagram, Deputy Commissioner Graham (NYSE:GHM) Doyle told Reuters in an emailed statement.
Both inquiries were launched last month, Doyle said in the statement.
Facebook did not immediately respond when contacted by Reuters on Sunday.
The Telegraph https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/10/18/instagram-investigation-exposing-millions-childrens-contact, which first reported the inquiry, said Instagram made the email addresses and phone numbers of users under 18 public. 
The Irish regulator launched its probe following a complaint by David Stier, a U.S. data scientist, the Telegraph added. 
The first inquiry looks to establish if Facebook has the legal basis to process the data and whether it employs adequate protections and/or restrictions on Instagram.
""This inquiry will also consider whether Facebook meets its obligations as a data controller with regard to transparency requirements in its provision of Instagram to children,"" Doyle said.
Instagram's profile and account settings will be the focus of the second inquiry, examining whether the social media company is adhering to the regulator's data protection requirements. 
Ireland hosts the European headquarters of a number of U.S. technology firms, making the DPC the EU's lead regulator under the bloc's General Data Protection Regulation's ""One Stop Shop"" regime introduced in 2018. 

The new rules give regulators the power to impose fines for violations of up to 4% of a company's global revenue or 20 million euros ($22 million), whichever is higher.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp (T:6502) said on Monday it aims to generate $3 billion in revenue from its advanced cryptographic technology for data protection by 2030, as the Japanese sprawling conglomerate scrambles to find future growth drivers.
The cyber security technology, called quantum key distribution (QKD), leverages the nature of quantum physics to provide two remote parties with cryptographic keys that are immune to cyberattacks driven by quantum computers.
Toshiba expects the global QKD market to grow to $12 billion in 10 years with the advance of quantum computers, whose massive computational power could easily decipher conventional math-based cryptographic keys commonly used in finance, defence and health care.
The company is hoping to tap global demand for advanced cryptographic technologies as cyber security has come to the forefront of national defence. China is aggressively expanding network infrastructure for QKD, including quantum satellites that relay quantum signals.
The company said it has teamed up with  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) in the United States and BT Group (L:BT) in Britain in pilot QKD projects, and is in talks with another telecommunications carrier in South Korea.
Since a crisis stemming from the bankruptcy of the U.S. nuclear power business in 2017, Toshiba has conducted a series of restructuring steps, including the sale of its laptop and television set businesses.

It is now focusing on public infrastructure businesses that are resilient to a global economic slump driven by the coronavirus outbreak.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have reached a bilateral agreement that will give incentives and protection to investors who make investments in each other's countries, both finance ministries said on Sunday.
The agreement is one of the first between the UAE and Israel after they agreed to normalise relations in August.
It is also the first such agreement Israel has forged with an Arab country and will become the 37th such treaty for Israel, with the 36 others mainly Western countries. The last was signed with Japan in 2017.
The UAE has signed 99 investment protection treaties and this one with Israel would strengthen economic ties, encourage competition and increase the attractiveness of investments between the two countries, UAE Finance Ministry Undersecretary Younis Haji Al Khoori said in a statement.
Under the deal, which still needs to be signed by both finance ministers, investors would be protected from arbitrary changes in regulation and political situations and they will be able to transfer funds out of country if needed -- a framework the Israeli ministry said would put investors' minds at ease.
The UAE finance ministry said the agreement would protect investments from non-commercial risks such as ""nationalisation, confiscation, judicial seizures, freezing assets, establishing licensed investments, and transferring profits and revenues in convertible currencies."" 
Israeli Finance Ministry chief economist Shira Greenberg said the agreement would benefit the private sector while promoting competition in the Israeli economy.

Last week, the UAE and Israel reached a preliminary agreement on a separate deal that would avoid double taxation.

Shenzhen will launch stock index-futures products and will be allowed to issue offshore yuan-denominated local government bonds.

COVID-19 has changed working life for millions of people around the world, many of whom have switched from offices to working from home - reducing demand for office space and prompting companies to opt out of renewing leases.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Malaysia Airlines' parent company is still holding negotiations with lessors and creditors over a restructuring plan to keep the carrier alive, but the talks are taking longer than planned, according to a staff memo seen by Reuters.
""The negotiations are still ongoing and taking longer than the planned timeline, but we are gaining encouraging traction from the lessors and creditors thus far,"" Izham Ismail, chief executive of Malaysia Airlines and group CEO of parent Malaysia Aviation Group (MAG), said in a memo to staff on Oct. 16.
In response to a Reuters query, MAG said in an email on Saturday it is ""continuing discussions with creditors on its ongoing restructuring exercise"".
MAG, owned by state fund Khazanah, said Izham's memo to staff was to address concerns among employees.
Malaysia's national airline is seeking to restructure after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to slash operations.
The carrier had restructured after two deadly crashes in 2014 but unlike at that time the government is unwilling to bail it out this time.
Reuters reported last week that a group of lessors had rejected a restructuring plan that involved steep discounts, bringing the carrier closer to a showdown over its future.
In the memo to staff, Izham assured them that MAG's restructuring exercise ""is still work in progress"".
""Do you see me throwing in the towel yet? Together with the senior leadership team, we are here still fighting for the company’s survival,"" Izham said.
On Thursday, MAG said subsidiary Firefly Airlines will start flying in early 2021 as part of a realigned group-wide business strategy.

1240,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 17, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>","Calling Uber Eats, DoorDash & Grubhub: Your Next Acquisition Awaits","By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- You probably haven't ever heard of Waitr, but if CEO Carl Grimstad has his way, the name will soon be in headlines alongside Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats, DoorDash or Grubhub -- as proud new owner of the food delivery service.
""I have three competitors that all want more market share that are super highly capitalized. Consolidation works in this industry,"" Grimstad said in a phone interview this week. """"It's going to be hand to hand combat.""
Uber, Grubhub and Doordash did not reply to requests for comment.
Waitr, founded in 2013, focuses on underserved markets largely in the Southeast of the U.S. Grimstad joined in January to turn around the company from a money-loser whose stock at one point plummeted from a high of $14.15 in March 2019 to a low of 24 cents eight months later. Grimstad saw dwindling cash balances at the Lafayette, La.-based Waitr, which faced delisting for having a low share price for an extended time. He cut expenses, increased fees and reclassified drivers from employees to contractors.
In the second quarter this year, Waitr saw its first-ever quarterly profit, and Grimstad intends for it to continue that way, regardless of whether or not he sells the company. 
""You really can't run a business to sell it, you have to run it for the long term,"" Grimstad said. ""Our head is down and we're doing the blocking and tackling every day.""
While Waitr doesn't have a huge analyst following -- there are two that we found -- both seem to quite like the stock. In August, Craig-Hallum analyst Alex Fuhrman reiterated a buy after meeting with management. Waitr's fundamentals are strong and the stock is cheap compared to rival Grubhub, StreetInsider reported Fuhrman as saying. 
In July, B. Riley analyst Jeff Van Sinderen started coverage with a buy rating, noting that it ""frequently commands first or second place in market share, while efficient penetration and servicing of such markets has largely proven elusive for the larger players in the industry,"" according to StreetInsider. 
Grimstad cites the 20-odd markets where the company is the local favorite as among the most attractive qualities that a possible buyer might look for. It also serves 20 million customers and 20,000 restaurants.
""The market has expanded so rapidly, all the players are everywhere, but we have meaningful market share in these harder to reach plus or minus 20 markets,"" Grimstad said. ""Secondarily, it's a cash flow machine now.""
Market research indicates that the food delivery industry’s total addressable market will continue to grow for years as more types of food preparation businesses begin to use delivery services, Van Sinderen said. ""We believe that WTRH has been reborn under new CEO Carl Grimstad, who took the helm on January 3, 2020, following lackluster performance throughout  most of 2019 and significant management turnover,"" Van Sinderen wrote in a note. ""Mr. Grimstad has repositioned WTRH as a promising acquisition target, as it has inflected to growth and profitability and offers a deft command of smaller markets.""
Grimstad previously co-founded and headed up iPayment, a provider of credit and debit card payment processing services to small and medium-sized merchants. To learn about the delivery business, he actually delivered food and sat in the customer service center for hours. 
He sees Waitr as an integrated payments company, and recently issued a dine-in option in which customers can use Waitr to order via a QR code and pay the bill -- very Covid-friendly. It's a solution Grimstad points out can be sold in any market, and isn't limited to Waitr's current locations, a possible selling point for Uber Eats, Grubhub or DoorDash.
""We believe WTRH is an attractive takeout candidate following the wave of consolidation that the industry has experienced globally,"" B. Riley's Van Sinderen said.

1241,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 17, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: The Case for Exxon,"By Peter Nurse and Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Few companies have been as hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic as  Exxon Mobil  .
Its stock has fallen over 50% this year, losing its title as America’s oil major with the largest market capitalization, and was dropped from its prestigious place in the Dow Jones index of top U.S. industrial companies after 92 years.
Is Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) a survivor or is oil dead? 
Investing.com's Peter Nurse argues the case in favor of Exxon, while Geoffrey Smith explains why investors should steer clear. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bull Case
This is an excellent opportunity for investors to get involved with a company with a history of operational excellence and capital discipline, particularly as the damage caused to the industry gets rid of the waifs and strays.
A born survivor, as befits a company that can trace its roots back to Standard Oil, established by John D. Rockefeller in 1870, Exxon Mobil has long proved its ability to roll with the cyclical punches. It will again.
After all, even if the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries earlier this week reduced its demand forecast to 96.84 million barrels of oil per day for 2021, that’s still a lot of oil the global economy needs for at least the next 10 years. 
The industry may well be in structural decline, but it’s still very possible to make healthy profits along the way, ask the tobacco giants!
Increasing the company’s debt pile with bets on rising demand just as Covid-inspired shutdowns caused oil prices to slump was ill-timed. But the management has started to address these issues, announcing plans earlier this month to reduce its European workforce by up to 1,600 by the end of 2021 as part of its global review. 
Essentially, the stock is now massively oversold, with a cut to its sacrosanct dividend fully discounted ((it's already trading on the expected future dividend ratio, not the current one). Yet, oil prices seem to have stabilized to the point that an imminent dividend cut is unlikely, and as recently as July, Chief Executive Darren Woods insisted this hefty dividend was safe. 
A further substantial drop in oil prices seems unlikely in the near future, even with Covid-19 caes on the rise, with the major oil producing nations reluctant to suffer again the pain of earlier in the year.
""I want to assure you that the OPEC, non-OPEC partnership will continue to do what it knows best, by ensuring that we don't relapse into this almost historic plunge that we saw,"" Mohammad Barkindo, Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said on Thursday.
Influential investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded its stance on Exxon Mobil earlier this week, and this could be the cue for value investors to part with their cash.
The Bear Case
Exxon Mobil may not be going to zero – the world will need too much oil for too long for that – but it can’t be seen as a buy in anything but short-term and opportunistic terms.
Oil is dead, for any truly forward-looking investor. Demand has risen constantly for 160 years, but even OPEC now expects it to peak within the next 10, before starting entering structural decline.
Exxon has to fight for every dollar of revenue from rent-seeking governments. They will not be more generous in dividing up a shrinking pie. The Ex in Exxon stands for Ex-growth.
OK, so Exxon is a value stock, rather than a growth one. That requires it to be a reliable source of income, but there is nothing reliable about Exxon’s future returns to shareholders.
Arguments that Big Tobacco paid handsome dividends for years after entering structural decline only go so far: Exxon has to spend vast amounts every year to maintain its cash flow - $23 billion this year alone, even after it trimmed its budget by 30%.
Every other oil major has cut its dividend this year to conserve cash. Exxon alone believes it can just cover the gap by borrowing – some $22 billion in all. How many times can it repeat that trick? Management said after six months that it wants to both keep debt AND the dividend at their current level. With Crude Oil WTI Futures struggling to get above $40 a barrel, it’s hard to see how it can do both.
Management’s planning, moreover, depends on the assumption that the asset values on its balance sheet are safe, and not – as virtually every other oil company has acknowledged – at risk of being stranded by Climate Change and regulation to mitigate it. Aside from one big write-off of its tar sands acreage in Canada, Exxon - much to its credit – has historically refused to write down bad investments, believing it let managers off the hook too easily. But that’s another area where assuming that the future will be like the past is fraught with risk.
Pressure from activists is one thing. Actual regulatory risk is another: if the opinion polls are reliable, that’s about to get a lot bigger. Under a ‘Blue Wave’ scenario, in which Joe Biden takes the White House and Democrats regain the Senate, the oil and gas industry can expect to lose a good deal of the tax and regulatory privileges it had under previous  administrations, while its taxes will be channeled toward subsidies for the likes of Nextera Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE). An industry being milked to subsidize its competitors is one to avoid, for all of Exxon’s past achievements."

(Reuters) - Citadel Securities, which provides trading services to asset managers, banks, broker-dealers and hedge funds, has sued the Securities and Exchange Commission over its decision to approve a new mechanism for trading stocks at upstart exchange operator IEX Group Inc.
""The SEC failed to properly consider the costs and burdens imposed by this proposal that will undermine the reliability of our markets and harm tens of millions of retail investors,"" a Citadel Securities spokeswoman said in an email on Friday.
The lawsuit, which was filed on Friday and first reported by the Wall Street Journal, increases Citadel Securities' dispute over IEX's ""D-Limit"" order type. The D-Limit is designed to give traders a way to buy or sell stocks at the exchange while protecting them against unfavorable price moves.
Citadel Securities earlier asked the SEC to reject the proposal from IEX, saying the D-Limit will damage the U.S. stock market's integrity. But in August, the SEC sided with IEX allowing the plan to go forward.
Citadel Securities asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the SEC's decision to approve the D-Limit order, according to a copy of the court filing.
The SEC was not immediately available for comment late on Friday.
IEX President Ronan Ryan, in a statement quoted by the Wall Street Journal, said he was confident the SEC's decision will be upheld. ""Since its launch on Oct. 1, D-Limit is already proving valuable to a broad set of market participants,"" Ryan said.
""From our perspective, this recent action should only encourage more investors, brokers and market makers to use D-Limit given that the protections we have created are clearly working,"" Ryan said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As a technology-driven rally brings U.S. stock indexes within striking distance of fresh records, concerns that big names are over-extended and that new regulation might be coming have some investors diversifying beyond the rally leaders.
The S&P 500's five biggest companies, Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) now account for 28% of the index's weighting and have been responsible for 25% of its earnings, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said earlier this month.
On average, these tech and internet-driven stocks have gained 49.23% this year, compared to a 7% gain for the S&P 500 - and are up 9.6% on average since Sept. 21, versus 6.6% for the S&P 500. They are expected to report strong third-quarter earnings in coming weeks, proving their mettle in a year when the coronavirus pandemic fueled a work-from-home economy while devastating companies linked to sectors like travel, restaurants, and fossil fuels. 
(Graphic: S&P 500's big tech boost https://tmsnrt.rs/2SUGbw3) 
Still, some worry that mega-cap tech companies are exposed to factors that may cut their allure in the months ahead. Being long technology is the most crowded trade of all time, according to a recent Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fund manager survey.
""It's all about trying not to have all your eggs in one basket,"" said Laura Kane, head of Americas thematic investing at UBS Global Wealth Management. ""It's about trimming certain exposures and rotating into something else.""
UBS analysts have recommended diversifying out of mega-cap tech stocks on signs of an economic recovery and climbing valuations. They urge rebalancing into U.S. semiconductors, which are more sensitive to economic recovery, as well as emerging market value stocks and United Kingdom-based equities.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) analysts also recently cited a challenging regulatory environment as one reason to diversify out of U.S. tech shares and into Asian ones and European stocks.
Regulatory concerns have heightened following a scathing report https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tech-biden-analysis/scathing-congressional-report-suggests-big-trouble-for-big-tech-if-biden-wins-idUSKBN26S32A detailing market power abuses by Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook issued earlier this month by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel. The report has raised concerns that tough new rules and stricter enforcement for big tech companies will follow should Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden win the White House.
A potential breakthrough in the search for a COVID-19 vaccine also could also spur bets on shares of economically sensitive value and cyclical stocks that may benefit from a stronger economic recovery, potentially dimming the appeal of tech, Soc Gen analysts said. 
The median 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio for the Big 5 tech stocks is 31, while the S&P 500 trades at a 12-month forward PE ratio of 22, according to Refinitiv. Still, they are not as extended as in the dotcom period, with overall profitability, dividends and balance sheet strength in much better shape than 20 years ago.
Companies investors will be watching next week as they report third-quarter results include Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) on Tuesday, Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and Verizon Communication Inc (N:VZ) on Wednesday, and  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) on Thursday. Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook report the following week.
Many investors still see the big tech names, with their strong balance sheets and financial results, as havens as coronavirus cases continue to climb and the economy struggles with a lack of new fiscal stimulus.
""These companies deliver powerful profits,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors. ""People have to keep in mind that the five largest tech companies make more in earnings than the entire Russell 2000 combined, so this isn't the internet bubble.""
It might be a good idea to trim some tech exposure if the position has gotten too overweighted, but the sector's gains are largely being driven by fundamentals, said Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller & Washington LLC. 

To rotate out of tech because of big gains and some recent volatility would be ""a suckers' trade,"" he added. ""Reports of their demise have been greatly exaggerated,"" he said of the big tech stocks.

""I am pretty bearish on the emerging world,"" Fink said at an online event hosted by the Institute of International Finance.
He said the COVID-19 pandemic is taxing emerging economies and their health systems more than developed countries, de-globalization is hurting the commodity-dependent countries and the group is more sensitive to effects of climate change. 
""When we talk about climate change, and we think that's a big issue and a reallocation of capital,"" Fink said, ""part of that reallocation of capital is movement out of the emerging world.""
Outside these global macro trends, a lack of trust in EM governments is further hurting the asset class, the head of BlackRock said.
""We're seeing a flip-flop of governments. One government could raise a lot of debt, new government comes in and (there's) different behaviors, different attitudes, and it doesn't create any confidence for the debt holders,"" Fink said.
""The risk premium that you're going to have to demand to invest in the emerging markets is growing persistently.""
Following a sharp spike in March as COVID-19-related shutdowns spread all over the world, the rolling-year average premium demanded to hold EM debt rose to its highest in more than a decade.
BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager with almost $8 trillion under management. 
Fink added that many emerging countries are going to have to restructure their debt and their leaders are not aware of who is holding the debt and how that affects a restructuring.
""I have had three or four conversations with leaders of different emerging countries... it's like I'm telling them some facts from outer space,"" Fink said.

1247,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 06:00PM ET</span>",Shares of gun makers gain as Biden's lead grows,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Shares of gun makers have been gaining ground as Democratic candidate Joe Biden leads polls, and if he wins the presidential election in November there are expectations of a renewed surge in gun sales that could drive shares even higher.
Shares of  Smith & Wesson  Brands (O:SWBI) and Sturm Ruger (N:RGR) have both rallied around 8% since late September, mirroring Biden’s widening lead in the polls since his debate against President Donald Trump. The S&P 500 is up 4% in that period.
Fears about the coronavirus pandemic, civil unrest related to protests over racial justice and worries about a potentially disputed presidential election on Nov. 3 have created a surge in gun demand this year. Smith & Wesson CEO Mark Smith last month said the industry was unable to keep up with demand. 
A victory by Biden and his vice presidential running mate Kamala Harris, who favor increased gun regulation, could further stoke demand for firearms - and shares of firearms makers - particularly if Democrats wrest control of the Senate from Republicans, giving them majorities in both houses of Congress and making it easier to approve legislation.
""Should we see a Biden-Harris administration get elected, I would anticipate a surge in sales of modern sporting rifles, high-capacity magazines and corresponding ammunition,"" said Aegis Capital analyst Rommel Dionisio, using an industry term for military-style rifles, a high-margin product category for firearm manufacturers. 
An aggregation of betting odds by RealClearPolitics reflects a 65% chance Biden will defeat Trump, up from 55% before the Sept. 29 presidential debate.
Smith & Wesson's stock is up 135% this year, while Sturm Ruger has gained 51%.
Shares of Sturm Ruger surged nearly 900% in the eight years from Democratic President Barack Obama's election victory in November 2008 to the November 2016 election, which Trump won. Sturm Ruger is up just 10% during Trump’s nearly years in office. During the same 2008 to 2016 period, the S&P 500 rose about 113%.
Biden has promised to prohibit the sale of military-style rifles and high-capacity magazines, similar to a 10-year ban that expired in 2004. He also promises to require owners of military-style weapons to either sell them to the government or register them with the government.
Shares of gun makers surged ahead of the 2016 election on expectations Democratic candidate Hilary Clinton would win. Trump's victory drove the industry into a two-year slump, with customers no longer worried they would lose access to firearms. 
Firearm sales surged anew in 2020 due to fears related to the pandemic, and following social unrest in several U.S. cities and calls to defund police departments.
Federal background checks, a proxy for firearm sales to U.S. consumers, in the first nine months of 2020 reached 28.8 million, even before the typically busy holiday shopping season, topping the record 28.4 million checks done in the 2019 full year.
Graphic: Shares of gun makers outperform in 2020 https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxadyovx/Pasted%20image%201602711020863.png
First-time buyers made up 40% of gun sales in early 2020, compared to an average of 24% in recent years, according to a survey of gun shops by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade association.
Even if Trump wins a second term and dispels expectations of gun control measures, the potential for renewed protests against across the deeply divided country could drive additional demand for handguns for self defense, Dionisio said.

Investing.com – The Dow eked out a third straight weekly win Friday, despite selling into the close as investors weighed up stronger retail sales data that pointed to underlying strength in the U.S. consumer against cooling hopes for a quick roll out of stimulus. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.39%, or 112 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.08%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.36%.
The Commerce Department said Friday that retail sales rose 01.5% last month. That confounded economists’ forecast for a 0.5% rise. The retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP –  rose 1.4%, topping expectations for a 0.2% increase. 
Some economists, however, warned the data could represent the ""last hurrah"" for the consumer heading toward the end of the year as income will likely decline amid a lack of stimulus.  
""September strength may have been the last hurrah for the consumer this year. With the back to school/work spending likely behind us, and disposable income set to contract sharply in Q3/Q4 without fresh fiscal stimulus, we’ll be lucky if consumption is flat in Q4,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Despite little progress on stimulus talks, many believe that it is a matter of when rather than if further federal aid is coming, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggesting earlier this week that a fiscal package will be rolled out before January.
Utilities, industrials, and health care led the broader market higher, with the latter getting a boost from a rise in shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) and  Pfizer  .
Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) said it would apply for emergency U.S. approval of its Covid-19 vaccine it is developing with Germany's BioNTech in the third week of November. Pfizer and  Biontech Se  (NASDAQ:BNTX) both added nearly 4%.
The news helped restore some optimism over a Covid-19 vaccine after both Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) announced setbacks earlier this week.
Tech, however, lagged the broader move higher even as the Fab 5 stocks closed mostly in the red, despite trading higher intraday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Friday as further clarity regarding the timeline for the development of a coronavirus vaccine and upbeat retail sales data and brought buyers back to the market.
All three indexes were on track to snap a three-day losing streak driven by halted vaccine trials and protracted pandemic relief talks in Washington.
Still, they all looked set to post gains on the week.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) announced it could apply for U.S. authorization for the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with German partner BioNTech in November. Pfizer's stock gained 3.4%.
Retail sales in September blew past analyst expectations and consumer sentiment for the current month surprised to the upside, according to two separate economic reports. But with previous stimulus having run its course, the outlook is uncertain unless Washington can reach an agreement on a fresh round of fiscal aid.
""This was a strong showing by the consumer,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. ""Even though we still have high unemployment, the consumer hasn't changed his spending habits yet."" 
On that front, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that President Donald Trump would ""weigh in"" with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell if an agreement is reached on a new pandemic relief package. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, however, said he does not expect an agreement to be reached ahead of the Nov. 3 election as long as Pelosi is involved.
""Investors are still very much concerned about the uncertainties around the stimulus talks,"" said Cardillo. ""We could see something before the election but whoever wins the election will probably give us a bigger stimulus package which is desperately needed.""

Third-quarter reporting season burst from the starting gate this week, with 49 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 86% have cleared the low bar set by expectations, according to Refinitiv.
Analysts now see S&P 500 earnings for the July to September period dropping, in aggregate, by 18.7% year-on-year, an improvement from the 21.4% plunge estimated at the beginning of the month, per Refinitiv.
Oil services company Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) posted its third straight quarterly loss due to falling crude prices and plunging demand. Its shares dropped 7.8%.

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 01:25PM ET</span>",EU urged to review remdesivir supply deal after COVID-19 trial results,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union should renegotiate a 1 billion euro ($1.2 billion) contract it sealed last week with Gilead for a six-month supply of the COVID-19 drug remdesivir after it showed poor results in a large trial, experts said on Friday.
In a blow to one of the few drugs being used to treat people with COVID-19, the Solidarity Trial conducted by the World Health Organization showed that remdesivir appeared to have little or no effect on mortality or length of hospital stays among patients with the respiratory disease.
The trial results were disclosed a week after the EU's executive Commission announced its largest contract to date with Gilead (O:GILD) for the supply of 500,000 courses of the antiviral drug at a price of 2,070 euro per treatment, which Gilead said was the standard for wealthy nations. 
The Commission ""needs to present the reasons behind the rush to conclude the latest contract with Gilead and move to review it in light of the Solidarity Trial findings,"" said Yannis Natsis, who represents patients' organisations on the board of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the EU drug regulator.
The EU announced on Oct. 8 that it had signed the supply contract with the U.S. company on behalf of its 27 member states and 10 partner countries, including Britain.
Gilead had known about the results of Solidarity since Oct. 6, the WHO said, citing disclosure rules under the Solidarity Trial. 
Gilead told Reuters it had received in late September an ""heavily redacted manuscript"" from the WHO which contained different information from the final document published on Friday. 
'TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE'
The Commission's decision was made after EU countries warned of shortages of remdesivir in their hospitals amid a new surge of COVID-19 infections across Europe.
The contract does not oblige countries to buy remdesivir, although it ties them to the agreed price.
Two days after the EU deal, Poland said it had ordered 80,000 vials of remdesivir, which is usually administered in a six-dose regimen.
Gilead said it did not plan to adjust remdesivir's price for wealthy countries after the WHO trial, and the company questioned its results. 
""As time is of the essence – we are in a situation of a public health emergency - we have to not only invest up-front in vaccine development but also in access to therapeutics,"" a spokesman for the European Commission said.
He added the EMA would look into the Solidarity results and data available from other studies on COVID treatments ""to see if any changes are needed to the way these medicines are used"".
But the spokesman did not comment on whether the EU was aware of the Solidarity results before it signed the contract with Gilead. He also did not reply to questions on whether the price agreed with Gilead could be renegotiated.
""The EU should revisit the prices to be paid for Remdesivir. Why pay 1 billion euros for a drug with no effects on survival?"" said Andrew Hill, a senior visiting research fellow in the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Liverpool.
He said generic versions of the drug manufactured in India were sold at 200 euros per course.

1258,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>",Pfizer says earliest COVID-19 vaccine application to U.S. regulators would be after election,"By Manas Mishra and Michael Erman
(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) said on Friday it could file for U.S. authorization of the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with German partner BioNTech (F:22UAy) as early as late November, suggesting that it's possible a vaccine could be available in the United States this year.
That time line makes it unlikely a vaccine will be available before the U.S. election as President Donald Trump has promised. Pfizer said that it may say if the vaccine is effective as soon as this month based on its 40,000 person clinical trial but that it also needs safety data that will not be available until next month.
The Pfizer news, published in a letter from its chief executive on its website, lifted the U.S. stock market and the company's shares. Shares were up slightly in rival vaccine maker  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA), which is close to Pfizer in its vaccine development.
""So let me be clear, assuming positive data, Pfizer will apply for Emergency Authorization Use in the U.S. soon after the safety milestone is achieved in the third week of November,"" Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said.
Trump has said repeatedly that there would be a vaccine available before the election, but health officials and companies had only said that data might be available this month. The possibility of further delays was raised after trials for two rival vaccines were put on hold in the United States this fall.
The president's rush to a vaccine has also raised concerns that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, acting in haste, might not conduct an adequate review of the vaccine. 
U.S. health officials have sought to assuage those concerns out of fear that not enough Americans would take a vaccine early on. Earlier this month, the FDA formalized a requirement that the vaccine makers collect two months of safety data on one-half of trial participants.
Pfizer has been trying to demonstrate that its decision making is being driven by science rather than politics, Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan said.
""Just getting it to the market is only a small part of it,"" Divan said. ""People should actually be willing to take it. And the polling shows us that lot of people are reluctant to take it because they think it's not just being driven strictly by the science,"" he said.
Pfizer's comments on its time line raise the possibility of U.S. authorization of a coronavirus vaccine this year, a key step in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed more than a million people and ravaged the global economy.
Moderna could also apply for an emergency use authorization (EUA) this year. It has said that it may have interim data on its 30,000 person trial as soon as November.
Both companies are also applying for approval in Europe, where they are racing against AstraZeneca PLC (L:AZN). AstraZeneca's U.S. trial has been on hold since September. Another U.S. trial of a candidate from Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) was paused earlier this week.
After the FDA announced the two-month requirement on Oct. 6, which was approved by the White House but undercut the likelihood of a vaccine before voters go to polls on Nov. 3., Trump called the move a 'political hit job.' 
In addition to safety and efficacy, the FDA will also examine Pfizer's manufacturing operations for the vaccine. 
Bourla said the filing depended on several other factors, including initial data on effectiveness that may or may not be available by late October.
He said the company plans to share efficacy data with the public as soon as practical. (https:// A BioNTech spokeswoman confirmed the time frame for the possible EUA application to the FDA. 
Pfizer's shares rose 2.6% in early trading, while BioNTech's U.S-listed shares were up 2.8%. Moderna shares were up slightly.

1260,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 11:09AM ET</span>",Stock and Bond Market Volatility Diverges on ‘Blue Wave’ Bets,"(Bloomberg) -- With 18 days to go until the U.S. election, growing odds that Democrats will take control of the White House and the Senate is sending volatility gauges for stocks and bonds in opposite directions.
The Cboe Volatility Index -- known as the equity market’s “fear gauge” -- has been relatively subdued this month. That’s at odds with the U.S. Treasury market’s equivalent measure: The ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA MOVE Index jumped by the most since March last week after languishing near record-low levels.
While bets on price swings are taking opposite tacks, analysts say that traders are wagering on the same story. With Democratic nominee Joe Biden comfortably ahead of Donald Trump in presidential election surveys and his party gaining ground in several Senate polls, the current calculus is that a so-called blue wave would unleash another round of economic stimulus -- pressuring Treasury yields higher. Meanwhile, anxiety over a contested result is easing on gauges of stock-market volatility.
“Markets are seeing the upcoming elections and any final word on stimulus as important data points on whether this will be a true inflection point for interest rates,” said Sameer Samana,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment’s senior global market strategist. “With the odds of a Biden win and a blue wave increasing, the bond markets sees increasing chances of larger stimulus.”
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields touched the highest level since June last week as Biden’s lead in the polls widened, but have since retreated as stimulus negotiations seemed to deadlock. Still, five- and 10-year breakeven rates -- a proxy for inflation expectations and the chances of stimulus getting passed -- remain near recent highs.
Equity traders had been bracing for a too-close-to-call election, with implied volatility elevated long after the vote itself. But those fears have ebbed as Biden’s polling lead grows, with UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) noting this week that election-risk premium is at its lowest since March.
Currently, PredictIt’s market for betting on a Democratic sweep -- winning the presidency, keeping control of the House and taking control of the Senate -- shows odds of roughly 57%.
“In the equity market, what investors care about is a close or contested election,” said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG’s Mandy Xu in a Bloomberg Television interview Thursday. “As the probability of a Democratic sweep goes up, that risk premium has come in.”

1261,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Second sovereign downgrade wave coming, major nations at risk - S&P Global","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Some of the world's top economies could see their credit ratings cut or put on downgrade warnings in the coming months in a second global wave of coronavirus-related revisions, S&P Global's top sovereign analyst has warned.
S&P's sovereign group managing director Roberto Sifon-Arevalo told Reuters that the immense costs of supporting health systems, firms and workers through the pandemic was fundamentally altering some countries' finances for the worse.
The rating agency has already downgraded or cut the outlooks on nearly 60 countries this year, but only relatively few have been higher-rated richer nations.
With some though piling on 15-20 points of debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) - amounts that would normally take four or five years to accumulate - and locked into higher spending for the next 3-5 years, that could be about to change.
""You are talking about ratings in the EU, or in highly developed countries like Japan or the UK or in this part of the world, the United States, that have been able to implement pretty massive fiscal and monetary packages to defend themselves,"" Sifon-Arevalo said.
""The main point to see here is where do we see the trajectory going forward. If we see the trajectory as establishing more of a different structural pattern, then you are going to see some (rating) movements there."" 
A total of 31 countries - almost a quarter of all those S&P rates - currently have ""negative outlooks"" on their ratings which more often than not get converted into downgrades. 
Of the bigger economies it includes Australia's prized triple-A rating, Italy and Mexico's BBB scores and Spain's A grade. However, a blizzard of new negative outlooks could be just as much of a worry at time when many major economies are seeing a resurgence of the virus. 
""We are going through the revisions. Now, and over the next few months we will continue to do so,"" Sifon-Arevalo said. 
""I would say initially it's going to be an outlook change. And again, there's going to be those that maybe will come out of that and will come back to stable (outlooks) in a couple of years.""
""But then there will be those that will not come back to stable and they will keep going down the rating spectrum.""

DEFAULT WORRIES
There are two more groups of less well-off countries whose rating are also in the firing line. 
In Latin America, Mexico and Brazil are under pressure as well as Colombia which is teetering on the last rung of investment grade and on a warning it could be cut to junk.
The final group includes some of the world's poorest and most indebted countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where Sifon-Arevalo said more debt restructuring and defaults could be coming.
Zambia has already asked its international creditors to give it more time to pay some of its debts which have ballooned to 100% of its GDP, while countries like Angola and Ghana are spending roughly half of their government revenues just on making interest payments on their debts.
""I think we are likely to see more cases like Zambia's,"" he said. ""You can imagine that spending 50 cents out of every dollar or peso or whatever currency you're earning, just on paying interest it's becoming pretty difficult.""

1262,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>",Analysis: Unloved value stocks seen as cautious bet as election nears,"By Lewis Krauskopf and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - A sustained shift to value stocks has eluded investors for years. Indeed, a casualty this week was the $10-billion AJO quantitative value fund that announced it was shutting, citing the longest ""drought"" on record in value.
Some investors and analysts, however, are making a counter-argument, saying the unloved trade could be worth buying as the U.S. election nears and progress continues on a coronavirus vaccine.
""Investors have lost patience with value stocks but the irony is that we could be just weeks away from a turning point,"" said Troy Gayeski, partner and co-chief investment officer at SkyBridge Capital. 
A possible ""Blue Wave"" election on Nov 3, in which former Vice President Joe Biden wins the presidency and his Democratic party takes the U.S. Senate, could lead to massive stimulus, while clinical data on COVID-19 vaccines are expected by the end of the year.
Both outcomes could boost the outlook for the economy and help value portfolios, which tend to lean more heavily than growth on shares of banks and other financials, as well as on industrials, energy and materials companies, investors and analysts say.
Some investors are tip-toeing in. Lauren Goodwin, multi-asset portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments, has been increasing value exposure ""on the margin"" in part as a hedge, ""in the event that we have a quicker-than-expected resolution to the medical crisis, or in short outbursts when we have economic optimism."" 
Investing in so-called value stocks with cheap prices has a broad following and counts Warren Buffett as its most prominent disciple. But such value bets at the expense of buying high-profit growth stocks such as tech companies have generally been a losing trade for years. 
Over the past five years, the Russell 1000 value index climbed just 25%, compared to a 130% gain for the Russell 1000 growth index. This year alone, the growth index has gained 28% against a 10% decline for the value index, while growth had outperformed for 11 straight months until September. For October so far, the two groups are roughly even. 
BofA Global Research said value stocks had ""more room to run,"" noting that value outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 for at least three months at around the bottom of every economic recession since 1929.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said recently that a 2020 vaccine approval ""would likely drive a rotation towards value.""
""I think we are going to get a regime shift in markets probably after the election,” said Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA Research, which last month recommended clients ""pivot to value"" and says value's discount to growth is ""greater than it’s ever been.""
AJO Partners founder Ted Aronson, in a memo this week, said while he believed in a future for value, it was ""unlikely to arrive fast enough -- for us."" The fund's Large Cap Absolute Value strategy, which has more than $5 billion, fell 15% in the first nine months of 2020. 
Banks are among stocks that would need to see a resurgence for value to shine, and some fund managers are getting ready for such a shift.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) saw 196 new fund firms take positions in the company during the second quarter, including Coltrane Asset Management, while Citadel and Thornburg Investment Management upped their holdings, regulatory filings show.
But interest rates at rock-bottom levels are a hindrance. Bank stocks are tightly linked to bond yields, and financials are the biggest sector in the Russell 1000 value index.
Not everyone is embracing the trade.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has an underweight rating on several value-related sectors. Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said value companies' earnings fortunes generally are relying on fiscal stimulus and a widely-used COVID-19 vaccine.

“If you are putting on the value trade that is dependent upon those, you need to make sure that those events happen,” Palfrey said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday, lifted by a much stronger-than-expected report for retail sales in September that reassured market participants that consumer spending, the motor of the economy, is still holding up despite sustained high levels of layoffs and unemployment.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 160 points, or 0.6%, at 28,654 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6%.
Earlier, the Commerce Department said that core retail rales rose by 1.5% in September from August, three times the 0.5% increase forecast ahead of time. The numbers outweighed a less positive update from U.S. factories industrial production fell by 0.6% in the month, rather than the 0.5% increase expected. While much of that was due to a bigger-than-usual drop in utility output of power as summer demand for air-conditioning tapered off, capacity utilization and manufacturing output also dropped.
However, analysts at ING noted that the retail sales numbers, too, may have been distorted, in as much as August's numbers didn't have the usual 'back to school' surge in clothing and department store expenditures. The pandemic this year has disrupted the seasonal patterns behind many high-frequency economic indicators, closing down factories that would normally be open and forcing consumers to change the way they spend  their money and when they spend it.
""There is clearly momentum behind spending,"" ING's chief international economist James Knightley said in a note to clients, with a nod to the sustained strength of personal income thanks to extensive government support for the newly-unemployed. ""However,"" he added, ""uncertainty about Covid-19, particularly the fear that European-style containment measures could eventually return to parts of the US, may mean fewer upside surprises in coming months.""
Bank stocks remained under pressure at the end of a week when all the big lenders reported figures that showed significant pressure on their earnings from the collapse in U.S. interest rates.  JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) all fell by between 0.5% and 1%. 
More positively, Hertz Global  (NYSE:HTZ) stock more than doubled after the bankrupt car rental company said it had agreed $1.7 billion in debtor-in-possession funding that could pave the way for it to leave Chapter 11. Meanwhile, Navistar (NYSE:NAV) stock rose over 20% on reports that Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s truck unit Traton is close to completing the buyout of minority shareholders .
Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock rose 2.2% after the pharma giant said it expects to apply for emergency use authorization for its experimental Covid-19 drug in the third week of November. Shares in its project partner Biontech (NASDAQ:BNTX), which are usually more sensitive to such news, rose 2.9% to a two-month high. The Pfizer/Biontech drug is one of the few big hopes for a Covid-19 treatment that hasn't yet run into trouble during its clinical trials. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Johnson & Johnson both had to suspend their trials this week after unexplained illnesses among study participants.

1264,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>","Analysis: Japan's ANA charts course through COVID with loans, domestic flights and accounting rules","By Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's biggest airline, ANA, has turned to billions of dollars in loans and a government tourism campaign to weather the slump in air travel and could take advantage of accounting rules to avoid aircraft writedowns.
Like other carriers, ANA has been burning through cash to maintain jets that are either grounded or flying with too few passengers during the coronavirus pandemic, pushing it to an operating loss of 159 billion yen ($1.51 billion) for the April-June quarter.
Sources told Reuters on Wednesday that ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202) has secured $3.8 billion in subordinated loans from state-backed and private lenders.
That means it will have raised $13.29 billion of debt to cope with the coronavirus fallout, says Yasuhito Tsuchiya, a senior analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""It looks like they will have enough to survive,"" said Tsuchiya, who forecasts the carrier is on course for a record operating loss of around 400 billion yen for the full year ending March 31. 
The airline is slashing personnel costs through redundancies and pay cuts. Along with rival  Japan Airlines Co Ltd  (JAL) (T:9201), it is also getting government help including a waiver on airport landing fees, as Tokyo sees the carriers as crucial to keeping Japan, a 3,000-kilometre archipelago stretching along the edge of East Asia, connected.
ANA, which reported a negative cashflow from operations of 135 billion yen for April-June, has said it doesn't expect its international air travel to fully recover until 2024. 
It has more than 300 planes, including Airbus A380 super jumbos and twin-aisle jets such as the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliners, and owns two thirds of its fleet while leasing the rest.
At the end of June ANA said its aircraft were worth 1.14 trillion yen ($10.83 billion), almost unchanged from the previous year, but analysts say that is probably not a true reflection of their current market value.
Keeping planes that are grounded or underutilised could prove expensive because of parking and maintenance fees, which last business year cost ANA 177 billion yen.
Writedowns on some of them could add to a bottom line loss, but would allow the carrier to reduce depreciation charges in a boost to future earnings. 
Analysts, however, say ANA could instead take advantage of international aviation accounting rules that don’t force it to revalue planes to reflect market prices, allowing it to avoid painful writedowns and the need to raise equity.
""ANA has too many big aircraft, The loss of value calculated on the current market, would be enormous, so there is no way they can sell them,"" said Hajime Tozaki, an economics professor at J.F. Oberlin University in Tokyo and a former JAL employee.
Aviation consultant IBA this month estimated the value of aircraft owned by airlines had dropped $60 billion, or 40% lower than what they would be if supply and demand were balanced.
""Finding buyers right now at any price is rather difficult, except lessors who are looking to find bargains at low prices,"" said Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia.
HOME ADVANTAGE 
Tsuchiya said ANA and JAL have the advantage of a large domestic market with few competitors to help temper losses that other big Asian airlines like Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) lack. 
ANA was the world's ninth largest airline this summer based on seat capacity, up from 15th a year ago, according to data firm OAG, due to the relative strength of that home market.
Before the pandemic, ANA generated over half its revenue from domestic flights and demand has rebounded helped by the government's “Go To Travel” campaign launched in July to revive domestic tourism, which offers to pay up to half the cost of trips.
Domestic bookings in October are around 50% of last year, the ANA spokeswoman said, while the carrier has said international traffic is at 5% of levels seen in 2019.
ANA, which must repay around 200 billion yen in debt in the coming year, is due to release results for the July-September quarter on Oct. 27. 
The Japanese government announced further help for carriers on Friday, saying it would reduce airport landing fees by a record 45% on all domestic flights for seven months through February.

""The government needs both JAL and ANA as national flag carriers,"" said Tozaki.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hopes that  Pfizer  (N:PFE) could apply for a U.S. emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine in November helped soothe financial markets shaken by fears that that the resurgent coronavirus pandemic may undermine a fragile economic recovery.
Wall Street futures jumped back into positive territory and European stocks accelerated gains when the U.S. pharmaceutical group said the regulatory filing for the vaccine could come as soon as safety data is available in the third week of November. 
In midday trading the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.8% after losing over 2% on Thursday as new social restrictions in Europe, including a curfew in major French cities and tighter restrictions in London, spooked investors.
As the global race to develop a coronavirus vaccine heats up, financial markets have been tracking every twist and turn, hoping a successful deployment would help sustain economic recovery.
S&P 500 futures (Esc1) were up 0.3% after U.S. stocks ended Thursday's session down following a rise in weekly jobless claims. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's offer on Thursday to increase the size of a fiscal stimulus package to win the support of Republicans and Democrats helped limit Wall Street's losses, though many investors still believe a deal is unlikely before the Nov. 3 election. 
In a sign of improved mood on the trading floors, the euro (EUR=EBS) also regained some ground, rising about 0.2% to $1.1736 as investors shifted from perceived safe havens such as the dollar (=USD), which declined 0.2% against a basket of currencies. 
Sterling stumbled after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told businesses to get ready for a no-deal Brexit in case negotiations with the European Union fail to produce a free trade agreement.
The pound, however, recovered some ground and was trading unchanged against the dollar at $1.2904 as the head of the European Commission said the bloc's team would go to London next week to continue talks with the UK. 
Exposing the uncertainties over the economic outlook, oil prices fell, dragged down by concerns that the spike in COVID-19 cases in Europe and the United States is curtailing demand in two of the world's biggest fuel consuming regions. 
""It’s a tug-of-war between risks that are well flagged, the pandemic, the U.S. election, Brexit, and at the same time hope that these same risks can be resolved in matter of weeks or months"", said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
""In the meantime, it's hard for investors to take positions on the short term given all the uncertainties,"" he said. ""Looking forward to 2021, there’s a good probability these risks will be behind us."" 
Brent crude futures for December (LCOc1) fell 1% to $42.72 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for November delivery (CLc1) slid 0.9% to $40.56. 
Also exposing market angst, Germany's 10-year bond yield was set for its biggest weekly drop since June and stabilised near seven-month lows. 

Spot gold  prices were flat at $1,909.16 but looked set for their first weekly drop in three.

1266,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",Analysis: Europe's earnings optimism dwindles with resurgent virus,"By Danilo Masoni and Julien Ponthus
MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - A sudden tightening of social restrictions to tackle the resurgent coronavirus pandemic across Europe threatens to spoil any stock market boost third quarter earnings might bring.
European powerhouses Germany, France and the United Kingdom have announced a fresh range of measures, including curfews and limits on private gatherings, which have fuelled worries about the sustainability of the recovery.
Optimism about the burst of activity which followed the lifting of national lockdowns during the summer, had raised hopes the upcoming European earnings season would help the region's stock markets break out from the sideways movement they've been stuck in for months. 
European stocks are still down 11 percent in 2020 after COVID-19 sent the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index spiralling down about 40% in March. 
""In the grand scheme of things, this quarter is one of overall recovery,"" said Sylvain Goyon head of equity strategy at Oddo BHF in Paris.
""There's been an improvement in expectations and there's a good chance economic forecasts will continue to be revised upwards"".
According to Refinitiv I/B/E/S/ data, analysts expect companies on the STOXX 600 (STOXX) to report an average 36.7% drop in third quarter earnings year-on-year. 
""That's better than what we had last quarter but it's still fairly brutal,"" said Philipp Lisibach, Head of Global Equity Strategy at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in Zurich, highlighting the 51% drop in European profits in the second quarter.
While corporate profits in the third quarter of 2020 are expected to show evidence of a recovery, investors will be keen to see forecasts for the next quarter and 2021, if any are forthcoming. 
They will be closely watching outlook statements to see how businesses fared in the weeks following the reporting period and what the impact of a potential failure of the European Union and the UK to strike a free trade agreement might be.
Investors will also be analysing how companies are controlling costs and dealing with headwinds such as a stronger euro.
Forecast-beating results from European blue chips could provide ""a catalyst for equity prices to move higher"", said Kevin Thozet, a member of the investment committee at asset manager Carmignac.

FROM HEADWINDS TO TAILWINDS
Despite the bouts of volatility, early results from companies such as Publicis (PA:PUBP), the world's No.3 advertising firm, or German chemicals maker Covestro (DE:1COV) appeared to bring evidence of the better trend.
Recovering sales of Louis Vuitton handbags helped France's LVMH (PA:LVMH) contain the fallout from the coronavirus crisis in the third quarter, as the world's biggest luxury goods group reported a smaller-than-expected drop in revenues.
Also encouraging were the results of Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)  Stay-at-home winners  Logitech  (S:LOGN) and  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) are reporting results on Tuesday. Luxury goods makers  Kering  (PA:PRTP), Moncler (MI:MONC) and L'Oreal (PA:OREP) report later in the week. Graphic: U.S. versus Europe earnings growth expectations https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/rlgvdxljwvo/Pasted%20image%201602835240102.png Due to a relatively larger exposure to cyclical sectors, profit trends and price performances for European equities are tied to economic swings more than other markets such as the United States which is laden with tech giants such as Apple (O:AAPL) and Amazon (O:AMZN). Energy and financial stocks for instance, which tend to track economic growth closely, are expected to see their profits drop by 81.6% and 38.6% respectively this quarter. While this imbalance has weighed on Europe in comparison with the U.S. market which has seen the S&P 500 gain 7% year-to-date, it could turn into a tailwind once a credible vaccine is deployed or large U.S. stimulus gets approved, kick-starting the economy. ""In a period where the economy continues to be under immense pressure, the lack of growth sectors just hurts Europe, but at the same time you can make the argument that if the recovery continues then there's going to be a fairly decent catch-up potential,"" said Credit Suisse's Lisibach. Earnings in Europe are seen lagging the United States, where the third quarter profit drop is expected to be limited to 18.9% thanks to its heavy gearing to big tech, which got a boost from the stay-at-home economy during the pandemic.

1267,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",London and Paris Steel for Curbs to Check Spreading Virus,"(Bloomberg) -- Residents of Europe’s two largest cities are bracing for tighter curbs on social activity starting on Saturday, as governments across the continent attempt to check a new wave of coronavirus infections without crippling their economies.
With the number of cases hitting daily records around the region, and Britain and France two of the worst affected nations, Londoners will be banned from mixing with other households indoors, while the residents of Paris and eight other major cities will be confined to their homes between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. for four weeks.
After broader lockdowns triggered some of the worst recessions in living memory in the second quarter, European officials are opting for more localized restrictions targeted mainly at urban virus hotspots this time around.
Yet even after leaders including U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to do everything possible to keep their economies running, the prospect of national shutdowns is growing likelier by the day as the number of infections and deaths ticks inexorably higher.
“Everyone is worried about a second, full lockdown,” said Natalie Diaz-Fuentes, co-owner of London’s Santo Remedio Mexican restaurant and bar. “Even those of us who are lucky enough to have been busy and successful before the lockdown and just scraped through by the skin of our teeth.”
In Paris, chef Franck Baranger expressed outrage at Macron’s curfew announcement, made on national television on Wednesday, which he said showed the government is ill-prepared.
Because of the new regulations, the three restaurants Baranger co-owns in the French capital will have longer hours for lunch and will most likely open as early as 6 p.m. instead of 7:30 p.m., he said. His seafood restaurant “Belle Maison” will offer a takeaway option -- as long as it’s before 9 p.m.
“I think the government would be totally unable to manage a corner shop,” Baranger said Friday at his “Caillebotte” restaurant.
While polls suggest that a majority in France back the idea of a curfew in major cities, some governments are having to contend with rising opposition to virus curbs among citizens keen to return to a semblance of normality.
But with Europe heading into the winter, when people will be unable to spend as much time outdoors and transmission rates are likely to rise, getting back to normal appears some way off.
There has also been a sense of confusion in some countries, with central governments openly clashing with local administrations on the appropriate response.
In the U.K., officials in Manchester refused Johnson’s request to move to the highest level of pandemic restrictions unless he provides more generous financial support.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and the president of the Madrid region have disagreed publicly over policy, and Chancellor Angela Merkel struggled to convince Germany’s 16 state leaders to accept tougher measures during eight hours of talks on Wednesday.
New infections in Germany this week surpassed the previous peak from late March, with a record 7,620 cases recorded in the 24 hours through Friday morning in Europe’s biggest economy.
“At the moment the numbers are actually increasing everywhere,” Merkel’s chief of staff Helge Braun, who is a qualified medical doctor, said Friday on German television. “And increasing numbers mean that we are not doing enough at the moment to keep the infection under control.”
In a setback for Berlin’s efforts to control the virus, a court on Friday suspended an order for bars and restaurants to close at 11 p.m., a decision Health Minister Jens Spahn said he “very much regretted.”
Italy, the original epicenter of the disease in Europe, has also experienced an uptick in infections but a less pronounced one than in nations like Britain, France and Spain.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte may convene a cabinet meeting Saturday to consider new curbs, though that would not include a French-style curfew, according to an official who asked not to be identified.
The government is weighing new restrictions with a panel of medical and scientific advisers, and is urging regional leaders to impose localized measures agreed with the health ministry, another official said.
In Spain, bars and restaurants are set to be closed down in the Catalonia region around Barcelona, while in Austria, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz attempted to channel what he called the “team spirit” citizens showed during the first wave of infections in the spring.
The government has scheduled a meeting with the country’s nine provinces on Monday to decide how to reduce social contacts and avoid a second lockdown, Kurz said Friday."

The world’s most indebted real estate company said it’s exploring various ways to repay its HK$18 billion ($2.3 billion) convertible bond and will consult with investors before it makes a decision, according to people familiar with the matter who attended investor meetings with Evergrande officials on Friday.
The officials told attendees that possibilities for the convertible bond include full repayment, a tender offer or an exchange offer, and later emphasized that the company has enough cash on hand to cover potential payments tied to a put option in February. The officials also said Evergrande may buy back some of its dollar bonds.
The developer’s dollar note due 2025 rose 1.2 cents on the dollar to 72.4 cents, the biggest jump in nearly three weeks, Bloomberg-compiled pricing shows. Its note due 2021 rose 0.2 cents. Other Evergrande bonds slipped, suggesting investor sentiment remains cautious.
“Though the information investors got from each call was slightly different, the ultimate message is that the company is moving in the right direction, and would discuss with investors the repayment plans it is considering,” said Agnes Wong, head of Asia credit strategy & trading desk analysts at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
Evergrande has come under intense investor scrutiny in recent weeks after fears of a cash crunch triggered a sell-off in the company’s bonds and shares. While few expect the developer to default any time soon, it’s facing pressure to pare back a $120 billion debt pile and increase cash reserves.
In one of its calls with investors on Friday, Evergrande officials said the agreement signed late last month with strategic investors to waive a January deadline on about $13 billion of repayments doesn’t include any put options.
The officials also said China’s government may roll out measures to support some developers either by the end of this month or early next month, allowing firms to swap short-term debt into long-dated obligations to keep the real estate market stable, according to the attendees, who asked not to be identified because the call was private.
Evergrande didn’t respond to a request for comment. The People’s Bank of China didn’t immediately respond to a faxed request for comment on support measures for developers.

1270,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 07:08AM ET</span>",US Futures Edge Higher; Pfizer in Focus as Earnings Continue,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher, rebounding to a degree after recent losses, as the earnings season continues and ahead of a large economic data dump.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 6 points, or 0.2%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 59 points, or 0.2%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 29 points, or 0.3%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.1% lower Thursday, while the S&P 500 index declined 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.5%. These cash indices have ended lower for the last three days.
The earnings season continues apace Friday, with Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) the largest company due. The recent addition to the Dow will look to keep a four-year streak of profit beats going. 
On the financials side, the market will hear from Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK),  State Street  (NYSE:STT) and Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG), with these companies looking to continue what has generally been a good quarter for the banking sector - at least in comparison to the previous quarter's horrow show.
Drug giant  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) will also be in focus after it said it would file for U.S. emergency approval of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate as soon as a safety milestone is achieved in the third week of November.
There is also a crowded economic data slate for investors to study Friday, particularly after Thursday’s initial jobless claims suggested the jobs market was weakening again. 
The September retail sales figure is due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), and will be studied to see if Americans are still spending freely. Economists are expecting a gain of 0.7%, not much of a change from August's 0.6%. Also coming on the economic data front are September’s industrial production figures and October’s consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan.
These numbers are likely to further emphasize the need for additional fiscal stimulus, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are scheduled to talk again Friday. 
President Donald Trump said Thursday he was willing to go bigger than the $1.8 trillion already proposed, but a larger coronavirus deal is likely to meet with resistance from members of Trump’s party in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Oil prices weakened Friday amid continued concerns about stagnating demand given the surge in Covid-19 cases. Also of concern is the idea that more supply could hit the market, as OPEC experts gave no indication that an increase in output of nearly 2 million barrels a day, scheduled for the start of next year, will be postponed.
Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration released on Thursday showed a 3.818 million-barrel draw in crude oil supplies last week, but this did little to alleviate the gloom.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $40.52 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.2% to $42.66.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% at $1,912.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1721.

1272,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>",Wall Street bank trading boom does little to assuage concerns about lending,"By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Wall Street banks reported quarterly results this week, investors wondered about the staying power of the trading bonanza that has floated profits, offsetting problems in traditional lending businesses that have been hurt by the pandemic.
Trading revenue was up 4% to 29% at the five U.S. banks with major trading operations. Otherwise, lower interest rates hit lending income and prompted banks to add to loan-loss reserves.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) benefited most, because they do not have the lending operations of rivals like JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) or  Citigroup  Inc (N:C).
Enthusiasm about trading revenue among bank shareholders has faded since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when the businesses were shown to be black boxes of risk-taking that could generate huge losses. Later, banks' trading revenue fell dramatically because of new regulations and clients avoiding profitable products they once peddled.
Now, trading businesses tend to move in line with market trends or with a bank's strengths rather than with taking home-run risks. It remained hard to tell why, exactly, Bank of America might experience a 2.5% gain in bond trading whereas Morgan Stanley saw a 35% increase.
As a result, investors put less weight on those results and more weight on areas that generate consistent income from loan payments or fees.
""I don't think investors typically pay a lot for positive trading results because they know that there's a natural ebb and flow,"" said Patrick Kaser, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global.
Strength in trading rarely triggers investors to buy bank stocks because it is so ephemeral, Kaser said.
Goldman Sachs, for instance, currently trades at only 0.9 times the value of the assets on its books, compared with the industry average of 1.2 times, according to Refinitiv data.
Shifting values in stock and bond markets have helped banks make hay as clients moved portfolios around infection rates, policymakers' reactions to it, a possible vaccine and news like U.S. President Donald Trump becoming infected. Nasdaq cash equities volumes are up nearly 50% this year through Sept. 30 from 2019.
The volatility is expected to last into next year as the Nov. 3 U.S. election could roil markets, as could the possibility of a contested outcome. Other factors include the pandemic and more mundane changes like phasing out the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor), a reference rate for more than $200 trillion of financial contracts. As Libor is replaced in 2021, it could lead to disruptions.
Analyst estimates suggest banks will grow profits next year, in part reflecting an expectation that the economic backdrop will return to normal. However, bank executives have cited a range of factors that could result in helter-skelter markets.
""There's so much uncertainty,"" said Devin Ryan, an analyst with JMP Securities.
Industry consultant Greenwich Associates expects volatility to continue through the election cycle, but it has already subsided from the spring, said senior analyst Shane Swanson.

""Periods of enhanced volatility come in cyclical waves,"" he said. ""We've seen that before.""

HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Escalating anti-government protests in Thailand could push one of this year's worst performing stock markets even lower, some investors fear, as political instability adds another layer of risk to an already fragile tourism-dependent economy.
Thai stocks (SETI) were Asia's worst performers this week, down 2.6%, as protests hit the capital Bangkok where tens of thousands of people defied a ban on demonstrations. (SO)
Thailand has already suffered a record $8.8 billion in equity outflows over the first nine months of this year, exchange data shows, as the COVID-19 pandemic wrecks the travel-exposed economy and finance and industry-heavy stock index.
""The main thing is that it will add to the already negative sentiment,"" said Jeep Chatikavanij, founder of the Ton Poh Fund which manages $150 million. ""The Thai market is in a slow death towards irrelevancy, the protests are just one more thing.""
The protesters have for months been seeking to remove Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, and to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
Prayuth has vowed to stay on and this week issued an emergency decree, prohibiting gatherings of more than five people.

At the same time the economy has suffered its biggest contraction in 22 years, the stock market has dropped 22% since the start of the year and, due partly to a lagging currency  it is among the worst performers globally in dollar terms.
That the baht has held up this week shows that at least some faith in a longer-term recovery remains.
""Resurgence of the anti-government protests is concerning and suggests downside pressure in the short term, as well as a higher risk premium in Thai stocks than its Asian peers,"" said Nader Naeimi, AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital's head of dynamic markets.
However, he does not think the present instability will derail the Southeast Asian country's recovery prospects.

""For anyone who doesn't believe global tourism is dead forever, Thai stocks are a great bet on a post COVID world and an eventual return to travel and leisure activities.""

1276,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>","Analysis: Sales of first big COVID-19 drug, remdesivir, may disappoint","By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - Investors betting on big profits from COVID-19 treatments may get an unwelcome surprise when  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD) reports quarterly results this month. Its remdesivir, the first important coronavirus treatment, has not been used as much as first expected and faces complex insurance reimbursement issues.
Its best hope may be that the United States and other Northern Hemisphere governments concerned about a winter spike in cases are beginning to stockpile the antiviral drug, which is also being tested in combination with experimental COVID-19 antibody therapies. 
Remdesivir has become the standard of care for patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. But many doctors remain wary of using it more widely, raising questions about lofty analyst sales forecasts for a drug that could eventually be eclipsed by newer treatments.
The World Health Organization on Thursday said its international trial of COVID-19 therapies found that remdesivir did not have a substantial effect on patients’ length of hospital stay or chances of survival. The study has not been reviewed by outside experts.
Gilead, whose shares have fallen 22% since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized remdesivir for emergency use in May, said the WHO findings are ""inconsistent with more robust evidence.""
The company struggled to meet early demand and gave away around 250,000 courses earlier in the pandemic, when remdesivir was the only treatment proven to shorten hospital stays for severely ill patients.
Since then, low-cost steroids have demonstrated an ability to cut death risk in severely ill COVID-19 patients, and doctors question the medical value of using remdesivir for moderately-ill patients.
Wall Street forecast $2.5 billion in worldwide sales of remdesivir this year, according to Refinitiv. However, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversaw the drug's second-quarter distribution, said hospitals only bought 32% of 500,000 available courses - worth about $500 million at $3,120 per course.
The European Union in July purchased 30,000 courses worth another $74 million. The EU recently contracted for 500,000 remdesivir courses over the next six months, but the deal does not require purchases.
Gilead sells and licenses remdesivir to most of the world but is expected to get the vast majority of revenue from the United States and Europe.
Johanna Mercier, Gilead's chief commercial officer, acknowledged that ""hospitalization rates were much lower than originally predicted."" 
""A lot of people were worried about the supply and wanted to keep remdesivir for their worst-case patients,"" she said.
She declined in an interview to discuss Gilead's sales expectations, but said some of the excess U.S. supply was soaked up by HHS for stockpiling, and some was diverted to Europe.
The drug accounts for a fraction of Gilead's product sales, which totaled $21.7 billion in 2019. But the company in July raised its 2020 outlook, implying remdesivir sales of up to $3 billion, according to analysts. 
REIMBURSEMENT POLICY
Public health authorities have said that COVID-19 patients are not being denied drugs because of cost, but U.S. hospital incentives are complex.
Most commercial insurers as well as Medicare, the federal health plan for seniors, pay hospitals a flat per-patient rate for care, based on diagnosis. That creates an incentive to ""avoid keeping people in the hospital,"" and makes a drug that shortens stays cost effective, said Richard Trembowicz, healthcare reimbursement specialist at ECG Management Consultants. 
Medicare in March approved a 20% increase in its payment for hospital stays related to COVID-19 but does not reimburse directly for remdesivir, which costs $3,120 for a five-day course, or $2,340 for government purchasers. 
U.S. hospitals say the cost is not influencing clinical decisions.
""The price is not outrageous enough,"" said Katherine Perez, infectious disease pharmacist at Houston Methodist Hospital. ""We are hoping it is getting patients out of the hospital sooner.""
But, she added, ""I don't think the data supports using it in more mild infections."" 
Still, the FDA in August expanded its remdesivir authorization to include patients with less-severe illness.
""I would use it in an elderly person or someone on a drug that suppresses the immune system,"" said Dr. Rajesh Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. ""For a 30-year-old doing well it would be less likely.""
Gilead's Mercier said reserving remdesivir for patients who need oxygen ""is not necessarily the best use"" of the drug, since antivirals may work best early in an infection, before a virus has reproduced enough to cause damage.
The drug, which failed as a treatment for Ebola, is designed to prevent viruses from replicating and overwhelming their host's immune system.

Meanwhile, Gilead is moving ahead with remdesivir development, including testing an inhaled formulation to see if it could help non-hospitalized patients.

1277,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>","Exclusive: India's JK Tyre, other firms face antitrust scrutiny in bid-rigging case","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's antitrust regulator is investigating  JK Tyre & Industries  Ltd (NS:JKIN) after a state government accused the company of bid rigging, and the probe has been expanded to other firms, according to sources and legal filings seen by Reuters.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) last year ordered a probe after the northern state of Haryana said JK Tyre employed unfair trade practices while bidding to supply tyres for public transport vehicles, a court filing showed.
The case details and CCI's initial assessment were contained in a Sept. 19 state court filing made by JK Tyre contesting some of the watchdog's demands. The filing, reviewed by Reuters, has not previously been reported and the CCI does not disclose current probes into cartel cases.
According to documents in the filing, Haryana state told the CCI that JK Tyre was the sole bidder in a tender and quoted high prices. The watchdog in November ordered a probe saying ""non-participation by other tyre manufacturers"" was suggestive of a ""concerted act to rig the bid"".
A JK Tyre spokesman declined to comment ""as the matter is currently subjudice.""
In August this year, the CCI decided the role of other tyre firms should be examined and expanded its scrutiny to include  Apollo Tyres  (NS:APLO), CEAT (NS:CEAT),  MRF  (NS:MRF), and the Indian units of France's  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and Germany's  Continental AG  (DE:CONG), two sources familiar with the case said. 
It was not immediately clear whether the CCI has approached those tyre firms with inquiries.
The sources declined to be identified as details of the probe were confidential. The CCI and the Haryana state government did not respond to requests for comments. MRF, Michelin and Continental also did not respond to requests for comments, while CEAT and Apollo declined to comment.
A finding of bid-rigging could lead to a potential fine of up to three times the profit in each year prices were fixed by the companies, or 10% of annual revenue, whichever is higher. 
JK Tyre, which has a market value of $190 million, says it accounts for 30-36% of the market for different types of tyre variants that is worth some $9 billion annually.
""EMAIL DUMPS""
Haryana state has alleged JK Tyre was the sole bidder in the tender in 2018 and its prices were around 34% higher than previous purchase rates, the documents show.
""There appears to be some arrangement or understanding amongst the tyre manufacturers ... The matter warrants a thorough and detailed investigation to unearth the entire modus operandi resorted to,"" the CCI's Nov. 2019 order said.
As part of the probe, the CCI this year sought ""email dumps"" over five years belonging to some senior executives in the JK group, saying they were essential for the investigation. 
JK Tyre has challenged that demand at the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, saying it was cooperating with the investigation and the emails of those executives had limited or no relation to the case.
The watchdog's probe team was ""acting in a completely unreasonable, arbitrary and whimsical manner"", JK Tyre said in the Sept. 19 filing.
The court will next hear the case on Oct. 28.

1279,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 05:46AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Daimler Returns to Profit in Style,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The last hurrah of summer or the start of a sustained turnaround?
 Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF), the maker of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, returned to profit in style in the third quarter, according to preliminary results released Friday, as the world economy reopened after the coronavirus-driven lockdowns of spring.
The company sold more of its products, sweated its assets harder and squeezed costs, to generate over 5.1 billion euros in free cash flow from its industrial operations. The market had expected less than 3 billion. The recovery was impressively broad: the cars, vans and truck divisions all posted healthy profits before interest and taxes.
In addition, the company drew a thumping 1.2 billion euro dividend from its Chinese operations.
To cap it all, the company said it expects the positive momentum to carry on into the fourth quarter, after seeing a particularly strong September. Detailed guidance for the year, however, will have to wait until the group publishes its audited results next Friday.
Daimler (DE:DAIGn) is unlikely to be the last European carmaker to make such an announcement: the results come on a day when European auto registrations posted their first year-on-year gain in 2020, in another sign that the worst of the pandemic has probably passed.  The STOXX 600 Autos & Parts index rose 2.1% in response.
But while that’s optically pleasing, anything less would have represented something little short of disaster at the industry, given that lockdowns squeezed almost all of the second quarter’s sales into the three months between July and September.
Daimler said it “has seen a faster than expected market recovery and a particularly strong September performance.”
However, its forecast of continued growth in the fourth quarter was qualified by the assumption that there are no fresh lockdowns across Europe. That’s still very much in the balance.
Although the accelerating spread of Covid-19 will dent consumer and business confidence, there are good reasons for optimism: two weeks into the fourth quarter, car dealerships haven’t yet been affected by the tightening of restrictions on gatherings across most of the continent, which have fallen squarely on the hospitality industry; moreover, politicians are determined to avoid shutting down factories again, and the companies have used the summer to hone safe working practices.
One can quibble about Daimler’s sales mix – its announcement earlier this month that it’s accelerating the transition to electric vehicles merely acknowledges that it’s still behind the curve in that regard.
But the evidence of solid cash generation - at a level that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), with seven times Daimler's market cap, can only dream of - vindicates the stock’s bounce from oversold levels in March: it’s now more than doubled since then, and it rose 3.7% on Friday’s numbers to test its highest level since January  (although it failed to make a new post-pandemic high). It still remains cheap on a historical perspective at barely 11 times trailing earnings.

1280,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",France plans $23 billion state-backed scheme to avert company failures,"By Leigh Thomas
PARIS (Reuters) - France plans to raise 20 billion euros ($23 billion) in quasi-equity loans for small firms hit by the coronavirus crisis by offering investors a state guarantee against the first 2 billion euros in losses, officials said.
Fearing failures among firms which were already saddled with record levels of debt before the crisis, the French government wants the programme up and running by early next year as it battles the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Under plans to be presented to the financial sector on Monday, banks would first lend to small and mid-sized firms and then sell on 90% of the loans to institutional investors, people familiar with the proposals told Reuters.
That would limit banks' risk exposure to 10% of the loans, while also steering funds to viable firms.
Since a public guarantee is involved, EU state aid regulators have to give the programme their blessing, particularly the interest rate that would be charged.
""The discussion is going well, the European Commission is very interested in the programme, but we haven't landed on a precise number yet,"" a finance ministry source said.
The interest rate is unlikely to be less than 3%-5% since the loans would be junior to other debt on firms' balance sheets, another source familiar with the discussions said.
BANKRUPTCY WAVE?
With maturities of at least seven years and subordinate to other creditors' claims, the loans would have the advantage of not counting as debt on balance sheets, freeing up resources for operations and investment, critical for an economic recovery.
While French law already allows such loans, they are rarely used because banks have until now had to set aside more capital to cover the bigger risks they entail.
With cashflows crimped by the crisis, the French Treasury and central bank estimate that small and mid-sized businesses will need a total of up to 20 billion euros in equity capital.
However, firms may collectively be undercapitalised by as much as 30 billion euros, Euler Hermes, which as a credit insurer closely tracks corporate balance sheets, estimates.
Starting with more than 120 billion euros in state-guaranteed bank loans to help firms with their immediate cashflow needs, government measures to keep them afloat have so-far staved off a wave of bankruptcies.
Corporate bankruptcies have fallen to levels not seen since 1989, research firm Altares said. 
However, three out of four bankruptcy cases that went before the French courts in the third quarter have led to liquidation, which Altares said could be a prelude to a surge in filings, especially in the first quarter of 2021.

1281,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 05:40AM ET</span>",Big Four auditors' fees boosted by continued UK blue-chip dominance,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The world's Big Four accounting firms increased earnings from their dominance of UK blue-chip audits last year, the sector's regulator said on Friday, indicating that efforts to improve competition have made little headway.
Lawmakers have long called for more competition in auditing, but actual reforms have been patchy to date despite three government-sponsored reports considering the issue since the collapse of retailer BHS and builder Carillion.
All of the companies listed on the FTSE 100 index were audited by Deloitte, PwC, EY or KPMG in 2019, with combined income from auditing rising by 7%, Britain's Financial Reporting Council said.
So-called challenger auditors, which include Grant Thornton, BDO and Mazars, fared little better in the next tier down for listed companies. Only 10 companies in the FTSE 250 index were audited by firms outside the Big Four, up from nine in 2018, the FRC said.
However, the watchdog said that new curbs are taking effect, citing a 21% drop in the Big Four's fees for the more lucrative non-audit work they conduct for clients.
The curbs seek to improve auditing standards by limiting how much non-audit work can be undertaken, thereby removing a potential disincentive to auditors challenging what clients tell them.
Britain's business ministry is expected to consult publicly on how it wants to implement recommendations from the three reports aimed at improving competition and standards.
Britain's competition watchdog has proposed that audits are performed jointly by one of the Big Four and a challenger auditor, a step the FRC has rejected.
The Big Four's total fee income rose 7% last year while firms outside the dominant quartet slowed the decline in their total fee income, the FRC said.
Improving choice and resilience in the market remains a major focus, said David Rule, the FRC's executive director of supervision.

1282,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>",Column: ESG thrives in pandemic but amplifies growth-value split,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - The scramble for funds screened for Environmental, Social and Governance scores appears to be paying off in the strange pandemic-hit world of 2020 - but it may also be aggravating long-standing market skews.
On the face of it at least, ESG-themed equity funds that claim to locate more firms based on criteria such as carbon intensity, staffing diversity and shareholder control are having a good pandemic. Fund inflows are surging and performance is at least keeping pace.
Two of the myriad global indices now tracking the booming investment trend have outperformed MSCI's all-country stock index so far this year. MSCI's own ""World ESG Leaders"" has outstripped the all-country by about 2% while the FTSE Russell FTSE4Good Developed 100 outpaced it by 5%.
That's hardly surprising on one level. Funds set up to avoid carbon-energy firms or banks, for example, will have avoided the worst sectoral laggards in one the deepest recessions in modern history.
Amplifying that advantage, they are also typically loaded up with younger digital and technology firms that have led the stock market in recent years and have been supercharged by pandemic lockdowns, remote working and online retail.
The FTSE4Good Developed index, for example, has a 22% weighting in technology firms - not to mention a further 5% in telecoms and media and a hefty 13% in healthcare. And perhaps predictably, its top three holdings - amounting to a whopping 15% of overall weight - are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
All its stock in oil & gas, basic resources, banks and travel & leisure sectors comes to a little over 10%.
Paul Surguy, head of investment management at UK fund firm Kingswood, reckons a world working from home and a collapse in global travel was always going to flatter carbon-light portfolios.
""Couple this with an ever-increasing use of technology, which is primarily lower-carbon intensive, and one can see why the E of ESG has driven market returns year to date,"" he said.
But while an outperformance against the MSCI all-country is impressive, the index has done no better than the S&P500 and has underperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq by over 20%.
To be fair, stretch timeframes back over one or two years and it does beat S&P500, and outperformance per se is not strictly the sole goal of these funds.
FACTOR BIAS
But a question for many strategists is whether the ESG boom is itself perpetuating sectoral skews within stock markets that have seen the market laggards such as banks - or so-called ""value"" stocks persistently shy of historical valuations - underperform growth stocks like the runaway success of Big Tech.
Morningstar data shows that almost 200 global large-cap ESG equity funds in Europe had an average tech exposure of 23% in August - up some four percentage points from January.
Looking more narrowly at European climate-specific funds, research into five such funds by investment analysis firm Style Analytics showed a bias toward small-cap, higher-volatility and momentum stocks and away from value and yield.
""Someone who buys these climate funds is getting a factor bias, whether or not they know it and whether or not they want it,"" the report concluded.
The report underlines that the ESG trend has been yet another force exaggerating the persistent and gap between value and growth stocks.
""Beyond the falling bond yields and the widening profitability dispersion across European sectors, we believe the rapid rise of ESG investing has also contributed to the Growth/Value polarisation,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) strategists wrote.
""Demand for 'ESG-compliant' stocks is growing fast, and while overall equity flows have been mostly negative for the past two years, ESG funds have seen record inflows,"" they said, adding that the share of ESG funds in total Europe equity funds assets under management had almost tripled to 9% since early 2019.
Some say the total amounts of money involved in ESG are still just too small to make a decisive difference to the outperformance of Big Tech with market caps in the trillions.
But the scale of the growth in these funds is significant on the margins at least. Using EPFR data, Barclays shows cumulative inflows to ESG-labelled equity funds so far this year has topped $100 billion already - almost 20% up on last year.
ESG funds as a share of the overall universe have more than doubled in fewer than three years to about 3.5% of all equity funds and about 5% of all global funds.
Many asset managers who have watched a doubling of Big Tech share prices in just 12 months are itching to rotate sectors - not least with the gap between the growth and value stocks' share of the MSCI World at its widest since 2000.
But the growth of ESG funds - along with central banks and a second wave of the pandemic - continue to act against that.
What tips the balance? A vaccine to ""normalise"" the economy? Or a Democratic victory at the U.S. election and a European push to hasten a clampdown on Big Tech's dominance with tax and antitrust concerns that question their S and G in ESG?

(Reuters) - European shares bounced from two-week lows on Friday but were still set for weekly losses after a sell-off that was marked by fears of a second wave of COVID-19 infections, Brexit-related uncertainty and doubts about more U.S. fiscal stimulus.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was up 0.9% after posting its worst session in more than three weeks on Thursday.
Auto stocks (SXAP) jumped 2.9% after  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volvo (ST:VOLVb) posted stronger-than-expected results.
A resurgence in coronavirus cases across Europe has stoked fears about more sweeping lockdowns, with London and Paris - Europe's two richest cities - again living under the shadow of state-imposed restrictions.
""This raises the very real fear that what is a stop-gap measure actually turns out to be something slightly longer term, which could see the collapse of hundreds of businesses as well as the decimation of an already fragile economy,"" said Michael Hewson, market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
Focus on Friday will be on signs of progress in Brexit negotiations, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson set to give Britain's response to the European Union's demand that he either gives more concessions to secure a trade deal or braces for a disorderly Brexit in three months.
London's FTSE 100 (FTSE) rose 1.2%, but was still on course to snap a two-week gaining streak. (L)
The benchmark STOXX 600 was also headed for its first weekly decline in three as demand for equities globally was dented by mixed signals on whether Washington would agree on more fiscal stimulus before the Nov. 3 presidential election.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he was willing to raise his offer of $1.8 trillion for a deal with Democrats in Congress, but the idea was shot down by his fellow Republican, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
""The market's on-again-off-again love affair with impending stimulus masks the fact that uncertainty is bristling ahead of an expected choppy period,"" said Stephen Innes, markets strategist at Axi.
In company news, Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) surged 15.8% as a report said privately held Liberty Steel Group is set to bid for the ailing steel unit of the company as soon as Friday.
LVMH (PA:LVMH) jumped 6.8% as recovering sales of Louis Vuitton handbags helped it contain the fallout from the coronavirus crisis in the third quarter.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Friday, helped by positive corporate news from index heavyweights Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and LVMH (PA:LVMH), but overall sentiment remains weak with investors anxious over the economic impact of the second wave of the Covid-19 virus.
At 3:35 AM ET (0735 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.2%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 1.2%.
European stock indices have rebounded to a degree after posting their largest losses in more than three weeks on Thursday. Helping that bounce Friday has been some strong earnings from European corporate heavyweights.
Daimler stock rose 4.2% after the German carmaker posted forecast-beating third-quarter results late Thursday, and Volvo (ST:VOLVb) stock rose 1.5% after the Swedish truck maker also impressed in the quarter.
More broadly, new car registrations in the European Union increased in September, their first rise in year-on-year terms in 2020.
There were also gains elsewhere. LVMH (PA:LVMH) stock surged 6.8% after the luxury fashion conglomerate reported strong growth at its biggest brands in the third quarter, while  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) stock gained 1% after acquiring a majority stake in Champagne house J. de Telmont.
That said, Europe seems to be losing the fight to keep their economies open as the Covid-19 virus spreads. Starting this weekend, Londoners will be banned from mixing with other households, and residents of Paris and other major French cities face a curfew for four weeks.
Also weighing is the idea of Brexit turning disorderly after the EU expressed concerns by a lack of progress in the talks between the two parties and called on London to make concessions. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to give Britain's response later Friday.
Oil prices weakened Friday amid continued concerns about stagnating demand as a spike in Covid-19 cases in Europe and the United States hits economic activity in two of the world's biggest fuel consuming regions.
At the same time, a meeting Thursday of a technical committee of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied oil producers, a group known as OPEC+, did little to allay fears that these major producers will move ahead with plans to ease their supply cuts despite the tepid demand.
OPEC+ is set to reduce its current supply cuts of 7.7 million barrels per day by 2 million barrels a day in January.
Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration released on Thursday showed a 3.818 million-barrel draw in crude oil supplies last week, but this did little to alleviate the gloom.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $40.65 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.8% to $42.81.

The Hong Kong stock exchange has scheduled an Ant hearing for as soon as next week, pending an approval from the Chinese securities watchdog, a requirement for companies conducting dual listings in China and Hong Kong, people familiar said. Ant and the Hong Kong bourse declined to comment in emailed statements.
The Hong Kong hearing before a 28-member panel of external professionals has been expected for weeks but has yet to happen. If it’s delayed much further, the IPO risks straddling the Nov. 3 U.S. election where some expect a surge in postal ballots to create prolonged uncertainty. The one-week gap in Hong Kong between the pricing of an IPO and the start of trading means investors would be left exposed to an increase in volatility.
The Trump administration is exploring restrictions on Ant, as well as rival Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd., over concerns that their digital payment platforms threaten U.S. national security.
Trump’s ban on Tencent’s WeChat in the U.S. is facing push back. A magistrate judge said this week she’s unlikely to allow the country to implement prohibitions on Wechat while the government appeals her earlier ruling.
Ant said it’s making progress in getting the required approvals for its IPO in Shanghai and Hong Kong, following reports that it has yet to receive a green light from the Chinese securities watchdog.
Ant has added  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, ICBC International and BOC International to its list of joint book runners for the Hong Kong sale, people familiar said. That’s in addition to China International Capital Corp, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) acting as sponsors and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG acting as joint global coordinator for the Hong Kong leg.
Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte is planning to invest more than $1 billion in Ant’s Hong Kong and Shanghai IPO, people familiar have said. The listing is also drawing interest from other existing investors like Temasek Holdings Pte and the National Council for Social Security Fund, they said.

1289,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 02:18AM ET</span>",Europe Car Sales Rise 1.1% in Surprise First Gain of the Year,"(Bloomberg) -- Automakers eked out a surprise sales increase last month in Europe, the first advance this year for a region still struggling with a patchy recovery reliant on government subsidies.
New-car registrations rose 1.1% in September, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said Friday. Sales gained in Italy and Germany -- two of the major countries offering incentives to support electric-vehicle purchases -- and offset still-slumping demand in Spain and France.
Keeping the momentum going in the last few months of the year will be a challenge. Leaders in the U.K., Germany, Italy and France are struggling to cope with record new Covid-19 cases. Targeted strategies to slow the spread of the disease are being used for now before resorting to the kind of broad national lockdowns that decimated car sales earlier this year.
“We’d argue consumers don’t share automakers’ revival hopes,” Michael Dean, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a note ahead of the industry’s sales report. He expects annual deliveries to decline at least 20% and sees risk that the drop will be worse because of coronavirus-related restriction measures.
Europe’s car sales are still down 29% for the year through September. After deliveries cratered in March and April, automakers pared declines the following three months, then suffered a setback in August.
Germany’s car market expanded last month for the first time this year, as subsidies for battery-powered vehicles more than quadrupled sales of plug-in hybrid and battery-electric models. But while total registrations rose 8.4% there, Spain saw a 13% drop despite also offering incentives toward EVs.
Western Europe was the worst-performing region this year through August for Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), the top-selling automaker both in the region and globally. Still, with a recovery on solid footing in China, Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess said VW’s monthly orders and deliveries were up as September came to a close. He sees the positive trend continuing into the fourth quarter.
“It needs to be seen how much of the currently strong sales momentum is pent-up demand, how much is cyclical and what’s related to ‘the reincarnation of the car,’” Arndt Ellinghorst, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.’s European auto analyst, wrote in an Oct. 1 report. He predicted recovering deliveries, low inventories and strong pricing will drive “remarkable near-term earnings momentum” for BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), with VW also benefiting.

1290,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>",China's turbo-charged online fashion takes on Zara and H&M,"By Sonya Dowsett and Sophie Yu
MADRID/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Shein may be the biggest shopping site you've never heard of. 
The fast-fashion player is encroaching on the territory of more established rivals like Zara and H&M. It has become the largest, purely online, fashion company in the world measured by sales of self-branded products, according to Euromonitor. 
Nanjing-based Shein, founded in 2008, is aiming squarely at the ""Gen Z"" social-media generation, using influencers on Instagram and TikTok, and discount codes, to attract younger shoppers in an increasingly crowded fashion market.
It offers low-cost styles, uploading hundreds of new designs to its app every week. The price for a dress is around half that of Zara, according to a recent Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) price survey.
""You can save money, which is important when buying clothes as the fashions change so quickly,"" said Rebeca Rondon, a 23-year-old student in Valencia, Spain, whose Instagram page compares dozens of styles from Shein and Zara head-to-head.
The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted online sales at retailers, giving online-only players like Shein, Britain's Asos (L:ASOS) and Germany's Zalando (DE:ZALG) an edge over Inditex-owned Zara (MC:ITX) and H&M (ST:HMb) which have big city-centre stores. 
In September, the Shein app saw 10.3 million downloads globally from across the App Store and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Play, Sensor Tower data shows. In comparison, H&M's mobile app hit about 2.5 million, and Zara saw 2 million. 
To date, Shein has reached 229.4 million downloads, versus H&M's 123.5 million and Zara's 90.6 million, the data shows.
In the week of Sep. 27-Oct. 3, Shein was the most downloaded shopping app globally on iPhones, according to analytics platform App Annie. It ranked in the top 10 in the United States, Brazil, Australia, Britain and Saudi Arabia.
Privately-owned Shein, which also sells on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), does not publicly disclose sales or other financial figures. The company did not respond to emails or phone calls. 
It has backing from investors including IDG Capital and Sequoia Capital China, according to PitchBook capital market data. The funds did not respond to interview requests.
 Inditex  and H&M declined to comment for this story.
UNKNOWN QUANTITY?
Although Shein is gaining more followers, it has limited visibility compared with the likes of Zara and H&M. It has no domestic presence in China, where online shoppers go to  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Taobao and to  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) for clothes at bargain prices. 
Meanwhile, some consumers say the quality of items can be variable and delivery times erratic.
Unlike Zara and H&M, which have detailed background on the sourcing of their clothing and the working conditions of employees on their websites and annual reports, Shein gives no details about the manufacture of its products. 
Inditex revolutionised the fashion industry in the 1990s by responding quickly to trends and speeding designs to stores using factories close to its headquarters in Spain.
Shein also works with hundreds of factories in close proximity to its Nanjing HQ, according to a China-based industry source with knowledge of the company's business practices.
The Chinese company aims to get designs ready for shipping in three days, according to the source who wanted to remain anonymous because of sensitive business practices.
Three days is a significant compression of Inditex's lead time, from drawing board to store, which is around 3 weeks according to the Spanish company.
AMBASSADOR'S CODE
Nonetheless Shein faces a tough task to make inroads in a crowded online market where both Asos and Zalando have reported surges in sales this year. 
One way Shein is looking to grab attention is though a network of influencers and ""brand ambassadors"". 
""I have to promote the outfits on my social-media platforms,"" says Laura Illanes, a 22-year-old student at the University of South Carolina Upstate.
""They provide me with a discount code of 15% off - I need to share that with my followers,"" said Illanes, a college athlete with 36,000 Instagram followers, who gets six free Shein items per month in return for promoting the clothes on her account. 
Inditex and H&M have also reported big jumps in online sales, but that's a minority proportion of their overall sales. Shares in both have fallen over 20% since early February, which analysts have partly attributed to their big networks of stores. 
Hong Kong-based fund Anatole Investment Management presented the idea of a short sell on Inditex due to the rise of the ""new breed"" of online players from China at the Sohn investor conference streamed from Hong Kong on Sept. 9.

""Zara is a legacy player which is going to be crushed by fast fashion 2.0,"" Anatole Chief Investment Officer George Yang, who declined to be interviewed, told attendees.

1291,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 02:06AM ET</span>",European Stocks Seen Higher For Now; Sentiment Weak,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen edging higher at the open Friday, partially rebounding after sharp losses in the previous session. Gains could be short-lived though, with investors anxious over the economic impact of the second wave of the Covid-19 virus as well as the ongoing Brexit talks.
At 2:10 AM ET (0610 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.8%. 
European stock indices posted their largest losses in more than three weeks on Thursday, with the pan-Europe Stoxx Europe 600 index largely erasing all its gains for October and dropping the most since Sept. 21.
Friday is likely to see a small bounce, but European equities have generally lost momentum as the pandemic, an impasse in U.S. stimulus talks and the potential for the U.K’s trade negotiations with the European Union to end badly weigh on investor confidence.
Europe seems to be losing the fight to keep their economies open as the Covid-19 virus spreads. Starting this weekend, Londoners will be banned from mixing with other households, and residents of Paris and other major French cities face a curfew for four weeks.
Additionally, although German Chancellor Angela Merkel reported ""some movement"" on Thursday in talks between European Union leaders about a potential Brexit agreement, the two sides have barely made any progress this week and time is running very short.
In corporate news, German carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn)r is likely to be in focus Friday after it posted forecast-beating third-quarter results late on Thursday, citing a faster-than-expected market recovery and strong business in September.
LVMH (PA:LVMH) said strong growth at its biggest fashion brands buoyed revenue in the third quarter, partly offsetting steep declines in other segments of the luxury group that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.
Oil prices weakened Friday amid continued concerns about stagnating demand as a spike in Covid-19 cases in Europe and the United States hits economic activity in two of the world's biggest fuel consuming regions.
At the same time, a meeting Thursday of a technical committee of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied oil producers, a group known as OPEC+, did little to allay fears that these major producers will move ahead with plans to ease their supply cuts despite the tepid demand.
OPEC+ is set to reduce its current supply cuts of 7.7 million barrels per day by 2 million barrels a day in January.
Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration released on Thursday showed a 3.818 million-barrel draw in crude oil supplies last week, but this did little to alleviate the gloom.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $40.62 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.9% to $42.78.
Elsewhere, gold futures traded flat at $1,909.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded flat at 1.1709."
1292,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 12:40AM ET</span>",Japan will not join U.S. plan to bar China from telecoms networks: Yomiuri,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan has told the United States that Tokyo will not, at the moment, join Washington's plan to exclude Chinese firms from telecommunications networks, the Yomiuri newspaper said on Friday, citing several sources. 
Japan will take its own steps to respond in case there are worries over security issue, while Tokyo will cooperate with the United States, the paper said. 
The U.S. State Department published in August an update of a plan called the ""Clean Network"" calling for telecom companies, cloud service providers, and mobile apps of Chinese origin to be kept out of the United States.
The United States is pressing allies to bar Huawei [HWT.UL] from next generation 5G mobile phone networks on security grounds. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo mentioned the ""Clean Network"" plan when he met Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi in Tokyo earlier this month, the Yomiuri said.
Japan told the United States that Tokyo cannot join a framework which excludes a specific nation but will reconsider if there is any change to the current U.S. plan, according to the report.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato, the top government spokesman, responded to the Yomiuri report by saying his understanding was there was no exchange of views on the ""Clean Network"" plan during the meeting between Pompeo and Motegi but the U.S. explained its overall cybersecurity efforts.
""Our nation wants to continue to strengthen cooperation in the area of cybersecurity with the U.S."" Kato said during a news conference on Friday.
Japan will also take steps to secure cybersecurity safety by taking steps to reduce supply chain risks when procuring information and communication equipment, he said.

1293,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",Europe Is Losing the Fight to Keep Economy Open as Virus Spreads,"(Bloomberg) -- European leaders from London to Berlin face an alarming reality: lockdowns are creeping back on the agenda as the pandemic threatens the continent again.
It’s a scenario many ruled out after the summer, when coronavirus cases were receding across Europe and borders were re-opening. A resurgence was expected but the conviction was that a targeted approach would do.
That early sense of victory has given way to disappointment, and set the stage for a deeper crisis with major cities under curfew and central governments openly clashing with local officials on the way forward.
“The hope was that the second wave would be easier to control because we know how to identify and contain clusters and keep the economy running,” said Christian Odendahl, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform. “But that has not worked in Europe.”
Thursday unleashed a fresh wave of bad news, as one country after another posted record daily infections. Hospitalization and death rates ticked up across the region.
Leaders have less leverage to fight now, having burned political capital to shut down and then prop up economies when the pandemic erupted in the spring.
Businesses are more wobbly, the public is fed up with a dizzying array of “lockdown lite” restrictions, and political opposition is no longer sitting back. There’s an ideological fight at play too between libertarians who don’t want to restrict movement and those who say safety should trump all other concerns, including the economy.
It’s a much harder balance to strike this time round. For Jamie Rush of Bloomberg Economics “doing too little to contain the spread could easily end up costing more than a short national lockdown.”
Even a Two-Week U.K. Lockdown May Not Be Enough, Officials Fear
Spain’s Socialist government is battling with center-right authorities in Madrid, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is beset on all sides. His handling of the pandemic is costing him support in northern England, where he made rare gains in last year’s election. Now, it’s among the most affected regions in the U.K.
Even Chancellor Angela Merkel -- Europe’s queen of crises -- failed to prod Germany’s state leaders to accept tougher measures during an eight-hour negotiating marathon this week.
All this casts into doubt any rebound from the region’s worst recession in living memory. It will force governments to increase spending, further squeezing public finances. Central banks, which have deployed unprecedented stimulus, are gearing up to do more.
Europe’s initial strategy was a shock treatment that suspended personal liberties to get back to some type of normal as soon as possible. It seemed to be working. Job losses had been kept in check, thanks to generous stimulus packages.
But authorities, despite bulking up on testing, failed to enforce hygiene restrictions or self-isolation rules after lifting lockdowns. Over the summer, people traveled and brought the virus back home. The spread has accelerated as cooler weather forces people indoors, setting the stage for a winter of toil.
Outbreaks have spurred a new round of curbs. Starting this weekend, Londoners will be banned from mixing with other households, and residents of Paris and other major French cities will be confined to their homes at night for four weeks
Fear Factor
Even if restrictions don’t have a huge direct impact on economic activity, the associated fear factor could hurt spending.
Kate Nicholls, chief executive of U.K. Hospitality, the industry body for a wide range of leisure businesses, described the situation as being “trapped in a no man’s land of being open, but with severe restrictions that will significantly hit custom.”
The rise in cases has also alarmed scientists pressing for more stringent policies.
In the U.K., public-health experts have called for a “circuit-breaker” -- a quick-fire shutdown of businesses and social contact to coincide with a school break. Even there, the concern is that it’s too late to make an impact.
Meanwhile, various attempts to control the virus are breaking down, with testing and tracking systems in danger of becoming overwhelmed.
The Czech Republic -- the worst outbreak in Europe -- is now equipping hotels and spas as emergency health facilities.
Further complicating efforts to rally people is the fact that there’s no end in sight. A vaccine won’t likely be widely available before well into 2021, and public unrest is flickering.
In the southern Italian town of Arzano, a lockdown that closed all shops except those selling the essentials prompted several dozen shopkeepers to block a main road, joining other protests across the region. In the region surrounding Naples, schools are reportedly shutting down until the end of the month.
Any leader observing how compliance is breaking down has to wonder what tools, if any, they have left.

This week, U.S. automotive component maker Joyson Safety Systems (JSS) said it was investigating inaccuracies in the reporting of belt webbing test data over a 20-year period at the Japanese factory in Hikone it acquired from Takata in 2018. It said the inaccuracies arose before its acquisition.
""We are still investigating the matter and can't say yet how many seat belts were involved,"" an official in charge of recalls at Japan's transport ministry told Reuters.
The result of the investigation will be shared with transport authorities in other countries, the official added on condition of anonymity as the probe is still ongoing. 
A Joyson representative in Japan did not immediately respond to a Reuters request from comment. The Michigan-based firm took over what was left of Takata after it went out of business.
Takata was embroiled in one Japan's worst corporate scandals in recent years after admitting it fabricated faulty airbag inflators that could explode and send metal shrapnel into vehicle compartments. 
The faulty product was linked to numerous deaths and triggered one of the industry's biggest safety recalls.
Takata in 2017 pleaded guilty to criminal wrongdoing, saying it submitted false inflator test results to automaker clients.
JSS Japan is the top seat belt maker in the country with a market share of about 40%, as well as just under 30% globally, according to Nikkei.

Investing.com – Asian markets were mixed on Friday morning, with ever-rising COVID-19 cases the main driver. China is also to bring in new national security export laws, causing investor uncertainty.
China is to promulgate a new national security law controlling what it deems to be sensitive exports. The new law is likely to take a similar form to that of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Entity List, whereby certain companies and entities are prohibited from receiving certain technologies and strategic materials.
The exact mechanics of this law are yet to be public, and investors are uncertain as to quite how it will affect international trade. Companies are wary about how they will deal with the competing national interests of China and the U.S.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.31% at 11:09 PM ET (3:09 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Composite fell 0.47%.
In Australia, the SS&P/ASX 200 was down 0.32% and in South Korea, the KOSPI fell 0.58%, after a quick opening fall and rally.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.72%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 returned to parity after an early fall, inching up 0.03%.
The U.S. COVID-19 stimulus response once again produced uncertainty in markets, with yet another offer from U.S. President Donald Trump. However, few investors are expecting a deal to passed before the Nov. 3 elections. The new deal is larger than previous offers, giving some investors confidence in the size of the final package.
A rise in U.S. jobless claims also gave cause for concern about economic recovery. 898,000 Americans claimed unemployment over the past week, higher than the 825,000 claims forecast and hitting a two-month high.
“The market’s on again off again love affair with an impending stimulus torrent masks the fact that investor uncertainty is bristling ahead of an expected choppy period in terms of headline risk, including Brexit, the U.S. election, and perhaps the most horrifying troubles of all, the second wave of the coronavirus that could trigger more intense lockdown worries,” Stephen Innes, global chief market strategist at AxiCorp, told Reuters.
COVID-19 continues to ravage the global economy, with no end in sight as global case numbers continue to rise, and a second wave strikes Europe and the U.S. Global cases have now reached 38.8 million, with deaths passing the 1.1 million mark, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
“There’s a bit of worry there and also at what we’re seeing in America and in Europe regarding the virus and how it seems to be taking hold pretty significantly again,” Grant Williamson, investment adviser at Hamilton Hindin Greene, told Reuters."

1299,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>",U.S. judge 'not inclined' to reverse decision on WeChat app store ban,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge in San Francisco on Thursday said she was ""not inclined"" to reverse her decision blocking the government from barring Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL) from offering WeChat for download in U.S. app stores.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler said at a hearing that she did not think a new filing by the Justice Department ""changes the outcome"" or changes her analysis.
Last month, Beeler issued a preliminary injunction blocking the U.S. Commerce Department order which was set to take effect late on Sept. 20 in a suit brought by WeChat users.
The Justice Department has appealed Beeler's order to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, but no ruling is likely before December.
The Commerce Department order would also bar other U.S. transactions with Tencent Holding's (HK:0700) WeChat, potentially making the app unusable in the United States.
The Justice Department argues Beeler's order ""permits the continued, unfettered use of WeChat, a mobile application that the Executive Branch has determined constitutes a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.""
The WeChat users argued the government sought ""to implement an unprecedented ban of an entire medium of communication"" and then only offered ""speculation"" of harms ""without any evidence or examples involving Americans’ use of WeChat.""
WeChat has an average of 19 million daily active users in the United States, analytics firm Apptopia said. It is popular among Chinese students, Americans living in China and some Americans who have personal or business relationships in China. 
WeChat is an all-in-one mobile app that combines services similar to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), WhatsApp, Instagram and Venmo. The app is an essential part of daily life for many in China and boasts more than 1 billion users.

In a similar case, a U.S. appeals court on Wednesday agreed to fast-track a government appeal of a ruling blocking the government from banning new TikTok downloads from U.S. app stores.

1300,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 06:18PM ET</span>",China Moves to Shield Its Own Advanced Tech in Fight With U.S.,"(Bloomberg) -- China is set to pass a new law that would restrict sensitive exports vital to national security, expanding its toolkit of policy options as competition grows with the U.S. over access to technologies that will drive the modern economy.
China’s top legislative body, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, is expected to adopt the measure in a session that concludes on Saturday. The Export Control Law primarily aims to protect China’s national security by regulating the export of sensitive materials and technologies that appear on a control list. It would apply to all companies in China, including foreign-invested ones.
The measure would add to Beijing’s regulatory arsenal, which also includes a tech export restriction catalog and an unreliable entity list. The law would also help put China on a similar footing to the U.S., which regularly uses export controls and licenses strategically against its adversaries.
Mounting tensions between China and the U.S. have spilled over into the realm of technology. Big Chinese companies including Huawei Technologies Co., ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.’s WeChat and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. find themselves in Washington’s cross-hairs.
“Chinese authorities may have learned a lesson from the U.S. and other countries,” said Qing Ren, a partner at Global Law Office in Beijing.
A report carried by official Xinhua News Agency said the draft law stipulates that China could take reciprocical measures against a certain country or region that has “abused export control measures and damaged China’s national security and interests.”
The official Legal Daily reported on Thursday that some legislators had suggested source codes, algorithms and technical documents be added as controlled items, and that China should set up some restrictions on exporting technologies on which Beijing has a competitive edge, such as 5G and quantum communications.
Whether Beijing will allow the export of valuable Chinese technology is one of the biggest uncertainties hovering over the partial sale of TikTok to  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL). and American investors. China in August asserted the right to block the deal by adding speech recognition and recommendation technology -- the core of TikTok’s global popularity -- to a list of regulated exports.

The existing control lists are much narrower than the one used by the U.S., staying limited to materials that could be used for nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, Ren said. If it’s expanded in the future “then more products or technologies will be subject to export control in China,” he said.
While the U.S. is generally ahead of China in most spheres, China controls critical aspects of technology in industries from wireless networking to unmanned aerial vehicles.
Tech Headway
American officials have warned that Huawei -- the leader in next-generation wireless patents -- controls a 10th of worldwide essential 5G patents, and its deep involvement in international standards-setting could post a threat to U.S. national security. The company ranked among the top 10 recipients of U.S. patents in 2019 -- helping China become the fourth-biggest recipient of American patents, behind Japan and South Korea but ahead of Germany for the first time.
Chinese companies have also made headway in dominating certain niches. Shenzhen-based SZ DJI Technology Co. controls something like three-quarters of the global consumer drones market. Display maker BOE Technology Group is aggressively filing patents in its bid to get into next-generation OLED screens for smartphones.
And in artificial intelligence, companies from  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. and upstarts like SenseTime Group Ltd. are taking advantage of unparalleled reserves of data to advance in areas such as facial recognition.
How Huawei Landed at the Center of Global Tech Tussle: QuickTake
When approved, China’s law will be applied extra-territorially, taking a page from the U.S. Export Administration Regulations’ long-arm jurisdiction that Beijing has frequently criticized. Foreign Ministry officials have repeatedly accused Washington of stretching and abusing the concept of national security in justifying actions against Chinese companies.
China is the biggest exporting country in the world and overseas sales provide jobs for millions of people, so it will be careful not to abuse the law, said Mei Xinyu, a researcher at a research group under China’s Commerce Ministry. “We highly value China’s image as a reliable supplier in the international market,” Mei said. “So we wouldn’t expand the scope of export control at will.”
China’s Ministry of Commerce first published a draft of the legislation in June 2017. It went through two reviews by the NPC in December 2019 and at the end of June. When the draft bill was introduced for its first review, Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan explained to the national legislature that export control is a mechanism aimed at “honoring international obligations such as nonproliferation and safeguarding national security and developmental interests.”
But in a draft reviewed in June, national security was given higher priority.
“Threats to national security could come from various fields, including the economic field,” said Cui Fan, a professor of international trade at the University of International Business and Economics. “But we can’t confuse normal competition between companies with threats to economic security and national interests.”

The latest version further clarifies the scope of controlled items and punishment measures for violations. Government departments overseeing export control should publish export control guidance in a timely manner, a spokesperson of the NPC’s legislative affairs commission said on Monday, without elaborating.
Foreign companies need not fear the law since it applied equally to all companies operating in China, according to Ren from Global Law Office. Still, he said, foreign-invested companies should be careful if their activities involve the export of technologies.
“Chinese employees maybe are not allowed to release the controlled technologies to their foreign colleagues,” Ren said. “This depends on the very specific circumstances of the each individual company. But it could happen.”

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended lower on Thursday after a rise in weekly jobless claims compounded worries about a stalling economic recovery and fading hopes for more fiscal aid before the election.
The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose to a two-month high last week, stoking fears the COVID-19 pandemic was inflicting lasting damage to the labor market.
A separate report showed manufacturing activity in New York State fell more than expected in October.
""Going into the fall it will be difficult for unemployment to make a lot of positive headway because of the lack of stimulus,"" said Christopher C. Grisanti, chief equity strategist, MAI Capital Management in Cleveland.
U.S. President Donald Trump said he is willing to raise his offer of $1.8 trillion for a COVID-19 relief deal with Democrats in Congress, but the idea was shot down by his fellow Republican, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
The CBOE volatility index, investors' fear gauge, hit a one-week high and Wall Street's indexes dipped for the third straight day. The S&P 500 is down about 3% from its Sept. 2 record high close.
With less than 20 days until the Nov. 3 election, Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden are set to hold dueling prime-time town halls on Thursday instead of their second presidential debate, which was canceled after Trump declined to take part in a virtual matchup.
""More of what moves the market will be the crystallizing of who is going to win the presidency, and how close the Senate races are,"" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta.
A Biden presidency, coupled with a Democratic Senate, would likely mean a larger fiscal stimulus plan than what a Republicans Senate would agree to. However, Biden is also widely seen on Wall Street as likely to raise taxes.
Supporting the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc surged 4.8% as the drugstore chain forecast single-digit profit growth in 2021 after reporting a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit.
Focus is also on the quarterly results for corporate America, with expectations for third-quarter earnings improving to an 19% drop from a 25% tumble forecast on July 1, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.07% to end at 28,494.2 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.15% to 3,483.34. 
The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.47% to 11,713.87.
 Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) rose 1.3% after it beat third-quarter profit estimates, winding up mixed results from major U.S. lenders. Recent bank earnings reports saw those focused on trading clocking big gains, while retail banks took a hit from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The S&P 500 financials index climbed 0.8%, while healthcare index was the worst sector performer, down 0.7%.
The S&P 1500 airlines index <.SPCOMAIR> dipped 1.5% after United Airlines reported a 78% drop in quarterly revenue.
Shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VRTX) lost a fifth of their value after the drug developer discontinued its trial of a protein deficiency disorder treatment.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 59 new highs and 32 new lows.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - The race for driverless autonomous vehicles is heating up and on Thursday Cruise became the first to receive a permit to test cars without anyone in them on the streets of San Francisco from California's Department of Motor Vehicles. 
Cruise, which is majority owned by General Motors Co (N:GM) and counts Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) and SoftBank Group (T:9984) as investors, has been testing 180 self-driving cars in San Francisco with a safety driver behind the wheel, and the permit allows five of those cars to roam empty. But don’t expect robo-taxis just yet.
“So that's a step or two beyond what we'll be doing initially with this permit,” said Dan Ammann, Cruise’s chief executive. “It’s not too far down the road,” he said, but declined to share a timeline.
In a blog post, he added, ""We’re not the first company to receive this permit, but we’re going to be the first to put it to use on the streets of a major U.S. city."" (https://medium.com/@DanAmmann/f447f27cb353)
It will be an important step for Cruise to charge customers. 
For any of the companies to start making money in California, a separate permit is required, state officials said.
As part of SoftBank’s investment, SoftBank is obligated to purchase additional Cruise shares for $1.35 billion when Cruise is ready for commercial deployment. 
“That's a nice incentive to get to commercial deployment,” said Ammann, adding Cruise was in ""very strong"" financial shape after raising more than $7 billion. Cruise booked a $1 billion loss in 2019, according to a GM filing. 
Cruise is the fifth company to receive the driverless permit in California. Alphabet’s Waymo was the first in late 2018 to receive it for about three dozen test vehicles with speeds of up to 65 miles per hour. This year SoftBank-backed Nuro, whose vehicle has no steering wheel or pedals, was also approved and has delivered medical supplies for temporary COVID-19 hospitals.
Chinese startup AutoX and Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Zoox also got their permits in recent months. The four previous permits are for cities in Silicon Valley that are easier to navigate.
Under its permit, Cruise cars can go anywhere on San Francisco streets at a maximum speed of 30 miles per hour, and can drive both day and night.
In Arizona, which has been more open to testing of self-driving cars without drivers, Waymo has already been charging a select group of customers since summer of 2019 for empty vans that pull up and shuttle them around. That program - temporarily paused for the pandemic - was restarted in October and is expected to soon open to the wider public.
To prepare for its robotaxi future, Cruise is working on improving its ride hailing app that employees use for free to get around the city, Ammann said. 

That future would likely eventually include the Cruise Origin an electric vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals unveiled in January, but it would require approval from The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

Third-quarter earnings before interest and tax reached 3.07 billion euros ($3.59 billion), Daimler said, beating the 2.14 billion Refinitiv forecast. It said it expected the positive momentum to continue in the fourth quarter, assuming there are no further coronavirus lockdowns.
The COVID-19 pandemic had led to a slump in sales, pushing the company to operating losses in the first and second quarters.
To counter losses, Daimler's Mercedes-Benz has stopped building sedans in the United States to focus on more profitable SUVs, combined its fuel cell development with Volvo Trucks, and halted an automated development alliance with BMW BMWG.DE.
Earlier this month, Daimler said it will cut fixed costs, capex and research and development spending at Mercedes-Benz by more than 20% by 2025 as part of a strategy overhaul to take the brand further upmarket.
The move will see Mercedes-Benz, currently the world's top selling premium car brand, turn its back on a decades-old strategy of chasing sales volume to focus on the industry's most profitable segments: limousines and sport-utility vehicles.
Daimler said it expects to publish updated guidance for the full year when it publishes full results on Oct. 23.

The Albuquerque-based company's shares opened at $29.50 after its upsized IPO was priced at $22 per share, above the upper end of its target range. Array shares rose 65.7% to close trading at $36.45.
Backed by asset manager Oaktree Capital, Array raised about $1.05 billion in its IPO after selling 47.5 million shares. Its IPO had earlier aimed to sell 45 million shares at a price range of between $19 and $21 per share. 
Array's IPO comes as global energy consumption is shifting away from fossil fuels to sustainable sources such as solar and wind. 
It is also in line with the recent trend of strong investor appetite for new listings, with 2020 on track to be the best year for IPOs since the dotcom boom of 1999 and 2000.
""We're really at the early innings with the place solar can go,"" Array Chief Executive Jim Fusaro said in an interview. ""Utility scale solar is at cost parity with natural gas and other industrial plants, add that to global trends with renewables and focus on decarbonization.""
Array, founded in 1989, produces steel supports, electric motors and controllers, gear boxes and other solar energy equipment. As of the end of June, the company had $749.2 million in debt.
Oaktree Capital bought an undisclosed stake in Array in 2016.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JP Morgan, Guggenheim Securities and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are among the lead underwriters of the offering.

Investing.com - Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) reported on Thursday third-quarter results that beat analysts' forecasts on both the top and bottom lines, though warned a resurgence of Covid-19 in some states would continue to hurt sales.
Intuitive Surgical shares lost 3.5% in after-hours trade following the report.
""The impact and timing of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's business differs by geography. In the U.S., for example, while da Vinci procedures have recovered a significant portion of the pre-COVID-19 levels, the resurgence of COVID-19 in some states has had, and will likely continue to have, an adverse impact on the company’s procedure volumes,"" Intuitive Surgical said.
Intuitive Surgical announced earnings  per share of $2.77 on revenue of $1.08B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $2.02 on revenue of $967.56M.
The fall in revenue was driven by fewer system placements, primarily as a result of the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as a $23 million decrease in service revenue related to service fee credits from its customer relief program, the company said.
The company shipped 195 da Vinci surgical systems, a decrease of 29% compared with 275 in the third quarter of 2019.
Intuitive Surgical shares are up 25% from the beginning of the year, still down 4.47% from its 52 week high of $777.00 set on September 2. They are under-performing the Nasdaq 100 which is up 36.25% from the start of the year.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian government took a tentative step forward on its national small modular reactor (SMR) plan on Thursday, with an investment to help an Ontario company edge closer to commercializing its reactor technology. 
The C$20 million ($15.1 million) investment will help Terrestrial Energy complete a pre-licensing milestone for its technology, part of an effort to bring modern nuclear energy to industry, Canada's innovation ministry said.
""By helping to bring these small reactors to market, we are supporting significant environmental and economic benefits,"" said Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains. The company pledged to create dozens of jobs with the funding.
While SMR technology has not been widely deployed worldwide, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has been touting it as a way to help Canada achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
The modular reactors, which are fueled by uranium and use fission like traditional nuclear plants but cost far less to build, could also help reduce emissions in Canada's energy-intensive oil patch. 
""SMR technologies can provide a clean energy alternative to convention coal and fossil energy generation, including in hard to decarbonize sectors like resource extraction and heavy industry,"" Bains told reporters.
Energy producer Suncor (TO:SU) said it is in general talks with Ottawa on SMRs to help power oil sand operations and other facilities, though it does not yet have specific proposals. 
The development of a SMR industry in Canada could also help bolster domestic uranium producers, like Saskatchewan's  Cameco  Inc (TO:CCO), who have struggled for almost a decade in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster.

Renault joined several other major French companies including Air France-KLM in obtaining state-backed loans, as part of a crisis programme set in motion in France to help firms cope with the pandemic. 
Its credit facility is loaned by commercial banks but carries a guarantee from the French government of up to 90% of the amount borrowed. 
Financial chief Clotilde Delbos added that the loan was due to mature at year-end, and that it would have been ""a bit of a shame"" not to make use of it. 

""We have a very good level of liquidity, there is no liquidity problem, it's just good financial management,"" Delbos said.

1314,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 01:30PM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley profit crushes estimates on trading strength,"By Matt Scuffham and Ambar Warrick
(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) eased past Wall Street estimates for profit on Thursday, wrapping up mixed third-quarter earnings for big U.S. banks that saw those focused on trading clocking big gains while retail banks took a hit from the pandemic.
Like fellow Wall Street trading powerhouse Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley capitalized on a flurry of activity in financial markets. Clients bought and sold securities in response to the coronavirus pandemic, and many companies went public or raised fresh capital.
While Morgan Stanley's trading unit did not hit the record highs of the previous quarter, the latest performance was still good enough to help the bank comfortably beat expectations.
Striking an upbeat tone about future growth, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said the bank was encouraged by client engagement across all its businesses in the first few weeks of the fourth quarter.
Even as trading returns to the spotlight amid the pandemic, Chief Executive James Gorman has been taking steps to shore up Morgan Stanley's asset and wealth management businesses to insulate the bank from weak periods for trading and investment banking.
Gorman engineered two large back-to-back acquisitions recently - a $7 billion deal to buy  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV) Corp to expand its investment-management business immediately after closing its $13 billion acquisition of discount brokerage E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) Corp. Executives said they are done with deals for awhile as they integrate those companies.
""We clearly have our plate full,"" Pruzan said in an interview.
Morgan Stanley shares rose 1.5% to $51.40 in afternoon trading.
The bank's wealth management arm also turned in a solid quarter with a 7% jump in revenue to $4.7 billion.
Its return on tangible common equity (ROTCE), a measure of how well a bank uses shareholder money to produce profits, came in at 15%, in line with the target Gorman had set out earlier this year.
In contrast to Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, other big banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  (N:C), Bank of America (N:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) are more exposed to weak activity in the real economy, plus historically low interest rates. They have collectively set aside tens of billions of dollars' worth of provisions this year to cover bad loans.
Even so, most large banks beat profit estimates this quarter, partly due to muted expectations.
ANOTHER STRONG QUARTER
Revenue from Morgan Stanley's institutional securities division, which is houses its investment banking and trading businesses, rose 21% to $6.1 billion.
Equities underwriting revenue more than doubled to $874 million due to handsome fees from a number of high-profile initial public offerings such as  Snowflake Inc  (N:SNOW), Royalty Pharma (O:RPRX), KE Holdings Inc (N:BEKE) and Warner Music (O:WMG).
But revenue from underwriting bonds dropped from last year due to declines in loan issuances and muted dealmaking activity.
Net income applicable to common shareholders rose 26% to $2.60 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Earnings per share rose to $1.66, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.28 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Revenue also comfortably beat estimates, rising 16% to $11.7 billion, as all three of its main businesses posted gains. (https://mgstn.ly/3dvUT5T)

The auto union said FCA would invest in a state-of-the-art vehicle platform that will enable the assembly of plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles, with at least one new model in 2025.

(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is piloting a program to recruit Black talent in its sales and trading division, executives told Reuters, in corporate America's latest initiative to improve diversity after nationwide protests against racial inequality.
The Morgan Stanley Experienced Professional Program within its Fixed Income & Business Resource Management Divisions is seeking Black professionals with at least two years' full-time work experience in any field who want to work in finance.
""As long as you have the skill set around communication, analytical abilities, interpersonal skills, and you are willing to work hard, you could have a strong career,"" Derek Melvin, a managing director who designed the program, said in an interview on Wednesday.
The banking industry has been scrutinized for its lack of racial diversity since the May 25 death in police custody of George Floyd, a Black man, sparked demonstrations and prompted deep introspection at companies across the country.
That has led to fresh pledges to improve diversity and tie executive compensation to meeting related targets. However, such action has triggered concern from authorities.
Last week,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co defended its diversity initiatives after the U.S. Labor Department questioned whether they were unlawful or discriminatory.
Morgan Stanley's program is only open for up to 20 people. Melvin said he hopes the program, if successful, will be replicated across the firm's institutional securities business.
That division, the bank's largest breadwinner, reported a 21% jump in revenue for the third quarter on Thursday, helping the bank breeze past Wall Street estimates.
Successful applicants will get a month of training before doing 10-week rotations on different trading desks, leading to a full-time job.
Feedback on the program so far has been overwhelming, Melvin said. Since advertising it at the end of September, his team has received over 700 applications. Successful applicants will be chosen by the end of the year.

""Our expectations were that after a month, we'd have about 100 to work through,"" Melvin said in an interview. ""But we've been surprised to the upside here.""

1318,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 01:15PM ET</span>","Cannabis companies, betting on a Biden win, ready IPOs","By Shariq Khan and David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A year ago, Flora Growth Chief Executive Damian Lopez had just spent a chunk of his company's seed capital buying a Colombian cannabis producer, and was fighting his way through the legal and financial hurdles that have made development of the industry such a challenge over the past decade.
These days, a boom in sales of his hemp-derived health food and beauty products during the coronavirus pandemic, and the prospect of an easing of marijuana laws in the aftermath of the U.S. presidential election, have him sealing a $30 million funding round and making plans for a U.S. public floatation early next year.
“I think the election will be a huge catalyst,” Lopez said on Wednesday. He was busy planning for the initial public offering (IPO) with investment banking firm Boustead Securities set to be the company's chief adviser. 
Lopez is far from alone. U.S.-based dispensary business Gage Cannabis announced two weeks ago it would seek to list in the new year, while synthetic cannabinoid maker BioMedican has also laid out plans to go public in the first half of 2021.
Another hemp-based health products maker, Vertical Wellness, told Reuters this week it too was looking to debut next year.
Today's outlook is a far cry from 2018, when many Canadian-based players created for last year's legalization there, as well as expectations of the widespread opening of U.S. markets, faced fines and shutdowns, or were forced to merge, due to regulatory roadblocks that hampered growth prospects. 
Lopez and other CEOs say the potential January arrival in the White House of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his pro-decriminalization running-mate, Senator Kamala Harris, may prove a watershed moment for the industry. 
But even if President Donald Trump wins a second term, changing views on marijuana laws among voters and lawmakers have brightened the outlook for the industry, CEOs and analysts said.
“Regardless of who wins, more and more states are showing their support for cannabis,” Lopez said.
Voters in five states, including densely-populated New Jersey and rapidly-growing Arizona, are expected to back measures on Nov. 3 that would allow recreational use of marijuana. 
""We believe the November elections could drive meaningful upside for the U.S. marijuana industry,"" said Michael Lavery, an analyst at Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) & Co.
'DRAMATIC CHANGE IN EXPECTATIONS'
Shares of companies with broad footprints in the U.S. market, including  Curaleaf  Holdings (OTC:CURLF) Inc (CD:CURA),  Cresco Labs  Ltd (CD:CL) and Green Thumb Industries Inc (CD:GTII) are all up more than 20% since the presidential debate on Sept. 29, mirroring rising expectations of a Biden victory.
The Democratic nominee has widened his lead in several states likely to decide the election, Reuters polls showed, as well as his lead in online betting markets.
In last week’s debate with Vice President Mike Pence, Harris said marijuana would be decriminalized at a federal level in the United States under a Biden administration.
“Each election cycle cannabis comes closer to federal acceptance, and this election is pivotal to those goals,” said Cynthia Salarizadeh, founder and president of House of Saka, a cannabis-infused beverages business.
A Democratic victory for control of the Senate, which is looking increasingly likely according to polls, would replace Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has blocked legislation that would allow cannabis companies greater access to financial markets. 
Cannabis sales have surged with people stuck at home during the coronavirus pandemic. In California, sales data for August showed a 26% jump over the past year, while sales in Nevada were up 34%, according to BDS Analytics. 
Federal decriminalization, or legalization in more states, would not be without specific challenges, investors said. 
Many point to Canada as an example.
Though the country became the first G-20 nation to legalize recreational use of cannabis in 2018, regulatory hiccups in Canadian dispensary rollouts, slow international legalization and a lack of profitability sent investors packing over the next year. That left most companies at a fraction of their market values by the beginning of this year.
Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations, cautioned that several bills would need to pass before U.S. companies will be on the same regulatory playing field as their Canadian counterparts. 

Still, “it’s a dramatic change in expectations from three months ago, when it appeared Donald Trump would most likely win re-election,” he said.

1323,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 12:18PM ET</span>","Bolsonaro Weighs Huawei Ban From 5G Network, Cabinet Member Says","(Bloomberg) -- President Jair Bolsonaro is considering banning Huawei Technologies Co. from supplying components to Brazil’s upcoming 5G network because he sees China as a global threat to data privacy and sovereignty, according to a senior member of his cabinet.
While a decision hasn’t been made yet and will take into consideration the views of others in the cabinet, the remarks are evidence of Bolsonaro’s continued suspicion of Brazil’s largest trading partner.
Caught between Washington and Beijing, Brazilian officials have so far refrained from saying whether they would give in to U.S. requests to keep Huawei out of the country’s ultra-fast mobile network.
Still, the cabinet member dismissed the possibility of Chinese retaliation, saying Beijing relies on Brazilian agricultural imports to feed its population. The perception in Brazil is that other countries which have banned Huawei have not suffered major consequences, the person added, requesting anonymity to discuss internal matters.
In a recent interview, China’s Ambassador to Brazil Yang Wanming said the decision on Huawei will help define the broader relationship between the two emerging market giants. “What’s at stake is whether a country can set up market rules based on openness, impartiality and non-discrimination for all companies,” he said.
Read more: China Says Brazil’s Business Reputation Hinges on 5G Decision
Asked to comment on the story, Bolsonaro’s office deferred the request to the communication ministry, which said in a statement the 5G decision is a matter of national security involving many stake holders, including the ministries of economy and foreign affairs. Leaders of all countries involved are discussing the subject, the statement read, without elaborating.
Trade Ties
China was the destination of 40% of Brazilian exports in the first half of the year, according to data from the agriculture ministry. Sales to the Asian country, mostly soybeans, generated more revenue than those to the U.S., Latin America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East combined.
Yet relations with Beijing have been tense since Bolsonaro took office in 2019, after heavily criticizing China during the campaign trail. A close ally of Donald Trump, the Brazilian leader warmed up to President Xi Jinping during a trip to Asia last year. But just a few months ago Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo implicitly censured China, writing in his personal blog that the coronavirus had revived “the communist nightmare.” The president’s own son, lower house lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, has also blamed the pandemic on the “Chinese dictatorship.”

Other officials have expressed more pragmatic views on China. Vice-President Hamilton Mourao and Science and Technology Minister Marcos Pontes have advocated for an open and fair bidding process to pick the builders of Brazil’s 5G network.
Brazil plans to select those companies around next May after the health crisis delayed the process initially scheduled for this year, Communications Minister Fabio Faria said in a recent interview. Faria said the delay is actually positive as it will allow the government to observe global developments before making a decision.

Shaw said on Thursday it plans to set up an office in Singapore in 2021, becoming the latest global firm to expand into the city-state as it looks to tap into new investment opportunities.
Singapore, a leading financial services hub, has seen many fund managers, family offices and other investment firms stepping up their expansion in the city-state since 2019, amid concerns over the future of rival hub, Hong Kong.
It rolled out a new corporate structure for investment funds this year, in a scheme designed to attract more funds to set up in the city-state.
D.E. Shaw group, one of the world's largest hedge funds with more than $50 billion in investment capital, said in a statement that it had started preparing for its fund management licence application and initiated other preliminary steps to set up the office.
""Opening an office in Singapore will further enable us to tap into the region's talent, capital, and investment opportunities,"" said Kevin Patric, general manager of Asia Pacific at D.E. Shaw.
""This is a logical next step in the growth of our geographic footprint,"" he said.

It established its Hong Kong office in 2007 and its Shanghai office in 2010.

The goal of the test, scheduled for Oct. 17, is to highlight to companies looking to go public how a direct listing will function when new shares are sold and money is raised. (https:// In the four high-profile direct listings done since 2018, including those of music streaming company  Spotify Technology  (N:SPOT) and data analytics firm Palantir Technologies (N:PLTR), no new funds were raised, as is typical in the case of a traditional IPO.  Shares of Palantir and workplace app Asana (N:ASAN), which also went public through a direct listing, were down about 6% and 13%, respectively, below their debut price, as of Wednesday's close. Direct listings have enabled existing investors to sell their shares and led to investment banks playing less of a role in deciding the price at which shares are sold. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved a proposed rule by the NYSE to allow companies to raise capital through a direct listing. Supporters of the direct listing model have criticized IPOs as chummy deals that allow bankers to allocate the most shares to their top clients.

He said in June he wanted Nestle to shift its focus to better performing water brands which include Acqua Panna while the rest of the business was being put under review.
Private equity funds including Apollo (N:APO), that focus on turnaround deals and cutting costs to improve profit, are expected to show interest, the sources said.
 Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) is running the sale which has also drawn interest from some industry players, one of the sources said.
Dutch bottling company Refresco, which has a large business in the United States, is among those who could explore a bid, either alone or teamed up with a financial investor, two of the sources said.
Primo Water (TO:PRMW) and Niagara Bottling may also join the race for all or part of the portfolio, they said.
Nestle wants first-round bids by the end of October, according to one of the sources. 
Nestle, Refresco and Morgan Stanley declined to comment while Apollo, Primo and Niagara were not immediately available.
The assets on the block generated 3.4 billion Swiss francs ($3.72 billion) in 2019 sales.
Guggenheim analysts said last year the water brands were declining at roughly 2 percent, without the impact of coronavirus, and could fetch $4.9 billion-$5.9 billion.

Yet, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) estimated a price closer to 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.28 billion), adding Nestle had lost market share to private labels, while growth in the industry remains with sparkling brands like La Croix and PepsiCo's (O:PEP) Bubly.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British arm of China Merchants Securities (HK:6099) (SS:600999) (CMS) will close its commodities brokerage after a review of the business that aimed to align it with the group's global strategy, a letter seen by Reuters said.
The letter did not detail the strategy.
CMS's United Kingdom, Hong Kong and China offices did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Telephone calls to the London office were unanswered.
Based in Shenzhen and listed in Hong Kong and Shanghai, CMS in 2019 was the fourth-largest securities broker by assets in China with revenues of 25.66 billion yuan ($3.8 billion).
Metal broking sources say CMS retreating from London could be linked to political tensions between Britain and China over Hong Kong, but that the decision was also tied to the London operation's difficulties in generating revenue.
Commodity trading volumes this year have come under pressure from COVID-19 lockdowns, which have hit demand for oil and industrial metals such as aluminium and zinc.
One source with direct knowledge of the matter said the decision to close CMS's London commodities unit was made by the Hong Kong office, but declined to give further details or say whether the London office would close completely.
""Unfortunately due to a change in business direction, we have taken the decision to close our commodity brokerage business which has been operating in the UK since 2014,"" the letter sent to a customer this week said.
The letter signed by CEO Wei Zhang also said China Merchants Securities (UK) Limited (""CMSUK"") is looking to close the customer's accounts by Nov. 30.
""We will remove all margin/credit facilities on your accounts from October 28th 2020,"" the letter said. ""In order to facilitate the closure of your accounts we will require you to close out, or transfer out, positions you currently hold.""
CMSUK is a Category 2 member of the London Metal Exchange, allowing it to trade LME contracts on the exchange's electronic system and on the telephone and as a member of LME clear it can clear trades for itself and for customers.
It is also a member of the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) (ICE), according to CMSUK's website.
""(CMSUK) will eventually have to give up both the LME and ICE,"" a source familiar with the matter said. 
Chinese banks and brokers have for some years made a beeline for a larger slice of the billions of dollars of commodities business that goes through London every year.

Investing.com -- Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) Inc. shares posted their biggest loss on record a day after the company released disappointing third-quarter revenue numbers. The news dragged down other cloud providers.
The company, which had soared about 450% year-to-date, said Wednesday at the close that sales would come in between $70 million and $71 million. Analysts were expecting anywhere from $74.2 million to $76 million.
Shares fell 24%.
Fastly cited lower spending from a top customer, Chinese Internet giant ByteDance Ltd, aka TikTok, and ongoing U.S.-China tensions. 
“Due to the impacts of the uncertain geopolitical environment, usage of Fastly’s platform by its previously disclosed largest customer did not meet expectations, resulting in a corresponding significant reduction in revenue from this customer,” the company said in a statement.
Analysts were quick to react, with both Baird and Stifel cutting their ratings on the stock.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>","Fisker closes deal for supplier Magna to build its SUV, take stake in startup","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Fisker Inc, which is going public through a merger with a so-called blank check company, said on Thursday auto supplier  Magna International Inc  (TO:MG) will supply the vehicle platform and build the electric carmaker's Ocean SUV.
As part of the deal, Magna will receive warrants to purchase a stake of up to 6% in Fisker, giving the EV maker an overall valuation of about $3 billion, Fisker Chief Executive Henrik Fisker told Reuters. 
""We're full speed ahead,"" Fisker said in a telephone interview. ""This is a huge turning point. We realized Magna would be an amazing partner because having skin in the game obviously means we both have the same goal of getting this car to market.""
Fisker, which is merging with Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp (N:SPAQ), said it had finalized a deal with Canada's Magna to build the Ocean in Europe, marking the Canadian supplier's first entry into contract manufacturing for an EV startup.
While Magna has built vehicles for traditional automakers for years, analysts and investors have speculated it could eventually build for technology companies like Apple Inc (O:AAPL). 
Magna retrofits vehicles for Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Waymo and builds vehicles for BMW AG (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz and  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM) Ltd's (NS:TAMO) Jaguar Land Rover at its plant in Graz, Austria. 
Magna also has a tentative deal to build vehicles for EV startup Canoo Holdings Ltd (O:HCACU), which is also going public later this year through a reverse merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.
Magna's stake in Fisker is subject to hitting three engineering and production milestones through the planned start of production of the Ocean in November 2022, Henrik Fisker said. Fisker Inc said in August it had a tentative deal for Magna to build the SUV at its Graz plant. 
Magna President Swamy Kotagiri told Reuters the stake is more about Magna getting compensated.
""We really want to be the Switzerland for the automotive industry - neutrality,"" he said. ""We're not siding with one customer.""
""This is a unique competitive position for us, particularly with new mobility players and (automakers) seeking to expand their electrified offerings."" 
Further terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Kotagiri said Fisker's pricing was based on volume. Fisker is targeting initial sales of 8,000 SUVs in 2022, 51,000 in 2023 and 175,000 in 2024.
Fisker had previously said it was negotiating to use Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) MEB electric-vehicle platform, but Henrik Fisker said the company remains in talks with the German automaker to use unspecified body and interior parts.
Closing a deal addressing Fisker Inc's platform and manufacturing needs was seen as critical by investors. Fisker's inability in July to close the deal it initially targeted with VW sent shares in Spartan Energy down 20%. 
Use of Magna's aluminum-intensive vehicle platform will allow the Ocean to have an electric driving range of more than 300 miles (483 km) and enable Fisker to offer buyers the option of a third row of seating, Henrik Fisker said. 
The vehicle will have a starting price of $37,499.

Fisker Inc's merger with Spartan is expected to close on Oct. 30 and its shares will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""FSR,"" Henrik Fisker said.

The average for a 30-year, fixed loan dropped to 2.81%, down from 2.87% last week and the lowest in almost 50 years of data-keeping,  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) said in a statement Thursday. It was the 10th record low this year. The previous one -- 2.86% -- held for about a month.
The slide in borrowing costs that began in March, as fears of the coronavirus drove investors to the safety of Treasuries, shows no signs of stopping. The Federal Reserve has signaled it will hold its benchmark rate near zero through at least 2023. That should keep a lid on mortgage rates, which have been below 3% since July.
Cheap loans have been fueling a housing rally that has bolstered the pandemic economy, even amid persistent job losses. Purchases have soared and millions of current homeowners have been able to save money by refinancing.
But surging demand for the scarce supply of properties on the market is pushing up prices, putting homeownership out of reach for many Americans. And lenders have tightened credit standards, presenting another potential obstacle for would-be buyers.
“It’s important to remember that not all people are able to take advantage of low rates, given the effects of the pandemic,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in the statement.

1337,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>","France, Netherlands call for an EU watchdog to regulate tech giants","By Mathieu Rosemain and Douglas Busvine
PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - France and the Netherlands on Thursday called for a European Union authority to regulate large tech companies such as Google (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB), whose dominance gives them effective internet gatekeeper status. 
The move increases pressure on Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who is preparing a new Digital Services Act, to set tough rules for data-sharing and ensure that marketplaces are fair and open.
The Franco-Dutch proposal, which calls for pre-emptive action to prevent power grabs by Big Tech, overshadowed a gathering of EU ministers that discussed artificial intelligence and cloud computing.
In a joint statement, French junior minister Cédric O and his Dutch counterpart Mona Keijzer said such an authority should be able to prevent tech company platforms from blocking access to their services ""unless they have an objective justification.""
""These platforms can hinder the entry of new companies and limit the freedom of choice for consumers and entrepreneurs,"" said Keijzer, the Dutch state secretary for economic affairs and climate policy.
""Our common ambition is to design a framework ... to address the economic footprint of such actors on the European economy and to be able to ‘break them open’,"" said O, the top digital policy official in the French government.
In response, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, said: ""What we are talking about is upholding our European values and the functioning of our single market.""
The European Commission is taking a tough line against U.S. tech giants, driven in part by antitrust cases resulting in decisions that subsequently failed to boost competition because these investigations often take several years.
Gatekeepers, such as companies with bottleneck power or strategic market status, will not be allowed to use data collected on their platforms to target users unless this data is shared with rivals, according to the draft regulation seen by Reuters last month.
The power of digital gatekeepers was one issue discussed on Thursday at an online meeting of EU digital and telecoms ministers hosted by Germany, the current EU president.
Twenty-five of the 27 EU members signed a declaration on creating a European cloud federation - a framework for the storage, use and sharing of data within the EU, Altmaier told reporters after the meeting.
This would enable the development of Gaia-X, a cloud computing initiative pioneered by Germany and France. The two countries that did not sign - Cyprus and Denmark - are expected to do so soon.

“This declaration is promising and shows the depth of the change that we witness,"" said Commissioner Thierry Breton. ""There is a common understanding that it is vital that any data can be stored and processed in Europe, according to European rules and standards.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Thursday as concern about a reviving Covid-19 pandemic in Europe was compounded by another set of weaker-than-expected unemployment numbers from the U.S. labor market.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 281 points, or 1.0%, at 28,233 points, while the S&P 500 was down 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.3%. While last week's winning streaks they're still positive for the month so far, they've given up around half the gains they made since the start of October.
Earlier, the Labor Department had said initial jobless claims had risen to 898.000 their highest level since late August last week, confounding hopes for another modest decline. While some doubts remain over the numbers due to the fact that California hasn't filed any for three weeks while it investigates claims of fraud and other administrative issues, the rise is consistent with other signs of weakening in the economic rebound at the end of summer. 
""It seems pretty clear from the decently reliable data on jobless claims that 1) layoffs are really high, rising somewhat and more likely to be permanent & 2) momentum in net hiring is slowing,"" said Julia Coronado, founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives and a former Federal Reserve economist, via Twitter. ""I really want to see pretty, shiny things but I just don't.""
Sentiment was also overshadowed by fears that the renewed spread of Covid-19 as the northern hemisphere winter starts will inevitably lead to fresh restrictions on economic activity. The U.K. and France have both tightened regulations on non-essential meetings and activity this week, with France putting Paris and other major cities under a curfew. Inhabitants of London, meanwhile, will be barred from mixing with other households from the weekend. 
The news has somewhat overshadowed the morning's earnings releases, which saw both Walgreens Boots (NASDAQ:WBA) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) handily beat expectations. Walgreens stock rose 5.7% to its highest since the end of August, while Morgan Stanley - for whom expectations had been high - rose 0.9%.
Elsewhere, Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) stock fell 28%, reversing all of a frothy three-week rally, after it said the TikTok streaming service, its biggest customer, hadn't used its software as much as expected against the backdrop of a looming ban in the U.S.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 1.7% as a broker target price upgrade offset the news of its second price cut in a week, this time for its Model S cars.

The companies have been locked in a legal battle since LVMH last month cited worsening business conditions at Tiffany as one of the reasons to walk away from the deal.
Tiffany, which has alleged in a lawsuit that LVMH improperly tried to renegotiate the deal, said on Thursday sales in Mainland China were ""extremely strong"" and its business was recovering in the United States after being hit earlier in the year. 
LVMH has said Tiffany's prospects were ""dismal"" and it was a different company from the one it had agreed to buy in November before the health crisis hammered demand for luxury goods.

(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA) on Thursday forecast a return to growth in profit next year, banking on a recovery in the second half of fiscal 2021 after improvement in U.S. and UK markets helped it beat estimates for the most recent quarter.
Walgreens, whose 2020 adjusted profit fell 21%, has cut jobs, suspended share repurchases and closed some of its UK-based Boots stores to save costs and revive profit growth, as shoppers stayed indoors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Thursday's full-year results showed sales at Boots were down by a third in the final quarter of financial 2020, although that was improved from a 48% slump a quarter earlier.
""We are seeing gradual improvement in key U.S. and UK markets and continued strong performance in our wholesale business,"" Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said in a statement. 
The company said it expects adjusted profit for fiscal 2021 to grow in single-digit at constant currency rates. Analysts expected growth of about 1%, according to Refinitiv data. 
It forecast strong adjusted profit growth in the second half of 2021, as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, and supported by its cost-cutting plans, and investments in 2021. 
Walgreens shares rose 1.7% before the opening bell on Thursday, but were still down nearly 40% in the year. The stock is one of the worst performers on the bluechip Dow Jones index <.DJI.>. 
In the quarter ended Aug. 31, online sales more than doubled at Boots.com while sales at Walgreen.com rose nearly 40%. Same-store sales at the company's retail pharmacy division in the United States rose 3.6% from a year earlier. 
Walgreens, like rival CVS Health (N:CVS), has been providing COVID-19 tests during the pandemic and has increased testing capacity to 500,000 per month. The company said its test results generally take one to three days to arrive.

Excluding items, Walgreens earned $1.02 per share, beating analysts' expectations of 96 cents per share.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares hit two-week lows on Thursday, knocked by tougher curbs in London and Paris to fight a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no breakthrough in Brexit trade talks also a dampener.
Wall Street was also set to add to losses from previous sessions as policymakers in the United States fail to agree on an economic stimulus package ahead of presidential elections next month.
Analysts said the biggest pullback in markets in three weeks was more of a pause than a fundamental shift, however.
""We have to be careful about reading too much into these moves ahead of the U.S. election coming up,"" said Ned Rumpeltin, European Head of Currency Strategy at TD Securities
""There is a general risk-off sort of feel for the day. I don't really see today in terms of changes in overall trends and direction.""

Analysts said the rise in coronavirus infections across Europe and no sign of a vaccine anytime soon after two high-profile prospects experienced problems was hitting sentiment.
London was headed for a tighter lockdown, with France also introducing tighter curbs in Paris and other major cities.
Hopes for a U.S. package to boost the coronavirus-hit economy before the presidential election next month have also fizzled out after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said such a deal would be difficult.
""It's all pointing to a greater hit to fourth quarter activity and warrants a degree of adjustment in market pricing,"" said Derek Halpenny, head of research at MUFG.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was down 2.1% to a near two-week low, with markets in London (FTSE) and Paris (FCHI) lower 2%-2.2% and Frankfurt (GDAXI) and Milan (FTMIB) 2.6%-2.7% weaker.
BREXIT ON EU SUMMIT MENU
A two-day summit of European Union leaders starts on Thursday as the EU and Britain continue their efforts to overcome stumbling blocks, such as fishing rights and competition safeguards, to agreeing a trade deal before the UK's Brexit transition arrangements end on Dec. 31.
The pound slipped 0.4% to $1.2950 whereas the euro drooped 0.25% against the dollar to $1.1716, its lowest in a week. 
Investors will tune into European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who takes part in a debate on the global economy at 1600 GMT as part of the IMF and World Bank's annual meeting which is being held virtually.

PARIS (Reuters) - Clinical trials of an experimental vaccine against COVID-19 which is being developed by France's  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) and U.S. biotech firm Translate Bio (NASDAQ:TBIO) are on track to begin before the end of the year after positive results in tests on animals.
Sanofi and Translate Bio said in a statement on Thursday that the results from pre-clinical trials showed two doses of the MRT5500 vaccine induced a ""favourable"" immune response in mice and monkeys.
There is no internationally-approved vaccine to protect against COVID-19, which has killed more than 1 million people around the world and triggered economic chaos.
More than 40 drugmakers and research groups are conducting human trials to develop vaccines, with seven which have progressed to the late stages of tests.
The finding published on Thursday is similar to that released in August by Translate Bio, which at the time said it aimed to launch clinical trials in November.
Sanofi and Translate Bio confirmed that a phase 1/2 trial on humans would begin in the fourth quarter to test for safety and to determine the dosage before a possible final Phase 3 trial.
They did not provide a precise starting date.
In mice, they said four dose levels had been assessed using a two-dose vaccination schedule, adding that the pre-clinical results were undergoing peer review for potential publication.
""Two doses of MRT5500 induced neutralizing antibody levels significantly higher than those observed in COVID-19 patients,"" the companies said.
In non-human primates (NHPs), Sanofi said three dose levels had been evaluated with a similar two-dose approach.
""The preclinical results we report in this paper demonstrate the ability of MRT5500 to elicit a favorable immune response in both mice and non-human primates,"" Ronald Renaud, Chief Executive of Translate Bio, said.
The vaccine candidate uses a technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA) which instructs cells in the body to make specific coronavirus proteins that then produce an immune response.
Several companies are also using this approach to develop a vaccine, including U.S. companies  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) whose candidates have reached late-stage trials.

Sanofi is also developing another COVID-19 vaccine candidate with British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and started a clinical trial in September, with the first results expected by the end of the year.

1349,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 08:26AM ET</span>",Analysis: Imported tortillas? Big Mexican farmers fear cuts will hit harvests,"By Sharay Angulo
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's most productive farmers fear they may not be able to meet growing demand after state funding cuts, warning of a rising reliance on imports of the white corn used for staples such as tortillas and tamales.
Under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the agricultural budget has been cropped by a third, with subsidies aimed at larger farmers, who account for two-thirds of corn production, almost entirely eliminated.
Mexico has historically been self-sufficient in white corn, but Jose Cacho, vice president of Grupo Minsa (MX:MINSAB), warns that these changes could force Mexico's second biggest corn flour miller to buy imported supplies in the medium term.
""There's a risk we won't be able to source enough,"" Cacho said, referring to the 800,000 tonnes Minsa buys annually, adding that it had not bought imported corn for years.
Mexico's agricultural ministry and the president's office did not respond to Reuters requests for comment
Although the government says it considers all farmers important, its agriculture minister said last month that with limited resources available it must prioritize the most vulnerable in the country's many poor rural regions.
Rural poverty has been a driver of immigration to the United States and social unrest for decades and Lopez Obrador, who ran on a pledge of helping the poor, has imposed a sweeping austerity program and tried to reassign resources to tackle it. 
The government says new programs supporting smaller farmers with price guarantees will eventually reduce imports.
Mexico City-based GCMA forecasts that white corn production will to dip 3.4% to 23.5 million tonnes this year, before recovering in 2021. 
However, the consultancy sees Mexico's overall corn crop only inching up by about a million tonnes by 2024, the last year of Lopez Obrador's term in office. That is far short of demand growth of a million tonnes each year, or about 2.5% annually.
'DISINCENTIVIZING'
Steadily growing use of yellow feed corn to fatten Mexico's livestock has for decades come from cheap U.S. supplies, with imports now making up more than a third of national corn demand.
While this has kept prices down, it has also undercut farmers in Mexico, where leading industry players say subsidy cuts are set to exacerbate the problem.
""Corn is no longer good business because it is cheaper to import,"" said Juan Pablo Rojas, who heads the National Confederation of Corn Farmers and grows corn himself near the Pacific coast in western Mexico. 
""They are disincentivizing national production.""
Importing corn for tortillas could potentially make them cheaper, but a decline in national production for a product at the heart of Mexican identity would be a blow to its pride.
Beyond such symbolism, Mexico is still scarred by U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of a tariff war, which led corn importers to reconsider how reliable U.S. supplies were.
""It affects our national sovereignty,"" said Rojas, adding that when farms fail, workers tend to migrate to look for work in cities or north of the border. 
Many support programs have been eliminated, including $300 million to promote exports and subsidies to help farmers pay into a price hedging mechanism, while about $700 million in help for equipment has been cut to $70 million in the 2021 budget.
And without more government support, larger corn farms cannot compete against the U.S. government's aggressive payout schemes for its own corn farmers, Minsa's Cacho said.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture last month released details of a second round of its coronavirus crisis aid for farmers, including an estimated $3.5 billion for corn farmers alone, the American Farm Bureau Federation said.
President Donald Trump and the U.S. Congress have, since late 2018, approved an estimated $61 billion in cash payments and other support efforts for farmers from two main programs, one that aims to cushion losses caused by trade wars, and the other in response to the pandemic.
With yellow corn imports of around $3 billion annually, Mexico is the top destination for U.S. corn. Imports will rise by 5% to 16.2 million tonnes in the 2019/2020 season, agriculture ministry projections show, while white corn imports will jump by 20%, but on much less volume.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates corn supplied to Mexican buyers in 2019/2020 at 18.3 million tonnes.
""We are selling it (corn) at an international price because we compete ... directly with Ohio (and) Minnesota,"" Rogelio García, a corn and sorghum producer from Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico said.
'PUNISHING' POLICY
Among Mexico's 2.7 million corn farmers, 90% work plots smaller than 20 hectares and Lopez Obrador has instituted a minimum price guarantee scheme of 5,610 pesos ($248) per tonne in select states for producers who tend up to 5 hectares. 
In March, Lopez Obrador authorized less generous price supports for corn farmers with plots up to 50 hectares and produce at most 600 tonnes per year, which are available only in three northern states during the fall-winter harvest. 
This is hitting bigger farmers, those who plant 20 hectares or more, who account for more than 70% of domestic production.
""The new policies are punishing farmers with plots larger than 10 hectares,"" Cesar Quezada, a farmer who produces corn, chicken and meat, said of the ending of policies that once provided a variety of support for farmers with medium or commercial-scale operations.
""We see less appetite ... to increase the hectares to produce corn, soybeans or sorghum because on the one hand the international market (price) is low and on the other they will have higher production costs,"" Quezada said. 

""This threatens food production and food security.""

1350,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>",New York could emerge the winner from Brexit derivatives clash,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union is trying to grab a slice of the City of London's multi-billion euro derivatives market after Brexit but EU regulators risk driving some of the business to New York from January if there is no clarity on rules.
London is the world's biggest centre for trading derivatives or swaps, but from December 31 it will lose direct access to EU customers unless EU and British regulators avoid a clash over where and how banks can trade these products.
In the meantime, EU bank branches in London might look to platforms in the United States that can serve EU clients, industry officials and regulators said. This would avoid getting tangled up in conflicting UK and EU trading ""obligations."" 
Steven Maijoor, chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), said there will be clarity before year-end on where EU investors must trade derivatives like interest rate and credit default swaps.
""The UK branches of EU entities are subject to both the EU and UK derivatives trading obligations and we need to give clarity on how to address that,"" Maijoor told Reuters.
One solution would be to allow EU branches in Britain to do their derivatives business under UK rules, a proposal made last year by Robert Ophele, chairman of France's markets watchdog AMF.
This would allow the EU banks to maintain access to London's highly liquid market in swaps on behalf of EU clients.
But the current lack of clarity could benefit New York which competes fiercely with London in swaps trading.
Ophele, also an ESMA board member, has said that EU banks could lose out on achieving the best prices in derivatives deals if they are shut out of London and would have to shift some hedging to the United States.
""The key issue for us is that whatever solution we come forward with it also needs to be in line with legislation,"" Maijoor said, referring to the EU's securities law.
But the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) said it was unclear how EU branches in Britain would be given flexibility fast enough in time for January if the underlying EU law needs changing.
""Switching trades to U.S. swap execution facilities is not necessarily straightforward as some clients may not be able or permitted to do that,"" said Roger Cogan, head of European public policy at ISDA.
He said if the EU granted ""equivalence"" or full access for UK platforms to EU customers it would avoid fragmentation of markets that is detrimental to prices.
Brussels wants reassurances from Britain that its rules on derivatives will be aligned with the EU's regime before giving the green light on equivalence, a request that makes UK regulators bristle.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority has said it will spell out its own derivatives trading regime by the end of the year.
The best outcome would be equivalence, which would support global capital markets, Maijoor said.

He also said that the European Commission will not be able to decide on equivalence until it has sufficient information and assurances from Britain that it will not deviate from EU rules.

1353,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>","Banks Not Ready for Negative Rates, NatWest Chairman Davies Says","(Bloomberg) -- British lenders aren’t in a position to implement negative interest rates, according to the chairman of NatWest Group Plc.
“We’re not completely ready for it,” Howard Davies said in a Bloomberg Radio interview Thursday. “There would be technical issues and many contractual issues.”
Davies said he was against the introduction of sub-zero rates, noting there was little evidence it had spurred investment in other countries. “We are really assuming interest rates are pretty well zero for any reasonable planning horizon. It could be worse than that.”
The Bank of England is seeking information from U.K. financial institutions on their ability to handle negative rates. The central bank has said it isn’t currently planning to cut interest rates below zero, but is preparing in case such a move ever becomes necessary.
Davies also warned that the ongoing Brexit talks offered little solace for the finance sector, one of the U.K.’s biggest industries.
While British banks are prepared for any outcome, it is a “suboptimal solution,” Davies said on Bloomberg Television. Without an agreement between the EU and U.K. on cross-border financial services -- a process known as equivalence -- some business will “drift away” from London after Brexit, he said.
Davies also said loan losses stemming from the pandemic were lagging the provisions U.K. banks made in the first half of the year. He added that governments should extend their support programs as long as lockdowns are still in place.
“All banks would say that the actual lived experience is not as bad,” he said. “Provision by the government of financial support is preventing the disasters occuring.”

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening sharply lower Thursday, following weakness in Europe, with the market ruling out the chance of more fiscal stimulus before the November elections despite a surge in coronavirus cases.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 34 points, or 1%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 270 points, or 1%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 161 points, or 1.4%. 
These cash indices all closed lower Wednesday, registering their first back-to-back down sessions in three weeks. 
Losses have been severe in Europe Thursday, with the main indices all dropping over 2%. This has been based on worries that the resurgence in cases of the Covid-19 virus will result in more lockdowns in the region’s economies, stopping the economic recovery.
""In Europe you just have a long list of quite notable actions being taken, with Paris and other French cities going into curfew, and today reports that London is going to the next, high level phase of restrictions,"" said Derek Halpenny, head of research at MUFG, in a Reuters report.
""It's all pointing to a greater hit to fourth quarter activity and warrants a degree of adjustment in market pricing.""
Adding to the woes are the vanishing chances of additional U.S. stimulus ahead of the elections in early November.
""Getting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Wednesday, adding that he and Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are still ""far apart"" on their spending priorities.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China has raised $6 billion in a dollar bond issue that was offered to U.S. investors for the first time just weeks before the Nov. 3 election, a term-sheet reviewed by Reuters showed.
The deal, the fifth foreign currency denominated bond since China reinstated its offshore debt sales programme in 2017, attracted $27.2 billion in orders, the term-sheet showed.
China has issued four dollar bonds and one euro bond in the past three years.
The debt was priced at 25 basis points above U.S. Treasuries for the $1.25 billion three-year tranche, 30 basis points for the $2.25 billion 5-year tranche, 50 basis points for the $2 billion 10-year tranche and 80 basis points for the $500 million 30-year tranche, the term-sheet showed.
""The successful issuance of the U.S. sovereign bonds has helped establish and improve a yield benchmark of more market significance for Chinese issuers,"" China's finance ministry said in a statement. 
It was the first time China has offered debt to U.S.-based investors who were most active in the longer-dated tranches of the transaction.
U.S investors, primarily fund managers, were the largest buyers of the 30-year tranche, picking up 47% of the $500 million sold, according to the term-sheet.
The rising tensions between Washington and Beijing did not deter U.S.-based investors from participating in the deal, according to one person with direct knowledge of the matter.
The person could not be named because he was not authorised to speak to media.
""We did not see the geopolitical situation scaring people away,"" he said.
The deal was finalised on Wednesday as the stand-off between Washington and Beijing showed no signs of easing.

The U.S. State Department has submitted a proposal for the Trump administration to add China’s Ant Group to a trade blacklist, according to two people familiar with the matter, before the financial technology firm is slated to go public in Shanghai and Hong Kong.

DUESSELDORF/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The German government must swiftly decide on whether it is prepared to take a stake in Thyssenkrupp's (DE:TKAG) ailing steel business, one of the firm's labour leader said, adding steel remained a vital product for the country's car sector.
""Steel is anything but dead,"" Tekin Nasikkol, who chairs the works council of Thyssenkrupp's steel unit and is on the conglomerate's supervisory board, told Reuters. ""I believe a government stake is the right response to the crisis.""
Nasikkol echoed a demand by IG Metall, Germany's most powerful union, for the state to take a stake in the business, which is under pressure from cheap Chinese imports, a weak car market and the coronavirus pandemic.
His comments also come amid fears over whether efforts by Germany to contain the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis preserve jobs by creating a generation of debt-laden ""zombie"" firms with no real future.
""We're not a zombie company. Despite bad management we have been able to pass on billions to the group over the past 10 years,"" Nasikkol said.
He said a quick commitment by the government was needed, adding it would have to be decided in a next step whether Berlin or the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where Thyssenkrupp is based, would provide the bailout.
""We need a decision on what happens next before Christmas,"" Nasikkol said, adding a national steel summit scheduled for Dec. 11 would provide a good opportunity.
The government has said that taking a stake was not the right response.
Thyssenkrupp Steel, which posted a nine-month operating loss of about 700 million euros ($820 million), might also seek tie-ups with rivals such as  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC)  Salzgitter  (DE:SZGG) and SSAB (ST:SSABa), sources said.
But barriers for such a move are high as most peers are barely turning a profit themselves, they said.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>",U.S. set to unveil streamlined commercial space regulations Thursday,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration will unveil final regulations on Thursday on commercial space launch and re-entry license requirements, a senior official told Reuters.
The regulation, which was first proposed in March 2019, consolidates four separate regulations and will apply a single set of licensing and safety rules for all vehicle operations.
Wayne Monteith, the FAA's associate administrator for commercial space transportation, told Reuters on Wednesday that one goal of the regulation was to be ""performance based and not prescriptive.""
A company will be able to get a ""single-five year license to cover multiple launches from multiple locations,"" Monteith added.
The FAA's new rules will bring it in line with the Defense Department's orbit collision avoidance requirements to avoid other satellites or rocket bodies. FAA's prior rules only required avoidance with human-rated vehicles.
Monteith said the new rules will ""unleash the ability of industry to innovate"" and will allow U.S. regulators to handle the expected surge in commercial launches.
U.S. companies like Elon Musk's SpaceX and Amazon.com (O:AMZN) plan to launch thousands of satellites into orbit in the coming years.
In July, Amazon said it would invest more than $10 billion to build a network of 3,236 satellites to provide high-speed broadband internet. SpaceX is building a network of roughly 12,000 satellites for its Starlink constellation in low Earth orbit.
The rule will become effective in about 90 days. The FAA plans workshops Nov. 4-6 to explain how industry will be impacted by the new requirements.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao noted in 2019, when the rules were proposed, that it had been 12 years since launch vehicle rules were updated. She said the regulation ""streamlines the licensing process, enables flexible timeframes, (and) redefines when launch begins.""

1362,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 06:01AM ET</span>","Exclusive: PSA to ditch its two small gasoline city cars, sources say","By Gilles Guillaume
PARIS (Reuters) - PSA (PA:PEUP) is ending the production of  Peugeot  (OTC:PUGOY) and Citroën small city cars, three sources told Reuters, withdrawing from an increasingly unprofitable market as its starts a strategic review ahead of its planned merger with  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA).
While PSA had already agreed to sell its stake in its Czech joint venture with Toyota (T:7203) where the Peugeot 108 and Citroen C1 models are made, the decision to stop selling the gasoline cars altogether has just been taken, the sources said.
Carmakers are reviewing the production of vehicles with combustion engines as they need to fit costly exhaust filtering systems to meet tighter emissions laws. That's pushing up the cost of some so-called entry-level A segment cars to the point where they are hard to justify economically.
""PSA is getting out of both the factory and the A segment business, as it is offered today, and on which manufacturers have arguably lost the most money in Europe,"" one of the sources familiar with the matter said.
PSA declined to comment on the future of the two small cars. It said it was reviewing which products would best meet customer expectations in the A segment and cope with European carbon emissions targets. 
""This means a reflection with fresh and disruptive ideas,"" a spokesman for the French carmaker said.
The European Commission is planning to tighten its emissions limits for cars under new proposals designed to cut the bloc's greenhouse gas output further by 2030.
PSA's merger project with FCA has also increased the options available, two of the sources said, as the Italian-U.S. company has no intention of abandoning its small best-selling Panda and 500 models. Both already have hybrid versions and the 500 is also available in full electric mode.
""Current projects could be replaced by new ones made possible by the merger with FCA"", another source said. ""The merger is turning all the cards around, especially when you consider that the A segment, from the very first 500 to the Panda, is inseparable from Fiat history"". 
FCA declined to comment.
PSA and FCA aim to finalise their merger in the first quarter next year to create a new company called Stellantis, which will be the fourth-biggest automaker in the world. 
MARKET CONTRACTION
The European market for frugal city cars has been shrinking for several years. Its share fell to 7.4% last year from 10.9% in 2010 while slightly larger and more profitable vehicles in the B segment maintained their share at 30%, IHS Markit data show. 
As part of a profitability drive, PSA has already discontinued production of two smaller Opel models - the Adam city car and the entry-level Karl - as part of an overhaul of the German brand. 
Despite their miniature engines and light weight, which theoretically made them suitable for cities, automakers have struggled to make their smallest cars profitable. 
Some carmakers, such as  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) which makes the Smart car, or  Renault  (PA:RENA) with its Twingo, have been forced to invest heavily in all-electric powertrains to improve their emissions profile in Europe. 
PSA also considered electrification as an option for its A segment cars but eventually abandoned the plan, fearing it would remain unprofitable, one of the sources said. 
Several alternatives are being studied, including offering more low-cost electric cars in the style of the new Citroën AMI, which is assembled in Morocco, or vehicles in the B segment with a more accessible price, the source said.
While talks about which architecture A segment Stellantis cars will use remain open, PSA is keen to retain a technological lead in the B segment, which includes models such as its popular Peugeot 208 and Opel Corsa. 
Earlier this year, FCA sent a letter to its suppliers telling them the company's next three B segment cars would be based on PSA's modular CMP platform and produced internally under licence. 

PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares, who will head Stellantis, has said repeatedly that he saw no need to scrap any brands following the merger.

1363,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 05:51AM ET</span>",Pirelli reboots its R&D to stay on track through the pandemic,"By Stephen Jewkes
MILAN (Reuters) - When the coronavirus pandemic forced Italian tyremaker Pirelli (MI:PIRC) to temporarily shut its factories in March, R&D chief Pierangelo Misani needed a rapid rethink.
With a new range of products due to be launched by early next year at the latest, Misani scrambled technicians and IT teams to get more research and development shifted online so locked down engineers could test materials and tyres virtually.
The pandemic has disrupted production and sales for tyremakers worldwide - Pirelli's revenue fell by a third in the first six months of 2020 - and it needed to keep its new tyre development on track for an expected sales rebound next year.
""There are moments of crisis, like COVID, when you have to reshape and make yourself more efficient and that's what we're doing,"" Misani told Reuters.
Pirelli has 19 plants in 12 countries and is the only major manufacturer working solely in the consumer tyre market, supplying high-end tyres for cars, motorcycles and bicycles - as well as Formula 1 racing cars.
Like companies throughout the auto industry, Pirelli has been going digital for years as cheaper computing power and advanced software programmes made virtual engineering possible.
But it also continues with on-the-road testing of a number of factors where it is still better to do so in a physical setting.
As part of its digital drive, Pirelli had been drafting in younger IT staff - engineers with different skillsets, able to match vehicle dynamics and modelling know-how as costly road testing slowly makes way for virtual testing.
""Changing the engineering profile is the biggest challenge for the auto industry,"" Misani said.
WRAP-AROUND SCREEN
In recent years, the company headquartered in Milan in northern Italy has spent more than 6% of revenue on average from its so-called high-value tyres on R&D, one of the highest levels among rivals.
While some tests such as noise and aquaplaning can be done reliably using full simulation, others such as tyre endurance still need physical fine-tuning in lengthy road trials to check things such as handling and driving characteristics.
But with the lockdown making it impossible to drive cars round for thousands of miles, Misani's team needed solutions. So he turned to its new tyre development simulator unveiled early this year which drew on years of virtual work in Formula 1.
The system uses a wrap-around 210-degree panoramic screen built around a static car wired up to reproduce the sensations any driver would feel in a real car - the seat, steering wheel, seat belts, shaker systems.
It cuts lead times by 30% and the number of physical prototypes needed.
As the lockdown bit, Misani's team stepped up remote drives, developing a series of ""off-line"" simulations. These allowed engineers to do some tests on their PCs at home connected to the Pirelli server, where the computing programmes are run.
""What surprised us was the speed and acceleration of the whole thing. If before we were at 70% simulation, now we're suddenly at 80%,"" Misani said. ""And it's going to grow.""
READY FOR LAUNCH
Misani said the best results have been in the replacement market where it is due to launch three new product lines by the start of 2021 - an ultra-high performance tyre for summer use, a brand new all-season tyre and a new winter tyre.
""The epidemic prompted us to engineer tools to boost simulation and modeling and we'll be ready in plenty of time for the launch,"" Misani said. 
Things have been a little slower in the so-called original equipment sector where the company sells direct to automakers as it is tied to the development times for the cars themselves. 
""There's been some delay though it's not as bad as we thought since carmakers have also tried to upgrade their IT platforms in this period,"" he said.
Pirelli has development centres around the world in Germany, South America, the United States and China. It also has testing facilities at its factories.
While going virtual does remove the need to pay for physical testing environments, part of the savings are then reinvested in new tools, software licences and IT infrastructure. 
But Misani says bumping up simulator programming and virtual testing will help save and, more importantly, speed up the time it takes to develop products and get them to market.

""What we're doing is not streamlining or rightsizing R&D - we're reshaping it.""

1364,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 05:38AM ET</span>",StockBeat: The Dam Breaks in Europe,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were on course for their worst day in over three weeks on Thursday, as the tightening of measures across the Continent to bring the Covid-19 pandemic back under control led investors to abandon hopes of a recovery in the near term.
By 5:35 AM ET (0935 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 8.4 points, or 2.3%, at 326.24, its lowest in two weeks. The German DAX led the losses with a 3.0% decline, while France’s CAC 40 fell 2.4% and the U.K. FTSE 100 fell 2.3%.  
The euro, meanwhile, fell 0.3% to a two-week low of $1.1707 against the dollar, while the yield on the German 10-Year bond, the continent’s risk-free benchmark, plummeted to its lowest since March, at -0.62%.
The latest catalyst for the sell-off was the imposition of a curfew on major cities in France, where new infections are running at a rate of over 22,000 a day.  That fed into a building narrative that European governments are behind the curve in stopping the virus’ spread, reluctant to engage in another bout of economic self-harm with more stringent lockdown measures.
“I’m not satisfied,” Der Spiegel reported German Chancellor Angela Merkel as saying late on Wednesday after a meeting with regional politicians. Such measures as had been agreed “aren’t hard enough to prevent disaster,” Merkel reportedly said. 
Similar struggles are playing out across Europe. In the U.K., cities such as Manchester are fiercely resisting central government’s attempts to impose the toughest of three new levels of restrictions on non-essential activity. That is stoking grievances and public defiance in neighboring Liverpool, which is already under tier 3 restrictions. The U.K.'s chief scientific advisor has already dismissed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's new system in much the same terms as Merkel used on Wednesday   In Spain, central government has had to impose a state of emergency in the capital Madrid after it overturned in court initial measures aimed at fighting the virus.
The fear of ever-tighter measures is a very clear negative for Europe’s stock markets, which are more heavily weighted to cyclical stocks than to growth and momentum stocks. The STOXX Automobiles & Parts index fell 3.9% in early Thursday trading, while the Stoxx 600 Banks index fell 2.6%. Ryanair (LON:RYA) shares fell 3.5% after the continent’s biggest airlines said it will cut its winter schedule more than it first planned, to only 40% of capacity. More troubled travel stocks, such as Europcar (PA:EUCAR) and  Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA  (OL:NORR), skidded closer to zero.
As in the U.S., there is a world of difference between the present wave of the pandemic and the first one that hit in the spring. Higher infection rates are to a large degree the result of greatly expanded testing.  The virus is also more present in younger people who are less likely to require hospitalization or suffer lasting harm.  In Italy, which had the worst first wave in continental Europe, number of Covid-19 patients fell from a peak of over 4,000 in April to only 38 in July. It has now returned to 539, as of Wednesday.
That the number of extreme outcomes is still low compared to spring levels is often lost in an increasingly heated debate that pits the economy against public health.
But for all the differences from the first wave, one truth remains unchanged. Markets are vulnerable whenever the pace of virus spread accelerates, which is something it is doing all across Europe right now. No amount of stimulus, fiscal or monetary, will change that."
1365,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>",Analysis: Stepped up Chinese scrutiny increases investment risk of 'Beast' Ant,"By Cheng Leng and Julie Zhu
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - As Ant Group was working in August towards its giant IPO, at least two smaller Chinese banks with existing ties to the fintech firm decided to stop sourcing new consumer loans from it, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Their moves came after regulators scrutinised banks that used Ant's technology platform excessively for underwriting consumer loans at a time when concerns about defaults and lenders' asset quality grew in a pandemic-hit economy, said the people.
The sharper regulatory focus over Ant's cash cow and rapidly growing consumer lending business to curb financial sector risk has emerged as a key concern for potential investors ahead of its likely $35 billion float, the world's largest.
For its lending business, Ant originates demand from retail consumers and small businesses and passes that on to about 100 banks for underwriting, earning fees from the lenders and putting its own balance sheet at minimum risk. 
Ant's consumer lending balance was 1.7 trillion yuan ($254 billion) as of end-June this year, or 21% of all short-term consumer loans issued by Chinese deposit-taking financial institutions.
""The 'catch me if you can' type of game between regulators and Ant will always be there,"" said Dong Ximiao, chief analyst at the Zhongguancun Internet Finance Institute, a think tank backed by Beijing's Haidian district government.
""But the trend of tight regulations won't go backwards for sure,"" Dong said. ""Regulators are now well aware of how harmful it would be to set free a beast like Ant.""
With its unique business model and the absence of peers in China and elsewhere, analysts say Ant has mainly thrived as a technology platform away from banking sector's regulations despite its bouquet of financial offerings.
Even in the run up to the IPO the company tried to burnish its tech credentials - it changed its name to Ant Group from Ant Financial - and is pushing brokerages to get tech analysts to cover the firm，two separate sources said.
However, regulators are becoming increasingly worried about banks' inadequate risk controls on the consumer loans business and their excessive reliance on external tech platforms such as Ant to tap customers. 
This year, regulators and the top court have unveiled new rules, including putting a cap on interest rates that tech platforms can charge for their own lending, to standardise practices and protect bank balance sheets.
REGULATORY WARNING
The decision of two smaller banks to stop bringing in new consumer loan business via Ant came after the PBOC kicked off a survey in July to investigate the bad loan ratio of banks' such co-lending business, said the people.
The people, who received the PBOC guidance and have direct knowledge of the banks' actions, declined to be named and didn't want the lenders' names to be mentioned as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Ant, an affiliate of e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (N:BABA), said the information about the action taken by the two smaller banks was ""unsubstantiated"" and that in the past two months the company had tied up with more banking partners.
""Our partner banks manage risk independently and together, we have been facilitating consumer loans with risk management performance and achieved the delinquency rate as low as 2.15% as of July 31, 2020, much lower than industry average,"" it said.
PBOC did not respond to Reuters request for comment.
Starting as a payments processor in 2004, Ant built an empire by offering its users short-term loans that are credited within minutes and selling insurance and investment products.
Ant is targeting a valuation of about $250 billion or more in its IPO, similar to the market cap of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (SS:601398), the No.1 bank by assets globally. 
Graphic - Cosumer credit, not e-payment, now the cash cow for Ant: https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-REGULATIONS/CHART/rlgpdxkjxpo/chart.png
Adding to the risk for potential investors in Ant, the U.S. State Department has submitted a proposal for the Trump administration to add Ant to a trade blacklist, Reuters reported earlier on Thursday. 
And in an indication of the regulatory challenges ahead at home, Li Wei, PBOC's technology department head, during an address at a conference organised by Ant last month, warned banks on their reliance on tech platforms. 

""No matter how the form of financial businesses evolves ... financial institutions should never outsource their key licensed financial credentials to others, and all financial businesses should be licensed and under regulations,"" Li said.

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump administration to consider adding China's Ant Group to trade blacklist - sources,"By Humeyra Pamuk, Alexandra Alper, Karen Freifeld and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has submitted a proposal for the Trump administration to add China's Ant Group to a trade blacklist, according to two people familiar with the matter, before the financial technology firm is slated to go public.
It was not immediately clear when the U.S. government agencies that decide whether to add a company to the so-called Entity List would review the matter. 
The move comes as China hardliners in the Trump administration are seeking to send a message to deter U.S. investors from taking part in the initial public offering for Ant. The dual listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong could be worth up to a record $35 billion.
The latest swipe at China also comes in the run-up to the Nov. 3 election, in which U.S. President Donald Trump, trailing in the polls against his Democratic rival Joe Biden, has made a tough approach to China an important foreign policy platform.
While the Alipay payment app is currently unavailable for American users in the United States, according to a spokesperson for Ant, Trump administration officials fear the Chinese government could access sensitive banking data belonging to future U.S. users. 
A powerful security panel known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) stopped its $1.2 billion bid to buy the money transfer company Moneygram in 2018 over national security risks.
The State Department did not respond to a request for comment. Ant, an affiliate of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988), declined to comment but in a recent statement to Reuters emphasized that only 5% of the company's business is outside China.
""China opposes the U.S. abusing the concept of national security and its national power to oppress foreign countries. This is a bullying practice,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in a regular briefing on Thursday.
""China will continue taking necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,"" he said.
The entity list, which makes it more difficult for U.S. firms to sell high-tech items to blacklisted companies, has become the tool of choice for the Trump administration to punish Chinese companies, though its real-world impact is sometimes questionable. 
While curbing access to U.S. technology deals a blow to companies like Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies, which was added in May 2019, its impact on a fintech giant like Ant is likely to be more symbolic and does not prevent U.S. investors from taking stakes in the firm.
The administration has been largely loathe to use tougher tools against China, such as freezing assets in the United States, which many attribute to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin's dovish stance on Beijing.
Ant is China's dominant mobile payments company, offering loans, payments, insurance and asset management services via mobile apps. Ant is 33% owned by Alibaba and controlled by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.
Ant's Alipay payment platform, like Tencent's WeChat platform, is used primarily by Chinese citizens with accounts in renminbi. Most of its U.S. interactions are with merchants accepting payment from Chinese travelers and businesses in the country.
Senator Marco Rubio, who has successfully urged the Trump administration to pursue investigations of Chinese companies, called last week for the U.S. government to consider options to delay Ant's IPO.
The impact of such blacklisting on firms seeking an IPO is evidenced by the failure of Chinese artificial intelligence firm Megvii Technology to clear a hearing with the Hong Kong exchange last November, en route to a planned listing of $500 million.
The exchange sought more information from Megvii, including details of its suitability for a Hong Kong IPO, after the United States put it on a trade blacklist in October.
The U.S. End User Review Committee, which decides which companies to add to the list, includes the departments of State, Defense, Energy and Commerce. Defense and Commerce declined to comment while Energy did not respond to a request for comment. 
The Hong Kong leg of the IPO is being sponsored by China International Capital Corp,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is working as a joint global coordinator. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is also involved. 

However, approval for the IPO has been delayed. On Tuesday, Reuters reported China's securities regulator is probing a potential conflict of interest in Ant's planned stock listing.

Niel, founder of French broadband provider  Iliad  (PA:ILD), and Unibail's former CEO Leon Bressler said they were heading a consortium of investors with a combined 4.1% stake in the company.
They are opposing Unibail's rights issue - intended to fund the property group's recovery plan - and asked shareholders to vote against it at a general meeting on November 10.
Bressler called the plan ""a misguided act by a management team that remains prisoner of its failed strategy that started with the acquisition of Westfield."" He said the purchase of the Westfield shopping mall business was responsible for Unibail's heavy debt.
""It is time to re-establish URW as Europe’s leading pure-play prime shopping centre business by selling the US portfolio and using proceeds to solve the company’s debt issues,"" he said in a statement.
Unibail agreed to buy Westfield, which is mainly focused on the United States and Britain, in late 2017 for $16 billion.
Bressler said the deal had ""polluted"" the group's dominant position in Europe with a more marginal position in the United States, a less attractive market. 
The group said in September it would speed up a disposal plan of shopping centres, and had identified some 6 billion euros ($7.04 billion) of assets it could sell as the sector faces the fallout from the pandemic.
Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield shares were up more than 5% by 0807 GMT, the only gainers in France's blue chip CAC 40 index (FCHI).

URW operates 89 shopping centres mainly in the United States and in Europe, including those at Forum des Halles in Paris and La Part-Dieu in Lyon, a portfolio that the group valued at 60.4 billion euros as of July 30.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Uber Eats' South African unit on Thursday expanded delivery offerings, launching an app-based over-the-counter medicines service as it seeks to claw market share in the fast-growing online shopping sector in Africa's most industrialised economy.
Uber Eats, a unit of U.S. ride-hailing service Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) already has a lion's share in South Africa's $600 million food dispatching market.
The equally lucrative medicines delivery market is controlled by pharmacy chains Clicks and Dis-Chem, which offered delivery services long before COVID-19 spurred a shift to online shopping.
Analysts say such ""first movers"" including Naspers- owned Takealot, have a natural advantage over newcomers, especially with users increasingly seeking to use fewer smartphone applications to do more things.
But Uber Eats is banking on a ""marketplace"" strategy - combining ride-hailing and grocery deliveries and other services on a single mobile phone app that already has over 2 million users in the country, it said in a statement. 
Its latest foray in the delivery sector is in partnership with local health group Medicare, which operates more than 50 clinics and pharmacies around the country, and will allow its app users to purchase over-the-counter medication.
""The nationwide lockdown and restriction in movement created an immediate need to accelerate our business in increasing the accessibility to daily essentials,"" general manager of Uber Eats South Africa Shane Austin told Reuters.
""Which is part of the reason our focus has been towards on-boarding various other merchants onto the app, aside from just restaurants.""

In its latest Digital Market Outlook, information portal Statista predicted South Africa's e-commerce market would see annual compound growth of 11% up to 2024, with the number of online shoppers growing to nearly 37 million from around 25 million currently.

""With the prospect of an imminent U.S. stimulus plan diminishing by the day (and) rising infection rates prompting tighter restrictions across Europe, is it any wonder that investors are starting to get a little twitchy?"" said Michael Hewson, market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
European stock markets have bounced from the coronavirus lows hit in March on a raft of global stimulus, but sentiment has recently taken a hit from a surge in infections as well as signs of a slowing economic rebound. 
France has imposed curfews and other European nations are closing schools and cancelling surgeries in an attempt to contain the resurgence ahead of the winter season.
Bourses in France (FCHI), Italy (FTMIB), Spain (IBEX) and Germany (GDAXI) fell between 1.7% and 2.0%.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Thursday, with investors worrying about resurgent Covid-19 infections stifling economic activity as hopes die of U.S. stimulus before the election.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 2.4% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 1.8%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 2.2%.
Concerns that a resurgence in the Covid-19 pandemic could lead governments throughout Europe to shut down their economies again has hit the confidence of investors, particularly after the recent stock rally.
New cases are hitting 100,000 daily in Europe. Nearly 20,000 infections were reported in Britain, while the French government on Wednesday declared a public health state of emergency. Hospital admissions are also now clearly on an upward trend, although the number of deaths is still far below the spring peaks.
Germany, France, the U.K., and others are in the process of instituting measures such as limited lockdowns, bar closures and other systems intended to reduce the spread of infection.

The government will waive about 50% of landing fees from August through next March, said the sources, who declined to be identified because the information is not public. They added that the announcement was likely to come as early as Friday.
The measure will apply to 14 government-operated airports, the sources said.
The transport ministry could not immediately be reached for comment.
The relief is the latest step to prop up Japanese carriers and comes as banks including the state-backed Development Bank of Japan have provided ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202) $3.8 billion in subordinated loans to help it weather the pandemic, sources told Reuters on Wednesday.
While Japanese airlines have seen some rebound in domestic flight demand, helped by a government travel campaign, bookings remain below last year's levels.
That means carriers are burning through cash to maintain jets that are either grounded or flying with too few passengers.
The aviation lobby group, which is comprised of 19 airlines including ANA and Japan Airlines (JAL) (T:9201), in March called for the government to exempt landing fees as the number of passengers sharply decreased amid the pandemic.

ANA reported a 159 billion yen operating loss in the April-June period, while JAL posted a 131 billion yen operating loss for the three months.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Thursday, with investors fretting about resurgent Covid-19 infections as well as troubled Brexit talks.
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.7% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.6%. 
Concerns that a resurgence in the Covid-19 pandemic could lead governments throughout Europe to shut down their economies again has hit the confidence of investors, particularly after the recent stock rally.
New cases are hitting 100,000 daily in Europe. Nearly 20,000 infections were reported in Britain, while the French government on Wednesday declared a public health state of emergency.
Germany, France, the U.K., and others are in the process of instituting measures such as limited lockdowns, bar closures and other systems intended to reduce the spread of infection. 
This is occurring while doubts are emerging over the speed at which vaccines will be approved. Despite the global push for a Covid-19 vaccine, with dozens in clinical trials and hopes for initial inoculations this year, WHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan reiterated Wednesday that mass shots were unlikely to be widely available in the near future.
At the same time, businesses and markets within Europe are becoming increasingly jittery about uncertain trading rules between the world's largest trading bloc and the sixth-biggest economy as the year-end deadline to put a post-Brexit deal in place nears.
European Union leaders are set to meet in Brussels later Thursday to discuss progress, amid few signs of compromise on the tricky issues of fisheries, fair competition and dispute resolution.
In corporate news, Swiss pharmaceutical major Roche (SIX:RO) said Thursday that sales fell in the period from January to September compared with the previous year, but it backed its outlook for 2020.

1377,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 01:09AM ET</span>",Clock Ticks For Banks to Comply With Trump’s Hong Kong Sanctions,"(Bloomberg) -- The countdown has begun on whether banks will be ensnared in the Trump administration’s sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials, singled out for contributing to a clampdown on political freedoms in the Asian hub.
A U.S. report to Congress on Wednesday named 10 officials, including Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and Xia Baolong, the head of China’s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, over their role in implementing a new security law in the former British colony. The State Department list reinforced sanctions imposed in August under an executive order, which had included one additional name.
Officials in the U.S. now have 60 days to identify banks that have business with those on the list, putting lenders at risk of being sanctioned. Banks operating in Hong Kong, including  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). as well as major Chinese lenders, have already been taking steps to ensure they are compliant with U.S. laws.
The follow up will identify “any foreign financial institutions that knowingly conduct a significant transaction with the foreign persons listed in this report,” the State Department said based on what’s laid out in the Hong Kong Autonomy Act.
Citigroup in August took steps to suspend accounts linked to some of the targeted individuals, a person familiar with the matter said at the time. Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc, based in London, has also reviewed whether it has relationships with any of the officials and will monitor their transactions, another person said.
Even China’s largest state-run banks moved to comply, seeking to safeguard their access to crucial dollar funding and overseas networks. Major lenders with operations in the U.S. including Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) Corp., and China Merchants Bank Co. have turned cautious on opening new accounts for the 11 officials, including Lam, people familiar with the matter have said.
China’s state-owned lenders need to preserve their access to global financial markets. The four largest banks had $1.2 trillion in dollar funding at the end of June.

Performance data on the fund's website http://www.ajopartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AJO-U.S.-Equity-Performance-20Q3.pdf showed a number of its funds were down sharply for the year to Sept. 30, with its Large Cap Absolute Value strategy, which has more than $5 billion, down 15% and Small Cap Absolute Value down 21%.
""Our relative performance has suffered because our investment edge, our ""secret sauce,"" is at odds with many forces driving the market,"" founder Ted Aronson said in a memo provided by a company representative to Reuters.
""However, the drought in value — the longest on record — is at the heart of our challenge.""
Aronson wrote the length and the severity of the headwinds ""have led to lingering viability concerns among clients, consultants, and employees.""
Value stocks or shares of economically sensitive companies have been among the laggards in the market's rally from its lows in March. Related sectors such as retail have struggled as their business models get disrupted in a shift to a more tech-driven world.

(Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) cut the price of its Model S ""Long Range"" sedan in the United States to $69,420, its website showed, following a tweet https:// flagging the cut earlier on Wednesday from Chief Executive Elon Musk.
The cut is Tesla's second this week for the high-end sedan, following a 4% cut to $71,990 on Tuesday.
Tesla shares closed 3.3% higher at $461.30 on Wednesday and were little changed in after-hours trade.
The company also on Tuesday reduced by 3% the price of its Model S in China, where it had previously cut the starting price of its Model 3 sedan.
The starting price for Model S is now a thousand times that of a pair of red satin shorts that Tesla started selling in July for ""$69.420"" to poke fun at the company's naysayers.
Tesla introduced its Model S in 2012, but in recent years the car has faced competition from the automaker's less expensive, mass-market Model 3 sedan, launched in 2017, which currently starts at $37,990. The Model S makes up only around 5% of Tesla's unit volume, said a  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst in a client note on Wednesday.
The analyst said the Model S price reduction was likely in response to price cuts by electric vehicle startup Lucid Motors, which sells its luxury sedan Air model at a starting price of $69,900. That includes a $7,500 U.S. government electric vehicle tax credit, for which Tesla vehicles are no longer eligible.
The price cuts also come as competition in the electric vehicle market - long dominated by Tesla - heats up, with several automakers launching new electric vehicles next year.

Germany's  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) is scheduled to release an electric version of its Mercedes-Benz S-class luxury sedan, the EQS, next year. Analysts expect the EQS to be significantly more expensive than the Model S, however, with the latest version of the gasoline-powered S-class retailing at more than 100,000 euros ($117,500).

Investing.com – Asian Pacific markets were mostly down on Thursday morning, with U.S. COVID-19 stimulus looking increasingly unlikely before their elections and the rapid spread of COVID-19, especially in Europe. Increased U.S.-China tension is also a negative for investor confidence.
The Shanghai Composite inched down 0.08% at 11:05 PM ET (3:05 AM GMT) and Shenzhen’s SZSE Composite edged down 0.14%.
Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that the consumer price index gained 1.7% year-on-year in September, down from the predicted 1.8% rise and August’s 2.4% growth. The country's producer price index fell 2.1% year-on-year, more than the forecast 1.8% fall and the 2% fall reported in August.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.69% and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.83%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.15%.

The poor outlook for an agreement on U.S. COVID-19 relief measures dogged U.S. markets in the last session and negative sentiment spilled over into early Asian Pacific trading. Talks between U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are currently deadlocked ahead of the presidential elections.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had this to say: “The clock will not stop ... I’d say, at this point, getting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult, just given where we are in the level of details, but we’re going to try to continue to work through these issues.”
“This has been an ongoing drama ...the latest twist I heard is nothing is going to get done until the election. That’s why I think you’re getting the market selling off a little bit,""  Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management, told Bloomberg.
In Europe, the COVID-19 pandemic is resurging across the region, with major economies beginning to put in place stricter containment measures. Germany, France, the U.K., and others are in the process of instituting measures such as school closures, limited lockdowns, and other systems intended to reduce the infection spread. In consequence, expectations of economic recovery are being sharply limited, leading to further investor disenchantment.
Developments in the U.S.-China ongoing tensions are also cause for downward pressure, with the U.S. State Department proposing that the Trump administration place China’s Ant Group Hong Kong IPO on a trade blacklist. Ant Group is the financial technology arm of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA).

1381,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 10:27PM ET</span>",Billionaire Rides Cooking Oil Dominance to Record China IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- Kuok Khoon Hong pulled off a remarkable second act. The billionaire sold shares of his China business in the biggest ever initial public offering on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, thanks to the most popular cooking oil brand in the country.
Kuok’s Yihai Kerry Arawana Holdings Co. almost doubled when the stock debuted on the ChiNext board on Thursday after its IPO raised 13.9 billion yuan ($2 billion). Its namesake cooking oil with a Golden Dragon Fish logo has been a staple of Chinese kitchens for decades and fueled demand 3,499 times the amount of shares offered to retail investors online.
After starting production in 1991 from the mainland’s first packed oil production line, the unit of Kuok’s Wilmar International Ltd. now has 40% of a Chinese edible oil market that consumes almost 40 million tons annually. The IPO came just three years after the country opened doors for foreign firms to invest in the oilseeds crushing sector, allowing global powerhouses such as  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) Ltd. and Cargill Inc. to take on local rivals including Arawana and state-run Cofco Corp.
“Yihai Kerry Arawana has tremendous controlling power in its own market, with a solid sales performance even during the lockdown period of the coronavirus,” Wang Ling, a Beijing-based analyst with Sinolink Securities Co., said in a telephone interview.
Wang expects expansion after the IPO will lead to an all-around capacity increase in Arawana’s oilseed crushing and grain processing operations, boosting both its revenue and net income in the three years through 2022. Arawana’s shares opened up 91% to 48.96 yuan ($7.29) per share and traded at 40.48 yuan at 9:52 a.m. local time, compared with the IPO price of 25.70 yuan,
The share sale surpassed CGN Power Co.’s 12.6 billion yuan listing in 2019 to be the largest IPO ever in Shenzhen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Kuok’s IPO of Arawana follows his success in turning Wilmar, with annual revenue of more than $40 billion, into the world’s biggest palm-oil business. Shares of the Singapore-based commodities giant fell 4.7% in early Singapore trade, paring this year’s gain to 7.8%. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. owns more than 20% of Wilmar.
Arawana pitched the IPO as a reflection of its position in China and a bet on the country’s future, it said in a statement on its website last month. The company had revenue of 171 billion yuan in 2019 with net income of 5.56 billion yuan, according to an exchange filing.
The IPO appealed to the mainland’s individual retailers with a promise to share profits with the Chinese people and contribute to the economy of its homeland.
That’s a powerful message in a market where individual investors are fueling a share rally, with the value of Chinese domestic equities topping $10 trillion for the first time since 2015. The world’s second-largest stock market has added $3.3 trillion since a low in March, helped by government policies to encourage trading, a flurry of new listings and the strengthening yuan.
Huang Xiong, a 53-year-old from Shanghai, snared an allocation of shares in the IPO and said he was drawn in by Arawana’s strong position in the cooking oil market.
“The product is meeting demand for something that all homes must consume on a daily basis in China,” Huang said in a telephone interview. “Arawana has been in a dominant position here as a brand everybody knows for many years,” he said, adding that a general bullish sentiment in China’s stock market fueled interest.
Yihai Kerry Arawana currently operates more than 70 production bases in China producing cooking oil to rice, flour, diary and other ingredients. It has said the IPO proceeds will be used on 19 food production projects in the country. Kuok has reiterated his confidence in the mainland, even as a deadly pig-killing virus cut demand for animal feed, and the outbreak of coronavirus forced people to dine at home.
In its latest expansion, Arawana will invest 10 billion yuan to build the largest food complex in China’s east, according to the local government. The industrial park located in Jiangsu’s Lusi port will include an edible oil refinery, facilities to crush oilseeds and process rice, as well as piers. The project will target the almost quarter of a billion consumers in China’s rich Yangtze River Delta, a market that includes Shanghai, Nanjing and Hangzhou.

The company, a provider of solar-tracking solutions for utility-scale projects, sold 7 million shares Wednesday for $22 each after marketing them for $19 to $21 apiece, according to a statement. ATI Investment Parent LLC, an entity controlled by Oaktree Capital Group LLC, sold 40.5 million shares.
The company, based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, increased the size of the sale from 33.75 million shares on Tuesday. Array Technologies has a market value of about $2.8 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
ATI will own most of the company’s stock after the listing, according to its filings.
The public debut of Array Technologies comes amid a surge in investor interest for green stocks and equities with an ESG bent.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of 25 state attorneys general oppose a settlement of U.S. opioid probes being negotiated with Purdue Pharma LP and members of the wealthy Sackler family who own it, arguing the deal would improperly entangle state and local officials with future sales of the company's addictive pain drug OxyContin.
In a letter to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, the state attorneys general take issue with the Justice Department's condition that Purdue transform into a ""public benefit company"" that would be run on behalf of thousands of U.S. communities suing the drugmaker and Sackler family members. The letter cited a previous Reuters report detailing discussions to resolve the investigations.
One controversial aspect of that proposal is that the entity would steer proceeds from continued sales of OxyContin to those litigants, which include myriad state and local governments.
The attorneys general say the proposal ""compromises the proper roles of the private sector and government"" as officials attempt to hold alleged perpetrators of the nation's opioid crisis accountable, according to a copy of the correspondence reviewed by Reuters. They contend Purdue should instead be sold to a private buyer, adding that one unidentified suitor for the company has emerged.
Representatives for Purdue, Sackler family members tied to the company and the Justice Department declined to comment.
The opposition, including by the attorneys general from Massachusetts, New York and California, could complicate negotiations to resolve both the Justice Department probes and thousands of lawsuits alleging Purdue and Sackler family members aggressively marketed prescription painkillers while downplaying their abuse and overdose risks, according to people familiar with the process.
Sustained opposition to the proposed settlement could also result in legal fees that drain Purdue's bankruptcy estate while adding uncertainty to the drugmaker's attempted reorganization.
The outcome of the settlement talks will help determine how much money U.S. communities receive to address a public health crisis that has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in the United States since 1999. The company and family deny they contributed to the opioid crisis and said their prescription drugs included proper warnings.
The letter, which was later publicly released, was signed mostly by Democratic state attorneys general. In the case of New Hampshire, it includes the signature of the deputy to that state's Republican attorney general.

BILLIONS IN OPIOID PROFIT
Purdue, which filed for bankruptcy last year facing an onslaught of litigation, and its owners are attempting to settle widespread opioid litigation under terms that require it to also resolve Justice Department probes. 
While many states have opposed a settlement proposal from Purdue and the Sacklers, the states remain in court-supervised mediation in an attempt to resolve the litigation on terms the parties find acceptable. 
Over the years, Purdue reaped billions of dollars in profit from its opioids, enriching Sackler family members, and funneled illegal kickbacks to doctors and pharmacies, federal prosecutors and state attorneys general have alleged. The company and family have denied the allegations.
Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue has proposed transforming into a public benefit company that it estimates will deliver more than $10 billion to plaintiffs, partly through millions of doses of lifesaving opioid addiction and overdose reversal medications the company is developing. 
The Sacklers would contribute $3 billion, cede ownership of Purdue, and potentially pay more through the later sale of another pharmaceutical business they own. Some state attorneys general have demanded the Sacklers contribute more. 
Purdue is nearing an agreement to plead guilty to criminal charges as part of a broader deal to resolve the Justice Department probes, Reuters previously reported.
The settlement under discussion includes a $2 billion criminal forfeiture that the Justice Department is prepared to largely waive if Purdue steers that money to communities harmed by opioids and receives bankruptcy-court approval to become a public benefit company as it envisioned.
That proposed restructuring aims in part to allow U.S. communities to supervise sales of OxyContin that patients still use to manage pain as opposed to transferring the business to another private for-profit company. 
In their letter to Barr, states said the Justice Department should not express a view on the proposal.
""If DOJ insists the Sacklers get their way and their OxyContin business is elevated into a public trust, Americans will question whether billionaires bought special treatment in this case, while working families across the country suffered,"" they wrote.

Members of the Sackler family linked to Purdue are expected to face a civil financial penalty while avoiding criminal charges in the proposed settlement, Reuters previously reported. The Justice Department settlement talks are fluid and some of the terms could change as discussions continue, according to people familiar with the matter.

The bank believes some of its staffers made ""false representations in applying for coronavirus relief funds for themselves"", defrauding the U.S. Small Business Administration, David Galloreese, head of Human Resources, said in an internal memo seen by Reuters. 
The abuse was tied to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program and outside the employees' roles at the bank, the memo said, adding Wells Fargo will cooperate fully with law enforcement. 
""These wrongful actions were personal actions, and do not involve our customers.""

(Reuters) - United Airlines said on Wednesday it cut operating costs by 59% in the third quarter and had nearly $20 billion of liquidity to position it for an eventual recovery from the COVID-19 crisis that has hammered the travel industry. 
Airline executives have signaled a slow but steady improvement in leisure demand but do not foresee a recovery to 2019 levels for at least two years, with business and international travel particularly slow to bounce back amid ongoing travel restrictions. 
When the rebound finally arrives, airlines want to have a cost structure and network in place.
""We're ready to turn the page on seven months that have been dedicated to developing and implementing extraordinary and often painful measures, like furloughing 13,000 team members, to survive the worst financial crisis in aviation history,"" said United CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX).
He acknowledged, however, that the ""negative impact of COVID-19 will persist in the near term.""
Shares closed down about 1% at $35.61 before the results were released and were down 1.37% in after-hours trading.
Chicago-based United said its daily cash burn slowed to an average $25 million in the quarter ended September from $40 million in the second quarter, and included $4 million per day in severance and debt payments.
Including voluntary departures, United said it has cut its workforce by 22,000 employees, leading to roughly $765 million in pretax costs in the third quarter.
United had $19.4 billion of liquidity at Sept. 30.
Revenue fell 78% to $2.49 billion, slowing from a plunge of about 87% in the previous quarter and helped by a 50% jump in revenue from its cargo business.
The airline will face increasing competition on its home turf next year after low-cost rival Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) said this week it plans to add service at two United hub airports: Chicago O'Hare and Houston's George Bush Intercontinental.
United said its quarterly adjusted loss was $2.37 billion, or $8.16 per share, compared with adjusted net income of $1 billion, or $4.07 per share, a year earlier.
Rival Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) posted a $5.4 billion quarterly loss on Tuesday, while Southwest and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) are due to report next week.

United management will hold an investor call on Thursday at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT).

The third-largest U.S. bank has dismissed all charges against Investcorp Credit Management LLC, which it said had received $18.9 million from Citi's accidental payment.
""We are pleased to have these funds returned,"" said Citigroup in a statement. 
Citi had sued a dozen firms for refusing to return the payment after an ""operational error"" caused the bank to transfer $900 million of its own funds to Revlon creditors, a blunder that led to costly litigation, regulatory consent orders and a $400-million penalty.

Since then, Citi has announced that Chief Executive Mike Corbat would retire earlier than expected, with current president Jane Fraser set to succeed him.

The lawsuit claims the company's ""oppressive and dangerous"" policies violated public-nuisance laws and exacerbated COVID-19 hazards, according to the report.
The employees at a warehouse in Staten Island, New York claimed that Amazon had not been honest and forthcoming with plaintiffs or the court about not disciplining workers for falling short of the company's quotas for the number of tasks they complete each hour, Bloomberg reported.
Amazon says worker safety is its top priority, but employees at several facilities in different states claim their well-being takes a back seat to quickly shipping customers' orders, Bloomberg reported.
""We have reinstated a portion of our process where a fraction of employees, less than 5% on average, may receive coaching for improvement as a result of extreme outliers in performance,"" Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said in a statement.
All of the company's measures continue to provide additional time for workers to practice social distancing, wash their hands and clean their work stations whenever needed, Lighty added.
German trade union Verdi had called on workers at seven Amazon warehouses to go on two-day strike over better pay and conditions on Tuesday to coincide with the global Prime Day promotion event.

During the annual shopping event that spans several countries, Amazon typically offers heavy discounts and free shipping for its Prime members to boost sales.

Investing.com - United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) reported on Wednesday third-quarter results that missed analysts' forecasts on both the top and bottom lines as the impact of the pandemic on air travel weighed on performance.
United Airlines Holdings shares lost 1.21% in after-hours trade following the report.
United Airlines Holdings announced a loss per share of $8.16 on revenue of $2.49 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated LPS of $-7.57 on revenue of $2.54 billion.
The miss on topline comes as passenger revenue slumped 84% year-over-year.
The company reported that cost cuts had helped improved its cash burn and said it had enough liquidity to weather the impact of the pandemic.
Operating costs were cut by 59% compared with the prior-year period, and the company achieved an average daily cash burn during the third quarter of $25, compared with the second-quarter average daily cash burn of $40 million.
The company's available liquidity at the end of the third quarter 2020 was approximately $19.4 billion.
United Airlines Holdings shares are down 60% from the beginning of the year, still down 63% from its 52 week high of $95.16 set on Nov. 7. They are under-performing the Nasdaq which is up 31.16% from the start of the year.

Investing.com -- Stocks dropped for a second day in a row after the Treasury Secretary threw cold water on hopes for a stimulus agreement before the election.
According to Steven Mnuchin, the two sides are still far apart on some issues. Republicans offered a $1.8 trillion deal while Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have resisted, saying it doesn’t go far enough. The Democrats’ own package is around $2.2 trillion.
It was a reversal of gains notched earlier in the day on positive earnings reports from some of the biggest U.S. banks. Big tech faltered, tracking declines by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) shares touched a 52-week high as the return to restaurants after Covid lockdowns helped boost sales. Shipping company FedEx (NYSE:FDX) also hit a 52-week high. 
Data are due out on jobs and oil inventories, a closely watched measure of demand that traders use to judge the strength of the economic recovery.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow.
1. Another pandemic winner?
Over the last few weeks, a long list of pandemic winners and losers has been revealed, as consumers continue to shop online and order restaurant food even if they aren't traveling and staying in hotels. Restaurants were hard hit during the Covid lockdowns, but the third quarter showed that at least some of them are on the rebound, even as the threat of future lockdowns looms large in new Covid hotspots. 
Shares of fast food giant McDonalds hit a 52-week high of $227.82 on Wednesday. Last week, the hamburger and fries seller said third quarter comparable sales were stronger than expected, falling just 2.2%. It also cited strong average check growth. 
On Wednesday, rival Restaurant Brands International Inc (NYSE:QSR) International, said comparable sales at Burger King are seen falling 7% for the quarter, though that is an improvement from the 13% decline in the prior quarter.
2. Another reading on employment trends
Thursday is jobs day every week as the government releases the latest data on new unemployment claims. Initial claims, which will be released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) are expected to be 825,000, down slightly from the 840,000 reported for the previous week. Continuing claims are expected to be 10.7 million, also down slightly from 10.9 million the prior week.
3. A fresh reading on oil demand after a hurricane
After a one-day holiday delay, the Energy Information Administration will release its weekly crude oil inventory numbers at 11:00  AM ET (1500 GMT) on Thursday. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect stockpiles to fall by 2.8 million barrels after a 500,000 barrel build the prior week. Declining crude stocks could indicate increased demand, though last week production was interrupted by a hurricane hitting the U.S. Gulf coast.

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 04:35PM ET</span>",Latin American borrowers dial up sustainability efforts,"By Aaron Weinman
NEW YORK (LPC) - Latin America’s largest corporate borrowers are doubling down on their commitment to sustainable finance, tying new bank loans to key performance indicators that ensure companies adhere to more transparent environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics.
Mexican cement maker Cemex amended approximately US$3.2bn in existing bank loans to tie its debt costs to sustainability-linked targets. Millicom International Cellular, which focuses on Latin American telecommunications with its brand Tigo, is also in discussions with lenders about refinancing a US$600m revolving credit facility with sustainability-linked pricing, according to two sources familiar with the deals.
Latin American economies rely heavily on high carbon-emitting industries such as mining and oil and gas. But momentum is growing for ESG-linked financing in the region as borrowers seek to minimize their carbon footprint and bolster standings with banks and investors.
Sustainable or socially responsible lending topped more than US$345bn globally at the end of August, up nearly 11% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv LPC data. Environmental issues alongside diversity and social governance are driving growth in such debt instruments, while banks and investors are ramping up demands for heightened accountability from corporate borrowers.
Cemex’s loans and Millicom’s potential refinancing follow two transactions that were completed over the summer in Chile. Pulp and paper company Empresas CMPC and glass bottle maker Cristalerias Toro signed US$100m and US$40m loans tied to sustainable metrics in August and July, respectively.
BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) was sustainability coordinator on CMPC’s loan, according to a press release from the bank on August 7. Santander (MC:SAN) said it closed the transaction for Cristalerias Toro in a press release on July 13.
“Looking at the deals that have been done this year (sustainability-linked financing) has taken off. There’s a concerted effort across the region, from smaller, green loans to larger mandates across different sectors,” said Anne van Riel, co-head of sustainable finance capital markets at BNP Paribas.
BNP Paribas was also the sustainability coordinator on Cemex’s transaction, the two sources familiar said. A spokesperson for the bank declined to comment on the transaction and a spokesperson for Cemex did not respond to a request for comment.
Scotiabank and BNP Paribas, meanwhile, are lead bookrunners on the deal for Millicom, while Norwegian bank DNB is the sustainability coordinator, a third source familiar with the deals said. Spokespersons for Scotiabank and Millicom did not respond to a request for comment. Spokespersons for BNP Paribas and DNB declined to comment.
TRAILBLAZER
BNP Paribas, meanwhile, was the top-ranked lender globally for green or ESG-related loans for the first eight months of 2020, according to Refinitiv LPC data. The bank is also carving out a reputation as a sustainability coordinator for lending in Latin America, according to one senior banker at a rival institution.
The French lender has notched up sustainability mandates for CMPC and now Cemex and expects competition among banks to heat up for future ESG-linked loans.
“Banks have been hiring to ramp up their sustainable financing capabilities. This is important, and to make an impact as a financial institution, we can’t do that by ourselves,” said BNP Paribas’ van Riel. “Ultimately, we’re in competition to structure these deals, but we have a credible legacy and an understanding of how to carry this out.”
Meanwhile, the deal for Cemex shows the cement maker’s commitment toward being a better corporate citizen and offers it a chance to lower borrowing costs. Sustainability metrics, aligned with Cemex’s Climate Action strategy, will be measured annually and could increase or decrease the price of its loans by five basis points, the company said in a press release on Tuesday.
Cemex will implement metrics to its bank loans, including reducing carbon dioxide emissions per cement product and power consumption from green energy in cement, among others, the company said.
“By doing these deals, there is a potential discount that makes (sustainability-linked loans) more palatable,” said van Riel. “In the loan market, even if it is a small discount, it attracts issuer interest.”
Cemex said it is extending the maturity on roughly US$1.1bn in term loans to 2025 from 2022, and an approximate US$1.1bn revolving credit facility is being extended by one year to 2023. The cement maker is also prepaying about US$530m in debt amortizing in July 2021.
Cemex is also re-denominating approximately US$313m of US dollar term loan debt and roughly US$82m-equivalent in euros to Mexican pesos.

Pricing on the US dollar loans remains unchanged at 300bp over Libor, according to the banking sources.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Will loan losses from the coronavirus recession get worse, much worse or extremely worse over the next six-to-12 months? All of the above, bank executives said this week.
In reporting third-quarter results, CEOs and finance chiefs at the five biggest U.S. lenders gave a muddled picture of what to expect. Economic conditions improved in recent months thanks to pandemic lockdowns lifting, as well as government assistance and loan forbearance. But it is not clear that stimulus programs will continue or whether the world is headed for a new wave of infections.
""The economy and the markets this year have been defined more than anything else by the impact of the global health-care crisis,"" Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said on Wednesday. ""This has created a sinuous path for the recovery.""
The U.S. job market improved, consumer spending rose and borrowers continued to use extra cash to pay down debt, helping the overall credit picture. Banks put far less money aside for souring loans in the third quarter than they did earlier this year, and haven’t experienced any meaningful loan losses yet.
However, Bank of America,  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) executives warned that losses on various types of loans might not really take shape until next year. For instance, credit-card write-offs usually happen after 180 days of delinquency, and those borrowers are still largely current.
""We're still in the midst of a crisis,"" said Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason. The pandemic has put pressure on Citi's credit card business, because customers used plastic less and paid down debt.
Commercial borrowers facing pandemic-related business pressure are not slacking on payments yet, either.
Bank of America expects commercial losses to be ""lumpy"" next year, depending on what happens to particular companies, Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) Chief Executive David Solomon pointed to the restaurant, hospitality and oil and gas industries as particularly vulnerable.
""There continues to be enormous uncertainty globally in the trajectory of the virus,"" he said.
JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, has become more optimistic about how the pandemic may affect its loan book, with its ""base case"" scenario looking better than it did three months ago.
The bank is far from certain the trajectory will continue though, with CEO Jamie Dimon saying reserves could be off by $10 billion to $20 billion if things get a lot better or worse.

""The economy has materially improved,"" said Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf, pointing to all the factors that have helped buoy the economy for now. ""However, there's still a long way to go, and there remains significant risk to the recovery.""

Apple swung between gains and losses but closed flat; a day earlier it unveiled its new slate of iPhones. Some analysts said iPhone sales are likely to only gather pace in at the start of next year amid delays in shipping.

Stimulus hopes suffered a blow as Mnuchin said it would be ""would be difficult"" to reach a deal on the next round of coronavirus stimulus with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi before the Nov. 3rd election.
The stalled progress on talks come as the White House's improved $1.8 trillion stimulus proposal was deemed insufficient by Pelosi, while Senate Republicans were uneasy about the size of the deal.

1397,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 03:09PM ET</span>",Mysterious Mega-Flows Rotate Through World’s Biggest Tech ETF,"(Bloomberg) -- The amount of cash cycling through one of the world’s largest exchange-traded funds is turning heads across Wall Street.
The $146 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) ETF has seen an average of $1.5 billion per day in flows over the past month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund posted its biggest withdrawal in two decades in late September, followed by its largest influx in the same time period one day later. The ETF lured $3 billion the following week, ahead of a $3 billion exit the next day. This week brought another $3.7 billion inflow in a single day.
While QQQ is one of the most heavily traded ETFs on the market, the consistency and sheer magnitude of the mega-flows has analysts at odds over what’s driving them, given that they don’t appear to line up with any rebalancing schedule or model portfolio shifts. The recent uptick in options activity has spurred speculation that the ETF is being used as a hedging vehicle, while some say that renewed appetite among retail investors is fueling the flows. Others posit that the cash churn amounts to a massive tug-of-war over the outlook for technology shares, which have already rallied an astonishing 73% from March lows.
Options Overflow
The massive cash movements may be a byproduct of building options appetite. Roughly 3.7 million options contracts tied to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). traded on Tuesday, well above the stock’s 20-day average of 1.95 million. Call open interest in  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc., Apple and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). has averaged 12.9 million contracts over the 30 days through Friday, the highest since early 2019.
Typically, dealers selling call options will buy the underlying stock in order to hedge their position. However, given that the so-called FAANG group comprises nearly half of QQQ, buying the ETF works as a “quick and dirty hedge,” according to Steve Sosnick.
“This is where the concentration comes into play,” said Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR). “It would not be surprising that dealers would find themselves hedging the huge call activity with QQQ -- especially when Facebook and Google followed along.”
Retail Resurgence
Other see evidence of individual investors in the massive flows. Retail traders -- locked at home with little to do amid the pandemic -- have emerged as a force in 2020’s stock market rebound, enticed by the prospect of zero fees.
“Right along with the ‘Robinhoodies’, a few large players must be day trading -- such extreme moves aren’t from traditional investors,” said James Pillow, managing director at Moors & Cabot (NYSE:CBT) Inc.
There’s reason to think that day traders have migrated to riskier corners of the ETF universe. The ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ, a triple-leveraged fund that tracks the inverse performance of the Nasdaq 100, saw a record inflow of $239 million this week. Its twin, the ProShares UltraPro QQQ -- which offers three times the returns of the Nasdaq 100, posted a $285 million outflow.
“That tells me there is a lot of day trading going on related to the Nasdaq 100,” said Christian Fromhertz, chief executive officer of Tribeca Trade Group. “They’re super liquid and really move on Covid-related headlines.”
Tug of War
There’s also the possibility that the fund’s traffic is being fueled by investors trying to divine the future path of QQQ. Megacap tech shares have largely powered the stock market higher, buffeted by the “stay-at-home” trade amid the pandemic lockdowns.
However, the outlook is cloudy. Hedge funds and speculators built up the biggest net short position since 2006 in Nasdaq 100 futures at the end of last month, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. While some of those positions have been covered, the latest data show that bearish sentiment is far from dissipated.
“There’s a battle between top callers and those who believe tech has further to run,” said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store. “The swings between massive inflows and outflows reflects that battle.”

1398,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>",High costs haunt Wells Fargo results years after scandal,"By Imani Moise and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co's (N:WFC) profit plunged 57% in the third quarter, missing Wall Street's expectations as persistent costs tied to its years-old sales practices scandal continued to haunt the bank.
Like chief executives before him, new CEO Charlie Scharf, now one year on the job, has made cost cuts a cornerstone of his turnaround plan. He targeted $10 billion in savings annually over the long term, but investors are growing impatient.
""Why is that the number?"" asked UBS analyst Saul Martinez about Wells' core cost guidance. ""Because you haven't been anywhere near that number for five years.""
The San Francisco-based bank, which has been in regulators' penalty box since 2016, spent $961 million on customer remediation accruals in the quarter, indicating that the bank was still feeling the burn from its sales practice scandal has already cost it billions. 
Bank executives have signaled repeatedly that the worst of the fallout is in the past, but elevated operating losses have remained constant. Wells Fargo has reported large litigation or remediation charges in 7 of the last 11 quarters, according to filings.
Outgoing Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry made the same assurance last quarter. 
""That is what I said and I was wrong when I said it,"" Shrewsberry told reporters on a call discussing results, adding that he still felt confident lumpy costs were in the past. ""It wouldn't surprise me if people waited until the end of the next quarter to make sure that we lived up to that.""
Cost-cutting initiatives are under way as Scharf begins implementing changes across the bank. Headcount fell by more than 1,000 from the prior quarter. But firm-wide expenses inched up slightly due to scandal-related operating losses and a $718 million restructuring charges tied to severance.
LOAN WEAKNESS
Rising costs, however, do not help as the banking industry deals with near-zero interest rates and slower loan growth. 
Net-interest income at the fourth-largest U.S. bank was $9.4 billion, down $512 million from the second quarter, as its loan book shrank 2%. Total revenue fell 14%.
Because Wells does not have a large capital markets business like JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) or  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), it has fewer ways to cushion declines in revenue from low interest rates.
Banking rivals including Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) have also said net interest income should start to recover after the third quarter as loan demand picks back up. But Wells Fargo offered a more bearish outlook for its own revenue due to a growth restriction on its balance sheet imposed by regulators after the scandal.
""We won't be expanding the size of our balance sheet, really much for any reason because we're operating under an asset cap,"" Shrewsberry said. ""We're not at it but we're pretty close.""
The U.S. Federal Reserve capped Wells Fargo's assets at $1.95 trillion in February of 2018 until the proves it fixed the risk management failures that led to widespread customer abuses. The bank has not given guidance on when it expects the cap to be lifted.
Total period-end loans fell nearly 4% to $920.1 billion, hurt by a $30 billion fall in commercial loans, a bigger slump than expected, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve placed restriction's on Wells' balance sheet as punishment for the sales abuses, to be lifted only when the management team can prove they have sufficiently improved risk management and controls.
Wells Fargo posted net income applicable to common stock of $1.72 billion, or 42 cents per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $4.04 billion, or 92 cents a year earlier.
Analysts expected a profit of 45 cents, according to Refinitiv data.
Shares of the bank were down 5% at $23.51.

1399,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 02:36PM ET</span>",Covid Recession Spawning Entrepreneurs in U.S. Amid Joblessness,"(Bloomberg) -- Americans continue to create new businesses in surprising numbers, a potential tailwind for an economy that this spring saw its highest jobless rate since the Great Depression.
The number of Employer Identification Number applications, which new businesses file with the IRS, fell sharply in March as the Covid-19 pandemic forced business shutdowns in many states. However, applications began rebounding by early summer especially in the South, which initially had a milder outbreak, and by now the growth has spread nationwide.
New business formations of any size hit 1.5 million in the third quarter, up 77% from the previous three months and 82% from a year earlier, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, which collects and publishes the IRS data. One caveat is that people often wait several months after filing for an EIN before actually starting their businesses, creating a lag in job creation.
John Halitwanger, a University of Maryland economics professor who closely follows the EIN filings, hailed the new numbers as “the highest on record” in a Twitter post.
More telling, the data suggest the new entrepreneurship extends to both sole proprietors and future employers. Census officials parse out likely employer businesses through clues on the EIN applications and label them as having a “high-propensity” to turn into a business with a payroll. Such high-propensity applications surged by 79% nationwide in the third quarter from the previous three-month period, the Census said.
The South had more of these likely employers file than any other region in the third quarter, up by 79% with more than 236,000 applications. The Northeast, which had lagged in filings earlier this year, rebounded with the biggest percentage gain, up 97% with almost 85,000 filings.
Mike Wootton is a franchise development executive for the owner of the My Eyelab chain of eyewear stores. With so much unemployment, he’s been targeting franchise sales to corporate middle managers who suddenly find themselves needing to replace their incomes. The challenge has been in certain big cities that continue to restrict operations with the virus, he said.
“We’ve been able to continue to see same-store sales increases this year,” Wootton said. “There was obviously an initial drop-off when all the stores closed, and then we were trying to kind of assess the situation and figure out how we get back to doing business.”
Late last month, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economists commented on the entrepreneurial numbers in a research note it titled, “The Surprising Surge in Business Formation.” While some of the gains could be explained away by pent-up demand because so many people were locked down this spring, “the data suggest a much more positive outlook for new business formation than after the last recession,” the note said.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 02:20PM ET</span>",The We Company reverts to WeWork name to emphasize office-sharing roots,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The We Company, parent of money-losing shared office provider WeWork, which last year yanked plans to go public after harsh criticism over its business model and erratic management, is dropping the ""we"" moniker to revert to its better-known name, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
Restoration of WeWork as the official name is the most symbolic effort to date by management installed last year by majority owner SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) to focus on its core office-sharing business.
The ""we"" brand was introduced in January 2019 by WeWork's co-founder, Adam Neumann, with the aim of broadening the shared office space business to a lifestyle company. 
Neumann was widely criticized when the company disclosed he had trademarked the brand and received a $5.9 million payment from WeWork for its use.
Neumann, who was replaced as chief executive and stepped off the WeWork board last year after the company abandoned plans to go public, later said he would return the money. 
Sandeep Mathrani, the new CEO, said in the memo announcing the name change that the move is another step in returning the company to WeWork's office-sharing roots.
""We want to be strategic. We want to be innovative. We want to be impactful. We want to be WeWork,"" Mathrani wrote. 
""We are officially restoring our company name from The We Company to WeWork,"" the memo said.
WeWork, which has been slammed by the coronavirus-induced recession along with many other businesses, has said it will become profitable by the end of 2021.
The company hopes to benefit from corporations that are reducing their real estate footprint because of the pandemic and have looked to working from home and greater use of flexible workspace, which WeWork can provide with its global footprint.
Since Neumann's exit Mathrani has hired new management and cut headcount in an effort to steer the company to profitability.
WeWork in August said it had slashed its cash burn rate to $482 million in the second quarter, or almost in half from the end of 2019. The company also said it had obtained a $1.1 billion commitment in new financing from SoftBank.
WeWork withdrew its public offering in September 2019 that looked to value the company at $47 billion and make it one of the year's hottest IPOs. 

WeWork soon entered a tailspin as its valuation fell to less than $8 billion. After a management shake-up it remains enmeshed in lawsuits over a $3 billion tender offer to existing shareholders.

1401,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 02:11PM ET</span>",Parent of Brazil's JBS pleads guilty to U.S. foreign bribery charges,"By Jody Godoy and Sabrina Valle
NEW YORK/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's J&F Investimentos, parent company of the world's largest meatpacker, JBS SA (SA:JBSS3), pleaded guilty to U.S. foreign bribery charges and agreed to pay $256 million in criminal fines, prosecutors said on Wednesday.
Only half of the fine, $128 million, will be paid to U.S. authorities, as the company will receive credit to payments made to Brazilian authorities.
In 2017, J&F agreed to pay a record-setting 10.3 billion-real ($1.85 billion) fine in its home country for its role in corruption scandals that severely weakened Brazil's then-president, Michel Temer. Top executives in Brazil had admitted to bribing more than 1,900 politicians to secure contracts for the group.
Shares of JBS rose 5.8% in Sao Paulo following the announcement in the United States, amid hopes the deal would allow the company - which reported a net profit of 3.4 billion reais last quarter - to draw under a line under the sprawling corruption scandal. 
According to documents made public on Wednesday in a U.S. court, the amount of the bribes paid by J&F officials to high-level government officials exceeded $150 million, which generated $178 million in profit for the company, U.S. prosecutors said.
Lucio Martins, J&F's director of compliance, pleaded guilty to violations of the U.S. Foreign Corruption Practices Act on behalf of the company in a video conference proceeding before U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie in Brooklyn.
Between 2005 and 2017, the company conspired to bribe officials to get the Brazilian government and other entities to arrange financing and equity transactions benefiting J&F, according to a U.S. charging document. 
Prosecutors said part of the bribe negotiations took place within the United States.

1403,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",Wall Street’s Profit Rebound Fails to Assuage Wary Shareholders,"(Bloomberg) -- Bank profits are starting to resemble life before Covid, but investors aren’t buying the idea that the industry’s crisis has passed.
In earnings reports this week, the top U.S. firms said they already socked away most of what they will need to cover near-term losses on loans, and they’re still benefiting from a pandemic-fueled trading boom. Yet even as the five biggest banks reported a profit rebound in the third quarter, their stocks remained laggards.
“Financials are being treated as if they’re victims of this pandemic when they’re really operating pretty well,” David Kelly, chief strategist for JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.’s asset management unit, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday.
The market is signaling that $50 billion the banking group stockpiled for potential loan defaults as the pandemic spread probably isn’t coming back, and that the industry’s pain has merely been postponed. With stimulus talks bogged down in Washington, bank executives conceded that joblessness affecting many customers may take longer than previously hoped to subside. Some banks predicted loan losses, muted so far, will climb in the later half of next year.
For now at least, banks are in a sweet spot. The five firms increased their combined loan-loss reserves by a mere $172 million in the third quarter, down 99.4% from the $28 billion buildup in the second quarter. Trading revenue at the Wall Street firms, meanwhile, jumped more than 20% for a third straight quarter.
Net income for the five biggest U.S. firms totaled $23.2 billion in the quarter, more than triple that of the second quarter and just 12% below the level reported a year earlier. Still, shares of the four largest lenders are all down more than 27% this year, even as the broader S&P 500 has surpassed previous highs. The only sector banks are outperforming is energy.
After the same five banks saw profit start to drop in the middle of 2007, it was two years before earnings climbed back to at least 80% of the pace before that financial crisis. This time it took two quarters -- assuming it holds.
Banks are taking solace in consumers who are paying down balances or resuming payments after forbearance programs. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). said only about 6% of deferral requests are still in place, while JPMorgan said 92% of accounts that came out of its program are current. At  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., consumer loans that are 90 days past due hit the lowest level in more than five years.
“We expect that the reserve builds are behind us,” Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said. “We are seeing a return to the fundamentals of a generally sound underlying economy, but we won’t get there until we fully address the health-care crisis.”
Emphasizing ‘Uncertainty’
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., the world’s largest credit-card issuer, said consumer spending on its cards has picked up in recent weeks. Still, customers’ discipline in paying down debts can also hurt earnings by generating less interest. The bank’s outstanding credit-card loans declined 11%.
Some banks tempered their projections for the economy. Jennifer Piepszak and Mark Mason, the chief financial officers of JPMorgan and Citigroup, respectively, used the words “uncertain” or “uncertainty” more than a dozen times to describe the outlook on their calls with analysts on Tuesday. Citigroup said it now expects a slower recovery in the next two years.
That leaves banks facing questions on where they will find revenue growth. Despite the windfall from trading, the five firms’ revenue fell below $100 billion for just the second time in the last seven quarters, driven by a 13% drop in net interest income. Loans on their books fell for a second straight quarter as they faced the combination of lower demand and their own caution.
“Sluggish loan growth and low rates create some headwinds for banks,” Jeffery Harte, a bank analyst at Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR), said on Bloomberg TV.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). CEO David Solomon faced questions from a few analysts about the outlook for his firm’s share price.
“The banking sector and financials broadly are well out of favor,” Solomon acknowledged. The pandemic and the uncertainty “hurts the overall neighborhood.”

1406,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: EU antitrust regulators may narrow Amazon investigation - sources,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators may narrow the scope of their year-long investigation into Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to speed up the case against the U.S. online retail giant, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Splitting up the Amazon case could address complaints by rivals that antitrust enforcers take too long to address harm done to them through anti-competitive practices and that rulings fail to keep pace with evolving markets.
EU regulators adopted a similar tactic against Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google by first addressing complaints about its price comparison shopping service and then opening investigations into other areas of its business.
The European Commission started an investigation into Amazon in July 2019, focusing on whether its dual role as a marketplace for merchants and also as a competitor selling the same products might give it an unfair advantage.
The investigation is also looking at the role of data in the selection of Amazon's ""Buy Box"" winners which appear on the right of product pages saying ""Buy now"" or ""Add to basket"" and drive about 80% of sales.
However, the EU's competition enforcer is now considering splitting the two issues to focus on one, making it easier to move forward with the case, one of the people told Reuters. 
""The data case seems weaker,"" the person said, adding that no final decision had been made on whether to split the case, nor which angle to focus on first.
The European Commission declined to comment.

The sources said also said there was a debate over whether the case should be examined under antitrust regulations designed to combat anti-competitive agreements such as cartels, or under rules to stop companies abusing their market power.

(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) executives on Wednesday joined the chorus of U.S. bank officials predicting an economic recovery would improve business in the quarters ahead, after lower interest rates fueled a miss on third-quarter revenue.
The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender set aside lower provisions for potential loan losses, mirroring other Main Street peers such as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) that also lowered reserves. 
""Our decision to add less to our credit reserves this quarter than in the two previous quarters was largely based on an improving economy relative to 90 days ago,"" Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said on a call.
JPMorgan executives on Tuesday sounded a cautiously optimistic note that the coronavirus pandemic will not send the economy into the worst possible tailspin.
Bank of America set side $1.4 billion to meet future losses in its commercial loan portfolio in the quarter, far less than the $5.1 billion it provided for during the June quarter. Profit fell but beat estimates. 
""We don't expect to see a meaningful increase in net charge-offs to mid next year, and we expect that the reserve builds are behind us,"" Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said in a post-earnings conference call. 
Revenue in its core consumer bank fell 17% to $8 billion in the third quarter, mainly due to lower interest income and reduced credit card activity. Its loan book shrank for the first time since 2015, according to Refinitiv data.
Net interest income at the bank, a key measure of how much it can make from lending, sank 17%, showing the effects of the U.S. Federal Reserve's moves to slash interest rates to near-zero and promise to keep them there to help spur growth.
The bank is especially vulnerable to rate movements because of the composition of its balance sheet, weighing on overall revenue that missed estimates. 
The lender also posted weak results in its sales and trading arm, in stark contrast to JPMorgan and Citigroup, which reported a 30% and 16% rise in trading revenue on Tuesday.
Bank of America's adjusted sales and trading revenue rose 4% to $3.3 billion.
""Unfortunately loan demand is what it is and the combination of pay-downs of credit facilities (good thing), mortgage prepays, open capital markets and overall cautious market conditions led to a 5% decline in loans and rates are really pressuring revenues (down 7%) and that's a bigger part of the BofA story. Feels sluggish, but not far off from expectations,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr. 
The second largest U.S. bank by assets posted adjusted revenue of $20.45 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $20.81 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Net income applicable to common shareholders fell 15.8% to $4.44 billion, or 51 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, but beat estimates of 49 cents. 

Shares of the bank were down nearly 3% in early trading.

1409,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>",Eli Lilly says other COVID-19 antibody drug trials ongoing after study halted for safety concern,"By Carl O'Donnell and Michael Erman
(Reuters) - Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) & Co on Wednesday said other trials of its experimental coronavirus antibody therapy remain on track after a government-run study testing the treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was paused due to safety concerns. 
Lilly said on Tuesday that an independent safety monitoring board requested a pause in the trial, called ACTIV-3, due to a potential safety issue.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is collaborating with Lilly on the trial, said the advisory board paused the trial after seeing a ""difference in clinical status"" between patients on Lilly's drug on those who received a placebo, without providing further detail.
""They've crossed the boundary"" for an acceptable level of safety concerns in the trial, said Dr. Richard Chaisson, professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins who was not involved with the study. ""Now they have to decide whether the boundary is important enough that they should stop the trial altogether, declare it unsafe."" 
Lilly on Wednesday said the paused trial is distinct from others it is conducting because it focuses on hospitalized patients who are more severely ill and being treated with other drugs as well, including  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD)'s antiviral remdesivir. 
The company had already asked U.S. regulators for an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the antibody drug, called bamlanivimab or LY-CoV555, to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 patients, based on interim data from a different study in those less severe illness. It is also testing the drug in nursing homes to see if it can prevent staff and residents from getting infected.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the status of the EUA application.
LY-CoV555 is similar to the experimental dual-antibody therapy from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN) that was used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump. That treatment is also awaiting clearance by U.S. regulators.
Trump touted both drugs as being tantamount to cures in a video he posted last week after being released from the hospital.
Lilly said in a statement that these type of treatments may prove to be less beneficial for hospitalized patients than for those with more mild cases of the disease. A Lilly spokeswoman declined to comment further on why the trial was halted. 
The paused trial is being conducted in partnership with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a division of the NIH that is working with several drugmakers on COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. 
It was halted at the request of an independent oversight panel, called a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). It is not uncommon to pause drug trials to investigate safety concerns, and such actions do not necessarily indicate a serious problem. 
""Lilly trusts the judgment of the independent DSMB and supports its decisions to exercise caution in ensuring the safety of the patients participating in this study,"" the company said in a statement.

1411,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 12:20PM ET</span>",Goldman's trading business returns to former glory during pandemic stress,"By Anirban Sen and Matt Scuffham
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday posted its best quarterly performance in a decade by some measures, as trading moved back into the limelight and its lack of a big consumer business switched from a curse to a blessing.
The Wall Street bank posted a quarterly return-on-equity of 17.5%, its highest since 2010. Investors closely track that figure because it shows how well a bank uses shareholder money to produce profits.
Goldman also boasted record earnings per share, beating analyst expectations by a wide margin. Its performance was driven in large part by a 29% jump in trading revenue, as clients responded to news about the coronavirus pandemic by shifting their portfolios.
While rivals including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co have also benefited from the markets boom this year, they are far more exposed to vulnerable consumers and businesses suffering from unemployment and pandemic lockdowns. Goldman's consumer bank is relatively tiny.
""Simply stunning results,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Susan Roth Katzke said in a report.
Goldman's shares were up 0.6% by late morning as shares of other big lenders fell.
In the years leading up to the pandemic, Goldman's heavy exposure to trading and lack of exposure to traditional lending was viewed as a problem. The bank is in the middle of a business-model revamp orchestrated by Chief Executive David Solomon that includes building out its consumer bank, called Marcus, and adding services like retail wealth management.
Analysts say that is the right strategy for the long term, but, for now, Goldman's business mix is just right.
""Goldman remains one of our favorite stocks,"" Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said. ""Its loan portfolio is small and of very high quality compared to those of other large bank holding companies. It has minimal exposure to credit cards and small business, which we see as the biggest COVID-19 risks. But it has upside leverage to more active capital markets.""
Goldman's $4.6 billion in quarterly trading revenue included gains across fixed income and equity markets, and a bigger increase than other Wall Street banks. The business accounted for 42% of Goldman's overall revenue, while consumer and wealth management represented 14%.
The bank set aside $278 million to cover loans that go bad, bringing its year-to-date total credit provisions to $2.8 billion. By comparison, traditional rivals JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) have set aside anywhere from $10 billion-20 billion this year.
Goldman's investment banking business also benefited from several high-profile IPOs including Snowflake, Rocket Companies and Dun & Bradstreet during the quarter.
Goldman expects the trends to continue through at least the end of the year, as markets remain volatile and its investment banking backlog has grown, Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr said on an analyst call.
""We can count on any number of issues to be the source of some volatility, whether it's the U.S. election, Libor transition, or the trajectory of COVID,"" he said. 
Goldman has also picked up ""meaningful"" market share across its trading businesses, he said, part of the bank's strategy to target major corporations for hedging, Treasury and risk-management services.
The bank's overall profit nearly doubled $3.5 billion from $1.8 billion a year ago. Earnings per share were a record $9.68, up from $4.79 a year earlier.
Analysts had expected a profit of $5.57 per share, on average, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv.
Revenue rose at all four of its business units, with total revenue up 30% to $10.8 billion. That was above the $9.5 billion consensus estimate.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes inched higher in choppy trading on Wednesday as investors digested a mixed bag of quarterly earnings reports from major U.S. banks.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) edged up as strength in its trading business helped quarterly profit surge 94%. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) shed 4.0% after it missed revenue estimates and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) declined 4.6% as its profit fell short of forecasts.
The S&P 500 banks index dropped 1.3% as the third-quarter earnings season took off amid improving expectations over the extent of the drop in overall profits for S&P 500 firms. Analysts now expect earnings to fall 18.9% from a year, according to Refinitiv IBES data, versus a 25% drop on July 1.
""People are lot more optimistic about earnings ... Q3 is going to be negative but better,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.
An impasse over a COVID-19 stimulus bill in Washington also kept the mood in check. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Republican-led Senate would vote next week on a targeted $500 billion coronavirus aid bill of the type Democrats have already rejected as they hold out for trillions in relief.
Fading hopes of a deal on federal aid as well as a halt in trials of a COVID-19 vaccine and a treatment pulled Wall Street's main indexes back from one-month highs on Tuesday.
Investors are expecting more aid after the Nov. 3 presidential election in the event Congress fails to agree on a deal in the next three weeks.
A widening lead for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in national opinion polls has also been a positive for markets as investors expect more infrastructure spending and less global trade uncertainty, strategists and fund managers said.
At 10:55 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.87 points, or 0.03%, at 28,688.68, the S&P 500 was up 2.79 points, or 0.08%, at 3,514.72. The Nasdaq Composite was up 9.10 points, or 0.08%, at 11,873.00.
Energy stocks rose the most among major S&P sectors on the back of a rise in oil prices. [O/R] Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) firmed about 0.8% after sliding during an event on Tuesday when the company launched its next-generation iPhone 12.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc gained 3.6% as several brokerages raised their target price on the chipmaker's shares.
UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) dropped 2.1% despite raising its profit forecast as the U.S. insurer said it was difficult to predict the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic on earnings.
Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) Inc surged 12.3% after a report that oil producer ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) was in talks to acquire the shale producer.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.34-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.02-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 20 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 93 new highs and seven new lows.

Investing.com --  It's safe to play arcade games again! Okay, maybe not, but Dave & Buster's tried to assure us that things aren't as bad as they may seem.
Same-store sales are down just 62% in September, a relative improvement over August, when they fell 75%, and 87% in the second quarter. 
As of Oct. 4, 98 of 136 stores have reopened and a brand new one was inaugurated. Dave & Buster’s Entertainment (NASDAQ:PLAY) had $197 million in cash and equivalents at the time, and about $744 million outstanding under its credit facility.
The company expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization at breakeven if it can reach between 50% and 55% of 2019 sales.  
“The progress we’ve made re-opening stores and driving sales recovery demonstrates the enduring strength of the Dave & Buster’s brand and the loyalty of our guests across the country,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Jenkins said in a statement. ""We remain optimistic that we will emerge from this challenge in a stronger competitive position to deliver fun to our guests and value to our shareholders.” 
Meanwhile, Covid-19 cases are ticking up worldwide. Small gatherings are becoming a growing source of the spread as cases and hospitalizations rise across the U.S., CNN reported Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield a saying during a call with the nation's governors on Tuesday. The U.S.'s seven-day average of new daily cases surpassed 51,000 Tuesday, the first time in more than two months that the figure was above 50,000, CNN said, citing Johns Hopkins University data.
Shares of Dave & Buster's are down more than 60% in 2020. Last month, the company reported a loss per share of $1.24 on sales of almost $51 million. That compares to earnings per share of 90 cents on sales of $345 million a year earlier.

It’s a trend that should continue as investors look beyond traditional haven assets for yield and resilience, said London-based Isabelle Mateos y Lago, the global head of the firm’s official institutions group. That means turning toward illiquid and alternative investments as well as high-yield debt, she said.
The world’s stockpile of negative-yielding debt has soared to $16.3 trillion, approaching an all-time high and up from a low of $7.7 trillion in mid March, according to a Bloomberg index.
“Portfolio construction is being completely taken back to the drawing board because people understand we’ll face these low interest rates for a long, long time,” Mateos y Lago said on Bloomberg TV. “Asset owners are trying to get yield and returns in line with their mandate. Thanks to that you’re seeing capital flow back to emerging markets who direly need that.”
Money is also flowing back into corporate bond markets, she said. Meantime, the combination of fiscal stimulus and a broader economic reopening, despite second waves of Covid-19 infections, may trigger a rotation within equities.
“You should see less outperformance from these tech stocks that have benefited so much from the lockdown,” Mateos y Lago said. “People are warming up to small caps, cyclicals and things that tend to do well in reflation and expansion.”

1417,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 10:36AM ET</span>",The Vaccine Cargo Cavalry Sizes Up Readiness of Historic Airlift,"(Bloomberg) --
The medical industry’s dash to produce the world’s first coronavirus vaccines in just a few months is heightening the urgency for the workhorses of global trade to be ready for the historic charge to defeat the disease.
Only 28% of companies involved in supply-chain logistics feel well prepared to handle Covid-19 vaccines and 19% characterized their readiness as very unprepared, according to a survey released Wednesday that showed a wide swath between optimists and pessimists. The poll, conducted in mid-September by the International Air Cargo Association and Pharma.Aero, is part of an effort to coordinate widespread delivery of the immunizations.
Just over half of 181 respondents already have the vehicles, containers and the connections needed to move hundreds of millions of vials in a constant deep-freeze. Almost a quarter said they’re still trying to procure such equipment, the survey of airlines, freight forwarders, airport operators and ground handlers showed.
The preparedness of those responsible for moving the medicine from manufacturing sites to health clinics worldwide is paramount because the doses, once in transit, must stay ultra-cold as they traverse a world economy where supply chains are already at capacity. The industry is also trying to avoid bidding wars, shortages and every-country-for-itself attitudes that sparked a stampede for personal protective equipment in the initial months of the pandemic.
“This is the greatest challenge that the logistics industry is facing today or maybe ever,” said Emir Pineda, manager of aviation trade and logistics at Miami International Airport and a board member of the association, known as Tiaca. “The supply chain is made up of many links and if one of those links breaks, then we’re going to have an issue.”
With little precision about when drug makers will produce enough vaccines for mass distribution, logistics estimates are hard to come by and inherently unreliable. Pineda said that the Covid-19 vaccine rollout alone may generate 65,000 tons of air freight, more than four times the amount of vaccines transported in 2019 and enough to fill 930 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 747 freighters.
Different Ballgame
The drug industry has been transporting vaccines for many years without much fanfare, so the expertise exists. But the magnitude and complexity of this effort will require much more coordination between private industry, customs officials, governments and non-governmental organizations.
“Before Covid-19, it was 100% scalable: We knew how many flus there were in the world, we know how many cases of meningitis there were,” said Frank Van Gelder, secretary-general of Pharma.Aero. “But suddenly you have a pandemic, which captures the entire global population and then you start to play a different ballgame.”
Such a large airlift would be difficult in normal times. The task looks especially daunting on top of the sustained, solid demand for online merchandise and basic necessities like groceries that are already filling cargo planes and container ships. The cost of air freight is up about 50% from a year ago, and seaborne shipping-container rates have tripled since the start of the year.
Meanwhile, transport companies have starting mapping out where the bulk of the vaccines will be produced -- in places like Illinois, North Carolina and the Northeast in the U.S., the U.K., Ireland and Germany in Europe, and in Asia’s pharma hubs in India and China.
While companies like FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX). and  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS). are investing in freezer space, there’s still concern about addressing “the last mile” of distribution, particularly in remote and often impoverished regions hard to reach with extreme refrigeration -- anywhere from -20 to -80 degrees Celsius (-4 to -12 degrees Fahrenheit) that will be required.
Along parts of the vaccines’ journey, there will be electricity available for refrigeration and battery-powered coolers. On other legs, though, the survival of the doses will depend on dry ice packed in boxes, raising a range of risks including premature thawing to safety questions for handlers because of the fumes emitted when it sublimates.
The complexity of the mission could exert strains on the logistics industry so great that it may require military might, through authorities like the U.S.’s Civil Reserve Air Fleet, a program established in 1951 after the Berlin airlift that lets the Pentagon use commercial aircraft for national-security reasons.
Cold Corridor
“It’s an iPhone 12 launch on steroids,” said Neel Jones Shah, global head of air carrier relationships at San Francisco-based freight forwarder Flexport and a Tiaca director. “I would still say that the confidence in our state of readiness is maybe a 6.5 out of 10.”
That cautious optimism may grow as more companies step in to help. Among the leaders in cold-chain refrigeration is Thermo King, part of Trane Technologies (NYSE:TT) Plc, a Dublin-based maker of industrial equipment. It’s positioning its line of units for each step of the cold corridor that the logistics industry is trying to establish.
“We’re trying to make all our capacity available,” Francesco Incalza, the head of Thermo King’s business in Europe. “When I hear, for instance, that there is not enough capacity in the supply chain to move 8 billion doses of vaccine -- if you get organized, there is capacity.”

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - French luxury goods group LVMH (PA:LVMH) is set to gain EU antitrust approval for its acquisition of U.S. jeweller Tiffany (N:TIF), people familiar with the matter said.
The EU decision comes amid a legal battle between LVMH and Tiffany, with the latter suing the Louis Vuitton owner in a Delaware court, alleging that the French company has deliberately been stalling the completion of the deal.
Tiffany has alleged that LVMH has improperly tried to renegotiate the deal, which was agreed in November last year before the COVID-19 pandemic emerged and hit countries and companies worldwide.
LVMH has countersued Tiffany, alleging that the U.S. company has been mismanaged during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Oct. 26, declined to comment. LVMH and Tiffany did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The two companies had several overlaps in some areas but these are not serious enough to trigger competition concerns, the people said.

The U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment and antitrust enforcers in Australia, Canada, China and South Korea have already given the green light to the deal.

The company reported preliminary comparable sales drop of 7% for the three months ended Sept. 30 at its flagship Burger King operation globally. 
However, that was an improvement from a 13.4% fall it reported in the previous quarter when most of its restaurants were closed for dine-in due to lockdowns.
Bigger rival McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) earlier this month said global sales improved in the third quarter, down just 2.2%, as drive-through orders surged and special promotions lifted sales to double-digit percentage increases in September. 
McDonald's had great success with a limited-time promotional deal with rapper Travis Scott, which led to ingredient shortages.

1422,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 08:27AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs’s ‘Womenomics’ Stocks Outperform,"(Bloomberg) -- Companies with a higher presence of female executives have historically rewarded their equity investors with better performance, said  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists as they unveiled a basket of European firms that employ an elevated number of women.
“Over more or less any period since the global financial crisis, having more women in senior positions as managers or on the board is associated with company outperformance relative to the sector,” the strategists led by Sharon Bell wrote in a note on Tuesday. They added that this doesn’t apply to all industries and that academic research isn’t yet conclusive on this trend.
Goldman analysts rolled out a new basket of European companies with the most women at all levels, called Womenomics (GSSTWOMN Index), which includes firms such as LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (OTC:LVMUY),  Swedbank AB  (OTC:SWDBY), Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc. French and Nordic companies dominate the list, said the strategists, as France has a quota system for female board members while the Nordic region has historically had higher female labor participation.
Europe is beating the U.S. in its push to make women a more equal part of the workforce, and although the pay gap between men and women remains large in the region, it’s smaller in all major countries in Europe than in the U.S., Canada and in Japan, according to Goldman. Workforce participation rates among women in Europe have been rising, while in the U.S. they’ve been flat since the late 1990s, said the strategists.
The research weighs in on the market debate regarding the importance of investing based on environmental, social and governance principles. Europe has been seeing a boom in appetite for such investing this year, with about 50% of all new exchange-traded funds in Europe, the Middle East and Africa this year ESG-related and accumulating about $4.2 billion in assets, according to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). data. That compares with $3.8 billion for new non-ESG funds.
ESG Flows
Inflows into ESG-focused strategies may have contributed to the better equity performance among companies with higher female presence, Goldman said.
“The price outperformance may be a function of flows into ESG funds targeting diversity metrics, rather than more women producing better outcomes or lower risks,” the strategists said. “But even if this were the case, we continue to believe investors will value higher social and governance scores for companies, so companies that do perform well on these metrics should continue to attract both flows and a premium.”
As a to-be-sure, Goldman strategists also added that they weren’t able to find a correlation between higher female presence and returns on equity. While the outperformance of companies with more women is “pretty robust” for different time periods, in industries like technology it doesn’t work, according to Goldman, as the sector has been slow to improve its diversity.
They also said that academic research hasn’t been conclusive on whether employing more women means better performance.
Goldman’s Europe Womenomics index is down about 7.8% this year, compared with a drop of 11% for the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 gauge. Over the past five years, the difference is much more significant, with Womenomics up 22% compared with a gain of around 4.2% for the Stoxx 600.
Covid-19 Effect
The companies in the basket have on average 46% female employees, compared with 36% for the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index. In addition the selected companies have 40% female managers and 42% women on the board.
Goldman doesn’t believe females in the workforce will be more adversely affected than men by the fallout from Covid-19. While women are more heavily represented in such industries as travel, media and retail, which have seen strong profit declines during this year’s crisis, more women are employed by the public sector, where salaries have held up better.

Longer-term social changes as a result of the pandemic could also benefit women, according to Goldman.
“There is likely to be less commuting, more online work and working from home, and this should enhance flexibility for both men and women,” the strategists said. “It is the flexibility of both women and men that we think has been a determinant in increasing women’s participation in the workforce in recent years.”

1423,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>","Senator Warren slams Disney for layoffs, executives' salaries","By Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren slammed Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's move to lay off 28,000 workers while making shareholder payouts in the years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, demanding more information from company executives on the measures.
Warren, a progressive former U.S. presidential candidate, blasted the entertainment company for the layoffs that came as Disney reportedly restored pay for some executives who had taken cuts due to the pandemic, according to a letter the Massachusetts senator sent to Disney on Tuesday and seen by Reuters.
Warren described Disney's decision to pay dividends and buy back stock before the pandemic as ""short-sighted,"" because it reduced the capital the company could have used to weather the downturn.
""I would like to know whether Disney’s financial decisions have impacted the company’s decision to lay off workers,"" Warren wrote. ""It appears that – prior to, and during the pandemic – Disney took good care of its top executives and shareholders – and now is hanging its front-line workers out to dry.""
Disney did not immediately provide a comment. Warren said she appreciated that Disney has continued to provide healthcare benefits to furloughed workers for the last six months.
Activist investor Daniel Loeb of hedge fund Third Point (NYSE:TPRE) said the company should permanently end its dividend, after Disney suspended it in May, and invest in streaming programming instead.
Roughly two-thirds of the 28,000 workers Disney said last month it was laying off were part-time. Disneyland, the company's theme park in California, remains shut due to the pandemic.
Abigail Disney, the grand-daughter of Disney co-founder Roy Disney, has also criticized the company for how it has handled the pandemic.
Warren has been targeting executives who are under increased scrutiny as the economy falters from the pandemic, and as workers and other elected officials press them on issues such as racial justice and climate change. 

Last month she criticized CEOs for failing to keep a pledge backed by the trade group the Business Roundtable to consider social responsibility above shareholder profits.

1425,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 07:54AM ET</span>",Wells Fargo Returns to Profit as Provisions Are Pared Back,"Investing.com -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) swung back to profit in the third quarter thanks to a booming housing market and a sharp drop in the amount of money set aside to cover possible loan losses.
The Californian-based lender said earnings per share rebounded to 42 cents, just shy of a consensus forecast of 44c. Net income totaled $2.0 billion, compared to a loss of $2.4 billion in the second quarter. The improvement in the bottom line would have been even sharper had it not been for $961 million in customer remediation charges. The bank had already flagged these.
The main reason for that loss had been $9.5 billion in credit loss provisions, a line that shrank to only $769 million in the third quarter. The move is a reflection of how the bank expects its loan book to perform as the U.S. economy faces an extended period of weakness and uncertainty due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
""Strong mortgage banking fees, higher equity markets, and declining sequential charge-offs positively impacted our results, while historically low interest rates reduced our net interest income and our expenses continued to remain elevated,"" chief executive Charlie Scharf said in a statement.
The bank's mortgage activities have profited from a boom in housing as Covid-19 has triggered a flight from city centers to the suburbs, where lower prices allow for the extra space requirements of a family working from home.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) had both posted sharp declines in provisioning in their results on Tuesday. The upbeat signal that that sent was, however, dampened by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon later saying that it may still need to add $20 billion to its reserves if the economy falls into a double-dip recession.
Provisions of some $1.4 billion were also the main reason why Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s earnings missed expectations when they were announced earlier Wednesday. BofA and Wells Fargo both suffered from sharp drops in income from their main lending business as interest margins compressed in the wake of the Federal Reserve's emergency rate cuts in the spring. Net interest income fell just under 20% from a year earlier at Wells Fargo, while Bank of America's fell 17%.
JPMorgan had beaten expectations on Tuesday with third-quarter EPS of $2.92 on revenue of $29.94B, compared to forecast for EPS of $2.23 on revenue of $28.22B. The positive trend continued on Wednesday with both Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) also reporting higher-than-expected earnings, Goldman in particular lifted by windfall earnings from its traders.
Wells Fargo stock, which has yet to make any meaningful bounce from its May lows, fell another 1.8% in premarket trading by 8:50 AM ET (1250 GMT).

(Reuters) - Analysts are upgrading Asian companies' forward 12-month earnings estimates at a higher pace than for the U.S- and European firms, Refinitiv data showed, on expectations that Asia's faster recovery from the COVID-19 crisis would bolster earnings. 
Analysts have lifted Asia companies' forward 12-month EPS estimates by 1.4% in the past month, compared with U.S. firms' 0.4% increase, meanwhile, they cut European firms estimates by about 1%.
Recent economic data showed Asian companies, led by China, are making a faster economic progress after coming out of their lockdowns, registering higher factory output and export growth.
China's exports extended strong gains in September, as its firms rushed to grab higher market share with their overseas rivals still grappling with reduced manufacturing capacity.

South Korean exports also rose for the first time in seven months in September.
Refinitiv data showed South Korea and Malaysian companies saw earnings upgrades of over 4% in the past month, the highest in the region.
""With the highest leverage to emerging market growth at a time when global trade is picking up, Korean earnings momentum is just inflecting upwards,"" said Sean Darby, global equity strategist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF). 
Australian, Taiwanese and Chinese firms also saw earnings upgrades of up to 3% last month. 
India, which has the second highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world, also witnessed corporate earnings upgrades over the past month.

""Along with a recent moderation in new COVID-19 cases, India's PMI surged to the highest level in over eight years. Together with strong auto sales, this could help earnings revisions improve,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a report.
Paul Sandhu, head of multi-asset quant solutions at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management, said Asia's better handling of COVID-19 compared with developed markets could also bolster the region' stocks in coming months.

If Joe Biden wins the presidency, “control of the Senate will mean the difference between substantial fiscal expansion and fiscal gridlock, which would challenge some of our colleagues’ more bullish views on risk assets,” strategists including Michael Zezas and Ariana Salvatore wrote in a note.
Polls and betting markets suggest a “sizeable” advantage for Biden over Donald Trump in the presidential race, according to the strategists. The odds of having to wait more than a week for a reliable result after the Nov. 3 vote have come down, they added.
The contest for the Senate, which is currently in Republican hands, appears tighter and is potentially crucial for breaking an impasse over fiscal stimulus.
Treasuries and West Texas Intermediate crude oil appear “least priced” for a so-called Blue Wave outcome where the Democratic Party emerges with control of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives, the report said.
“Equities also appear poised for downward pressure in a Blue Wave, though we argue that would be temporary and a potential dip-buying opportunity,” the strategists wrote.

1431,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 07:08AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Largely Flat; Banking Earnings in Focus,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Wednesday, as the corporate earnings season kicks into full gear, with the focus on the key banking sector.
At 07:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, lower, the Dow futures contract rose 10 points, or 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 15 points, or 0.1%. 
These cash indices closed lower Tuesday, ending a four-day win streak, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending 0.6% lower, the S&P 500 down 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite off 0.1%. However, they haven't registered consecutive down days this month.
The banking sector, often seen as an important guage of the strength of the overall economy, will be in focus Wednesday, with third-quarter earnings from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) all due. These follow above-estimate earnings from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in the previous session.
Outside of the major banks, there are also earnings due from the likes United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), on the heels of Delta's (NYSE:DAL) disappointing quarterly update, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) and  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA).
Still, investors face a number of headwinds, with Covid-19 cases continuing to mount, vaccine trials facing difficulties and a new stimulus bill remaining something of a mirage. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday the Senate would vote next week on a targeted $500 billion coronavirus economic aid bill. This is extremely unlikely to pass through the House given it’s the type of deal Democrats have rejected in the past as not being enough.
Turning to economic data, September's producer price index is the key release Wednesday. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, is expected to rise 0.2% on the month, climbing at a slightly slower pace than the previous month. 
This would duplicate the pattern on consumer prices, which after several months of above-trend gains, look like they are normalizing. Both headline and core CPI, released Tuesday, increased by 0.2% month-to-month in September.
Oil prices weakened Wednesday on concerns that fuel demand will continue to falter as rising coronavirus cases across Europe and in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer, cause economic growth to wane.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its forecast for oil demand in 2021 by 80,000 barrels per day to 96.84 million barrels per day in its monthly report on Tuesday, citing damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The weekly report on crude inventories by the American Petroleum Institute is due later in the session, having been delayed by a day because of the Columbus day holiday on Monday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $40.33 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $42.39.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,904.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1741.

1432,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 07:01AM ET</span>",From iPhones to e-axles: how one tech firm is pushing into electric vehicles,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
(Reuters) - The miniature motors that make iPhones buzz on silent helped power Japan's Nidec (T:6594) to become a 1.5-trillion-yen ($14 billion) company.
In recent years, Nidec's founder Shigenobu Nagamori has turned his attention to autos, and a technology which turns electricity stored in the battery into propulsion power.
This technology, called an e-axle or e-drive, is emerging as a new competitive front as the auto industry shifts to electric vehicles. By 2030, Nagamori says he wants a 35% slice of a global e-axle market that is forecast to be worth $20-30 billion a year by then, up from an estimated $2.8-$3 billion now.
He is betting that electric cars will follow the same route as room aircons, washing machines and computers, with key components, such as motor systems and central processing units, standardized and supplied by a few dominant tech firms.
""Laptops and aircons from different makers might look different outside, but you look inside, the (key) parts are all more or less the same. The gut technologies of EVs are going to become as commoditized or standardized"" as these items, Nagamori told an earnings news conference earlier this year. E-axles and batteries will come from a few competitive suppliers, he predicted.
To ensure Nidec emerges as one of these suppliers, Nagamori, a no-nonsense 76-year-old, has set his sights on acquiring gear-maker JATCO from Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) and combining it with Nidec's motor and power-control electronics business. Some details of this effort, which Nissan is resisting, are reported here for the first time. The takeover battle underscores how quickly electrification is reshaping the auto industry.
""Nidec brings to the auto industry the tech industry's approach,"" says Daiwa Securities analyst Shiro Sakamaki. ""Like cell-phones and laptops, car models are already being redesigned at an increasingly rapid pace, and Nagamori is betting that trend will accelerate and automakers are going to leave the development and manufacturing of technologies such as the e-axle to suppliers.""
Nagamori declined to be interviewed for this article. Nidec declined to comment about its pursuit of JATCO.
A SHORT HISTORY OF THE E-AXLE
The e-axle, or e-drive, combines an electric vehicle's gear, motor, and power-control electronics. It's the ""brain"" that controls how a vehicle manages energy stored in its battery and transforms it into power. It also helps to recover energy lost in braking and returns it to the battery.
In other words, a well-designed e-axle maximizes a vehicle's power efficiency and acceleration and helps extend its driving range and its smoothness. 
The technology has emerged as a competitive front in part because automakers are under pressure to cut electric vehicles' manufacturing costs to make them as affordable as mainstream gasoline cars. E-axle systems and batteries present the industry with the biggest margins for efficiency gains and cost savings.
Advances in new technologies are critical to global efforts to cut CO2 emissions. Vehicle-based CO2 emissions account for roughly 17% of emissions from all sources, according to Zifei Yang, an analyst at the International Council on Clean Transportation in Washington. Moreover, says Yang, the rate of reduction in vehicle emissions has slowed as more people drive bigger, more polluting SUVs. Other analysts point to trends in emerging economies such as China and India where large numbers of middle-class consumers are trading in mopeds for cars.
Some automotive technology suppliers have combined efforts to make e-axle systems. Japan's Denso and Aisin formed a joint venture called BluE Nexus in 2019 and  Toyota  earlier this year moved to invest in the company, taking a 10% stake. This year U.S. parts supplier BorgeWarner agreed to acquire UK-based Delphi, and Japan's Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Automotive merged with three Honda group suppliers. Automakers Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Ford, and Toyota and smaller Japanese brands are each forming an EV technology alliance in part to drive down e-axle manufacturing costs.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) initially developed its own e-axle technology. Reuters couldn't determine whether it continues to use it in more recent models.
GM, Nissan and some other carmakers believe e-axles offer such a large margin for cost efficiencies and product differentiation that they want to design and manufacture their own systems. GM believes it can better integrate the e-axle with the battery and the rest of the vehicle, making for a quieter, smoother and more economical drive, said Adam Kwiatkowski, GM's executive chief engineer for global electrical propulsion systems.
""Technologies in a vehicle that are technically complicated, house a whole bunch of IP, and are capital intensive, you are always better off designing and producing them yourself,"" Kwiatkowski told Reuters in an interview.
If GM doesn't design its own e-axles, Kwiatkowski added, it will have to buy them, it won't be sure of their technical details or efficiency and will be locked into drive unit designs that may not be optimal.
A DIFFERENT APPROACH
Nidec's Nagamori has said he believes the way to become a market leader in e-axles is to focus on making the technology inexpensive. The way to do that, he says, is by being able to produce every component and sub-technology that goes into an e-drive system, and by building up scale to produce more.
That's in part why Nidec, a motor specialist, has been on the hunt for firms with an expertise in power electronics. It acquired automotive electronic control system producer Honda Elesys Co from Honda in 2014 and the automotive electronics division of Japan's Omron Corp in 2019.
To close out the e-axle technical loop, Nidec has set its sights on JATCO, an automotive transmission producer in Fuji city at the foot of Mt. Fuji, 75% owned by Nissan.
According to two sources familiar with Nagamori's thinking, Nidec's founder believes JATCO is in play because of financial problems at Nissan that have already forced the automaker to sell non-essential assets, including its fleet of corporate jets.
Over the past year, Nidec has poached several Nissan executives, including its former vice-COO Jun Seki.
Nagamori succeeded in hiring Seki shortly after he was passed over for Nissan's top job last year. News emerged late on Oct 8, 2019 that Makoto Uchida had been chosen as Nissan's new global chief. The following morning, Seki received a call from a headhunter, said one of the sources. Nagamori wanted to sit down with him.
Shortly thereafter, Seki traveled to Kyoto to meet Nagamori, intending to rebuff the approach, the source said. Instead, Nagamori talked Seki into considering helping Nidec ride the wave of electrification sweeping the auto industry and turn Nidec into a 10-trillion-yen company by 2035.
In November, as talks between the two men progressed, Nidec contacted Nissan about its interest in taking a controlling stake in JATCO. The answer was ""no,"" according to well-placed sources at Nidec and Nissan, because Nissan's top executives want to keep key e-axle technology in house. Nissan declined to comment about the matter.
By late December Seki resigned from Nissan, and on Jan 13 this year he boarded the bullet train to Kyoto, to eventually assume the position of Nidec's president and COO. Among Seki's first tasks: recruit more top talent from Nissan, which he did by bringing in a few of his former colleagues, and finish the takeover of JATCO.
In February, Nidec approached Nissan again about acquiring JATCO, and once more Nissan's answer was ""no,"" said the same well-placed sources at Nidec and Nissan. According to these sources, Nissan's COO Ashwani Gupta told Seki and other Nidec executives that Nissan considers JATCO ""one of our core technological competences"" and is only interested in talking about forming an alliance to collaborate on developing next-generation e-axle technology. The sources said Gupta added that if Nissan were desperate for cash, it would sell its 1.5% stake in  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) before selling its stake in JATCO. Nissan declined to comment.
Nissan repeated the message on Aug 6 when two Nidec managers visited the carmaker's global headquarters in Yokohama, one of the well-placed sources said. Then, on Aug 19, Gupta told staff at JATCO's head office that JATCO is ""an important asset for Nissan"" and a ""partner."" JATCO spokeswoman Masako Fujita confirmed the gist of Gupta's remarks.
Nagamori remains confident about the prospects for Nidec's e-axle business. He is set to pump 500 billion yen into setting up factories in China, Mexico and Poland and investing in the technology. And Nidec is engaged in what some competitors describe as aggressive pricing by cutting its price to automakers to about $1,200 to $1,300, well below the industry's estimated average cost of $1,800.
Nidec has signed supply deals with Geely, as well as GAC Motor and its joint ventures with Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Chinese EV upstart NIO. Nidec is also rumoured recently to have landed additional deals to supply Geely's joint venture with Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and a joint venture between Great Wall Motor and BMW. Nidec declined to comment on the rumored deals. It also declined to comment about pricing.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 06:41AM ET</span>",Magyar Telekom considers subletting headquarters as COVID-19 keeps workers away,"By Gergely Szakacs
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Locked into a 15-year lease agreement, Magyar Telekom (BU:MTEL) is considering subletting some of its new headquarters, one of several options under review as the coronavirus pandemic upends long-term plans for Hungary's largest office building.
The Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) unit, one of Hungary's biggest companies which employs more than 7,000 people, had spent just over a year working in the state-of-the-art office complex on the outskirts of Budapest.
When the first wave of the pandemic hit and Hungary went into lockdown, the 58,000 square-metre building was closed. After a short reopening, most employees were told to work from home again from September as COVID-19 cases in Hungary surged.
Of 5,500 employees normally working in the building, only 150-200 were on site under strict hygiene regulations early this week.
""Our management has decided that when normal business resumes, 40% of our employees will be working from home,"" Corporate Communications Director Istvan Kutas said in the empty offices, where most hallway lights were out.
""An average employee will work two days per week from home,"" he said. ""There will be people who never work from home, but some will be doing so permanently.""
As of Wednesday, Hungary had reported 40,782 coronavirus cases with 1,023 deaths. The daily COVID-19 death toll on Tuesday hit a record 28.
The company, which launched its commercial 5G service in April with employees working remotely, is exploring ways to utilise some vacant office space, as renegotiating its long-term lease contract with property developer Wing is not an option.
Magyar Telekom did not say how much it pays for the lease, which commercial real estate sector sources say could cost between 14 to 18 euros per square metre a month, bringing its annual cost to around 10-12.5 million euros.
Both companies declined to comment on details of the contract.
""We are looking at several options, including inviting some of our close partner companies into our headquarters, as well as moving employees in from other offices and selling those properties,"" Kutas said.
He declined to give further details about plans. It was unclear when staff could return to the building, which boasts three underground parking floors, a pond and a rooftop jogging track.
Kutas said the company spent half a billion forints ($1.64 million) on protecting its facilities from COVID this year, including more frequent cleaning and coating some surfaces with a lasting disinfectant.
Magyar Telekom expects to incur costs worth hundreds of millions of forints as it needs to provide employees with masks and other protective gear.
Agnes Sziget, who works in Magyar Telekom's human resources department, said she had not felt an impact on her productivity while working from home, but she missed the office atmosphere.

""Virtual sessions can never replace face-to-face meetings,"" she said. ""I miss my colleagues, our interactions and shared laughter the most.""

1440,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 05:51AM ET</span>",SoftBank restarts buybacks as asset sales swell cash pile,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) resumed its share buybacks in September, after an enforced pause in August due to asset sales, saying on Wednesday it spent 40 billion yen ($380 million) of its growing cash pile.
This is in line with previous signalling of a slower pace of purchases from SoftBank, which spent 1 trillion yen on buybacks between March and early August after the gap between the value of its assets and market valuation reached record levels.
SoftBank's shares traded sideways during the lull in August ahead of deal news, which included the sale of chip designer Arm to  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA), but have since resumed their climb and closed near two decade highs on Wednesday. 
In a sign of SoftBank's restored confidence, its Vision Fund plans to market a blank-check company to investors, a source told Reuters, as it joins a trend to offer private companies a quick route to public markets.
The size of the company has not been decided, the source said, but could include SoftBank cash. In July 2019 SoftBank said it had secured $108 billion in pledges for a successor to its $100 billion Vision Fund, before a string of soured bets undermined fundraising efforts.
A recovery at the first fund, which analysts say could trigger a broader reappraisal of the group's investing abilities, has yet to be seen, with its assets still underwater at the end of June. 
Mitsunobu Tsuruo, a  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst, forecasts SoftBank's earnings ""at roughly breakeven"" for the year ended March, while cautioning that it is ""exceptionally hard for people outside the firm to establish a rational outlook for earnings"". 

Citigroup estimates SoftBank's asset sales have topped 9 trillion yen ($85 billion) in the last six months.

1441,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 05:47AM ET</span>",StockBeat: ASML Gets a Lift From Apple's Marketing Machine,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Amid all the ballyhoo about Apple’s new 5G-enabled iPhones, investors are also giving it up for the company that made them possible.
ASML (AS:ASML) is the Dutch company that makes the machine that prints the circuitry on the new iPhones’ chips, at the cutting edge of what’s known as the “five nanometer process”.  Its proprietary technology, embedded in machines that cost over $120 million each, allow the transistors on the new chips to be shrunk to a width of five billionths of a meter. That means many more of them can be packed on to a single chip, greatly increasing its overall computing power. Right now, it's the only company in the world that can make such machines.
Thanks to the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) marketing machine, ASML shares are flying again. They’re up 10% over the last three weeks as the hype around the new iPhones had cranked up, even though they fell 1.2% on profit-taking after the company’s third-quarter results, which were published on Wednesday.
Chief financial officer Roger Dassen indicated in a video accompanying the results that the company may not quite meet its full-year guidance for delivering the so-called EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) machines that make the new chips but still said he expects ASML to “approach” the 4.5 billion euros ($5.3 billion) in EUV revenue it has guided for. He added that he expects EUV revenue to rise another 20% next year.
Otherwise, the results contained few surprises in themselves, with net sales up by around one-third over the last three months and up 25% over the first nine months of the year. Net profit nearly doubled from the third quarter of 2019 and was up by half over the first nine months. That’s a more than respectable performance in a year when many manufacturing companies have flirted heavily with disaster. It pays to be making the product of the future.
So far so healthy. But there’s a reason why the shares underperformed in September. The U.S. imposed sanctions on Chinese chipmaker SMIC on national security grounds, as part of its wider battle for global control of high-performance technology. SMIC is understood to be ASML’s biggest customer in China, a country that is on course to account for over 1 billion euros in sales this year – more than 10% of the group total.
Dassen said that the company will be able to ship its less sensitive Deep UV technology machines to China from the Netherlands without an export license, but the cutting-edge EUV systems, developed and manufactured in San Diego, Ca., will be subject to license restrictions that – at present – look unlikely to be relaxed whatever the outcome of November’s presidential election.
That matters because the market for 5G phones is likely to be a lot stronger in China in the foreseeable future than anywhere else in the world, simply because China has a big lead in rolling out 5G networks.  In the long term, that could mutate into a significant shrinkage of ASML's total addressable market, if the U.S. and China insist on dividing the world up into technological spheres of influence. For now, however, ASML can  still reap the considerable rewards of global market leadership.

The antitrust division of the department fined the company for restraining competition, which affected three contracts for the sale of chicken products to a customer in the United States, Pilgrim's said.
""We are encouraged that today's agreement concludes the Antitrust Division's investigation into Pilgrim's,"" Chief Executive Officer Fabio Sandri said in a statement. 
The plea agreement is subject to the approval of the United States District Court of Colorado. 
It comes after Pilgrim's then CEO Jayson Penn was indicted in June along with three other current and former industry executives on charges of seeking to fix the price of chickens. Penn has pleaded not guilty.
Pilgrim's said it expects to record the fine as a miscellaneous expense in its financial statements in the third quarter.

The stock was also boosted by source-based reports in dailies La Repubblica and Il Messaggero that CDP had teamed up with private equity firm Blackstone (N:BX) and infrastructure fund Macquarie to prepare a bid for Atlantia's 88% stake in Autostrade per l'Italia (ASPI).
Atlantia said on Tuesday it had entered exclusive talks with CDP until Oct. 18, adding it was open to considering a potential offer from CDP and other investors for the Autostrade stake.
Atlantia's shares were up 10.2% by 0810 GMT.
""An agreement with CDP for the sale of ASPI would eliminate the political risk, solve the debt problem in the holding company ..., accelerate the return to an investment grade rating of the group and ensure financial flexibility to Atlantia,"" broker Equita said in a note.
CDP, Blackstone, Macquarie could not immediately be reached for a comment on the newspaper reports.
A source close to the deal said talks between CDP and Atlantia were at an early stage and while there were discussions with other potential investors, no joint bid was yet on the table.
Atlantia has been embroiled in a legal dispute with the Italian government since 2018 when a bridge run by Autostrade collapsed, killing 43 people. The government has threatened to strip Autostrade of its motorway licence.
The two parties had moved closer to an deal in July, when Rome approved a plan that would see Atlantia cede control of Autostrade to CDP, but talks had since stalled due to disagreements over how to implement it.

According to Il Messaggero, an offer from the CDP-led consortium could be presented as soon as Oct. 18, a day before Atlantia holds a board meeting, and could be worth 8 billion to 10 billion euros.

1444,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 04:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. apparel watchdog probes Jockey's Indian partner after human rights abuse allegations,"By Sachin Ravikumar and Chandini Monnappa
BENGALURU (Reuters) - A top apparel industry watchdog has launched an investigation into underwear maker Jockey International's Indian partner  Page Industries  Ltd (NS:PAGE) following allegations of human rights abuses at one of its factories, the watchdog told Reuters.
The investigation by U.S.-based Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP) comes after Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund dropped Page from its investment portfolio due to concerns of human rights violations at ""Unit-III"" - one of Page's Jockey manufacturing sites in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru.
Page has denied wrongdoing and called allegations https://etikkradet.no/files/2020/08/Page-ENG.pdf of verbal abuse and workplace intimidation against employees ""outrageous"". It did not answer Reuters' questions about the WRAP probe, but said it has evidence which ""flatly disproves"" the allegations.
Shares in Page Industries fell as much as 3.2% on India's National Stock Exchange on Wednesday after news of the probe. The stock, which had climbed 0.8% earlier on Wednesday, was down 1.2% as of 0820 GMT.
In an email to Reuters, WRAP spokesman Seth Lennon said such violations could normally result in a factory losing its certification.
""Should the facility refuse to remediate such non-compliances or should the remediation efforts be insufficient, WRAP will revoke the facility's certification. In case any non-compliances noted prove to be so egregious as to leave no room for remediation, WRAP reserves the right to immediately suspend the facility's certificate,"" Lennon said.
WRAP said it makes certification decisions on a facility-by-facility basis and that it investigates whenever it receives credible concerns. 
The Page site under investigation is certified until Nov. 15. WRAP did not say whether it would investigate any of Page's other manufacturing sites.
A WRAP certificate is much sought after by garment factories in countries including India, Bangladesh, China and Vietnam, as it provides assurance to international clothing brands that a factory adheres to certain ethical and safety standards.
U.S.-based Jockey, a WRAP founding member, told Reuters it requires all of its partners to maintain the certification and that it would ""closely monitor"" the outcome of an internal evaluation of the allegations being carried out by Page. 
It did not comment on whether it would sever ties with Page if the Indian company was censured by WRAP.
Bengaluru-headquartered Page is the exclusive licensee for Jockey wear in India and six other countries. Page also makes apparel for Britain-based swimwear maker Speedo, but in a smaller capacity.
Speedo said last month it would investigate the Norwegian wealth fund's allegations and follow up with Page ""as a matter of urgency"". It did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment on the WRAP probe.
While WRAP did not specify when it began its investigation into the Page factory, a person with knowledge of the development said it started in late September.
The Unit-III factory in Bengaluru employs about 1,000 workers. Page, which reported roughly $400 million in revenue in the fiscal year ended March 31, did not disclose what proportion of sales came from Unit-III.
The outcome of the WRAP probe is due in the coming weeks, the person said, without specifying a date. The person was not authorised to speak publicly on the matter and so declined to be identified.
WRAP said it would not comment on the details of an ongoing investigation.
Page said it has engaged with the Norwegian wealth fund's Council on Ethics - the body which recommended the fund exclude Page from its portfolio after its investigation ""assessed the risk that Page is contributing to or is itself responsible for systematic abuses of internationally recognised human and labour rights"".

The Council on Ethics told Reuters it had accepted Page's request for a meeting, and that it would likely need to conduct another investigation to assess whether its recommendation on Page should change.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares held steady on Wednesday, underpinned by gains for Wall Street futures, following losses the day before on vaccine trials and a stimulus impasse, while the dollar was also stable.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was unchanged in early trading, and markets in Frankfurt (GDAXI), London (FTSE) and Paris (FCHI) were steady to higher.
Markets had little direction as they grappled with ""angst about vaccine/antibody delays, angst about rising covid cases in Europe, stalled U.S. fiscal talks, stalled Brexit trade talks"", said Kit Juckes, macro strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY). 
Wall Street futures (ESc1) were up 0.4%, however, with U.S. banks Goldman Sachs (N:GS),  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) and Bank of America (N:BAC) scheduled to report results on Wednesday, following above-estimate earnings from JPMorgan (N:JPM) and  Citigroup  (N:C) in the previous session.
Stock market losses began on Wall Street Tuesday when Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) said it was pausing a COVID-19 vaccine trial after a study participant suffered an unexplained illness.
Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY) later said it too had paused the clinical trial of its COVID-19 antibody treatment because of a safety concern, leading the U.S. equity market to deepen losses.
J&J shares lost 2.3%, and Eli Lilly closed down nearly 3%.
Hopes for the passage of a new coronavirus relief package also faded as U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected a $1.8 trillion relief proposal from the White House.
""U.S. stimulus talks are still going nowhere, dimming the prospect of a new round of support this side of the election,"" said Sydney-based NAB strategist Rodrigo Catril.
In addition, investors are watching tensions between the European Union and Britain after the EU demanded ""substantive"" movement on Tuesday on fisheries, dispute settlement and guarantees of fair competition in their talks on a post-Brexit trade deal.
Sterling declined the most among major currencies, down 0.4% against the euro (EURGBP=), the dollar  and yen (GBPJPY=). EU leaders will hold a summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday to assess progress.
Euro zone August industrial production data is due on Wednesday.

BREATHER 
Oil slipped on concerns that fuel demand will continue to falter on concern rising coronavirus cases across Europe and in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer, will impede economic growth.
Brent (LCOc1) and U.S. crude (CLc1) were off around 0.5% at $42.24 and $39.97 a barrel, respectively.
The U.S. dollar was steady after its best day in three weeks on Tuesday, when its index (=USD) against a basket of six major currencies rose 0.5%. The index was last 0.1% higher at 93.62. The euro (EUR=) was barely changed at $1.1734.
Government bonds were also seeing small moves (DE10YT=RR) (US10YT=RR), though German bund yields, which move inversely to prices, dipped to their lowest since May [EUR/GVD]. Gold, another safe haven, picked up 0.26% .
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) had tracked Wall Street's losses overnight to end a seven-day rally. 

The index was last down 0.25%, having toppled from a two-and-a-half-year high of 588.76 touched on Tuesday. Chinese shares (CSI300) closed down 0.7%.

(Reuters) - European shares steadied on Wednesday after tumbling in the previous session due to a pause in a COVID-19 vaccine trial and on concerns about more lockdowns, although investors stayed away from big bets ahead of talks on a Brexit trade deal.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was flat by 0746 GMT, recovering from its first fall in four days.
Early gains in auto (SXAP), banking (SX7P) and technology (SX8P) stocks were offset by a slide in the travel and leisure (SXTP) and energy (SXEP) sectors.
Hopes of more stimulus to help businesses ride out the COVID-19 pandemic helped European shares track gains in global equities in the past few weeks, but prospects of more lockdowns and signs of a delay in a vaccine have since dented sentiment.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Tuesday imposed new restrictions on gatherings, restaurants, sports and school activities.
""There is still hope that targeted restrictions might be able to contain the spread of the virus,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Thu Lan Nguyen.
""If infection trends were to continue this hope will start to dwindle though (and) it would look to the market as if the U.S. was handling the pandemic better after all.""
Although trading in most country indexes was muted, a weaker pound lifted London's FTSE 100 (FTSE) by 0.4% ahead of a UK-imposed Oct. 15 deadline on Brexit negotiations. Growing political friction about the impact of new local COVID-19 restrictions has also hit sentiment. 
The European Union would prefer to have a Brexit trade deal, but it is ready in case no agreement can be reached, the Commissioner for the EU's single market said.
Focus later in the day will be on euro zone industrial production data for August, which is expected to show an increase of 0.8% month-on-month following a 4.1% gain in July.
In company news, Italy's  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) jumped 9.1% to the top of the STOXX 600 after entering exclusive talks until Oct. 18 with state lender Cassa Despositi e Prestiti over the sale of the group's motorway assets.
The UK's  Bunzl  Plc (L:BNZL) rose 5.5% as it said it expected a slightly higher operating profit margin and stronger revenue growth in the second half of the year.

Overall, third-quarter earnings at STOXX 600 firms are expected to have declined by 36.7% year-on-year, smaller than a 50.8% plunge in the second quarter, according to data from Refinitiv.

Masayoshi Son’s conglomerate bought back 6.17 million shares last month, it said in a filing Wednesday, part of a now half-completed 2.5 trillion yen buyback program. The firm halted that in early August, about a month before announcing a deal to sell U.K. chip designer Arm Ltd. to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp. for $40 billion.
The Japanese company resumed buying on Sept. 15, the day after unveiling that mega-deal, then bought on every single business day till the final five days of the September quarter, when it’s prohibited from doing so. Despite the flurry of purchases, its shares are still down 2% over the month, after news emerged that the company was trading tech options, a strategy some investors deemed risky.

Still, SoftBank’s stock is at two-decade highs, bouncing back after a year of coronavirus setbacks and losses at startups such as WeWork. It’s more than doubled from its March Covid-19 trough, aided also by plans to offload 4.5 trillion yen in assets -- an effort SoftBank is on track to surpass.
It’s so far only spent roughly 1 trillion yen of its envisioned share repurchase amount. As of September, it had used just a fraction of the 500 billion yen it pledged in a program decided on June 25. It also hasn’t launched a 1 trillion yen buyback plan the board agreed upon on July 30. SoftBank acknowledged in July it might not complete the buybacks by its originally scheduled target of March 31, the end of its fiscal year.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged largely higher Wednesday, helped by some positive corporate news. However, gains are tepid and uncertainty is rife as the coronavirus continues to weigh.
At 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.4%, while the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1%.
TomTom (AS:TOM2) stock soared 6.7% after the Dutch navigational-technologies company announced it has extended its contract with Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER). It said its basic underlying earnings for the third quarter had fallen sharply on the year, although they were still above forecasts.
 Ashmore  Group (LON:ASHM) stock climbed 6.2% after the asset manager said that assets under management for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 rose 2.3% to $85.5 billion. 
On the flip side, ASOS (LON:ASOS) stock dropped 5.6%. The online fashion retailer said the economic prospects and lifestyles of its core 20-something audience are likely to remain disrupted for the foreseeable future, but still said its fiscal 2020 pretax profit tripled and forecast that underlying profit would rise again in the current fiscal year. .
The spread of the Covid-19 virus, particularly across Europe, continues to breed uncertainty with a number of countries widening restrictions to try to regain a grip on the pandemic. 
Infections rose at the fastest pace since April in Germany, France reported a surge in patients needing intensive care and new cases in Italy jumped to the highest level since March.
At the same time, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) placed its antibody test on hold due to potential safety concerns, just a day after Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) paused its Covid-19 vaccine trial because of a participant’s unexplained illness.
The International Monetary Fund is due later Wednesday to publish its most detailed study of the pandemic’s impact on public finances. The central point is expected to be that it’s still too early for governments to worry about having to pay for rescue efforts and thus ease back on fiscal spending. 
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is set to speak later Wednesday at the virtual annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group, and she is likely to press home that more is needed to combat this outbreak.
Oil prices edged lower Tuesday amid concerns of demand stagnating as rising coronavirus cases, particularly in Europe and the U.S., cause growth to slacken.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its forecast for oil demand in 2021 by 80,000 barrels per day to 96.84 million barrels per day in its monthly report on Tuesday, citing damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

""We are moving full scale production of Escape PHEV to the 2021 model year. The first Escape PHEVs will be sold next year,"" a company spokesman said in a statement.
The automaker said it recalled 20,500 Kuga PHEV vehicles in Europe last month and suspended their sale as it looks into potential concern with the high voltage battery, which in certain cases could result in a fire.
""Because we share components with Kuga PHEV, including battery cells, we are moving production to next year, while we work with the battery cell supplier to resolve the issue affecting Kuga PHEV in Europe,"" a company spokesman in Europe said. 

Ford, which builds Escape vehicles at Louisville plant in Kentucky, had first planned their production last spring, but that was delayed to this summer as the COVID-19 pandemic forced the automaker to shut factories.

1451,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 03:15AM ET</span>",Column: How the market learned to stop worrying and love the blue wave - Mike Dolan,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - Just about the only market consensus all year on next month's U.S. election was that it would be volatile around the vote - but even that's turning upside down three weeks before polling.
A narrow and disputed election result has been one of the main investor fears for months. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s October global fund manager survey still had 60% of its respondents expecting the result to be contested - and three quarters said it was the outcome likely to cause most market disruption. 
But with Democratic challenger Joe Biden's consistent opinion poll lead since May widening into election day, bookmakers' odds on a clearcut outcome and Democrat clean sweep of the White House and both Houses of Congress are narrowing.
Investment banks and asset managers, who have for decades argued markets would baulk at tax and spend policies and prefer congressional gridlock to curb any excesses, are now positively embracing the likelihood of a clean sweep for a Democratic Party expected to spend big and also raise wealth and corporate taxes.
With less than a month to go, Wall Street stocks are racing to record highs again and long-elevated implied volatilities of the S&P500 benchmark - the VIX 'fear gauge' and its November and December futures contracts - are draining to 6-week lows.
Opinion polls now put Biden's lead over incumbent Donald Trump in double digits, almost twice September levels. Bookmakers in Europe put Trump as the 7/4 outsider, his longest odds of the campaign, and the Democrats are now favorite to take to take key swing states - Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
Online market PredictIt puts the chance of a Biden White House as high as 66% and a Democrat clean sweep at 59%.
Far from running scared, the investment world appears to be embracing all that. 
A ""blue wave election outcome has curiously flipped from consensus bear to bull catalyst in recent months,"" Bank of America's investment flow strategists said on Friday.
""The more likely a sweep, the less likely we see a prolonged election outcome,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s cross-asset strategist Andrew Sheets added.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategist John Normand explains further: ""The notion that the U.S. will soon deliver another round of sizable fiscal stimulus due to a Blue Wave is likely allowing investors to look through the current fiscal cliff, White House antics and even a contested election.""
""In simplest terms, a Democratic sweep reboots a U.S./global expansion that began around May, has been losing momentum since August and is at risk of a serious stumble,"" he added. ""Whatever one thinks about the course of regulatory policy, the margin impact of higher corporate taxes and the possibility of stealth deglobalization, what will matter more for the next 12 months will be front-loaded stimulus.""
SWEEP STAKES
So, barring a big upset from here, implied volatility may have been overcooked despite the twin uncertainties of the pandemic and an election - never mind persistent background angst about Brexit or yearend financial and economic stress. 
Even taking account of an assumed exaggeration of the VIX due to its use as a hedging tool, a VIX (VIX) near 30 at the end of September implied 1-2% daily market swings over the next month. In other words, a lot of jitters were already priced. 
The drop to as low as 24 over the past week - its lowest since August - looks more measured.
Although retaining a hefty premium at 28, the November  and December  VIX futures contracts are also at their lowest since late August as Democrat odds shorten.
Currency market volatility gauges <.DBCVIX> too have fallen to their lowest since July. Only bond market vol - pricing the effects of a steepening yield curve after a big fiscal splurge - has tended in the other direction. (MOVE) 
Some commentators point to the expected passing of Trump's erratic decision-making style and 'policy via Tweet' as another reason for lower volatility ahead.
After spiking to record highs as the pandemic unfolded, the World Economic Policy Uncertainty Index - largely based on media references to policy concerns - has subsided too and September's reading was back below August 2019 levels.
Yet, it's hard to disentangle the effects of this year's pandemic shock and massive rescues from the election itself. 
Despite Trump's relative unpredictability, there's little evidence his tenure before COVID-19 was any more volatile for equities than the previous four years. Just prior to the pandemic, currency volatility was half that of 2016 and bond market vol had subsided too.
What has diverged from the VIX of late is the tech-heavy Nasdaq's implied volatility (VXN) - now showing some of the biggest volatility premia over the wider market in 16 years. Whether that's regulatory fears under a Democratic government or greater use of options to bet on their continued upside is debatable - but some see churn ahead when the election and the pandemic move into the rear view mirror.
""A Biden win could be the moment to shift away from Big Tech - but not necessarily for regulatory reasons,"" Sheets said, adding a fiscal stimulus and a vaccine would steepen the yield curve and hasten the end of the ""abnormal economic environment"" that has disproportionately benefited Big Tech.

Liberty Global, set up by U.S. cable pioneer John Malone, offered 110 Swiss francs per share of Sunrise, Switzerland's second-biggest telecoms company, in a surprise deal in August.
The approach was a reversal of Sunrise's failed bid to buy Liberty's Swiss business, which collapsed after running into shareholder opposition last year.
At the end of the offer period on Oct. 8, 37.1 million Sunrise shares - equivalent to 81.98% of the voting rights and share capital - had been offered, the companies said on Wednesday in the definitive notice of the interim result.
The outcome, which exceeds the minimum acceptance threshold of two-thirds of all Sunrise shares being tendered, confirms the earlier provisional result.
An additional acceptance period of ten trading days will now start on Oct. 15 and run until Oct. 28.
An extraordinary shareholders meeting to be called by Sunrise will be held on or around Nov. 9, while Liberty Global intends to start the de-listing process for Sunrise from the SIX Swiss Exchange. It will also start the squeeze-out process for the remaining shareholders.

The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, is the latest sign of consolidation in the telecom industry as companies try to cut costs and ramp up investments in technology.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening mixed Wednesday, with investors looking to the world’s central bankers for guidance as the coronavirus tightens its grip.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%. 
The International Monetary Fund is due later Wednesday to publish its most detailed study of the pandemic’s impact on public finances. The central point is expected to be that it’s still too early for governments to worry about having to pay for rescue efforts and thus ease back on fiscal spending. 
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is set to speak later Wednesday at the virtual annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group, and she is likely to press home that more is needed to combat this outbreak.
The latest news surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic is hardly optimistic, with countries across Europe widening restrictions to try to regain a grip on the pandemic. 
Infections rose at the fastest pace since April in Germany, France reported a surge in patients needing intensive care and new cases in Italy jumped to the highest level since March.
At the same time, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) placed its antibody test on hold due to potential safety concerns, just a day after Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) paused its Covid-19 vaccine trial because of a participant’s unexplained illness.
In corporate news, ASML (AS:ASML), the semiconductor equipment maker, reported better-than=expected earnings for the third quarter earlier Wednesday, saying it also sees double-digit growth in 2021.
French cosmetics company L’Oreal (PA:OREP) is also likely to be in the spotlight after Le Figaro reported that it’s set to name deputy Chief Executive Officer Nicolas Hieronimus as its new chief, replacing long-time boss Jean-Paul Agon.
Oil prices edged lower Tuesday amid concerns of demand stagnating as rising coronavirus cases, particularly in Europe and the U.S., cause growth to slacken.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its forecast for oil demand in 2021 by 80,000 barrels per day to 96.84 million barrels per day in its monthly report on Tuesday, citing damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The weekly report on crude inventories by the American Petroleum Institute is due later in the session, having been delayed by a day because of the Columbus day holiday on Monday in the United States.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $39.97 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.5% to $42.25.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,898.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1743."
1455,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 12:54AM ET</span>",Xi Rallies China Behind Shenzhen as Global Tech Fight Heats Up,"(Bloomberg) -- President Xi Jinping vowed to press ahead with plans to gain the global lead in technology and other strategic industries, despite expanding efforts from the U.S. and its allies to check China’s rise.
The Chinese president reaffirmed his commitment to “opening up and reform” as a strategy for gaining economic advantage in a 50-minute speech Wednesday to mark the 40th anniversary of Shenzhen’s establishment as a special economic zone. With hundreds of local officials and executives present including Huawei Technologies Co. founder Ren Zhengfei, and Vice Premier Liu He looking on, Xi called for the making of the southern metropolis into a “model city for a great, modern socialist country.”
“We need to unswervingly implement an innovation-driven development strategy to foster new engines and new trends, so as to build a technological and industrial innovation high-ground with global influence,” Xi said, in remarks that didn’t mention China’s disputes with the U.S. and made only passing reference to “many unprecedented challenges” from abroad.
The speech represented a high-profile backing of the companies and leaders in the so-called Greater Bay Area, a designation that’s meant to to push China into higher-quality manufacturing and better integrate the former colonies of Hong Kong and Macau into the mainland. That means bolder policies to knit together several cities -- including Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Macau -- to create a regional powerhouse rivaling Tokyo Bay or Silicon Valley.
The speech did little to move the broader stock market, with the CSI 300 Index down 0.6% as of the mid-day break. The index of stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen, which surged 3% on Monday in anticipation of Xi’s visit, is within 1% of a five year high.
Xi’s speech visit also comes at a demanding time for China. The ongoing trade war with the U.S. and pandemic-driven economic downturn have increased the urgency of Beijing’s efforts to boost local consumption and close the technology gap in strategic industries. In recent months, Xi has urged a shift to a “dual-circulation” economy fueled by domestic growth and supplemented by foreign technology and investment.
Also helping to fuel inflows into Chinese assets are signs of a continued recovery in the world’s second-largest economy as the pandemic abates. China’s exports rose for the fourth straight month in September, while the nation’s stock market topped $10 trillion for the first time since 2015 on Tuesday.
During a sweep through manufacturing hub Guangdong province this week, the Chinese leader gave an inkling of what’s to come. He urged a greater focus on quality to overcome increased global uncertainty, and made a pitch for “self-reliance” during a visit to a local technology company, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.
Xi’s trip through the Pearl River Delta, which has an annual economic output larger than Indonesia, “is a huge signal that he wants to follow up on opening-up,” said Wang Huiyao, an adviser to China’s cabinet and founder of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing. “It’s a symbol of more openness. I’m expecting him to talk about the Greater Bay Area, policy incentives as well as how Hong Kong and China can collaborate.”
Former Fishing Village
Shenzhen could be the center of this new universe, said Hao Hong, chief strategist for Bocom International in Hong Kong. The once-sleepy fishing village that’s now home to Huawei Technologies Co. and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. could be given more autonomy and become the financing center for technology innovation.
Xi is scheduled to meet the leaders of Hong Kong and Macau in Shenzhen, as he seeks to leverage the former colonies’ separate trade and legal systems to help make the broader region more competitive.
Just like it was four decades ago, the city will again be a testbed for reform -- this time in land, human capital and capital markets, including the launch of a digital yuan. That’s why investors sent the Hong Kong and Chinese stock markets rallying earlier this week when Xi’s speech was announced, according to Hao.
“It’s a comprehensive reform aiming at elevating the city to the center of the Greater Bay Area,” he said. “The market is liking what it sees and is excited by this news.”

The revamped promotion will offer Walmart shoppers reduced prices during three separate savings events across November, the company said. Each savings event will begin online at Walmart.com and continue in Walmart stores.
While Black Friday, held the day after the Thanksgiving public holiday, remains a major marketing event for retailers, its relevance has faded in recent years due to early online promotions.
In recent months, a slew of retailers including Walmart,  Target  (N:TGT),  Best Buy  (N:BBY), and Kohl's (N:KSS), announced plans to roll-out their earliest shopping season, moving winter holiday promotions forward to as early as October.
On Tuesday, Best Buy sent an email to shoppers advertising deeply discounted laptops, tablets, printers and other items for their ""Black Friday Prices Guaranteed Sale.""
Several major U.S. retailers have also announced store closures on Thanksgiving and plan to bypass the midnight Black Friday door-buster sales, which traditionally mark the start of the holiday season, due to social distancing requirements.
""Although this year's event looks different, our commitment to what our customers depend on us for...hasn't changed,"" said Scott McCall, Walmart U.S. executive vice president and chief merchandising officer.

Those promotions will be on everything from TVs to bath towels to blenders.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Wednesday morning after two major U.S. COVID-19 treatment trials were paused over patient safety concerns. Also hampering stocks is the ongoing lack of action on U.S. COVID-19 stimulus plans, with any action looking increasingly likely to be put off until after the U.S. elections.
The Shanghai Composite was up down 0.46% at 11:08 PM ET (3:08 AM GMT) and Shenzhen’s SZSE Composite was down 0.47%. Chinese President Xi Jinping is due to deliver an “important address” in Shenzhen later in the day, marking the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the special economic zone. The speech is expected to lay out greater autonomy for the region.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched up 0.07%, reversing some earlier losses. South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.69%, with the Bank of Korea keeping its key interest rate steady at 0.50% earlier in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched up 0.04% and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 inched down 0.08%.
Asia Pacific markets were subdued in early trading , after Eli Lilly and Co.'s (NYSE:LLY) COVID-19 antibody treatment trial was paused over concerns for patient safety, pulling U.S. markets down by the close of the previous day’s trading. The news follows Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) pause on clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine the day before due to a patient illness.
“That just spoke to the fact that a vaccine could take longer to be delivered than what the market’s expectations are calibrated towards,” CommSec market analyst Tom Piotrowski told Reuters.
Adding to investor concerns is the strengthening likelihood of no U.S. COVID-19 stimulus package becoming available until after the Nov. 3 U.S. elections. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest $1.8 trillion COVID-19 as it stands, and even that deal met resistance from the president’s own party, with several Senate Republicans denouncing its cost.
Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management had this to say of recent U.S. stimulus events, telling Bloomberg, “It’s been a rollercoaster ride in terms of communication from both sides. There are still going to be significant pockets of stress in the economy.”
However, the increasing odds of a Democrat win at the polls are giving positivity to the markets, as a Democrat stimulus package is anticipated to be far more substantial than the recent deals that have been on offer.
Rising European COVID-19 cases are present further market headwinds, with increased restrictions planned for many countries.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set a deadline of Oct. 15 to finalize the framework of a U.K/E.U trade deal, though there is much skepticism about the likelihood of such a deal being completed in the timeframe.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is to open the virtual annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. The meetings take place over Oct. 12-18."
1458,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 10:55PM ET</span>",Hyundai Motor heir takes over from father after 20 years in waiting,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  Group appointed Euisun Chung as group chairman on Wednesday, cementing his succession from his octogenarian father in a move likely to give impetus to the world's fifth-largest automaker's push into electric vehicles and flying cars. 
In the first generational handover at the South Korean automobile giant in 20 years, Chung, 49, said he hoped to lead change at South Korea's second-biggest conglomerate as it battles to stay ahead of the pack in a time of rapid technological innovation in the global auto industry.
""Carrying on their bold and innovative legacies, I feel privileged, yet also a sense of great responsibility for opening a new chapter of Hyundai Motor Group,"" Chung said in his inauguration speech to employees. 
Chung identified autonomous driving, electrification, hydrogen fuel cell, robotics and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) - industry jargon for flying cars - as his initiatives for the future. 
Hyundai Motor shares were trading up 0.3% after rising as much as 2.5% after the appointment, while the wider market (KS11) was down 0.6%. Kia Motors (KS:000270) and  Hyundai Mobis  (KS:012330) fell 1.6% and 1.1%, respectively. 
LEGACIES 
Hyundai Motor Group earlier on Wednesday said Chung had been promoted to chairman from executive vice chairman, replacing his father, Mong-Koo Chung, who was made honorary chairman. 
Key affiliates of Hyundai Motor Group, including Hyundai Motor (KS:005380), endorsed his inauguration unanimously. 
The appointment makes Chung the latest third-generation leader to take over one of South Korea's family-led conglomerates, which have been credited with lifting the war-stricken country out of poverty since the 1950s. 
His father took the wheels of the group in 2000 and transformed the company, once mocked for poor vehicle quality, into the world's No.5 automaker. 
The 82-year-old has been stepping back from frontline operations in recent years, and gave up his board seat in Hyundai Motor earlier this year. 
Euisun Chung has played an increasingly visible leadership role since September 2018 when he was promoted to executive vice chairman. 
Hyundai Motor Group invested $1.6 billion in a self-driving technology joint venture with U.S. Aptiv (N:APTV), forged a partnership with Uber (N:UBER) on electric air taxis and invested in ride-hailing firm Grab.
In July Chung set a goal to win more than 10% of the global market for battery EVs by 2025. 
Legacy automakers with similar ambitions face a growing threat from Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), which has become the most valuable automaker. 
Hyundai recently said it plans to recall its top-selling EVs because of battery fire risks.
Euisun Chung does not have a major stake in Hyundai Mobis (KS:012330), an affiliate seen as key to control of the group, and is expected to renew the push for ownership restructuring to cement his influence after a previous attempt in 2018 met shareholder opposition. 

Chung is credited with steering the turnaround of Kia Motors by hiring former Audi designer Peter Schreyer. As vice chairman of Hyundai Motor, he also launched the luxury brand Genesis in 2015.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Jeffrey Ubben, the former activist turned ethical investor, said on Tuesday that environmental, social and governance concerns will increasingly hit companies' stock prices, just as climate change hurt oil and gas companies' shares. 
Ubben, who retired from the $16 billion activist firm ValueAct Capital Management LP in June to start Inclusive Capital Partners LP, an ESG-focused fund manager, said stock prices of many large companies had yet to fully reflect the global problems to which they contributed, such as McDonald’s Corp (N:MCD) on obesity and  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) on plastic waste, but that was beginning to change. 
""The externalities of the core business are now starting to be reflected in the stock price,” he said in an interview at Reuters Events’ ESG Investment North America conference https://reutersevents.com/events/esg-investment-north-america. 
In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola said that the company was ""committed to being a responsible business"" and has invested globally to increase bottle and can recovery while already using at least 50% recycled content in all packaging. Representatives for McDonald’s did not respond to an email seeking comment. 
Ubben also decried what he called the “productizing” of ESG investing through exchange-traded funds, products that invest in a basket or index of stocks known as ETFs, saying they allowed investors to feel good but that their money was not being used to cause major change. 
ESG exchange-traded funds managed by BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and others own too many widely held stocks that satisfy “checklist” criteria but whose broader businesses could be problematic, Ubben said. 
“They own the same 10 stocks as the S&P,” Ubben said, citing Google (O:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) as examples. “It allows people to run away from the problem and think they are doing something.” 
A spokesman for BlackRock declined to comment. The firm has seen some $25 billion flow into its ESG ETFs this year, double the amount in 2019, according to its earnings report on Tuesday.
CEO Larry Fink said in a January letter to company chief executives that BlackRock was expanding its suite of ESG products because it wanted to ""make sustainable investing more accessible to all investors.""
Ubben said he was supportive of Fink's broader efforts to increase its engagement with companies on ESG issues.  
Ubben said Inclusive, which managed $1.3 billion as of July and is backed by Affiliated Managers Group (N:AMG), would look for investments in growth companies with strong potential for ESG impact, or those that traded lower after belatedly accounting for external ESG impact and were committed to change. 
Inclusive’s portfolio so far, Ubben said, includes wood pellet maker  Enviva Partners LP  (N:EVA); renewable diesel company Darling Ingredients Inc (N:DAR); indoor farmer AppHarvest; educational technology business Strategic Education (O:STRA); and electric truck maker  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA). 
Nikola, for which Ubben is a director, has recently come under pressure to prove its nascent hydrogen-powered technology. 

“When the price will presume the status quo, we come in and change the strategy,"" he said. ""That’s the idiosyncratic return that we seek.”

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Tuesday launched its next-generation iPhone 12, with faster 5G connectivity that the California company hopes will spur consumers to trade in their old phones and keep its sales booming through the end of the year.
The core of the line-up, the iPhone 12 with a 6.1-inch display, will sell for $799, while a 'Mini' version with a 5.4-inch screen will be slightly cheaper at $699. A 'Pro' version with three cameras and a new 3-D 'lidar' sensor starts at $999, with the largest 'Pro Max' starting at $1,099 and going up to $1,399.
The new products will test whether Apple can ride a wave of consumer excitement around 5G wireless data networks, whose speediest variants outstrip their predecessors' data rates multiple times over. 
But whether iPhone buyers see a dramatic speed boost will depend heavily on where they are and which carrier they use - what Bob O'Donnell, head of TECHnalysis Research, called ""lots of little niggly details that get in the way of delivering on the promise of 5G."" 
He said Apple may be setting some customers up for disappointment when phones ship but offer only modest speed increases until carriers build out networks.
""I don't feel like Apple clarified that as much as they could have,"" O'Donnell said.
Apple said all iPhone 12 models in the United States will support millimeter wave 5G, the fastest variant of the technology, as well as lower-frequency bands. 
Outside of the United States, however, iPhones will lack millimeter wave compatibility, even in countries like Australia and South Korea where carriers are planning to roll out versions of the millimeter wave technology. Like some cheaper Android devices, iPhone 12 models in those countries will only support lower-frequency versions of 5G. 
Apple said it had tested 5G on more than 800 carriers in 30 regions globally.  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) CEO Hans Vestberg appeared on Apple's livestream presentation to announce that the phones would work with the U.S. carrier's 'ultrawideband' 5G network, designed to alleviate bottlenecks in major cities like New York and Los Angeles, as well as in crowded areas like NFL stadiums. 
The devices will arrive about a month later than is usual for Apple's annual launches. Pre-orders for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro in the United States, Britain, China and some other countries begin Oct. 16 and deliveries start Oct. 23. The iPhone Mini and Pro Max will be available for pre-order Nov. 6 and in stores Nov. 13.
Apple may face a lukewarm holiday season due to the coronavirus pandemic, said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
""As the convergence of flu season with COVID and colder weather forces everyone indoors, I think it's going to be harder to sell iPhones this Christmas. As much as Apple is a technology company, it's not known for its online sales, it's known for its in-store experience,"" Dollarhide said.
Shares of Apple fell over 3% during the event, erasing $77 billion worth of stock market value, and closed down 2.7%.
HOMEPOD MINI
Apple also announced a HomePod Mini smart speaker that will cost $99 and be shipped from Nov. 16. Many of the features serve as a catch-up to similar offerings from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.
But Ben Bajarin, principal analyst for consumer market intelligence at research firm Creative Strategies, said Apple had fleshed out its vision for how its devices could interact more directly with its own speakers than rivals had. For example, Apple customers can speak into their iPhone or iPad to use the HomePod Minis like an intercom system.

""That's not something that Google or Amazon, particularly Amazon, can do so cleanly,"" said Bajarin. ""The advantage Apple has that they pressed on is that a good portion of those (Google and Amazon) customers have iPhones. They leveraged the fact they own the pocket.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co is forging ahead with plans to build a mammoth new headquarters in New York, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday, despite the coronavirus pandemic casting serious doubt on the future of office buildings.
""We're building that headquarters for 50 years! It is not a short-term decision,"" Dimon said during a call with reporters after posting quarterly results.
Slated to open in 2024, for a price tag of as much as $3 billion, the building at 270 Park Avenue is to house about 14,000 employees.
At 1,425 feet, it would be the second-tallest office building in Manhattan behind One World Trade Center, nearly 200 feet higher than the Empire State Building and 225 feet above the nearby Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Tower, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.
An illustration by Lewis Garrison, a 3-D architectural illustrator who likes to make video flyovers of skylines, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCydmhyt2iXAMmpNNVFG_EUg?view_as=subscriber envisions JPMorgan's new headquarters towering over Midtown Manhattan, a T-Rex in what might seem like a field of dinosaurs.
But since pandemic lockdowns happened in March, far fewer workers have been going into offices, making it unclear why such a big skyscraper is necessary. 
JPMorgan has been showcasing new safety protocol and prodding white-collar employees to return, but New York's financial centers are nothing like they were before the pandemic. Major thoroughfares are more populated than when virus fears ran high, but the Midtown lunch crowd remains sparse.
The longer it goes on, the less temporary it seems.
Companies will need 10% to 20% less office space in a post-pandemic world, several real-estate brokerages predict. Nearly three-quarters of respondents to a Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) & Co survey in mid-September said they expect to work from home more often, up from 59% in its June tally.
Only one-in-five JPMorgan employees are going to offices in New York now, Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said. The company does not expect that to change for the foreseeable future.
JPMorgan will have a lasting shift toward working from home, Dimon said, but he doesn't know how big the change will be. The bank has as many people assigned to other New York buildings as it plans to have in the skyscraper and can adjust if necessary, he said.
""We have plenty of leeway in how we manage our real estate over time,"" Dimon said.
JPMorgan likely will adopt new floor plans that are less dense with larger conference rooms and perhaps more private offices, said Dennis Donovan, principal at Wadley Donovan Gutshaw Consulting. The bank will be able to do that from scratch instead of retrofitting.
It may also be part of Dimon’s legacy, a building to last beyond the time anyone is talking about his expense ratios or return on equity.
""It really is something that will endure well beyond COVID,"" said Jesse Keenan, a real-estate professor at Tulane University.

1464,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 06:40PM ET</span>",Fledgling private equity firms falter as virus curbs in-person wooing,"By Chibuike Oguh
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity fund investors have been favoring established buyout firms over first-time managers in recent months, as the challenges of carrying out due diligence remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic reduce their appetite for risk.
Out of the $127 billion raised by buyout firms between July and September, only $5.8 billion went to managers raising funds for the first time, the lowest level since 2013, according to industry data provider Preqin.
Some private equity fund investors said curbs on business travel were limiting their ability to familiarize themselves with new fund managers, and pushed them toward the relative safety of established players.
""It is definitely a higher bar in this environment because you can't have in-person meetings, you can't have a dinner with the manager, you can't really get to know the person,"" said Kelly Meldrum, head of primary investments at Adams Street Partners, a $41 billion ""fund-of-funds"" manager that invests in private equity funds on behalf of institutional investors.
In the third quarter of the year, Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX), the world's largest private equity firm, closed its fourth real estate debt fund after collecting $8 billion from investors. KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) also raised $950 million for its second real estate credit fund.
Few first-time managers achieved the same. Among them were Andros Capital Partners, which closed a $250 million fund focused on the energy sector, and Benford Capital Partners, which raised $130 million to buy small lower middle market businesses.
About 55% of institutional investors view virtual meetings as effective only for preliminary talks, and not as a replacement for in-person due diligence, according to a survey by placement agent Probitas Partners.
""The limitations on travel and meeting people have really made it much more difficult for first time funds in this environment,"" said Kelly Deponte, managing director at Probitas Partners, a fundraising advisory firm.
Overall, the private equity industry has held up against other asset classes during the pandemic. The Cambridge Associates private equity benchmark was up 10.34% in the second quarter, compared to a 20% rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period, according to the latest available data.
As more investors feel emboldened by the private equity sector's performance, this could give them confidence to back first-time managers again, said Sarah Sandstrom, a partner at Campbell Lutyens, a fundraising advisory firm.
""It is incrementally getting a bit easier. We don't have that same element of fear around the public market valuations and performance that we did in March and April,"" Sandstrom said.

BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - More data disclosure will help investors, employees and customers judge the pledges many American companies have made to diversify their workforces and boardrooms, activists and analysts said on Tuesday.
Companies should release specific information such as on the racial backgrounds of their directors or pay ranges of their workers, in order to maintain investors' faith amid shifting public attitudes, said speakers on a panel at the Reuters ESG Investment North America conference.
In a recent poll of Americans, only a quarter of respondents thought capitalism was good for society, said Martin Whittaker, CEO of Just Capital, which measures corporate performance on areas like workforce equality.
""We're not in a very good place right now in terms of faith in markets,"" Whittaker said.
U.S. companies rushed to offer support for racial equality after the death of George Floyd, a Black man, in police custody in Minneapolis in May, and amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Several panelists said they have gotten more outreach from top corporate executives this year who seem to have put a new focus on diversity and other ESG efforts.
""There’s been an awakening to climate and to systemic issues or more importantly structural barriers that seem to be woven into our institutions,"" said Lanaya Irvin, president of Coqual, an advisory firm focused on workplace bias.
But so far only a few companies have taken steps like publicly disclosing the government forms they file showing the race and gender of all employees by rank.
Brandon Rees, deputy director for corporations and capital markets for the AFL-CIO, the largest American labor federation, said the disclosures should be mandatory.

""It's important for the workforce as a whole to ensure that companies represent the communities that they serve,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co's U.S. lending arm agreed on Tuesday to pay a $4 million U.S. fine to settle a government agency's allegation that it improperly repossessed hundreds of consumers’ vehicles.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said that between 2013 and 2019, Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp (NMAC), a subsidiary of the Japanese automaker's North American unit, ""wrongfully repossessed hundreds of consumers' vehicles despite the consumer having made payments"" or taken other actions. Nissan must pay up to $1 million to consumers subject to a wrongful repossession.
NMAC said it denied wrongdoing but agreed to settle and takes the agency's ""assertions seriously and share their commitment to fair practices for all our customers.""
NMAC repossessed vehicles from consumers who made payments that decreased delinquency to less than 60 days past due or took other steps that should have prevented repossessions, the bureau said, adding NMAC told consumers it would not repossess vehicles
if payments were less than 60 days past due.
CFPB also found Nissan ""kept personal property in consumers’ repossessed vehicles until consumers paid a storage fee (and) deprived consumers paying by phone of the ability to select payment options with significantly lower fees.""
The agency said actions violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act prohibition against unfair and deceptive acts and practices. The settlement imposes requirements ""to prevent future violations and remediate consumers whose vehicles are wrongfully repossessed going forward,"" the bureau said.
CFPB also found that when Nissan agreed to modify loan payments for tens of thousands of consumers it ""used agreements or written confirmations that included language that created the net misimpression that consumers could not file for bankruptcy.""

In 2018, auto dealerships assigned NMAC over 382,000 new loans and 299,000 new leases, CFPB said, adding the same year NMAC serviced $49.3 billion in outstanding loans and leases.

1467,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 05:40PM ET</span>",Exclusive: FDA faults quality control at Lilly plant making Trump-touted COVID drug,"By Dan Levine and Marisa Taylor
(Reuters) - U.S. drug inspectors uncovered serious quality control problems at an Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co pharmaceutical plant that is ramping up to manufacture one of two promising COVID-19 drugs touted by President Trump as ""a cure"" for the disease, according to government documents and three sources familiar with the matter.
The Lilly antibody therapy, which is experimental and not yet approved by regulators as safe and effective, is similar to a drug from Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) Pharmaceuticals that was given to the president during his bout with COVID-19.
Trump, who credits the Regeneron drug with speeding his recovery, has called for both therapies to become available immediately on an emergency basis, raising expectations among some scientists and policy experts that the administration will imminently release an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the drug. The president's push is key to his efforts to convince voters he has an answer to the pandemic that has killed more than 215,000 Americans.
But the findings by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspectors at the Lilly manufacturing facility, which have not been disclosed previously, could complicate the drugmaker's bid for a so-called emergency use authorization (EUA) from the federal agency, two of the sources and two outside legal experts told Reuters. That's because U.S. law generally requires compliance with manufacturing standards for authorization of a drug.
The three sources who spoke to Reuters requested that their names be withheld so they could speak freely without fear of retaliation.
Inspectors who visited the Lilly plant in Branchburg, New Jersey, last November found that data on the plant's various manufacturing processes had been deleted and not appropriately audited, government inspection documents show.
""The deleted incidents and related audit trail were not reviewed by the quality unit,"" the FDA inspectors wrote. Because the government inspection documents reviewed by Reuters were heavily redacted by the FDA it was not possible to see the inspectors' more specific findings.
Following its November inspection, the FDA classified the problems as the most serious level of violation, resulting in an ""Official Action Indicated"" (OAI) notice.
That ""means that the violations are serious enough and have a significant enough impact on the public health that something needs to be fixed,"" said Patricia Zettler, a former associate chief counsel at the FDA who is now a law professor at Ohio State University.
Separately, Lilly said on Tuesday it had paused its clinical trial for the COVID drug in hospitalized patients ""out of an abundance of caution"" over a potential safety concern. The company did not release information on what the problem was and declined to say how the news might affect their EUA request.
In response to Reuters' questions on Monday about the manufacturing issues, Lilly confirmed the OAI notice but declined to provide details on what prompted the FDA action. The drugmaker said it has launched a ""comprehensive remediation plan,"" has increased staffing at the site and was working ""aggressively"" to address all concerns raised during the inspection.
The data deletions cited by the FDA, Lilly said, were not related to production of the drug. 
""These findings do not impact product quality or patient safety, as outlined in a detailed assessment submitted to FDA,"" the company's statement said. ""Lilly continues to provide updates to the FDA on progress towards completion of our detailed plan.""
The drugmaker declined to provide a copy of the assessment it gave the FDA. 
The FDA did not respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment.
One of the sources told Reuters that Lilly employees had complained about problems at the plant, including insufficient staffing and falsified records tracking whether workers had followed FDA manufacturing standards.
Lilly said the FDA has not made any findings of falsification at the site.
Out of 563 total inspections concluded in fiscal year 2019 by the FDA across the country, only a small fraction resulted in the most serious OAI classification, FDA data shows, and no other Lilly facility has received such a notice in at least 10 years.
None of Regeneron's facilities have received OAIs based on inspections through the end of October 2019, FDA records show. Regeneron said in a statement it was ""proud"" of the company's efforts to comply with manufacturing requirements, which ""is reflected in our FDA inspection record.""
Lilly has not disclosed the FDA inspections in its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. U.S. courts, in cases involving other companies, have ruled that such information could be material to investors. But that depends on several factors, including the severity of the FDA's findings, as well as whether the company has failed to correct the deficiencies.
In its statement to Reuters, Lilly did not respond to a question about why the inspections weren't disclosed.
PROMISE AND PITFALLS
Trump had previously focused on a promise to deliver a coronavirus vaccine by the Nov. 3 election, but that effort has since lost momentum due to doubts that any drugmaker will have enough proof of safety and efficacy in the coming weeks.
Now under increased pressure to act swiftly against the pandemic, the FDA has discretion to approve Lilly's COVID-19 therapy for emergency use even if the manufacturing issues have not been fully resolved.
The FDA has already been criticized by some scientists and politicians for issuing EUAs for use of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma treatment in coronavirus patients, despite little or problematic data. The agency ultimately withdrew its authorization for hydroxychloroquine and the plasma authorization remains in place.
The Branchburg plant specializes in a range of drugs that are injected by syringe or infused intravenously. Partly because of the risk of contamination, such treatments are more complex to make than conventional pills and require additional vigilance to ensure quality and safety, pharmaceutical experts say.
Lilly's drug, known as LY-CoV555, is a manufactured copy of an antibody from a patient who recovered from COVID-19. Known as monoclonal antibodies, such treatments work by recognizing and locking onto foreign invaders to block infection of healthy cells.
Leading scientists have pointed to antibody drugs as a promising way to treat people who are already sick, and also to temporarily prevent infection in people at high risk of COVID-19, until a successful vaccine is identified.
Lilly's clinical trial data thus far show its therapy may help reduce hospital stays and emergency room visits for COVID-19 patients. The company has asked U.S. regulators to approve emergency use of the drug for higher-risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild to moderate coronavirus.
Antibody drugs for the coronavirus are very limited in number, but Lilly says it expects to produce around one million doses of the treatment by the end of this year.
The Trump administration's program to accelerate development of COVID-19 vaccines and therapies, dubbed Operation Warp Speed, has already reached a $450 million deal with Regeneron for up to 300,000 treatment doses of its antibody treatment, REGN-COV2.
No such agreement has been reached with Lilly, but the government's interest in its therapy appears keen. Earlier this month, Warp Speed officials traveled to Branchburg to meet with Lilly executives, according to two sources briefed on the visit. Among the attendees were Lilly Chief Executive David Ricks and Chief Science Officer Dan Skovronsky, one source said.
A potential complication is the former relationship between Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Lilly, where he held a high-level position until 2017. Generally, he would have to sign off on a waiver for any company seeking an EUA that had been cited by the FDA for manufacturing problems. But because he is a former Lilly executive, Azar's involvement in the deliberations could pose a potential conflict of interest, legal experts said.
An HHS spokeswoman said Azar is not prohibited from participating in the deliberations about Lilly's manufacturing issues or its EUA. But she said that in general, Azar has delegated his emergency authorization powers to the FDA. 
HHS did not make Azar available for comment. 
PRESSURE TO ACT
Lilly acquired the New Jersey site when it bought ImClone Systems in 2008, and over the next ten years the FDA inspected the facility several times and found no serious problems.
That changed last November.
Two inspectors spent ten days at the facility, according to the redacted copy of their report, known as a ""483 letter"", which was reviewed by Reuters. The FDA inspectors described problems with ""appropriate controls over computers and production systems,"" and noted that data had been ""deleted"" and went unreviewed by company auditors.
After the November 2019 inspection, the FDA returned to the Lilly site for a follow up audit and found additional problems in August, issuing a second 483 letter, according to an FDA inspection log.
Among the problems: Lilly did not always have proper laboratory controls for drugs manufactured at the plant, the November inspection report said. One source said, for instance, that the plant failed to maintain systems meant to ensure that a popular anti-migraine drug, Emgality, met strength and purity standards.
If the issues aren't fixed, then the FDA could escalate the matter by issuing a warning letter, which sets out a deadline for correcting the problems. Ultimately, the FDA could order a company to cease producing certain drugs at a facility.

Lilly said it had not received a warning letter. 
Meanwhile, Trump is leaning on the FDA for a quick approval of the antibody drugs. He does not have the authority to issue an EUA under the law. 
However, he said in a video last week ""I have emergency use authorization all set. And we've got to get it signed now.""

The Frenchman, who joined L'Oreal in 1987 as a product manager, has worked his way up through various divisions, including professional products and luxury units. 
He will take over the operational reins of the group in April next year, the newspaper reported.
Agon, who is only L'Oreal's fifth CEO in its 113-year history, has been CEO since 2006 and announced earlier this year that he would be stepping down in 2021 when he turns 65 and his mandate expires.
He is expected to stay on as chairman, the French newspaper said.

(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY) said on Tuesday that the government-sponsored clinical trial of its COVID-19 antibody treatment similar to one taken by U.S. President Donald Trump has been paused because of a safety concern.
Trump touted the Lilly drug, along with the antibody treatment from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:REGN) that he received for his COVID-19, as tantamount to a cure in a video he posted last week.
The announcement comes one day after Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) said it was forced to pause a large high-profile trial of its experimental coronavirus vaccine because a volunteer fell ill. J&J said it does not yet know if that person was given the vaccine or a placebo.
AstraZeneca Plc's (L:AZN) U.S. trial for its experimental COVID-19 vaccine has also been on hold for over a month after a volunteer in its UK study fell ill. Trials of that vaccine resumed in other regions after a brief halt.
Lilly said earlier this month it was applying for emergency use authorization (EUA) for the antibody drug, LY-CoV555, for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 based on data from another clinical trial.
It is not uncommon to pause drug trials to investigate safety concerns, and such actions do not necessarily indicate a serious problem. Because of the urgent need for drugs and vaccines to tackle a pandemic that has claimed over 1 million lives worldwide - and the speed with which they are being developed - these trials have come under intense scrutiny.
""Out of an abundance of caution, the ACTIV-3 independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) has recommended a pause in enrollment,"" Lilly spokeswoman Molly McCully said in an emailed statement. ""Lilly is supportive of the decision by the independent DSMB to cautiously ensure the safety of the patients participating in this study.""
The Indianapolis-based drugmaker did not comment on the implications for the paused trial, called ACTIV-3, which is testing the treatment on COVID-19 patients who require hospitalization, or on its other ongoing trials. It is also testing the drug in nursing homes to see if it can prevent staff and residents from getting infected.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
Lilly began its ACTIV-3 trial in August and is aiming to recruit 10,000 patients primarily in the United States.
The trial compares patients who receive its antibody drug plus  Gilead Sciences Inc  's (O:GILD) antiviral drug remdesivir with those who receive remdesivir alone.
Lilly sought the EUA from U.S. regulators after publishing data in September showing LY-CoV555 helped cut hospitalization and emergency room visits for COVID-19 patients. The treatment is being developed with Canadian biotech AbCellera.
Lilly shares closed nearly 3%.

Investing.com  -- Markets took a breather from the recent four-day rally.
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both dropped about 0.6% while the NASDAQ Composite was little changed, as the hoped-for stimulus relief from Washington failed to materialize. Banks led losses on the benchmark, with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). sinking despite better-than-expected results.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s new iPhones -- fresh look, 5G, tougher 6.1-inch OLED screen and updated dual cameras -- weren't enough to keep it from sinking. 
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) eked out a gain as people flocked to make Prime Day purchases. 
Stimulus is still a mythical creature.
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. Bank earnings
More bank earnings are on tap, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) all due. As with JPMorgan and Citi, the focus will be on how much those banks are setting aside for soured loans and whether trading continues to be a bright spot in a volatile market. It's also worth keeping an eye open for hints of possible further job cuts after Wells cut 700 positions last week.
2. Non-bank earnings include United Airlines and UnitedHealth
United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) reports on the heels of Delta's disappointing quarterly earnings. UAL is expected to report a loss per share of $7.57 on sales of $2.54 billion. For context, a year ago, UAL reported earnings per share of $4.07 on sales of $11.4 billion.
UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) is also up tomorrow. Earnings per share are expected at $3.09 on revenue of $63.8 billion. 
 Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) is due to report a loss per share of $1.17 on sales of $2.23 billion for the quarter.
3. Economic data
On the economic data front, we'll get a look at September's producer price index. The number probably increased, but at a slightly slower pace than the previous month. The choppiness mirrors the economic rebound.

GM sued Fiat Chrysler last year charging the Italian-American automaker with bribing officials of the United Auto Workers union in order to gain advantages in 2009 and 2015 labor contracts that potentially put GM at a multibillion dollar labor cost disadvantage.
A federal judge in Detroit threw out the lawsuit in July and rejected GM's bid to have it reinstated the following month. 

Earlier this year, Fiat Chrysler had asked a U.S. court to toss out GM's lawsuit, calling it baseless.

(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) said on Tuesday it will contribute up to $1 billion more to a potential settlement of lawsuits alleging it and other companies fueled the U.S. opioid epidemic, bringing its total payment to $5 billion.
The New Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey-based drugmaker had agreed last October to a $4 billion settlement framework negotiated with a group of state attorneys general.
That proposal also called for the drug distributors McKesson Corp (N:MCK),  Cardinal Health  (N:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (N:ABC) to pay a combined $18 billion, but the framework met resistance from some states and local governments.
Negotiations have been ongoing since then, and the dollar amounts have been shifting. J&J in a statement said the additional $1 billion reflected continued negotiations and said additional terms are being finalized.
Paul Hanly, a lead attorney for local governments pursuing federal lawsuits against opioid manufacturers and distributors, said in a statement the plaintiffs' lawyers were ""very pleased"" with J&J's agreement to resolve the cases.
""We are hopeful other companies defending the numerous litigations will see the wisdom of this step forward,"" he said.
Representatives for the distributors and several state attorneys general did not respond to requests for comment.
More than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed nationally largely by states, counties and municipalities seeking to hold drug companies responsible for the U.S. opioid addiction epidemic.
The lawsuits generally accuse drugmakers including J&J of deceptively marketing opioids and distributors of ignoring red flags indicating the painkillers were being diverted for improper uses.

The companies including J&J deny wrongdoing. J&J is separately appealing a $465 million judgment the state of Oklahoma won against it in the first case to go to trial in the litigation.

1477,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 02:18PM ET</span>","Used-Car Prices Jump by Most in Half-Century, Boost Price Index","(Bloomberg) -- Used-car prices surged in September by the greatest amount in a half-century, accounting for most of the increase in the government’s latest monthly consumer-price index.
The 6.7% jump in seasonally adjusted prices of used vehicles is the largest since February 1969 and follows gains of 5.4% in August and 2.3% in July.
Demand for used cars and trucks has been climbing ever since the coronavirus outbreak temporarily shuttered U.S. auto plants, constricting supplies of new models. Used-vehicle prices also have been boosted by some automakers’ abandonment of entry-level vehicles and a pandemic-induced shift from public transport and ride-sharing.
Soaring sticker prices for new cars and trucks also may be encouraging recession-hit shoppers to choose pre-owned models. Average transaction prices for new vehicles in the third quarter climbed to $39,303 -- up more than $2,000 from a year ago, according to Edmunds.com.

(Reuters) - The Dow and the S&P 500 fell on Tuesday after a four-day winning streak as a pause in Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 trial triggered concerns about the timing of a vaccine, although a rally in technology shares supported the Nasdaq.
Johnson & Johnson shed 2% as it said it would take ""a few days"" to review its halted clinical trial following an unexplained illness in a study participant, possibly delaying results on one of the most closely watched efforts to contain the global pandemic.
The S&P healthcare index slipped from a record high hit in the prior session and weighed on broader markets as vaccines are seen critical to stopping the pandemic, which has driven the economy to its worst recession in decades.
Some of the worst-hit companies due to the pandemic - cruise line operators Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp, Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings and hotel operator Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) Ltd - fell between 3% and 7%.
The J&J news is ""an excruciating reminder of the difficulties that the coronavirus has brought on the economy,"" said Eric Schiffer, chief executive officer of private equity firm Patriarch Organization.
Adding to the negative tone, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected President Donald Trump's latest offer on COVID-19 stimulus, the latest sign that a bipartisan deal on coronavirus relief remains unlikely ahead of the November election.
Hopes of more U.S. fiscal aid and a rally in tech heavyweights led stocks higher on Monday, bringing the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq within 2% of their record highs hit in September after a pullback last month.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) slipped 1.1% ahead of a virtual event starting 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT) where it is widely expected to unveil four new iPhone models.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares, which have already surged 86% this year, added 1% as the company began 48 hours of promotions as part of ""Prime Day"" in an early start to the holiday shopping season.
Kicking off third-quarter earnings season, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) surpassed analyst estimates for quarterly profit on a surge in trading revenue.
However, Citi's results underscored deeper troubles in its consumer bank that struggled with a decline in customers and spending, sending its shares down 4%. JPMorgan was also down 1.1%, while the S&P 500 bank index shed 2%. 
Overall, analysts expect third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 firms to slide 19.6% from a year earlier, smaller than a 31% tumble in the prior quarter.
At 12:28 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.35% at 28,735.90 and the S&P 500 was down 0.31% at 3,523.23. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.16% at 11,894.92.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co dropped 2% as it lost another three orders for its grounded 737 MAX jet in September and delivered half the number of aircraft from the same month a year earlier.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.33-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.64-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

1479,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>","Sustainable funds offer downside protection, investors say","By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Using environmental, social or governance (ESG) factors to judge securities can offer protection against losses, helping drive the growth of the sector, several large investors said on Tuesday.
A recent study by  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) of 11,000 investment funds found little difference in performance between those with traditional strategies and those with so-called sustainable strategies, said Audrey Choi, the Wall Street bank's chief sustainability officer.
But the latter group faced significantly less volatility. ""I've never really met any investor who says I don't want that investment that has the same return and less downside volatility,"" Choi said, speaking at Reuters' two-day ESG Investment North America conference.
Sustainable funds are on pace this year to roughly double their record inflow of $21.4 billion in 2019, according to researcher  Morningstar  Inc, (O:MORN) a shift driven by superior performance.
Currently about 25% of assets under professional management in the U.S. are run with some regard for sustainability factors, Choi said, up from 10% a decade ago, and globally the share is even higher.
Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Capital Management, an $800 million investment firm in Boston, said the growth of data reporting on topics like carbon emissions or human capital management can help investors avoid problem holdings.
""ESG data is a way to enhance your risk assessment and protect against the downside,"" she said.
Also on the panel was David Burt, founder and CEO of DeltaTerra Capital, a research firm helping clients evaluate climate risk exposure such as on real estate portfolios.
Burt said the valuation of many assets will depend on how climate risks evolve, informed by data and models from sources like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ""The investment industry is really just now beginning to grapple with this problem,"" Burt said.

1480,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 01:54PM ET</span>",Citi’s Corbat Asked to Prove His Bank Isn’t the Next Wells Fargo,"(Bloomberg) -- A public slap from regulators, new limits on dealmaking and a surprise handover of the CEO reins all made for plenty to talk about on  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).’s earnings call.
The recent swirl of news surrounding the bank has investors and analysts feeling anxious. It’s even led to a bit of deja vu, with the worry that Citigroup is in for a round of regulatory oversight similar to what rival  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. has spent years trying to work through, with a Federal Reserve-imposed asset cap that’s caused the company to miss out on at least $4 billion in profits.
The tension came to a head in a contentious conference call Tuesday between the bank’s top executives and analysts, who spent the almost two-hour event calling on outgoing Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat to do everything from moving up his retirement date to giving a firm number for what the bank will need to spend to put regulators’ concerns to rest.
“Why isn’t Citigroup the new Wells Fargo in terms of the regulatory issues?” Erika Najarian, an analyst at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., asked on the call, adding that asset-cap and the business-activity limitations for Wells Fargo came long after its own consent order. “How can you reassure your current investors and your prospective investors that you’re not going down the same laborious regulatory remediation route?”
Wells Fargo, in 2018, was banned from growing until it convinces regulators it has cleaned up its act. The limit came two years after the San Francisco-based bank settled allegations that it opened millions of accounts for customers without their permission. Corbat, for his part, sought to assure investors on Tuesday that his bank isn’t on a similar path.
Not Easy
There was “no widespread customer harm -- the company did not profit from the activities,” Corbat said. Still, he cautioned, “this won’t be a quick or easy fix.”
Citigroup last week said it entered into consent orders with the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which also slapped the bank with a $400 million fine for failing to fix longtime deficiencies in its underlying infrastructure and controls.
The bank on Tuesday affirmed its commitment to spend $1 billion on improving those efforts this year. Still, executives didn’t present a clear picture of what those expenses may look like going forward.
“The remediation work will cost what it will cost,” Corbat said. “These are investments we need to make. In hindsight, we should have done this faster and prevented it from coming to this.”
Citigroup this year has already hired thousands of people to help it navigate the new years-long process of improving risk and controls, an effort it’s starting just as CEO-elect Jane Fraser is set to take the reins in February.
Timing Questioned
The timeline for new management also spurred questions by some analysts Tuesday -- with one asking when Fraser would first appear on an earnings conference call, and another wanting to know when the bank would set new targets for profitability to which executives could be held accountable.
“Speaking on behalf of investors and the people I speak with, there’s a collective sense of extreme disappointment,” Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said on the call. “Why not step aside now and have a new CEO -- Jane Fraser -- take over as a way to demonstrate the increased sense of urgency?”
Corbat said a transition period was needed before Fraser takes over. In the meantime, she’s still leading the firm’s global consumer-banking operations, helping the firm craft its plans for returning workers to North American offices and embarking on the gap analysis required as part of the consent orders.
Plus, Corbat recalled his own experience when he took the reins of Citigroup in 2012, after the board ousted then-CEO Vikram Pandit following a series of setbacks with regulators.
“It’s important to the company that we have a real transition,” Corbat said. “As you recall, my transition was about five minutes.”

While severe COVID-19 symptoms are extremely rare in infected children, they can pass on the virus to high-risk groups such as the elderly. 
That makes determining the effectiveness of a potential vaccine in children crucial, as vaccines work differently in kids and adults, the FDA said in its guidelines https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download in June.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted permission to the drugmaker and German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) to enroll younger participants this month, according to an update on the U.S. company's website https://www.pfizer.com/science/coronavirus/vaccine on Monday. 
Last month, Pfizer scaled up its trial to about 44,000 participants, from up to 30,000, to enroll people as young as 16 and those with chronic, stable HIV, hepatitis C and hepatitis B. 
The company said on Tuesday it would enroll children in its study based on satisfactory safety data in older adolescents and young adults, but did not specify a timeline. 
Pfizer is racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for the new coronavirus with rivals such as  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc and Johnson & Johnson.
Late-stage vaccine trials initiated by Moderna, J&J and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc are testing their respective candidates only in adults.
AstraZeneca's U.K. vaccine trial, targeting more than 12,000 volunteers, will have one out of 11 subgroups with children 5 to 12 years of age. Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said last month that tests on children had not yet started.

1490,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>","No jet orders, more 737 MAX cancellations for Boeing as crises drag on","By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) lost another three orders for its grounded 737 MAX jetliner in September, and delivered 11 total aircraft to customers, less than half the number from the same month a year ago, company data showed on Tuesday.
The closely watched monthly snapshot also shows that quality flaws on the 787 Dreamliner continue to hamper efforts to develop an alternative cash cow to the 737 MAX, grounded after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.
As Boeing works to win regulatory approval, potentially early next month, to fly the 737 MAX again in the United States, the coronavirus pandemic continues to hurt demand for jets from both Boeing and European rival Airbus (PA:AIR).
Boeing said it lost orders for two 737 MAX jets from leasing company BOC Aviation and another jet from an unidentified customer in September. 
For 2020 through September, the number of MAX orders canceled, or removed from Boeing's official backlog when it applies stricter accounting standards, stood at 1,006 aircraft. 
Canceled MAX orders, including those where buyers converted one type of jet to a different model, was 436 jets - and 448 for all jets across Boeing's portfolio, Boeing said. 
On the delivery side, Boeing handed to airline customers 10 twin-aisle jets in September, down from 25 a year earlier and 12 in August. 
That brings total deliveries to 98 for the first nine months of 2020, down from 301 aircraft for the same period a year ago. 
Deliveries are a closely watched metric for investors since airlines hand over the bulk of the money for an order when they pick up their planes at Boeing.
The September delivery tally included one P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, and three freighters: one 747 to  United Parcel  Service (N:UPS), one 767 to FedEx Corp (N:FDX) and one 777 to Lufthansa Cargo, Boeing said. 
It also included seven 787 Dreamliner jets: one for leasing company AerCap Holdings (N:AER), three for United Airlines (O:UAL), two for Turkish Airlines and one 787-10 to Taiwan's EVA Air, the planemaker said.
Boeing will face largest inventory of built new aircraft in its 104-year history, as ""the number of cancellations is increasing literally by every week,""  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL) Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Házy said on an Aviation Week podcast on Tuesday.

""Boeing has to make some tough decisions by the end of the year on how to deal with this,"" Udvar-Házy said.

1491,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>",Bankruptcies pile up in North America energy sector in third quarter: Haynes and Boone,"(Reuters) - Bankruptcies in the North American energy industry surged in the third quarter as companies struggled with weak fuel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lower crude prices and a dearth of available credit, according to law firm Haynes and Boone.
In the three months to September, 17 oil producers sought bankruptcy protection, fueling a 21% jump in such filings in the first nine months of 2020 from a year earlier, the report said on Tuesday.
As producers halted or scaled back exploration and drilling to rein in expenses, oilfield service providers have been hit even harder.
There were 26 new bankruptcy filings from service companies in the third quarter, compared with 11 in the year-ago period, the report notes.
The pain is set to worsen as lenders undertake the bi-annual redetermination of how much credit should be available to producers.
Available credit is expected to drop 15.7% after the fall redetermination season, a Haynes and Boone survey shows. Tens of billions of dollars in borrowing power was wiped out during the spring redeterminations.
The midstream sector has been relatively shielded from the recent rout, but with the market turmoil dragging on and producers trying to avoid onerous contracts, a number of them may approach bankruptcy courts during the rest of the year, said Haynes and Boone.
Through Sept. 30, just 32 midstream companies had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States since 2015, with only one of those in the third quarter.

1503,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>",King & Spalding M&A head Woolery departs: sources,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Jim Woolery, the head of M&A and corporate governance at King & Spalding LLP, has left the law firm and is exploring launching his own advisory practice, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Woolery, a former co-head of North American mergers and acquisitions (M&A) at JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and a former partner at law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, is considering launching a ""boutique"" firm with a focus on advising major sources of capital, such as billionaires, sovereign wealth funds and special-purpose acquisition vehicles, the sources said.
King & Spalding did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
While boutique firms are common in investment banking, few corporate lawyers have branched out on their own. Were Woolery to launch his own firm, he would no longer be restricted in his ability to work on clients by other assignments that King & Spalding has in its big practice, which ranges from litigation and regulation to M&A and shareholder activism.
Woolery's advisory work includes  Clorox Co 's (N:CLX) successful defense against Carl Icahn in 2011, the acquisition of Dell Technologies Inc (N:DELL) by Michael Dell and buyout firm Silver Lake in 2013, the $21.5 billion sale of payments company Total System Services (NYSE:TSS) to  Global Payments  Inc (N:GPN) in 2019, and a range of transactions for printer maker Xerox Holdings Corp (N:XRX), including the resolution of a dispute with Japan's Fujifilm over their joint venture and aborted merger.

1504,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>",JPMorgan executives offer slightly brighter view on pandemic recession,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and David Henry
(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) executives are cautiously optimistic that the coronavirus pandemic will not send the economy into the worst possible tailspin, and feel confident enough in the bank’s financial position to start repurchasing shares again soon if regulators allow.
Their comments came on Tuesday after JPMorgan reported much stronger-than-expected results for the third quarter, beating profit estimates and setting aside relatively little money for loan losses.
Only one of its four major units – consumer banking – saw revenue and profits decline, and even those customers are holding up relatively well, Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said. Other businesses, including trading, investment banking, commercial lending and wealth management, posted gains.
Although JPMorgan expects loan losses to escalate, and added another $611 million to its loan loss reserves, that figure is tiny compared to the previous quarter and smaller than what many analysts had expected. 
JPMorgan has the financial wherewithal to handle those losses and start buying back shares again if regulators will allow it, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said. The Federal Reserve has ordered big banks to halt buyback programs and limit dividends through year-end.
“We'll be patient, but we have tremendous amount of wherewithal to do both when the time comes,” he said. “And I hope we're allowed to do it before the stock is much higher.”
JPMorgan shares fell 1.8% to $100.57 in morning trading. The stock is down 27.4% year-to-date.
As the largest U.S. bank and one of the biggest global lenders, JPMorgan’s results are viewed as a barometer of the economy and financial markets. 
Its profit rose 4% to $9.4 billion, or $2.92 per share, in the third quarter, compared with $9.1 billion, or $2.68 per share, in the year-ago period.
Analysts had expected its profit to fall, with a consensus estimate of $2.23 per share, according to Refinitiv.
JPMorgan’s revenue fell slightly to $29.9 billion, but still came in ahead of expectations.
Trading was a bright spot for the third consecutive quarter, as market volatility caused volumes to swell. Revenue there jumped 30% to $6.6 billion.
Analysts cheered the results. Evercore ISI's Glenn Schorr called JPMorgan ""the Rickey Henderson of banks,"" a reference to a celebrated Major League Baseball star.
""JPMorgan put up as strong of a quarter as we could have hoped for,"" he wrote in a note to clients.
Executives were careful not to offer too sunny an outlook, especially because Congress has failed to pass another stimulus bill. Lockdowns intended to prevent the virus from spreading have put millions out of work and shuttered thousands of businesses, causing the worst recession in decades.
JPMorgan looks at a range of possible economic outcomes when setting aside reserves, executives said. While its ""base"" case has improved from the second quarter, it could very well deteriorate again.
""There's so much uncertainty,” said Dimon. “If better outcomes happen, we are over-reserved by $10 billion. If the double-dip happens, we would be under-reserved by $20 billion.""
So far this year, JPMorgan has added $19.4 billion to its credit loss provisions, more than four times the comparable figure for 2019.
Low interest rates hurt JPMorgan’s results in a predictable way, as the U.S. Federal Reserve is keeping rates at nearly zero to offset the impact of the pandemic. 
JPMorgan’s net interest income fell 9% to $13.1 billion in the third quarter and its net interest margin dropped to 1.82%. Those metrics are closely watched by investors to show how much central-bank rate policies are affecting income, and how well banks are managing their balance sheets.
JPMorgan maintained its forecast for full-year interest income at about $55 billion, but said adjusted annual expenses will be about $66 billion, worse than its prior forecast of $65 billion.
JPMorgan’s results came in contrast to  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), which also reported earnings on Tuesday. Citigroup beat analyst estimates but executives offered a less optimistic economic outlook, especially for its consumer business.

 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS),  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) are scheduled to report results on Wednesday, with  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) on Thursday.

1505,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 11:35AM ET</span>","Unilever, JP Morgan entered into $500 million corporate swap linked to new SOFR benchmark","By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) -  Unilever  (L:ULVR) and J.P. Morgan (N:JPM) entered into a $500 million interest rate swap agreement at the end of September using the new SOFR benchmark interest rate, in one of the first major long-dated corporate SOFR swap transactions, according to the U.S. bank.
The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is published by the New York Federal Reserve. Regulators want it used to back dollar-based derivatives and loans to replace the Libor benchmark rate.
The London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) is being scrapped after banks were fined billions of dollars for trying to rig the benchmark, which is used for contracts from home loans to derivatives and credit cards worth trillions of dollars globally.
Regulators are putting pressure on market participants to change references from Libor to alternative rates such as those compiled by central banks by the end of 2021.
While SOFR has been used by banks and financial institutions, it has so far yet to be adopted more broadly by corporates in the use of their funding needs. 
But at the end of September Unilever entered into a $500 million 10-year SOFR interest rate swap with J.P. Morgan, swapping from fixed to floating to hedge the September 2030 bond, according to a press release seen by Reuters ahead of publication.
According to the U.S. investment bank, this is one of the first major long-dated, non-financial new issuance SOFR swaps globally and is a sign that companies are becoming more comfortable in using new benchmark interest rates.
""For the first time we are seeing a corporate enter into a significant size of a long-dated SOFR-linked swap as opposed to using Libor as a reference rate,"" said Johannes Banner (NASDAQ:BANR), head of corporate FX and rates sales for Europe at J.P. Morgan in London. 
""So the real economy is starting to use SOFR in a considerable size and that is the start of a very significant trend.""

He added that some European corporates with exposure to euro interest rates could soon start using the European Central Bank compiled ESTR short-term rate in swap transactions to replace the Eonia rate that is being discontinued at the end of next year.

1506,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 11:27AM ET</span>","Luxury Home Sales Surge, Highlighting U.S. Housing Wealth Gap","(Bloomberg) -- Demand for luxury homes is soaring, underscoring how the pandemic has intensified wealth disparities in the U.S.
High-end sales jumped 42% in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to a report from brokerage  Redfin  (NASDAQ:RDFN). That’s the largest jump dating back to 2013. Sales of mid-priced homes climbed just 3%, while affordable purchases declined 4%.
While banks tighten credit for first-time buyers, the pandemic is hammering Americans who don’t have the privilege of working remotely. The wealthy, meanwhile, are benefiting from the surging stock market and mortgage rates near record lows.
The cheaper borrowing costs are driving demand for larger properties with more room to quarantine. And with many corporate workers no longer tethered to office buildings, there’s a shift away from expensive markets like San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles.
“The luxury housing market normally takes a hit during recessions as wealthy Americans tighten their purse strings, but this isn’t a normal recession,” Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, said in a statement.
Even with low mortgage rates, first-time buyers could struggle to get approved for loans or find homes they can afford in a market where inventory is scare. And while housing has been a bright spot in the pandemic economy, the migration to the suburbs has been driven by wealthier Americans.
Redfin defines luxury as the most expensive 5% of homes in a given market. High-end sales in Sacramento, 90 miles (145 kilometers) northwest of San Francisco, jumped 86%, more than any other major metro area, as Silicon Valley tech workers moved farther out.
Luxury sales climbed 63% in California’s Inland Empire, east of Los Angeles, and 61% in Oakland, a more-affordable city across the bay from San Francisco. They also increased 61% in Portland, Oregon, and 60% in West Palm Beach, Florida. In New York, expensive sales dropped 2% in Nassau County as inventory tightened.
The demand for high-end homes is driving up prices, which gained 6.5% from a year earlier, while values for the most affordable properties climbed 2.9%, Redfin said.
“Luxury listings are skyrocketing because high-end homeowners have the financial means and the flexibility to move during this pandemic,” Fairweather said. “The growing supply of luxury homes for sale means that wealthy buyers have more options to choose from and a better chance of finding a home that checks all of their boxes.”

The bank, which will have Wall Street's first woman CEO, Jane Fraser, at its helm early next year after long-time Chief Executive Michael Corbat retires, faces a series of challenges as a coronavirus-induced recession grips American households.
Citi's shares fell over 4% in early trade as management on a conference call indicated that the third-largest U.S. lender was bracing for prolonged pain, a view that contrasted with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Inc's more upbeat views on loan losses.
""We are expecting a somewhat more muted and slower recovery in both unemployment and GDP through 2022,"" said Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason. 
""In the crisis we are managing through, we're not seeing acquisitions or new account openings.""
With the recession crushing consumer and business confidence, and with it demand for loans, Citi reported its first outright fall in revenue this year, down 7% to $17.3 billion in the third quarter. 
Profit tumbled by more than a third as its credit card customers closed accounts and spent less. 
Revenue in North American branded cards, the growth engine for Citi's consumer bank going into the year, fell 12%. 
The bank, one of the largest credit card issuers globally, said end of period open accounts across its portfolio dropped by 4%, or more than 5 million, and purchase sales slid 10%.
BRIGHT SPOTS 
There were, however, some bright spots.
Citi's trading business turned in another strong quarter, with revenue from bond and stock market trading jumping 18% and 15%, respectively. 
Credit costs were helped in part by lower loan volumes, particularly in the consumer bank where customers have been paying down debt and account openings slowed. 
The bank added about $314 million to credit loss reserves in the quarter, compared to the $15 billion it had set aside in the first half of the year.
Even allowing for the impact of a $400 million fine related to its mistaken transfer of $1 billion to lenders of Revlon Inc, Citi's total net income for common shareholders came in at $1.40 per share. 
Without the penalty, core operating earnings per share would have been $1.55, which beat analysts' expectation of 93 cents.

1508,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>",Amazon’s Prime Day Steals Rivals’ Black Friday Spotlight,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).’s two-day Prime Day sale kicks off on Tuesday and is expected to give the world’s largest e-commerce company an early advantage over brick-and-mortar rivals still contending with pandemic-spooked consumers wary of battling Black Friday crowds.
With Prime Day delayed to October from July this year, Amazon single-handedly could yank the pivotal holiday season forward -- a long-predicted “Christmas creep.” More than three in four consumers plan to shop earlier this year than a year ago, with a third citing health and safety concerns, according to an International Council of Shopping Centers survey released Friday. Meanwhile a Harris Poll conducted with Bloomberg found that almost half of consumers plan to do most or all of their shopping on the web.
It’s a winning combination for Amazon, which earlier this year hired more than 175,000 people for its sprawling network of fulfillment centers after a spike in online orders briefly overwhelmed the company, forcing it to delay some deliveries. Amazon reported record profits last quarter, and investors have pushed the shares up some 85% this year, giving the company a market value of about $1.7 trillion. The shares rose about 1% Tuesday morning in New York.“Holiday spending will keep shifting from brick-and-mortar stores to online, and Amazon is very well aligned with those trends,” said Andrew Lipsman, an analyst at eMarketer Inc. who expects online spending of almost $10 billion over the two-day period, with more than $6 billion spent on Amazon.
Amazon didn’t tinker much with Prime Day, despite the delay. Deals in the first several hours were mostly discounts of 50% off or less on household goods, electronics and clothes priced at no more than $50, with the bigger deals expected later in the day, said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of Marketplace Pulse, a New York research firm that monitors the site. Live video streams highlighting deals were pushed lower on the page, a change from last year when they got top billing.
“I’m sure Amazon will reach record sales again,” Kaziukenas said, “but not because they did something unique this year.”
Amazon’s delivery machine, conceived for convenience, now offers the added benefit of safety compared with in-store shopping. Consumers initially turned to the company to stock up on toilet paper and hand sanitizer in April. Then they needed electronics to help families work and attend school from home. Summer became a season of patio furniture and swimming pools ordered online for staycations.
Now come the holidays, Amazon’s busiest time of year, with Covid-19 cases spiking yet again. That means Amazon could continue to generate double-digit sales growth despite a weak job market and congressional gridlock over further stimulus packages such as $600 weekly unemployment assistance that expired this summer.
Prime members who didn’t lose their jobs could actually have a little extra to spend and feel the urge to splurge since most households have cut back on travel, eating out and other expenses, said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation.
“People might just have more confidence of buying a little more and thinking, ‘Oh, I owe it to myself in a tough time,’” he said.
Amazon competitors who still get most revenue in stores have to balance drumming up business with protecting public health. Eight in 10 shoppers say they’re concerned packed stores could spread Covid-19, meaning retailers that aren’t offering deals online could lose out.
The industry for weeks has been trying to coax consumers to spend earlier. Executives from  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) Inc. and Kohl’s Corp. said they expect earlier demand. Retail veteran Deborah Weinswig got two dozen retailers to start a new shopping holiday, “10.10,” to address capacity issues and encourage shoppers to buy earlier.  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. rolled out their promotional days this week as well.
The latter last month started its own delivery service, Walmart+, and Target is shipping packages from its stores. But Amazon has 118 million U.S. Prime members, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, subscribers the company keeps loyal with delivery discounts and other perks. Amazon launched Prime Day in 2015 as a day of deals to attract new subscribers and hang on to existing ones. Prime members spend more on the site than non-members.For years, retailers have tried to get shoppers to spread out their purchases over the holiday by offering deals early and often. The phenomenon was dubbed “Christmas creep,” and it never entirely materialized because many shoppers procrastinate, waiting for Black Friday and Thanksgiving deals before getting serious about buying gifts. The pandemic has finally made “Christmas creep” a reality, analysts say, because shoppers are worried about items running out and getting online orders in time.
“Amazon Prime Day is going to kick off the holiday season and holiday shopping for many consumers,” said Chip Bergh, the chief executive officer of Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) & Co. “We know the capacity constraints with shipping because of the surge in e-commerce, so consumers are going to be urged to buy early.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. auto safety regulators said Tuesday they are investigating reports of fires in three General Motors (N:GM) electric Chevrolet Bolt cars.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was opening a preliminary evaluation after reviewing reports of three Bolt EVs catching fire under the rear seat while parked and unattended.
NHTSA said ""in the three cases identified, fire damage appeared to be concentrated in the EV battery compartment area with penetration into the passenger compartment from under the rear seat.""
The probe covers 77,842 Bolt EVs from the 2017 through 2020 model years.
GM said in an emailed statement it is ""cooperating with NHTSA in their investigation and we are conducting our own investigation into these complaints as well.""
NHTSA said the root cause of the fires is unknown.
Smoke inhalation injuries were reported in a March 2019 incident in Belmont, Massachusetts. A Bolt caught fire in the driveway and the owner said strong fumes permeated the home during a three-hour fire requiring professional cleaning. The owners also reported they suffered headaches from contact with the smoke.

BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - The European Union won the right to impose tariffs on $4 billion of U.S. goods on Tuesday in retaliation against subsidies granted to planemaker Boeing (N:BA), expanding a dispute that has already seen Washington put border duties on EU imports.
The World Trade Organization tariff award, which confirms a decision first reported by Reuters on Sept 30, threatens to exacerbate transatlantic trade tensions with just three weeks until the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3.
However, negotiators on both sides say it could also lead at last to discussions to resolve a 16-year legal battle.
Both the United States and the EU have signalled interest in settling the dispute over subsidies each provided to their respective planemakers, Boeing and Airbus (PA:AIR), while accusing the other of refusing to talk seriously.
Tuesday's decision, delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, follows a WTO ruling last year allowing Washington to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion in EU goods over state support for Airbus, which has sites in Britain, France, Germany and Spain.
Combined, the two cases represent the world's largest ever corporate trade dispute.
The state of Washington has since moved to repeal tax breaks that benefited Boeing, while Airbus has announced it will increase loan repayments for the A350 plane to France and Spain in bids to settle the matter.
Sources on both sides say they want their industrial rivals to go further before agreeing to bury their differences.
The European Commission has said it would prefer a negotiated solution, but would impose tariffs without one. 
It has already drawn up a list of U.S. products it could target including planes, wine, spirits, suitcases, tractors, frozen fish, and produce from dried onions to cherries.

The earliest it could act is after a WTO meeting on Oct 26, but few analysts expect it to do so before the U.S. election.

1514,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Timing of EU Tariff Strike on U.S. May Hinge on Election Winner,"(Bloomberg) --
The European Union will formally get the green light on Tuesday to impose tariffs on about $4 billion of U.S. exports, but will likely withhold fire until after the U.S. presidential election in three weeks, according to three officials familiar with the bloc’s thinking.
The size of the World Trade Organization decision over illegal state aid the U.S. provided to Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. was reported by Bloomberg last month. The award is lower than the $7.5 billion judgment granted to the U.S. last year in a parallel dispute against Boeing’s European rival, Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY).
The EU has drawn up a list of American products to hit with levies. And even though it’s targeting politically important industries for President Donald Trump and his Republican allies -- including aircraft, coal, agricultural products and seafood -- the bloc will likely hold off until after the Nov. 3 election in the U.S. to see if a deal is possible, said the officials, who asked not to be identified because negotiations over the dispute are private.
By waiting, the 27-nation bloc can try to reboot flagging settlement talks with Trump while waiting to see if discussions might fare better in the event former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic challenger who’s leading several national polls, wins the election.
The EU’s trade chief, Valdis Dombrovskis, has already indicated the difficulty in negotiating with the current White House.
“Probably under a new administration it would be easier because we know that the Trump administration is unfortunately supporting this unilateral action in areas of trade which is creating lots of tensions and lots of problems,” Dombrovskis told members of the European Parliament earlier this month.
Over the past three years the U.S. has imposed tariffs on European exports of steel and aluminum and threatened duties on billions of dollars of European goods if France and other European nations follow through with their plans to collect taxes on digital companies like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google.
Tony Blinken, a foreign policy adviser for Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign, said the Democratic contender wants to end Trump’s “artificial trade war” with Europe.
‘Fair Approach’
“Instead of hurting our own citizens and fighting with our democratic allies, we ought to be working on a fair approach to international trade and investment,” Blinken said during a webinar hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
While officials in the Trump administration and the EU both argue that now is the moment to engage in negotiations to settle the WTO aircraft dispute -- which has been going on for 16 years -- neither side appears any closer to a reaching a solution.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has rejected all the EU’s settlement proposals, said he’s seeking two things: A pledge from Europe to end its subsidies to Airbus and monetary compensation. “It is going to require commitments not to do it again but also paying back some element of the subsidy,” Lighthizer said in a Chatham House event in July.
But European industry officials argue that the U.S. demands are too heavy-handed and the pandemic has complicated the prospects for a deal.
Both the U.S. and EU are mulling ways to support their airline industries through a period in which global travel restrictions have hammered passenger air travel.
European officials say that, ultimately, a comprehensive deal on aircraft subsidies is in both America and Europe’s best interests if they want to curb China’s massive subsidization of its domestic aerospace industry.
A transatlantic aircraft accord could help accelerate the process of restraining “other competitors which may emerge in this area of civil aviation,” Dombrovskis told Bloomberg TV.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday, as problems with another Covid-19 drug trial dented sentiment toward cyclicals, while the first bank earnings of the quarter both pointed to a slowdown in consumer spending.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 57 points, or 0.2%, at 28,781 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1%, with megacaps Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) supporting as the two giants prepare for their biggest marketing events of the year later. 
Apple stock fell 1.8% after its biggest one-day gain in months on Monday, while Amazon stock was down 0.3%, after rising over 10% in the last week. 
Earlier, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) had reported much better-than-expected results for the third quarter, as its provisions against credit losses fell to only $611 million from $8.9 billion three months earlier, a suggestion that the worst has already been priced in, as regards the fate of the bank's loan book. JPMorgan stock still fell 0.5%, as investors zeroed in on falling revenue, especially at its consumer division, where revenue fell 9%. Similar concerns also hit  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock, which fell 1.2% after the bank reported a 34% drop in profit for the quarter.
By contrast, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) stock rose 3.7% to a new all-time high after the asset manager's results comfortably surpassed expectations.
There was little reaction earlier to figures showing U.S. consumer inflation still running below 2.0%, both in headline and in underlying terms. 
Sentiment had been hurt overnight by the news that Johnson & Johnson had paused its stage 3 trial of its experimental drug for treating Covid-19, due to an unexplained illness in one of the study participants. It's the second of the more promising experimental drugs to experence such a setback, after the AstraZeneca-Oxford University drug trial was halted over a month ago. While AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN)'s trial has resumed in many countries, it's still on hold in the U.S.
The trial news overshadowed an otherwise positive quarterly update from J&J, where sales rose 2% on the back of an improved performance from its medical devices unit. J&J stock fell 1.3%.
Elsewhere,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock - which has been one of the worst performers in the DJI over the last quarter - outperformed slightly, losing only 0.1% after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts upgraded it to 'neutral' from 'underweight'. 
Crude Oil futures prices were even more buoyant, rising 2.0% in the U.S. after the International Energy Agency predicted a strong rebound in world energy demand next year, even though it pulled forward the date when it expects world oil demand to peak.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said on Tuesday it does not expect to plug a daily cash bleed due to the COVID-19 pandemic until next spring, although it has at its disposal $1.3 billion in leftover federal aid for employees' payroll.
The airline previously said it could halt a cash bleed that averaged $18 million per day in September before the end of the year, but pushed back the target as third-quarter revenue fell 76% to $3.1 billion from a year earlier.
Atlanta-based Delta, the first U.S. airline to report third-quarter results, said it expects its cash burn to narrow to $10 million to $12 million per day in December. It was burning $27 million in cash per day in June.
The company swung to a $5.4 billion net loss, or $8.47 per share, in the quarter from a $1.5 billion profit a year ago. On an adjusted basis the loss was $3.30 per share. 
Shares were down 3.7% at $31.46 in premarket trade. 
The airline took a $3.1 billion charge for voluntary separation and early retirement programs as Delta slimmed its workforce as demand plunged, and a $2.2 billion fleet restructuring charge.
However, a 32% decline in labor costs in the quarter led to $1.3 billion in unspent federal funds awarded by Congress in March to cover airlines' payroll costs for six months and protect jobs.
""We've stretched those dollars out,"" Delta's chief executive, Ed Bastian, told Reuters, saying the company can use the money in the fourth quarter, on top of any additional aid if lawmakers finally approve another $25 billion payroll support program for U.S. airlines. 
An industry push for more aid has broad bipartisan backing but is stalled amid a Washington deadlock over wider COVID-19 economic relief.
Unlike its two major rivals, Delta has avoided the furlough of flight attendants and other frontline employees after reducing work hours, but it could still furlough some 1,700 pilots on Nov. 1 without a union agreement or more federal aid, Bastian said.
Delta's flight capacity was down 63% in the third quarter and its average load factor was just 41% versus 88% a year ago, though the average yield per passenger declined only 2%.
To woo pandemic-wary passengers, the airline is blocking off middle seats through the end of the year. The policy beyond that will depend on COVID-19 testing developments, traveler surveys and continued studies on the risk of COVID-19 transmission on airplanes. Studies so far have shown the risk is ""remarkably low,"" Bastian said.
Delta has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on efforts to restore passenger confidence, and while more people are beginning to travel, quarantines and uneven public health measures remain a deterrent, Bastian said.
He estimates business travel will recover in 12 to 24 months, though not to 100%. Delta is currently operating about 15% of its normal business travel, he said.
With no immediate need for new jets, the company has reduced purchase commitments for Airbus and Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) aircraft by more than $2 billion this year and by more than $5 billion through 2022.

Delta ended the quarter with $21.6 billion in liquidity, after a $9 billion capital raising in September secured by its loyalty program. Adjusted net debt totaled $17 billion.

(Reuters) - A record number of U.S. companies are either banning political spending or making sure they disclose it, as they seek to steer clear of controversy ahead of the Nov. 3 election, a new study has found. 
While many U.S. companies donate to political candidates and campaigns, some do not disclose it. This can put them in the crosshairs of customers and suppliers who can accuse them of a lack of transparency. 
President Donald Trump has also criticized some companies, including tire manufacturer  Goodyear Tire  & Rubber Co (O:GT) and drugmaker  Merck & Co  Inc (N:MRK) for taking political stands.
The Center for Political Accountability, a non-profit that advocates for corporate transparency, found that 332 companies in the S&P 500 prohibited some kind of political spending, like funding political committees, or disclosed some or all of their election-related spending in 2020, up roughly 9% from 2016.
The Center also found that 162 companies implemented board oversight for political spending, up 46% since 2016. Without board oversight, companies' lobbyists and local managers are left to handle the spending on their own.
""Companies have realized the increased risk in political spending as the political environment has become more hyperpolarized and toxic,"" said Bruce Freed, the co-founder of the Center for Political Accountability. 
The study did not look at corporate lobbying on legislative bills.
Healthcare real estate investment trust Welltower Inc (N:WELL) was one of the companies that changed its practices this year. It adopted a policy prohibiting donations to political incumbents, candidates or parties, unless approved by the CEO and general counsel, and instructed its trade associations that its contributions should not be used to support candidates or parties.

With shares in the company falling on investor worries about the fate of the vaccine, finance chief Joseph Wolk said it was unclear how long the suspension in the trials, due to an unexplained illness of one participant, would last. 
""It could be as small as a few days but it's hard to predict until they get the information they need,"" he told CNBC. 
The company will let an independent data and safety board go through its protocols as it reviewed the illness, he said. 
Johnson & Johnson is the first major U.S. drugmaker and medical device manufacturer to report third-quarter results and its earnings could set the tone for upcoming rival's earnings.
In the third quarter, sales rose to $21.08 billion from $20.73 billion, helped by strength in the company's largest unit, pharmaceuticals. 
Sales of cancer drug Darzalex rose 43.7% to $1.10 billion.
Sales of Imbruvica, which J&J jointly owns with  AbbVie Inc  (N:ABBV), as well as Crohn's disease drug Stelara, grew in the double-digits, bringing in $1.03 billion and $1.95 billion respectively. 
Its medical device unit's sales fell 3.6% to $6.15 billion, as patients and hospitals continued to delay non-urgent surgeries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The company now expects full-year 2020 adjusted profit of $7.95 to $8.05 per share, from its prior range of $7.75 to $7.95 per share.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned $2.20 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $1.98 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

J&J's shares fell 1.7% to $149.25 before the bell.

1524,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 08:18AM ET</span>",BofA Survey Shows Investors Braced for Contested U.S. Election,"(Bloomberg) -- Fund managers overseeing $593 billion were bracing for extreme market turbulence as they expect the result of the November U.S. election to be contested even as the Democratic nominee Joe Biden holds a comfortable lead over President Donald Trump.
Among investors surveyed in the week through Oct. 8 by Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., 61% believe the U.S. vote’s outcome will be challenged, causing maximum volatility in the final months of the year. The monthly survey took place at a time when, according to RealClearPolitics, Biden held a lead of an average of 9 percentage points nationally over Trump.
BofA’s poll signals that investors remain on edge ahead of the Nov. 3 election and fear a delayed outcome as the Trump campaign continues to raise questions about the legitimacy of mail-in ballots. That stands in contrast to Wall Street strategists, who have been saying that there’s now less chance of a contested election.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). economists have said that a combination of early results, voter turnout, county-level data and the high correlation of polling errors across states suggests investors will have enough information on election night to determine the likely victor.
‘Blue Wave’
Ronald Temple, head of U.S. equities at Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Asset Management, said that even as some investors don’t favor a “blue wave” of Democratic wins because of the risk of tax increases, the market is better off knowing the election result straight away.
“The worst outcome is a contested election because companies and investors really hate uncertainty,” Temple said by phone. “Part of the reason you’ve seen markets working their way back higher in the last couple of weeks is that the probability of a contested election has gone down.”
The S&P 500 has risen nearly 10% over the past three weeks as investors await more U.S. fiscal stimulus and Biden advances in polls. Strategists, including those at UBS Global Wealth Management, have said that a string of Democratic wins in the November election would mean more fiscal spending as the party prioritizes the economic rebound.
At the same time, despite the continuing battle over U.S. fiscal stimulus, recession fears among fund managers have receded, according to BofA. Investors continue to expect a bumpy or a slow recovery, with just 19% betting on a quick V-shaped economic rebound.
Money managers continue to reduce their cash levels, which fell to 4.4% in the latest survey period, while boosting their equity exposure, with a net 27% of survey participants saying they are overweight stocks. According to BofA, this level shows they are optimistic on equities, but not “dangerously.”
Fund managers paused the rotation into cyclicals, selling energy and banking stocks along with bonds while buying healthcare, staples and Japanese shares, the survey showed. Among the polled investors, 50% said technology shares will remain market leaders next year, while 43% disagreed.
BofA strategists led by Michael Hartnett said they expect the cyclical equity rotation into banks and energy to resume in the fourth quarter. They also recommended selling the S&P 500 above 3,600 index points, which is about 1.9% above Monday’s close.

Hyundai Motor plans to hold a board meeting possibly on Wednesday to promote Chung to chairman of South Korea's second-largest conglomerate, Yonhap reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed corporate sources. 
Hyundai declined to comment.
Chung, born in 1970, has led Hyundai Motor Group's recent push in electric vehicles (EVs), mobility and hydrogen cars. In July, he announced that Hyundai and sister company Kia Motors (KS:000270) aimed to sell 1 million electric vehicles (EVs) in 2025, jointly targeting a more than 10% share of the global market for EVs.
Chung's father and group patriarch Mong-Koo Chung gave up his board seat in Hyundai Motor earlier this year after stepping back from frontline operations in recent years, and Euisun Chung has played an increasingly visible leadership role since 2018.

Hyundai and Kia are together the world's fifth-largest carmaker, although they will fall to sixth place when  Fiat  Chrysler (FCA) (MI:FCHA) and PSA (PA:PEUP) complete their merger next year under the name of Stellantis.

Doubts over whether President Donald Trump would agree to hand over the White House if he loses have grown in recent weeks. Polls show him losing more ground to Democrat Joe Biden as the contenders push toward the Nov. 3 election.
The 224 fund managers with $632 billion assets under management surveyed by BofA last week saw the U.S. vote as the second biggest ""tail risk"" for markets. COVID-19 remained the top worry, the U.S. investment bank said in a note on Tuesday.
Despite pushing back expectations for a vaccine by a month to February, investors downplayed recession fears, with 60% saying the global economy was in an early-cycle phase.

Technology stocks, the backbone of this year's blistering share rally, featured as the ""most crowded"" trade for the sixth straight month of the survey. Still, 50% of the survey participants said the sector was likely to continue leading equities in 2021, while 43% said that was unlikely.

1528,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>",Israel sees commercial aviation deal with UAE within days,"By Dan Williams (NYSE:WMB)
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel and the United Arab Emirates will sign a commercial aviation deal imminently, an Israeli official said on Tuesday, as the countries cemented newly normalised relations ahead of reciprocal delegation visits expected next week.
Direct air traffic between Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi or Dubai would be a tourism and business boon for Israel and the Gulf power, while also easing Israelis' travel to Asia.
Saudi Arabia has agreed to expedite such flights by letting them pass over its territory. But Riyadh has indicated it is not ready to establish formal ties with Israel, as the UAE and Bahrain did at a Sept. 15 ceremony in Washington. 
Ofer Malka, director-general of Israel's Transportation Ministry, said in an interview the UAE aviation deal is ""more or less ready, and we will sign it in the coming days"".
Israel has also agreed to UAE commercial flights over its soil to westward destinations and back, Malka told Army Radio. 
An Israeli delegation accompanied by senior U.S. officials is due to fly out to Manama and Abu Dhabi on Oct. 18-19, returning to Tel Aviv on Oct. 20 with UAE delegates aboard making a first official visit to Israel, a source told Reuters. [nL8N2H31VK]
El Al Israel Airlines would likely be used for the initial legs of the trip and Etihad Airways for the last, marking the first direct flight to Israel by a UAE airliner, said the source, who requested anonymity as the planning was not final. 
Israeli and UAE officials have yet to confirm those trips. 
Malka said security at UAE airports was being worked on to enable Israelis to travel through them. He did not elaborate. 

Israel generally requires that its carriers be provided with extra security abroad. In some instances, measures have included separate terminals and Israeli guards at foreign airports.

1530,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>",'Blue wave' U.S. election expectations trigger green stocks frenzy,"By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - Growing expectations of a strong Democratic victory in U.S. elections have prompted investors to snap up renewable energy stocks, amplifying a recent rush seen after the European Union's fiscal splurge earmarked for green investments.
Investors are acting on expectations of trillions in fiscal spending over the next few years, triggering a ""green wave"" of investment that is drawing comparisons to the blistering rally in technology stocks.
While President Donald Trump is taking the United States out of the Paris climate accord aimed at combating climate change, Democrat Joe Biden, who hopes to beat him in November's election, has promised to set a U.S. goal for net-zero emissions by 2050.
BofA Global Research said last week in its weekly flows report that the surge in solar exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reflected investors' expectations for a ""blue wave"" on the Nov. 3 election. Blue is the color associated with the Democratic Party, versus Republican red.
The Invesco solar ETF has risen almost 150% year-to-date, nearly double the rise of the index that tracks the FAANG+ basket of technology giants that have led this year's stock market bounceback. 
Solar ETF outperforms tech giants: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprxojope/Pasted%20image%201602509485190.png
The eye-popping moves reflect bets that these securities will do well under a Biden presidency, given the candidate's green proposals.
However investors say they are also reflective of a long-term shift towards more environmentally friendly investing, driven by expectations that the economic recovery will be tech-driven and green-focused.
""I have never seen the writing on the wall so clear: the recovery is going to be green and digital,"" said Geraldine Sundstrom, fund manager at PIMCO. 
Sundstrom said she was not positioning specifically for the U.S. election but would use any knee-jerk reaction as a buying opportunity to add to her strategy of green investing. 
""It's totally abnormal in the sense that, never in my career have I encountered something that is embraced globally with hundreds of billions - I think by now we are able to say trillions - of money being directed into one direction."" 
U.S. election polling average: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmjmnxpr/Pasted%20image%201602510501935.png
Last week, solar and wind generator company Nextera exceeded the market value of oil giants  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), who have topped the charts of most-valuable energy companies for several decades. 
NextEra overtakes oil behemoths in market cap: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvljmgqvb/Pasted%20image%201602510852888.png
""The worst-case scenario for renewables over the next six months - especially from a valuations perspective would be a Trump win and Republicans retaining control of the Senate,"" said Jordan Waldrep, portfolio manager of the ECOZ TrueShares ESG Active Opportunities ETF. 
But Waldrep said that the broader trend towards renewables would continue, regardless of the election result.
The outperformance of European renewable companies also suggests the rally is not merely hinged on U.S. election prospects.
Danish wind-turbine maker Vestas is up 62% this year, while regional rival Siemens Gamesa is up 59%. A basket of European renewable energy stocks - which also includes these two - is up 68% year-to-date.

1531,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Bond Market’s Reflation Bets Face Risk of a Divided Government,"(Bloomberg) -- Even the bond bears are starting to wave warning flags about the degree to which markets are leaning toward a clear win by Democrat Joe Biden in next month’s presidential election, with his party also taking control of Congress.
Not long ago, investors were bracing for volatility in the weeks after the Nov. 3 vote, given the risk of a contested outcome. But President Donald Trump has been trailing by double digits in some national polls, spurring speculation a Democratic sweep will pave the way for supersized fiscal spending.
That backdrop gave fresh impetus last week to bets on a reflating economy, pushing the yield curve to its steepest since June. And it also may be setting the market up for potential pain if the scenario doesn’t pan out.
“If current polling trends hold, the odds of ending up with a contested election should drop, and divided government (with Republicans retaining control of the Senate) would supplant the contested election scenario as the more likely ‘yields lower’ outcome,” Praveen Korapaty, chief interest-rate strategist at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., wrote in a note.
“We continue to like being short in the belly of the U.S. curve in various forms” including curve steepeners, “though we’d watch for the evolving risk/reward trade-off if a Blue wave gets increasingly priced,” he wrote.
Korapaty forecasts the 10-year Treasury yield, now about 0.76%, will end the year at 1.05% and finish 2021 at 1.45%.
Underscoring the mounting bearish sentiment, some options traders on Monday were even hedging a possible move higher in 10-year yields sometime before Nov. 11 to about 1.50%. And speculators as of last week ramped up net short positions in bond futures to fresh records.
“Three weeks until the election is practically an eternity in 2020 time, so additional narrative shifts are definitely possible,” Solita Marcelli, Americas chief investment officer at UBS Financial Services, wrote in a note with Jason Draho, head of Americas asset allocation. “Too much optimism being priced in too soon could also lead to a potentially perverse situation in which investors are disappointed if a Blue Wave doesn’t happen.”

1532,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>",Shares struggle as coronavirus overshadows China data,"By Tom Wilson
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares struggled on Tuesday as worries over the coronavirus pandemic overshadowed Chinese trade data that pointed to a buoyant recovery, while the U.S. dollar edged away from a three-week low. 
The Euro STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.4% before trimming losses, with markets in Frankfurt (GDAXI), London (FTSE) and Paris (FCHI) mirroring its moves. It was last down 0.2%, on course to end three straight days of gains.
Keeping markets on edge, traders said, was news that Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) was pausing its COVID-19 vaccine candidate clinical trials because of an unexplained illness in a study participant.
Investors see the quick introduction of a vaccine as key to helping economies recover. J&J's move comes after AstraZeneca (L:AZN) paused late-stage trials of its experimental vaccine in September, also due to a participant's unexplained illness.
The travel and leisure (SXTP) and autos (SXAP) sectors suffered, losing 1% and 0.3% respectively after heavier falls in early trading. 
Wall Street was also set to lose ground. S&P 500 futures recovered most of their earlier losses to trade down 0.1%. 
The risk-off mood contrasted with earlier resilience for Asian markets. They recovered losses after Chinese data showed exports rising 9.9% in September and imports swinging to a 13.2% gain versus a 2.1% drop in August.
The data, which suggests Chinese exporters are recovering from the pandemic's damage to overseas orders, helped MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gain 0.2%.
Chinese blue-chip shares (CSI300) added 0.3% after dipping early in the day. Some investors, though, raised questions about how strong consumer demand would prove to be. 
""The question is not necessarily how China's trade is doing per se, but how well will consumers spend on Christmas to give some sense of normalcy amid a period of great stress,"" said Nordea Investments' Sebastien Galy in a note.
Currency traders were also watching Chinese trade-related issues. Reports that Beijing has stopped taking shipments of Australian coal caused the Australian dollar to drop as much as 0.6% to $0.7165 .
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in nearly 50 countries, fell 0.1%. 
Government bond yields in the euro zone held near recent troughs, with hefty supply failing to dent a market bolstered by expectations for further central bank easing.
Germany's 10-year Bund yield touched -0.538% (DE10YT=RR), its lowest in just over a week. Italian (IT10YT=RR) and Greek (GR10YT=RR) benchmark 10-year debt both hit record lows. 
STIMULUS HOPES
Investors increasingly expect Democratic candidate Joe Biden will win the U.S. presidential election next month. That would probably lead to a big stimulus package to help the coronavirus-battered U.S. economy. 
""Biden effectively leading in the polls is removing some element of uncertainty,"" said Jeremy Gatto, an investment manager at Unigestion in Geneva. ""In investors' minds, it's not a question of if we get a stimulus, but when.""
Some expect a Biden win to undermine the U.S. dollar, since he's pledged to raise corporate tax rates. But the dollar rose 0.2% against a basket of other currencies to 93.214 (=USD), trying to extend a rebound from Friday's near-three-week low of 92.997. 
The Chinese yuan fell 0.1% to 6.7466 per dollar , after the central bank set a weaker-than-forecast midpoint, offsetting any boost from the trade data.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Tuesday, with the tech sector outperforming ahead of important news from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), while investors also wait for earnings from the key banking sector.
At 7:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 102 points, or 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 120 points, or 1%. 
These cash indices are coming off a four-day win streak, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at a new one-month high and the Nasdaq 100 posting its biggest advance since April.
Tech giants Apple and Amazon led stocks higher on Monday and they will be front and center again Tuesday, as the market awaits their most important events of the year: the unveiling of the next line of iPhones and the annual Prime Day marketing event.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) start the third quarter earnings season in earnest, reporting before the opening bell. JPMorgan reported earnings 30% ahead of expectations, after slowing its credit loss provisions sharply from $8.9 billion in the second quarter to a little over $600 million in the three months through September. Strong trading results also more than offset lower lending income.
Earnings are also due from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), with the latter of special significance given its announcement late Monday to pause trials for its potential Covid-19 vaccine after a participant in the study fell ill for unknown reasons.
This is another setback in the race for a Covid-19 vaccine, after AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) paused late-stage trials of its vaccine candidate last month, also due to unexplained illness in a trial participant.
Meanwhile, investors now consider a new coronavirus relief bill ahead of the November elections as unlikely, with Republicans and Democrats not expected to reach a consensus and pass the measures in that time period. Hopes for stimulus are now focused on January, as Democrat Joe Biden continues to widen his lead in the polls over President Donald Trump. A Biden victory is expected to result in a comprehensive stimulus package in the new year.
Turning to economic data, the main focus Tuesday will be the September consumer price index, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Core CPI is expected to come in at up 0.2% from the prior month, a slowdown in growth from August’s up 0.4%. For the year-over-year comparison, core CPI is expected to tick up 1.4% compared with the 1.3% gain in August.
Oil prices pushed higher Tuesday, recovering after losses of just under 3% during the previous session, but excess output continues to plague the market along with ever-rising Covid-19 numbers hurting global demand.
A slow economic recovery from the pandemic threatens to delay a full rebound in world energy demand to 2025, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 2% higher at $40.20 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.3% to $42.24.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,927.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1795.

LONDON (Reuters) - People tired of their flat pack IKEA dressers, drawers, cabinets and tables will now be able to sell them back to the furniture retailer for resale in its stores as secondhand.
The world's biggest furniture group, said on Tuesday the ""Buy Back"" initiative was part of its aim to become ""a fully circular and climate positive business by 2030.""
Under the scheme, which runs in 27 countries from Nov. 24 to Dec. 3, customers will get vouchers to spend at IKEA stores, the value of which depends on the condition of the furniture they are selling back.
Customers with ""as new"" items, with no scratches, will get 50% of the original price, ""very good"" items, with minor scratches, will get 40% and ""well used"", with several scratches, will get 30%.
One possible catch for customers from the scheme is that products must be returned ""fully assembled.""
IKEA said vouchers will have no expiry date to encourage customers to purchase items only when they are needed.
""By making sustainable living more simple and accessible, IKEA hopes that the initiative will help its customers take a stand against excessive consumption this Black Friday and in the years to come,"" it said in reference to Nov. 27, when lots of retailers offer big discounts on their products.
IKEA said that anything that cannot be resold will be recycled or donated to charity.
By 2021, IKEA plans to have dedicated areas in every store where people can sell back their old furniture and find repaired or refurbished furniture.
Last week, IKEA said it sees sales returning to growth this year after the coronavirus crisis boosted shoppers' interest in spending more on their homes, a trend it believes is here to stay.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s total sales have soared during the coronavirus pandemic, yet in Latin America, the world's biggest online retailer is locked in a dogfight with local rivals as it rolls out its Prime Day event in Mexico and, for the first time, Brazil.
During the Tuesday and Wednesday annual shopping event that spans 19 countries, the company will again showcase the discounts and free shipping that come along with a paid Prime membership – a strategy that has helped Amazon reel in repeat shoppers around the world.
Even so, analysts say Amazon faces an uphill battle in Latin America's top two economies, where success or failure will set the bar for whether it can take on the rest of the region.
""Amazon in Latin America is not the monster that it is in the United States,"" said Marcos Pueyrredon, president of Buenos Aires-based eCommerce Institute.
Amazon does not release country-specific sales data, yet website traffic statistics suggest Amazon is struggling to keep up with Argentina's  MercadoLibre  (NASDAQ:MELI).
In Mexico, where Amazon launched its marketplace in 2015, it trailed second behind MercadoLibre for most unique visitors in August, according to the media analytics firm ComScore.
In Brazil, a more fragmented market that Amazon joined in 2017, it sat in fifth place after MercadoLibre and local e-commerce powerhouses like B2W, Via Varejo and Magazine Luiza.
Gloria Canales, head of marketing for Amazon in Mexico, said the company has been pleased with growth there, and will keep investing.
""We strive everyday to add selection, to improve shipping rates, to improve our payment methods. We're confident that that's what makes us successful.""
It is not like Amazon, which in July posted the biggest profit in its 26-year history, cannot afford to play the long game.
Prime, which in Mexico charges users 99 pesos ($4.67) a month or 899 pesos ($42.38) a year and offers a slew of music, games and original television along with free shipping, ""has been one of the biggest engines of growth that we've had in the country,"" she said.
Just in time for Prime Day, Amazon recently opened its first so-called fulfillment centers outside the Mexico City area, one in Guadalajara and another in Monterrey.
These massive warehouses boasting inventories of key products will help to speed up shipping to more regions.
In Brazil, where Prime costs 9.90 reais ($1.79) a month or 89 reais ($16.09) a year, Amazon began offering memberships just a year ago. Since then, it has seen the fastest subscription growth of any Prime market, with members now in 95% of municipalities, Amazon said in a statement.
Yet, Prime alone may not be enough to boost Amazon's fortunes, said Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures, pointing out inventory and distribution as two key areas where Amazon needs to improve.
""Undoubtedly it's growing,"" he said of the Prime program. ""But it's not a question about growing, it's about trying to keep pace with MercadoLibre.""
That can be a challenge despite the fact that the local champion lacks a membership perks program on par with Prime. Adding to MercadoLibre's headstart since its 1999 founding, the company has a broad base of sellers and understands the local terrain.
Lyana Kahn, founder of Mexican jewelry company LuckyLy, said her sales on Amazon have benefited from Prime's shipping and discount perks for customers.
""It's a great platform that gives you the push to reach more customers without a huge investment,"" Kahn said. Even so, LuckyLy also sells its sparkly earrings and gold-plated necklaces on several other sites, including MercadoLibre.
""Every platform has something different to offer,"" Kahn said. ""There's space for everything.""

Investing.com -- JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) reported earnings well ahead of expectations for the third quarter on Tuesday, thanks to a sharp drop in new reserves against possible credit losses and a strong performance from both its bond and equity trading divisions.
The bank, often seen as a bellwether for the U.S. economy because of its broad exposure to both financial markets and Main Street, said earnings per share totaled $2.92, some 30% above the $2.23 consensus forecast. Revenue totaled $29.94 billion, against expectations for $28.3 billion.
Loan loss provisions fell to a meager $611 million from a whopping $8.9 billion in the second quarter. Such provisioning measures the concerns a bank has that its borrowers won't be able to repay their loans. As such, the sharp decline suggests that the post-Covid credit landscape has brightened considerably. The bank said it had released some $569 million of the provisions it booked three months ago.
""After record provisions for bad losses in Q2, there is a good chance that the lender has seen the worst on this front and investors should expect some stabilization,"" Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said.
The bank's core tier 1 capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, rose by 60 basis points from the end of June to 13.0%. 
The pandemic nonetheless left its scars, with income from the bank's core lending division falling 9% from a year earlier to $13.1 billion, due largely to lower interest rates. Noninterest income, however, rose 7% to $16.8 billion, thanks to investment banking fees and trading profits. Markets revenue rose 30% while investment banking fees rose 9% on the year.
The bank's asset management division also performed strongly, contributing $877 million to a group net profit of $9.4 billion.
(CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the loan loss provision number)
JPMorgan's report follows an earnings beat by BlackRock on Tuesday, who reported EPS of $9.22 on revenue of $4.37B, compared to forecasts EPS of $7.73 on revenue of $3.92B.
Jefferies Financial had beat expectations on September 23 with third quarter EPS of $1.07 on revenue of $1.62B, compared to forecast for EPS of $0.34 on revenue of $1.11B.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",J&J pauses coronavirus vaccine trials due to unexplained illness,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) has paused clinical trials of its coronavirus vaccine candidate due to an unexplained illness in a study participant, delaying one of the highest profile efforts to contain the global pandemic.
The move comes around a month after AstraZeneca (L:AZN) also suspended trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine - which uses a similar technology - due to a participant falling ill.
J&J said on Monday the illness was being reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring board as well as the U.S. group's clinical and safety physicians. 
The company, which reports quarterly financial results on Tuesday morning, said such pauses are normal in big trials, which can include tens of thousands of people. 
It added the voluntary ""study pause"" in giving doses of the vaccine candidate was different from a ""regulatory hold"" imposed by health authorities. 
AstraZeneca last month paused late-stage trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine developed with the University of Oxford due to an unexplained illness in a British study participant. 
While AstraZeneca's trials in Britain, Brazil, South Africa and India have since resumed, its U.S. trial is still on hold, pending a regulatory review.
The J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines are both based on a so-called adenovirus, a harmless modified virus that instructs human cells to produce vaccine proteins. 
They are both also part of the U.S. government's Operation Warp Speed programme to support vaccine development. 
""This could be a second case of adenoviral vaccine to spur safety concerns,"" said Bryan Garnier analyst Olga Smolentseva.
AstraZeneca and medical experts say trial suspensions to look into the cause of a participant's illness are not uncommon. Underwriters of clinical trial insurance have said premiums for coronavirus vaccines studies are only marginally higher than for pre-pandemic vaccines.
J&J on Sept. 22 became the fourth Warp-Speed participant to enter the final stage of testing on humans, with the aim of enrolling 60,000 volunteers in the United States and abroad.""Everybody is on the alert because of what happened with AstraZeneca,"" Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said by email, adding it could take a week to gather information.
""This is likely to be a neurological event,"" he said. Last month, J&J said its vaccine candidate produced a strong immune response in an early-to-mid stage clinical trial. This prompted the company to start the large scale trial, with results expected by the end of this year or early 2021.
J&J declined to elaborate on the illness due to privacy concerns. It did say some participants in studies get placebos, and it was not always clear whether a person suffering a serious adverse event in a trial received a placebo or the treatment.

Stat News reported https://www.statnews.com/2020/10/12/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-study-paused-due-to-unexplained-illness-in-participant/?utm_content=buffer37312&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=twitter_organic the pause earlier, citing a document sent to outside researchers, which stated that a ""pausing rule"" had been met, the online system used to enroll patients in the study had been closed and the data and safety monitoring board would be convened.

J&J announced adjusted earnings per share of $2.2, a gain of 3.8%, on revenue of $21.08 billion, up 1.7%. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected EPS of $1.96 on revenue of $20.15 billion.
J&J also increased its guidance for its full year reported sales by $1.0 billion and adjusted EPS by $0.15, driven by the strength of the recovery and strong underlying business fundamentals.
At 7 AM ET (11:00 GMT), shares in J&J dropped 1.2% premarket despite the positive result, given the pause in its Covid-19 vaccine trial. J&J shares are up 4% from the beginning of the year, outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is up 1.1% from the start of the year.
“Our third-quarter results reflect solid performance and positive trends across Johnson & Johnson, powered by better-than-expected procedure recovery in Medical Devices, growth in Consumer Health, and continued strength in Pharmaceuticals,” said Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Breaking down the divisions, Pharmaceuticals starred, growing by 5% on the quarter, Consumer Health gained 1.3%, while Medical Devices dropped 3.6%. This decline was primarily driven by the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated deferral of medical procedures, but this represented a substantial rebound after the sector dropped over 33% last quarter.
""The current public-health environment further strengthens J&J’s position, where it’s benefiting from strong demand for its over-the-counter products. J&J makes everything from innovative cancer therapies, to medical devices and over-the-counter staples, like pain reliever, Tylenol,"" said Haris Anwar, an analyst at Investing.com
""In this general upbeat environment for healthcare giants, one of the biggest concerns for investors is how quickly the company normalizes its medical devices business. Revival in this unit will be a positive sign for the stock which is trading near a record level. But for all of its strengths, the company's hefty valuation leaves it little room for error.""
The healthcare conglomerate late Monday said it had temporarily paused its Covid-19 vaccine candidate clinical trials due to an unexplained illness in a study participant, delaying one of the highest profile efforts to contain the global pandemic.
J&J shares are up 4% from the beginning of the year, still down 3.29% from its 52 week high of $157.00 set on April 23. They are outperforming the Dow Jones which is up 1.05% from the start of the year.

1541,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Chinese regulatory probe delays approval for Ant's IPO, sources say","By Julie Zhu and Zhang Yan
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's securities regulator is probing a potential conflict of interest in fintech giant Ant Group's planned $35 billion stock listing, delaying approval for what could be the world's largest IPO, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is looking into the role of Alipay, Ant's flagship payment platform, as the only third-party channel through which retail investors could buy into five Chinese mutual funds investing in the IPO, the people told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The arrangement sidelined banks and brokerages, the traditional route for retail investors to buy into funds. More than 10 million retail investors piled money into the five mutual funds when they were launched in late September, underscoring the marketing clout of Alipay.
The CSRC said in guidelines effective from Oct. 1 that mutual fund distributors should avoid conflicts of interest form selling products related to their other existing and potential businesses.
The people said the probe was unlikely to derail the IPO, although it was unclear what its outcome might be. 
It has already delayed Ant's plans, however, as the company had hoped to get CSRC approval last month, and it has narrowed the window for the IPO ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, which could fuel uncertainty for global markets.
Ant declined to comment. The CSRC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Ant, a domestically incorporated affiliate of Chinese e-commerce behemoth  Alibaba  (N:BABA), is seeking a dual-listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong as soon as this month, and needs CSRC approval for both listings. 
The delay in CSRC approval has forced Ant to postpone a hearing with the Hong Kong stock exchange, the last part of the approval process for the Hong Kong listing, the people said.
The Shanghai exchange, in contrast, cleared the listing in 24 days, compared with roughly four months for most IPO candidates that obtained approval in September, according to public disclosures from the exchange.
HONG KONG HEARING
At $35 billion, Ant's IPO would be the world's largest, surpassing oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222)'s $29.4 billion flotation last December.
Ant's listing process has been marked by secrecy, with the firm asking lead bankers to personally sign confidentiality pacts and pressing some investors to explain why they should be allowed to attend marketing meetings.
Ant originally aimed to have the hearing with the Hong Kong bourse's Listing Committee on Sept. 24 and to launch the IPO after the week-long Chinese National Day holiday that ended on Oct. 8, said two of the people. 
The company is still aiming for the Hong Kong hearing to take place in the coming days, according to one of the people.
The Hong Kong exchange declined to comment. 

Exchanges and regulators scrutinise IPO prospectuses and question companies about key issues including their financials, corporate governance, shareholders and risk factors as part of their reviews.

KUALA LUMPUR/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Malaysian rubber glove maker Top Glove Corp Bhd (KL:TPGC), riding a wave of demand generated by the coronavirus outbreak, has hired banks to arrange a Hong Hong listing that could raise at least $1 billion, two sources said. 
 Citigroup  (N:C), China International Capital Corporation (CICC) (HK:3908) and UBS (S:UBSG), will manage the listing, said the two sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter but can't be named as the information is not yet public. 
Another source, also declining to be named as the process is private, said the world's largest glove maker could be more ambitious and look to raise as much as $2 billion.
The company, which is already listed in Malaysia and Singapore, in a filing to the Kuala Lumpur exchange on Monday said it is evaluating a dual primary listing on Hong Kong's stock exchange. 
The evaluation is at a preliminary stage and the structure has not been finalised.
""(The proposed listing), if undertaken, will enable Top Glove to be present in a larger, more active and liquid stock exchange, enlarge and diversify its investor base, and also provide an alternate and larger fund raising platform to support the company's future growth strategy,"" it said.
Citigroup, CICC and UBS declined to comment.

1545,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 05:36AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Grim Data Greet the Start of a Full Winter of Coronavirus,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are struggling again after two important indicators bore out fears that a full winter of Covid-19 restrictions is going to take another heavy toll on the economy.
The monthly ZEW survey of economic expectations in Germany nose-dived in October, falling to its lowest level since May, against a backdrop of rising infections, and broader restrictions on gatherings and activity in Europe’s largest economy.
That news came only three hours after the U.K. recorded its steepest rise in layoffs since 2009, as firms cut swathes of staff ahead of the scheduled end of the government’s wage subsidy scheme.
Germany’s DAX fell 0.3% by 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), while the U.K. FTSE 100 fell 0.2%. The benchmark Stoxx 600 fell 0.1% to 372.54, extending a four-month run of bafflingly low volatility. Since the start of June, when the post-panic rebound topped out, the Stoxx 600 has traded in a range barely 3.5% either side of 364 points. It hasn’t posted a new high since early July.
“The great euphoria witnessed in August and September seems to have evaporated,” ZEW head Achim Wambach said in a statement. “The recent sharp rise in the number of COVID-19 cases has increased uncertainty about future economic development, as has the prospect of the U.K. leaving the EU without a trade deal.
Wambach added that “the current situation in the run-up to the presidential election in the United States further fuels uncertainty.”
At least two of those three factors are more likely than not to be temporary: the most rational outcome of the brinkmanship in the Brexit negotiations is still a messy compromise that avoids dramatic ruptures and cliff-edge effects. In the U.S., meanwhile, the sustained lead of Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden in national opinion polls and – just as importantly – in certain key swing states – has eased fears about a contested election result in November.
The one factor that isn’t going away is the virus: data from the European Centre for Disease Control show new infections running wild in Spain, France, Belgium, the Czech Republic and much of England, where London Mayor Sadiq Khan accepts that some form of fresh lockdown measures are “inevitable.” Hospital admissions, arguably a more important indicator, slow a slightly better trend but are still clearly rising, in central Europe in particular.
The U.K. government on Monday unveiled a new system of categorizing high-risk areas in an effort to bring some structure and clarity to a policy often criticized as chaotic and ad-hoc. However, its chief scientific advisor Chris Whitty said that even the strictest measures under the new scale would likely not be enough to bring the infection curve down again.
The British labor market weakened drastically in the three months through August, with overall employment falling by 153,000, more than five times the consensus estimate. The unemployment rate rose to 4.5% from 4.1%, its highest in three years. The one bright spot in the report was vacancies, which rose by a record amount in the three months through August.  As with the comparable U.S. figures, it seems that the pandemic has created plenty of opportunities along with the disruption it has brought."
1546,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>",Investors Turn Skeptical of U.S. Democrat ‘Blue Wave’ Victory,"(Bloomberg) -- Markets are turning increasingly skeptical about the chances of a “Democratic sweep” in November’s U.S. elections. And that’s bad for almost all asset classes.
When Democrat Joe Biden’s poll numbers increased, numerous strategists started talking about the idea of a “Blue Wave,” where his party would retain control of the House and win the Senate. That prospect could be favorable to markets as a Biden presidency is seen adding to the odds of a fresh round of fiscal stimulus.
But now analysts say there’s a good chance the Senate stays in Republican hands, making the passage of a fresh flood of cash less likely. A combination of Republicans retaining control of the Senate, or stimulus being delayed until after the election will hurt economic growth through the first quarter, according to Bloomberg strategist Vince Cignarella. Add to that the current impasse over stimulus, which leaves almost no chance of a deal before the election, and you have a recipe for a market downturn.
“Without ‘fiscal 4,’ it becomes all about the Dems sweeping the Senate to get a significant package,” said Dennis DeBusschere, a strategist at Evercore ISI in New York, referring to a fourth round of stimulus. “With odds of a Senate sweep 57%, anything can happen.”
Monday’s market action looked a lot like a reversal of the “stimulus trade” that bets on a fiscal flood lifting cyclically oriented stocks and stoking inflation. The Nasdaq 100 gained 3.1% Monday, bolstered by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). jumping 6.4% and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). advancing 4.8%. Growth once again outperformed value stocks and large shares bested small ones, while the dollar rose.
At the same time, the Invesco Solar exchange-traded fund, in a sector that would benefit from a Biden presidency, dropped 3.4%. The bond market is showing signs of concern about bets on the reflation trade.

“The moves in Amazon and Apple are huge and have a significant impact on the Nasdaq 100,” DeBusschere said. “And many people pointed out some weird options activity. But don’t underestimate the impact of fiscal falling apart on the internals.”
Not everyone is worried. RBC economists Tom Porcelli and Jacob Oubina have said they aren’t sure more stimulus is necessary, an idea backed up by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists including Mike Wilson.
“While additional fiscal support would likely help growth and inflation over the next 12 months, we think it’s important to recognize that a strong macro recovery is already well underway,” the strategists wrote in a note Monday. “Furthermore, this recovery has accelerated without additional fiscal support most (included ourselves) thought was forthcoming a month ago.”
Still, everyone from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG have pointed to the potential market-friendly effects of a Democratic sweep driving markets.
“Fiscal stimulus = the new QE,” Nomura Securities International Inc. cross-asset strategist Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Monday.

Maersk, which handles about one in five containers shipped worldwide, said that though cargo volumes were still down on last year they had picked up more than forecast after falling sharply at the height of the coronavirus pandemic a few months ago.
""A.P. Moller - Maersk is on track to deliver a strong Q3 with solid earnings growth across all our businesses, in particular in Ocean and Logistics & Services,"" Chief Executive Soren Skou said in a statement. 
""Volumes have rebounded faster than expected, our costs have remained well under control, freight rates have increased due to strong demand,"" Skou said. 
Volumes in Maersk's Ocean-division declined by around 3% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, above an expected mid-single digit contraction, the company said.
The Danish company said it would cut 2,000 positions as a result of a major reorganisation announced last month, where it seeks to integrate its seaborne container and in-land logistics businesses.
Maersk currently has around 80,000 employees. 
Shares in Maersk were down by around 1% on Tuesday morning.
The company expects restructuring costs of around $100 million in the third quarter related to the redundancies. 
Maersk said it now expects full-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) in the range of $7.5 billion to $8.0 billion before restructuring and integration costs, up from an earlier range of $6.0 billion to $7.0 billion.

Preliminary results for the third quarter showed revenue at $9.9 billion, while EBITDA before restructuring and integration costs came in at $2.4 billion, Maersk said.

(Reuters) - European shares retreated from five-week highs on Tuesday as Johnson & Johnson's move to pause its COVID-19 clinical trials raised doubts about the timeline of a vaccine, while Airbus slipped after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) downgraded its rating on the stock.
A month after AstraZeneca (L:AZN) suspended late-stage trials of its vaccine candidate, Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) said it had temporarily halted trials due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) snapped a three-day winning streak to fall 0.3%, led by travel and leisure (SXTP), banking (SX7P) and insurance (SXIP) stocks.
Only two European sectors - telecoms (SXKP) and utilities (SX6P) - were marginally higher in morning trading, although analysts said the news was unlikely to spark a broader slump in equity markets.
""The sell-off wasn't too bad as we have been down this road before, but with numerous vaccines in the pipeline, this setback might not be viewed too negatively unless the unexplained illness becomes more expensive in other trials,"" said Stephen Innes, a markets strategist at Axi.
Hopes of more U.S. fiscal aid and signs of an economic rebound have powered European stock markets, helping the benchmark STOXX 600 on Monday to hit its highest close in nearly a month.
Fresh data on Tuesday showed China's imports in September grew at their fastest pace this year, while exports extended strong gains. However, data closer to home painted a less rosy picture as Britain's unemployment rate rose in August to its highest in more than three years. 
""In light of the new restrictions (in the UK) announced yesterday, today's data will still underplay the level of how much unemployment levels are likely to increase in the months ahead,"" said Michael Hewson, market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
Data on German investor sentiment for October is due at 0900 GMT, while focus later in the week will be on a European Union Summit, which is the self-imposed UK deadline for a Brexit trade deal.
Almost all the European country indexes were down by 0808 GMT.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Tuesday, amid worries the second wave of coronavirus cases hitting the continent will have an adverse impact upon the region’s nascent economic recovery.
At 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.5%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.4%. 
Official data showed that U.K. unemployment started to grow even before the government imposed new restrictions to control the coronavirus. The number of redundancies increased by 227,000 in the June-August period, the most since 2009, the Office for National Statistics said Tuesday, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.5%, the highest since 2017.
This news resonates as a number of European countries have posted record increases of Covid-19 cases in recent days, forcing authorities to adopt stringent localized restrictions, such as those imposed in parts of the U.K. on Monday. This tends to suggest many more job losses are likely in the coming months.
Adding to the negative tone was the news late Monday that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) paused its Covid-19 vaccine candidate clinical trials due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.
J&J's move follows a similar one by AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), which paused late-stage trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine, developed with the University of Oxford, in September. Although clinical trials have resumed in the U.K. and a number of other countries, AstraZeneca's trials have yet to resume in the U.S.
Wall Street closed with strong gains Monday amid confidence that a clear-cut election victory for Democratic candidate Joe Biden - implicit in most of the recent polls -  will pave the way for a comprehensive recovery package in January. 
In corporate news, Airbus (PA:AIR) stock dropped 3.5% after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) downgraded its investment stance on the aircraft manufacturer to underweight, citing a more cautious view on air travel in 2021. It cut its view on Airbus deliveries next year by 10%.
Rolls-Royce  (LON:RR) , which makes engines for the likes of Airbus, slumped 7.5%. The troubled manufacturer had posted strong gains on Monday, with investors reacting well to the multibillion-pound rescue package announced last month.
Oil prices pushed higher Tuesday, recovering after losses of just under 3% during the previous session, but excess output continues to plague the market along with ever-rising Covid-19 numbers hurting global demand.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Automobile sales in China rose 12.8% in September from the same month a year earlier, marking the sixth consecutive month of gain, as the world's biggest vehicle market comes off lows hit during the coronavirus lockdown.
Sales reached 2.57 million vehicles last month, showed data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).
Sales are still down 6.9% for the first nine months of the year at 17.12 million vehicles, CAAM said.
Auto insiders refer to ""Golden September, Silver October"" as they regard the months as the high season for China sales, with drivers venturing out to make purchases having stayed away during the stifling summer months.
Reflecting that trend, sales of passenger vehicles rose 8% in September. Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175), Great Wall Motor Co Ltd (SS:601633) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) booked double-digit growth.
The Beijing auto show, promotional events and local policies supporting consumption in the auto sector helped sales growth in September, said senior CAAM official Chen Shihua.
However, as broader economic activity is still slow, consumer confidence is yet to recover so it will take time to fully release demand for more affordable products, Chen said.
New energy vehicle (NEV) sales surged 67.7% to 138,000 units for their third consecutive month of gain. NEVs include battery-powered electric, plug-in petrol-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.
NEV makers such as home-grown Nio Inc (N:NIO) and  Xpeng Inc  (N:XPEV) as well as foreign firms like U.S. leader Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) are expanding manufacturing capacity in China where the government promotes greener vehicles to reduce air pollution.
On Oct. 1, Tesla cut the starting price of its Chinese-made Model 3 sedan by about 8% to 249,900 yuan ($36,805).

For trucks and other commercial vehicles, which constitute around a quarter of the overall market, sales surged 40% in September, driven by government investment in infrastructure and as buyers upgraded to comply with tougher emissions rules.

Speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the facility may produce up to 30,000 electric vehicles (EVs) annually by 2025 and represents an investment of S$400 million ($295 million).
Singapore is one of the world's most expensive places to buy a car and does not currently have any auto manufacturing capacity. But the wealthy city-state has set out ambitious plans to phase out petrol vehicles by 2040.
""Automotive activities are becoming viable in Singapore once again. EVs have a different supply chain, fewer mechanical parts and more electronics, which plays to Singapore's strengths,"" PM Lee said. 
A Hyundai spokeswoman confirmed the 30,000 unit target but said that the exact capacity was yet to be determined. The facility is due for completion by end 2022, the firm said in a statement.
The announcement comes after vacuum cleaner company Dyson last year scrapped plans to build an electric car in Singapore, saying it was not commercially viable.
Singapore plans to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040, and make a bigger bet on electrification to cut greenhouse gases and slow climate change.
Hyundai said in a statement its new Singapore facility aims to be carbon neutral by using solar and hydrogen energy, will utilise technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics, and will include a test drive track for customers.

The centre is part of Hyundai's vision to enable future vehicle buyers to customize and purchase vehicles online using a smartphone, allowing production to be on-demand.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Tuesday morning, with investors digesting a setback in the progress towards a COVID-19 vaccine.
Developer Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) said on Monday that an unexplained illness in a participant caused it to temporarily halt its vaccine study. The setback follows AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) halting clinical trials for its candidate AZD-1222, which it is co-developing with the University of Oxford, in early September. Although clinical trials have resumed in the U.K., Brazil, South Africa, India and Japan, AstraZeneca's trials are yet to resume in the U.S.
The Johnson & Johnson news comes after U.S. markets closed higher for a fourth day, with the Nasdaq boosted to its biggest advance since April by a surge in tech stocks such as Apple Inc and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) surged 6.4% on Wall Street on Monday ahead of the expected debut of the company’s latest iPhone later in the day, while Amazon saw its stocks jump 4.8% ahead of the company’s Prime Day shopping event later in the week.
The setback also continues to point towards a bumpy road towards economic recovery, with hopes for the latest U.S. stimulus measures being passed before the Nov. 3 presidential election fading. Senate Republicans continue to reject Trump’s proposal for a $1.8 trillion deal, and House of Representative members have been informed not to expect any action during the week.
“The hurdles at the moment come from the uncertainty around the U.S. election and the uncertainty about the timing and effectiveness of a vaccine,” AXA IM Core Investments chief investment officer Chris Iggo told Bloomberg.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.71% by 10:59 PM ET (2:59 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component edged down 0.13% ahead of the release of Chinese trade data, including exports, imports, and the trade balance, later in the day.
The port city of Qingdao also reported a total of 12 new COVID-19 cases, its biggest cluster in months. Investors are also looking to a “crucial speech” to be made by President Xi Jinping on Wednesday in Shenzhen, during celebrations to mark the city’s designation as a special economic zone.
In Australia, the ASX 200 jumped 1.18%. Canberra is seeking clarity from China about the latter’s reported ban of Australian coal imports, which has further soured the relations between the two countries.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.46% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched down 0.07%.
Hong Kong markets were closed due to a storm.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s physician Sean Conley said that the president has tested negative for COVID-19 for “consecutive days” on Monday afternoon. Trump is expected to jump back on the campaign trial and try to decrease the widening gap with Democrat candidate Joe Biden ahead of the election.
The hearings for Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court also began in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday.

The Hong Kong Observatory raised its storm signal to No. 8, the third-highest on its scale, at 5:40 a.m. and said it expects the signal to be in force for “most of the day.” Winds with mean speeds of 63 km (39 miles) per hour or more are expected from the northeast quarter, it said.
Most businesses close and public transport becomes limited when No. 8 signal or above is in place. Under Hong Kong stock exchange rules, trading will be abandoned for the day if the signal isn’t lowered to 3 or below before noon. A typhoon in August also disrupted stock trading in the city, with the market opening at 1:30 p.m.
Chinese President Xi Jinping is set to visit Shenzhen, neighboring Hong Kong, this week. He is scheduled to deliver an address Wednesday and meet the leaders of Hong Kong and Macau, the official Xinhua News Agency said Monday.
At 8 a.m., Nangka was centered about 450km south-southwest of Hong Kong and is forecast to move west or west-northwest at about 22km per hour towards the vicinity of Hainan Island and intensify gradually, the Observatory said on its website.
In 2018, the city raised the maximum No. 10 signal when Typhoon Mangkhut left the city with roads blocked, buildings damaged and low-lying areas flooded.

1558,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 06:30PM ET</span>","Apollo CEO Black says he regrets ties to Epstein, denies any wrongdoing","By Chibuike Oguh and Lawrence Delevingne
(Reuters) - Apollo Global Management Inc (N:APO) Chief Executive Leon Black told the buyout firm's investors on Monday that he regretted having had ties to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but denied any wrongdoing or inappropriate conduct related to his business and social relationship with Epstein.
Black wrote to the firm's investors after the New York Times reported on Monday that he wired between $50 million and $75 million to Epstein as far back as 2008.
Reuters could not determine how long Black continued to wire money. Epstein, who was charged by federal prosecutors with sex trafficking last year, committed suicide in his New York City jail cell in August 2019, before his trial.
While Black's business ties to Epstein were already known, the Times story outlined previously unreported payments, as well as socializing between the two financiers.
""I was completely unaware of, and continue to be appalled by, the reprehensible conduct that surfaced at the end of 2018 and led to the federal criminal charges brought against Mr. Epstein,"" Black wrote to Apollo fund investors in a letter seen by Reuters.
An Apollo spokeswoman said that Black acted in a personal capacity and that the private equity firm had not done any business with Epstein. Apollo shares dropped 5.7% on Monday to close at $43.90.
Black said in the letter that Epstein provided ""professional services"" to his family partnership and related family entities, involving estate planning, tax and philanthropic advice.
Black also said he met Epstein from time to time at his New York City townhouse and also donated money to charitable organizations he did not identify that were affiliated with the late financier.
Federal prosecutors and lawyers have sued Epstein's more than $630 million estate to obtain compensation for the young women and girls he allegedly abused and trafficked.
In January, U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General Denise George sued the estate, seeking claims on behalf of victims he raped and trafficked on a private Caribbean island. 

Black said in the letter he intends to cooperate with the U.S. Virgin Islands inquiry and any other investigation.

LONDON (Reuters) - Thirty of the world's largest investors managing a combined $5 trillion said on Tuesday they plan to set targets to lower their portfolio carbon emissions by as much as 29% over the next five years.
All members of the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, a group which includes the biggest U.S. pension scheme CalPERs and German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG), are aiming to align their portfolios with the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.
The move is the most ambitious yet by the influential group, whose members own sizeable stakes in many of the world's top companies, and comes as pressure builds for asset owners to use their financial muscle to push for quicker change.
While an increasing number of investors, companies and governments are committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, some have been criticised for not setting the clear nearer-term targets needed to ensure the goal is met.
With policymakers gearing up for the next round of global climate talks in Scotland next year, the group's move is likely to act as a challenge for other leading investors to step up their own efforts.
The group said its members would implement cuts in greenhouse gas emissions from their portfolios of between 16% and 29%, with each confirming their own particular target in the first quarter of 2021.
The plan, called the 2025  Target  (NYSE:TGT) Setting Protocol, should help increase investment in those companies contributing to the transition to a low-carbon economy and influence both markets and government policies, the group said in a statement.
Specifically, the group said it would send a message to the thousands of companies owned by the investors that ""deep emissions cuts are required"", and that the group would work with boards willing to adjust their business models.
The Protocol has been made available for comment by the public, academics, government and business until Nov. 13.
""Reaching net-zero is not simply reducing emissions and carrying on with the business models of today,"" said Günther Thallinger, Alliance Chair and Member of the Board of Management, Allianz SE.

""There are profound changes and opportunities that will come from the net-zero economy, we see new business opportunities and strong wins for those who are ready to lead,"" he added.

About half of that amount is related to lost gross domestic product as a result of economic shutdowns and the ongoing spread of the virus, while the other half comes from health losses including premature death and mental and long-term health impairments, Cutler and Summers wrote in an essay published online Monday in in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
“The immense financial loss from Covid-19 suggests a fundamental rethinking of government’s role in pandemic preparation,” the authors wrote. “Currently, the U.S. prioritizes spending on acute treatment, with far less spending on public health services and infrastructure.”
The $16 trillion amount is equal to about 90% of annual U.S. GDP; it’s also more than twice as much the U.S. has spent on wars since Sept. 11, 2001, including those in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, according to the essay.
Policies including wide-scale population testing, contact tracing and isolation can reduce the spread of infection and prevent some of these losses. Spending on testing and tracing strategies is about 30 times less expensive than the projected economic cost without those policies, the authors said.
Testing and tracing should be permanent investments by the U.S. government, and shouldn’t be dismantled when the pandemic recedes, wrote Cutler and Summers, who’s a paid contributor to Bloomberg Television.

Investing.com – The Dow notched a four-day win streak Monday, as investors piled into tech names with Apple attracting the bulk of buying action ahead of its slate of new iPhones expected to be unveiled on Tuesday.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.87%, or 250 points. The S&P 500 was up 1.64%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 2.57%.
Tech, meanwhile, was among the biggest gainers, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) closing up 6%  as Wall Street talked up signs of the strong demand for the upcoming launch of 5G-enabled iPhones.
""We expect four models of iPhone 12 to be unveiled on Tuesday .. we are seeing Apple and its Asian suppliers anticipate stepped-up demand for the larger 6.7-inch model which is raising the overall iPhone 12 expectations heading into this 'once in a decade' potential launch,"" Wedbush said in a note.

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) report quarterly earnings before the opening bell on Tuesday. Ahead of the quarterly earnings, analysts estimates have improved as many expect robust trading activity to ease the impact of softer lending activity amid ultra-low interest rates.
FactSet estimates cumulative financial earnings to fall 19.4% in the third quarter from a year ago, marking an improvement from its forecast in June for a 34.4% decline.

The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) gave Mountain Valley permission late Friday to resume some construction on its $5.4 billion-$5.7 billion pipeline, which runs from Virginia to West Virginia.
""As the litigation process progresses and as we receive additional information from FERC regarding potentially releasing the remainder of the route for construction, (Mountain Valley) will continue to evaluate its current construction plans, budget, and schedule,"" Equitrans said.
Mountain Valley is one of several U.S. oil and gas pipelines delayed by regulatory and legal fights with environmental and local groups that found problems with federal permits issued by the Trump administration.
FERC suspended work on Mountain Valley a year ago due to litigation over the project's Biological Opinion from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), which allows construction in areas inhabited by endangered and threatened species.
The FWS issued a new Biological Opinion in early September. Environmental and other groups continue to challenge the latest FWS approval and other federal permits in court.
Analysts at Height Capital Markets said they expect the project to enter service in mid 2021 but noted timing could slip to the third quarter of 2021 if legal challenges prevent some stream crossings.
""We acknowledge the legal challenge that is currently before Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and have agreed to temporarily delay stream and waterbody activities out of respect for that process,"" Equitrans said.
Equitrans has said it expects the pipeline, which is about 92% complete, to enter service in early 2021.
In February 2018, when Equitrans started construction, it estimated Mountain Valley would cost about $3.5 billion and be completed by the end of 2018.

1566,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 03:59PM ET</span>","Bank Profits, Inflation, Apple iPhone Day: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Two highly anticipated events this week boosted stocks on Monday, pushing the NASDAQ Composite index closer to 12,000.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) led stocks higher as the two prepared for their big events on Tuesday: the unveiling of the next line of iPhones and the annual Amazon Prime day sale.
Monday's market surge put the momentum trade back in the forefront after cyclical stocks took center stage the last few weeks. Investors and traders have been watching Washington's off-again, on-again negotiations over a new stimulus plan, with fading hopes a deal will come any time soon.
In addition, the market seems to be adjusting for the possibility of a Joe Biden victory in November and a related ""Blue wave.""
Bank stocks are also in the spotlight this week as earnings kick off, and core inflation data are expected.
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow:
1. Bank stocks react to third quarter earnings
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) report third quarter earnings before the opening bell. Some analysts believe trading income could help smooth over lackluster lending income. JPMorgan is seen reporting earnings per share of $2.23 on revenue of $28.2 billion, according to estimates of analysts tracked by Investing.com. Citi is seen reporting EPS of 86 cents on revenue of $17.2 billion.
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) also reports on Tuesday, and analysts tracked by Investing.com expect a loss of $3.03 a share on revenue of $3.1 billion.
2. Inflation for September seen slowing from prior month
Core CPI for September comes out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) along with a slew of other inflation measures. Investors tracked by Investing.com expect Core CPI to pick up 0.2% from the prior month, when it crept up 0.4% from July.
For the year-over-year comparison, Core CPI is expected to tick up 1.4% compared to the 1.3% gain in August.
3. Big iPhone reveal on deck
Apple shares are already near a 52-week high, and the unveiling of the next set of iPhones is pushing it up even more.
The shares jumped 6% on Monday. Some analysts, such as Wedbush, are saying the unveiling could be the beginning of Apple's most important product cycle since the release of the iPhone 6 in 2014.
The new suite of phones are equipped with 5G, the next generation network. But what's really got people excited is the prospect of upgrades. Wedbush estimates that out of 950 million phones around the world, some 350 million of consumers are ready for an upgrade.

1567,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 03:20PM ET</span>",French Airbus workers sign key restructuring deal,"TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Major French unions on Monday signed a keenly awaited labor deal with Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) covering job reductions and furloughs for production workers affected by coronavirus-blighted demand for passenger jets.
After three months of talks, unions representing a majority of the planemaker's French workers signed an agreement paving the way for 4,200 job reductions in France, including 3,400 in Toulouse, Europe's aerospace capital where Airbus is based.
Unions say the agreement will prevent compulsory redundancies, although Chief Executive Guillaume Faury recently warned staff that voluntary measures would not be enough.
Unions also signed an agreement implementing government-backed furlough schemes for up to 30% of French employees mainly involved in production work. 
In total, Airbus is looking for 15,000 job cuts among its more than 130,000 staff and has reaffirmed those plans after aviation markets failed to recover as quickly as expected. 
But it has said 1,500 jobs could be spared if government backing remains for furloughs and 500 others could be saved by French government funding on a new carbon-free aircraft project.
The agreements take effect on Jan. 1.
""During the restructuring, we have reached our goal of having zero compulsory layoffs, which was our red line,"" Jean-François Knepper, negotiator for the Force Ouvriere union, told Reuters.
Any shortfalls in the number of people agreeing to leave, compared with Airbus' target, could be met by prolonging the sign-up period or restricting salaries for a further year, he added.
Airbus workers have until Dec. 31 to sign up for voluntary redundancy, but that could be extended to March 31.

The minority CGT union refused to back the package, saying it failed to rule out compulsory layoffs or help most staff.

1569,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 02:22PM ET</span>","From Legacy Name to Cloud Company, Avaya Aims for a Turnaround"," By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- Say ""  Avaya  ,"" (NYSE:AVYA) and what likely comes to mind are those omnipresent office handsets. 
But Avaya is now a cloud play and shares are up some 40% since the start of 2020. Not bad for a company that emerged from bankruptcy in 2017, and in 2019 was still considered a legacy name. 
Avaya was on the block a little over a year ago. Then came a partnership with RingCentral (NYSE:RNG) to launch ""Avaya Cloud Office,"" creating what could become a leader in cloud communications. The timing was fortuitous, as Avaya shifted from mostly providing support services for their old systems to supporting companies forced to send their employees home to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
""We were in the right place, at the right time,"" said Chief Executive Officer Jim Chirico in a video interview. ""Today, all of our growth is in areas of cloud and saas,"" or software as a service. 
The transformation has been quick. The company gave out 2.5 million temporary free licenses to companies whose employees were sent home, to get them started. Those are turning into customers. Now, Avaya is helping companies measure the productivity of work-from-home staff.
""We have insight into what their agents are doing each and every day, and quite frankly, each and every minute,"" Chirico said. 
Avaya's key partnerships, like that with RingCentral, mean no need to develop proprietary technology. They have also developed a video communications platform, akin to  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM), but not for retail use. The focus is on ""large enterprise"" and based on security. Chirico cited governments, large financial institutions and health services companies who ""really love it.""
""We're seeing significant growth in those key enterprise customers in multiple segments,"" Chirico said. Annual revenue of about $2.8 billion for Avaya is more than Zoom and RingCentral combined.
""We're in the early innings and we see based on our products and the (total addressable market) that's out there, there's certainly an opportunity to grow the company,"" Chirico said. 
The company has remained profitable throughout its transformation. In August, Avaya reported earnings per share of $1.44, which beat the estimated 79 cents on sales of $722 million, compared to the expected $687 million. 
On Aug. 11, following quarterly results, Avaya got price target increases from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Northland Capital Markets, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Citi.
In July, Cowen raised its price target to $18 from $15, and maintained an outperform rating, according to StreetInsider. 
""COVID is accelerating companies’ long-term business continuity initiatives and that the timely combination of Avaya’s private and public cloud rollouts, Avaya ReadyNow and Avaya Cloud Office, respectively, supports overnight cloud migration for both large enterprises and SMEs,"" said Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza in a note, according to StreetInsider. ""RingCentral’s CFO suggests that the 7-figure ACO contract that Avaya landed in the UK this quarter is indicative of a pipeline that skews toward larger, chunky deal sizes.""
Chirico declined to comment on potential mergers and acquisitions, but noted the company has a lot of flexibility to invest back in the business.  
""In three years, we want to be between being in the pack to leading the pack,"" Chirico said. ""Three years ago we weren't even in the pack.""

Adding to its woes, the company in March also lost a court battle to avoid paying higher rebates to state Medicaid programs for its top-selling drug.
Mallinckrodt said on Monday it had agreed to pay $1.6 billion over several years to settle opioid-related litigation. About $450 million would be paid as part of its settlement once the company emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy.
The company would then pay $200 million in the first and second year after its emergence from the bankruptcy, and $150 million subsequently through the seventh year.
Mallinckrodt had agreed to pay $260 million over seven years to resolve disputes related to its multiple-sclerosis drug H.P. Acthar gel and pay out rebates to state Medicaid programs.
The company had said in February it planned to have its generic drug business file for bankruptcy as part of a tentative $1.6 billion opioid settlement to resolve claims by state attorneys general and U.S. cities and counties.
Mallinckrodt also plans to dismiss its appeal to a March ruling related to Acthar gel, whose price per-vial has risen from about $50 in 2001 to $38,892 in 2019.
During the bankruptcy protection, the company said it aims to resolve opioid-related claims and reduce its debt by about $1.3 billion, while surviving on cash on hand and cash generated from operations.

The company listed both assets and liabilities in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion in a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District Of Delaware.

1571,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 01:35PM ET</span>",EU watchdog to clarify share trading after full Brexit,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's securities watchdog said it expects to make a statement soon on where shares listed in the bloc must be traded after Britain's full departure from the European Union in December.
It was important for market participants to have clarity on where they can trade shares, Steven Maijoor, chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), told the European Parliament.
Britain left the bloc last January but still has full access to the single market until Dec. 31 under transition arrangements.
Brussels is assessing whether to grant ""equivalence,"" or continued full access for UK share trading platforms, to EU investors or cut off the City of London.
Without equivalence, EU investors would trade EU shares inside the bloc under its share trading obligation (STO) rule.
EU states are divided over whether to make the STO more flexible given that investment funds in the bloc are heavy users of deep liquidity in London trading platforms.
""Ultimately, you would prefer to have equivalence here, but clearly I fully understand that is difficult for the Commission as that would also require clarity on how in this area the UK would like to change its laws and regulations,"" Maijoor said.
Brussels wants Britain to say if it will diverge from current trading rules inherited from the bloc and thereby no longer be equivalent to maintain access.
""We are discussing this internally ... in close coordination with the European Commission,"" Maijoor said.
ESMA's previous statement on the STO and other announcements on EU securities rules would serve as an ""anchor,"" Maijoor said.
The London Stock Exchange said on Monday it would offer trading in EU-listed shares on its new Amsterdam hub from the end of November if there is no equivalence decision by then to allow continued trading in London.

Investing.com --  In case you hadn't heard, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s got big news coming up tomorrow. 
In fact, Wedbush even says the day will mark the beginning of the company's most important product cycle since the iPhone 6 in 2014, according to StreetInsider. Apple will reveal its iPhone 12 family of products, kicking off the 5G ""supercycle."" 
Shares are up more than 5% on Monday as the market salivates over the next overpriced handset models. The iPhone represents more than 50% of Apple sales.
The big problem with the new models is that 5G isn't actually much faster than 4G networks, according to Briefing.com. In fact, it could take years for 5G to reach worthwhile speeds, some speculate. 
Four models are expected, ranging from $699 to $1,099.
“We are seeing Apple and its Asian suppliers anticipate stepped-up demand for the larger 6.7-inch model which is raising the overall iPhone 12 expectations heading into this 'once in a decade' potential launch,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note, according to StreetInsider.
Ives sees 75 million to 80 million phones, up from 65 million to 70 million a few months ago, with some 350 million of 950 million existing units ready for upgrade. Chinese consumers are also important this year. 
“We are seeing considerable strength from the China region over the last few months (should be a source of relative strength in the September quarter) with positive trends heading into the all-important holiday timeframe,"" said Ives, who has a buy-equivalent on the stock. 
Last seek,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised its estimates for the iPhone, saying Wall Street estimates are too low. Analyst Katy Huberty raised 2021 fiscal year sales and earnings per share by 2%, which is 5% to 6% above consensus. She raised FY21 iPhone shipment forecast to 220 million units from 218 million, according to StreetInsider.
""We expect this fall's launch to be the most significant iPhone event in years,"" Huberty said.

(Reuters) - European shares hit a five-week high on Monday as optimism about a stable economic recovery in China and hopes of more U.S. fiscal stimulus helped offset concerns around surging COVID-19 cases across the continent.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) marked a third straight day of gains to end 0.7% higher, led by utilities (SX6P), technology (SX8P) and autos (SXAP) stocks.
The Trump administration on Sunday called on the U.S. Congress to pass a stripped-down coronavirus relief bill after talks stalled on a more comprehensive stimulus deal.
""Investors have not lost faith that further stimulus measures will follow and that an effective COVID-19 vaccine will soon be placed on the market,"" said Milan Cutkovic, market analyst at Axi.
But a jump in domestic coronavirus cases has raised the spectre of fresh lockdowns and cast a shadow over a nascent economic rebound.
With Italy preparing for nationwide curbs, the European Central Bank's chief economist, Philip Lane, said the euro zone economy was entering a tougher phase. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also imposed a tiered system of further restrictions on parts of England, including closing some pubs.
British pub and restaurant owners Marston's Plc (L:MARS) and  Restaurant Group  Plc (L:RTN) fell 5.3% and 9.3%, respectively, while the blue-chip FTSE 100 (FTSE) lost 0.3%. (L)
""Investors are walking on thin ice,"" Cutkovic said. ""Further lockdowns would jeopardise the already fragile economic recovery and have lasting effects on consumer confidence.""
Data on inflation, industrial production and business conditions is due later in the week. All eyes will also be on a European Union summit on Oct. 15 and 16, particularly with a UK-imposed deadline for a post-Brexit trade deal.
""It seems progress has been made and if this continues, I would expect talks to continue beyond that self-imposed UK deadline,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid.
The Italian bourse (FTMIB) ended 0.6% higher, shrugging off a slide in bank stocks as Italian government bond yields fell near record lows on expectations of a new round of stimulus from the European Central Bank.
As the third-quarter corporate earnings season gets under way, analysts expect earnings at STOXX 600 firms to have declined 38% year-on-year in the quarter following a 50.8% slump in the prior quarter, according to Refinitiv data.

The European telecoms index (SXKP) surged to a three-week high, powered by a 6.8% jump for Dutch telecommunications company KPN (AS:KPN) following a report that Sweden-based private equity firm EQT (NYSE:EQT) was considering a takeover.

Once known for applications like Photoshop, Adobe has become one of the biggest providers of software for running such campaigns, which businesses use to decide which of thousands of images and pieces of written to content to show to potential customers. Growth in its marketing software division has helped send shares up nearly 50% this year.
The artificial intelligence features released on Monday aid that effort by, for example, scanning and labeling thousand of product images by color and shape, or using natural-language processing technology to read an article to determine its subject. 
That makes it easier for marketing campaigns to make a recommendation, whether that means showing a person browsing an e-commerce site a pair of shoes similar to ones they have previously viewed or a news website suggesting a story on a similar subject to the one just read.
Such artificial intelligence technology has existed for several years, but using it generally required corporate marketing departments to export data from their systems and work with another division of the business to use, slowing the work down, Ali Bohra, director of strategy and product marketing for intelligence services at Adobe, said in an interview. Adobe has placed the technologies directly inside the marketing systems, reducing the need to export data.

""When you're thinking about the need to be agile and work in real time, this is not a process that works very well,"" Bohra said.

1580,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>","Electric cars to triple market share in Europe amid COVID-19, researchers say","By Kate Abnett
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Electric vehicles made up 8% of car sales in Europe in the first half of 2020, putting them on track to triple their market share this year, according to analysis by the NGO Transport & Environment (T&E).
While the novel coronavirus pandemic has seen overall car sales plummet, sales of electric cars - which T&E defined as both battery and plug-in hybrid models - have increased.
This saw electric cars more than triple their market share in the European Economic Area (EEA), compared with the first half of last year, T&E said.
Outright sales of such vehicles are expected to roughly double this year, to one million units, it said.
T&E attributed the sales increase to tougher European Union car emissions standards, which took effect this year, and post-pandemic purchase incentives in Germany and France.
The NGO expects carmakers to meet the 2020 emissions standards, which would see electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles triple their market share in 2020 to 10% of EEA car sales.
""It is because of the EU emissions standards, but it is also thanks to many investments carmakers made last year,"" report co-author Julia Poliscanova said.
The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) said electric vehicle sales have been boosted by national support schemes to foster economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic but that this trend was not necessarily a long-term one.
""It is difficult to make any predictions on future long-term shifts in consumer behaviour from such 'artificial' growth driven by subsidies,"" ACEA said.
T&E urged the EU to set tougher future emissions targets to ensure electric vehicles keep edging out polluting models.
Fuel-guzzling SUVs also increased their market share, to 39%, in the first half of 2020.
The European Commission has already outlined plans to further tighten car CO2 limits as part of its proposal for a tougher 2030 EU climate goal.

ACEA said policymakers needed to strengthen charging infrastructure and schemes to make zero-emissions vehicles affordable before considering tighter CO2 standards.

LONDON/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Shareholders in  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR) have approved the company's plan to end its 90-year-old dual-headed structure in favour of a single London-based entity, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company said on Monday.
The proposal passed with the support of more than 99% of shares voted.
The results were released during shareholder meetings streamed online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Investors in Dutch-listed Unilever NV (AS:UNA) approved the move with 99.4% support last month.
Unilever wants to unify on Nov. 29, ending a hybrid structure that dates back to the merger of British soap maker Lever Brothers and Margarine Unie in the Netherlands. 
The maker of Dove soap, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Ben & Jerry's ice cream says the dual structure hampers its ability to conduct acquisitions and asset sales quickly, such as the planned sale of its tea business. 
Such flexibility is key to Unilever's ambition to shift its portfolio into higher-growth areas like premium beauty. Unilever has said this will become even more important as a result of the pandemic.
The final steps towards completing the unification include UK High Court hearings on Oct. 23 and Nov. 2, with the Dutch-listed shares ceasing trading after Nov. 27.
The only potential worry for Unilever is an ""exit tax"" proposed by a Dutch opposition party that could cost the company up to 11 billion euros ($13 billion). 
A top Dutch legal body said on Friday the current plan appeared at odds with fundamental principles of law. The opposition party has re-submitted its proposal for consideration with amendments, though no debate has been scheduled on it in parliament. 
Unilever has said it does not think the law is viable, but if passed before the unification is finalised, it would be a reason to stop it.
Unilever began its push to restructure under previous management after a failed $143 billion takeover approach by Kraft Heinz (O:KHC) in 2017.
Tax and political considerations thwarted its first attempt to unify in Rotterdam in 2018, with concerns about a 15% Dutch dividend withholding tax and forced selling by some UK shareholders once Unilever was dropped from Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) index. The current plan will see Unilever Plc shares included in the Dutch AEX (AEX).

Britain's departure from the European Union gives some extra urgency, as a delay beyond this year could mean additional scrutiny from EU and British regulators.

The test, AdviseDx, can be used to identify a type of antibody called Immunoglobulin M (IgM) in blood samples to determine if someone has been exposure to the novel coronavirus, potentially indicating a recent or prior infection.
Abbott has already received emergency use authorization for seven tests, including molecular tests, a rapid antigen test and another test which can detect a type of antibody called IgG.
The FDA's emergency use authorization allows the use of unapproved medical products in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases with no adequate or approved alternatives.
IgG is longer lasting in the body after an infection, but IgM is more useful for determining a recent exposure to the coronavirus as these antibodies become undetectable weeks to months following an infection, Abbott said http://newsfile.refinitiv.com/getnewsfile/v1/story?guid= Unlike molecular tests, which can detect whether someone has the coronavirus, antibody tests determine if someone has had a previous infection by detecting disease-fighting proteins called antibodies. However, antibody tests are not recommended as the sole basis of diagnosis of COVID-19 as these antibodies may not be detected in the early days of the infection. Shares of Abbott were up 0.5% at $110.21 in early trading.

Twitter defines monetizable daily active usage or users as users who logged in or were otherwise authenticated and accessed Twitter on any given day and to whom they were able to show ads, according to 9to5Mac.
""Twitter has turned around its user product and has been driving a nice pickup in mDAU growth over the last few years, and we think this trend can continue on a multi-year basis,"" Walmsley said.

1586,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 10:20AM ET</span>",Analysis: New Apple 'iPhone 12' to offer 5G speeds U.S. networks can't deliver,"By Supantha Mukherjee and Kenneth Li
(Reuters) - 5G will finally get its U.S. closeup with the expected debut of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s next iPhone on Tuesday. But the blazing speeds promised will not materialize for most people.
The device, dubbed the iPhone 12 by analysts, can tap into 5G, or fifth generation wireless technology, that theoretically operates as much as 10 to 20 times faster than current 4G wireless networks. 
Using the next iPhone or any 5G enabled device on today's network, however, will be ""like having a Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) ... but using it in your local village and you can't drive to up to 200 miles per hour, simply because the roads cannot maintain those speeds,"" explained Boris Metodiev, associate director of research firm Strategy Analytics.
Apple, which is expected to unveil the new phone at a virtual event on Tuesday, will need to walk a tightrope between enticing consumers to upgrade their phones while not over-promising what 5G can do today.
Current 5G U.S. networks mostly use low-band wireless spectrum, or airspace, that is slower than high-band spectrum, but more reliable over longer distances. It will likely take years before the massive speed boost phone carriers promise will make augmented reality and real-time cloud gaming seamless.
Several U.S. telecom operators have deployed networks based on lower spectrum bands, with slightly higher speeds than 4G. A noticeably faster variant of ""mid-band"" 5G is also being rolled out, but it is unlikely to reach three-quarters of Americans until 2025, estimated longtime Apple analyst Gene Munster of venture capitalist firm Loup Ventures. 
The fastest speeds touted by carriers are a type of 5G called millimeter Wave, or mmWave, that work over shorter distances.  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) has the largest current mmWave network, available only in limited areas.
Although Verizon 5G users could connect almost 10 times faster than on Sprint and T-Mobile, actual average speeds were far lower, according to research firm OpenSignal's mobile signal experience report in June.
On average, AT&T Inc and Verizon customers with 5G phones saw only a small bump up from 4G speeds, according to the same study.
In South Korea and in China, faster 5G networks are more pervasive. But Apple will be competing against local brands including Samsung (KS:005930) in South Korea, which is already on its second line of 5G phones, and China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, whose sales have surged after the telecom giant was banned in the United States.
The other big letdown is that applications using higher speeds to deliver something new have yet to be created. It is a chicken and egg problem at this part of the tech cycle, executives said, noting that interest in 4G was fueled by  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)'s mobile apps and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube.
""The applications we will be dazzled by, that will really take advantage of the network, will only be developed once the network and devices are available,"" said Morgan Kurk, chief technology officer of CommScope, a telecom equipment maker.
U.S. consumers most motivated to buy a 5G phone would be those who need a new smartphone right now and are looking to protect their investments.
""If you're buying a phone that you're going to have for three years, you're going to want to make sure that it's going to support the latest networks,"" said Geoff Blaber, vice president of research at CCS Insight.

Just know what to expect, Blaber added. ""There's going to be relatively little that you can do on a 5G iPhone you can't do on a 4G iPhone today.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Monday, with Big Tech megacaps buoyant after the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said that talks on a new system for taxing multinationals had failed to reach an agreement.
That leaves the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) free to carry on using their current tax minimization strategies for the foreseeable future, despite concerns on the part of regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.

Investors were showing an increased willingness to look through the short-term deadlock over stimulus talks in the U.S. and focus on the prospect of a more effective package being agreed in the new year under a new administration. Fears about the possibility that President Donald Trump may contest the election result if he loses have receded as a string of polls have shown him clearly behind rival Joe Biden, both nationally and - to a lesser extent - in key battleground states.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists argued in a note to clients that any such delay will hardly be fatal to the recovery, given that households appear to have been building up reserves over the summer. 
""It's possible that a stimulus delay wouldn’t fully develop into the economic challenge it has the potential to be,"" Morgan Stanley's Mike Zezas argued. ""Our economists now see evidence that U.S. consumption can carry on for longer without fiscal support, given built-up excess household savings. This is good news as there are many viable political paths towards stimulus over the next three months.""
Among individual stocks, the biggest gainers included cybersecurity firm Cloudflare (NYSE:NET), which rose 14% to a new all-time high after launching a new service that it claims will protect remote networks even against zero-day attacks.  Such services have gained in importance this year as the pandemic has forced the economy to adopt remote working.

1591,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 09:18AM ET</span>",Bond ETFs Go From Roughed-Up to Record Inflows Thanks to the Fed,"(Bloomberg) -- Things were looking pretty bleak back in March for bond exchange-traded funds. The Covid-19 selloff created a liquidity crunch that drove their prices to trade at deep discounts to the value of the underlying assets. Skeptics questioned whether these products could ever be trusted again.
Then the Federal Reserve stepped in. On March 23, it announced that that it would begin buying corporate debt ETFs. This ignited a wave of front-running investments and served as a stamp of approval for the market sector.
A thank-you note to Jerome Powell may be in order. Flows into U.S. fixed-income products this year have surpassed the total for all of last year. New funds are coming down the pipeline. And investors are increasingly using corporate bond ETFs to bet on an economic recovery and hedge against what could be a volatile post-election season.
“The events from the onset of the pandemic have only accelerated the growth of fixed-income ETFs,” said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
So far this year, inflows to bond funds total $166 billion, compared with $154 billion in all of 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Of course, another sharp downturn could reopen a chasm between bond ETF prices and their underlying assets, and the Fed’s eventual unwinding of its holdings might spur distress. But the central bank hasn’t given indications about its exit timeline, so purchases for fixed-income funds remain strong.
The Fed has bought 16 different corporate bond ETFs, with purchases peaking in June at $4.2 billion, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence. Investors anticipating the central bank’s moves added $28 billion to those products.
Two of the funds the Fed bought ended up topping the list of biggest sector gainers this year. BlackRock’s iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) is leading with $17.5 billion, while Vanguard’s Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCIT) has attracted $12.2 billion.
Even some without the Fed backing have seen stellar years. Vanguard’s Total Bond Market ETF (BND) and BlackRock’s iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) have added $12.1 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively.
“We’re already in record territory, and we’re likely to blow that record away, given the volatility headed into an election,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research for CFRA Research.
Novel Uses
Investors have been shoveling money into U.S. government and mortgage-backed bond ETFs in the past month, anticipating further choppiness from uncertainties over fiscal stimulus and the presidential election outcome. Other strategies for bond funds recently include shorting high-yield securities and hedging long positions.
“There’s a variety of ways they can be used in portfolios, and I think that helps to draw a more diverse investor base,” said Dave Perlman, ETF strategist for UBS Global Wealth Management.
These ETFs also enable clearer price discovery in the less-liquid bond markets and make it easier for investors to amass a diversified portfolio of specific types of securities.
“Institutional investors are getting more comfortable using ETFs to gain more targeted exposure” instead of buying individual bonds, Rosenbluth said.
This, in turn, has created a flurry of new funds. So far this year, 39 fixed-income ETFs have begun trading, compared with 38 at the same point last year and 37 in 2018. Two new ones in 2020 -- iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and Franklin Liberty U.S. Treasury Bond ETF (FLGV) -- have already attracted $890 million and $423 million respectively.
Fed Hangover
Yet the good times may have their limits. The Fed stopped buying bond ETFs in August. And early birds who bought ahead of the Fed could start profit-taking.
Corporate-bond products might see up to $30 billion in outflows in the next month or two, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. The category lost $3.2 billion in September, but has regained $6.1 billion in October so far.
And bond ETFs haven’t converted everyone. Some investors still prefer purchasing the individual bonds.
Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group, said that for high-quality bonds like Treasuries, he would rather just buy them directly, so he doesn’t have to worry about any fees. But he said that for complex formulas and diversifying holdings, the ETFs can come in handy.
“As you get into more credit risk or structure mortgages or prepay instruments, then I think ETFs can play a role,” he said.

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 09:05AM ET</span>","Investor PrimeStone urges LivaNova to shake up business, says share price could double","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Investment firm PrimeStone is pressing medical device maker  LivaNova PLC  (O:LIVN) to consider strategic options including selling parts of its business, refreshing its board and hiring a new finance chief, saying such steps could double its share price.
London-based PrimeStone said that years of underperformance required a new strategic direction and that the company should divest its Cardiopulmonary business, sell or close its Heart Valves business, and consider appointing a new board chairman and hiring a new chief financial officer, according to a letter the investment firm is sending to LivaNova's board on Monday.
PrimeStone said in the letter, which was seen by Reuters, that LivaNova's share price could ""more than double to $100"", adding: ""However, to get there, several changes need to take place.""
The investment firm is urging the company to focus on its Neuromodulation unit.
LivaNova did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
PrimeStone, founded by three former partners at private equity firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG), said in the letter that it owned roughly 2.2% of LivaNova. The investment has not been previously reported.
The investment firm said in the letter that it has been a patient investor. But it added that total shareholder return for LivaNova investors since 2015 has been -17% compared with a +171% for its peers during that period. 
Private negotiations between PrimeStone and LivaNova broke down in August, according to the letter, because LivaNova's board chairman wanted to reach a higher share price through ""beat and raise"" earnings releases.
LivaNova, which has a market capitalization of $2.4 billion, was created five years ago through a merger of Cyberonics and Storin. In the last 52 weeks, its share price has fallen 28%. It closed trading at $50.06 on Friday.
PrimeStone said in the letter that it expects other shareholders to support its suggestions that could ""help restore the Company's credibility and get it on the path of significant value creation.""

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 07:41AM ET</span>",Caterpillar bets on self-driving machines impervious to pandemics,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Question: How can a company like  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) try to counter a slump in sales of bulldozers and trucks during a pandemic that has made every human a potential disease vector?
Answer: Cut out human operators, perhaps?
Caterpillar's autonomous driving technology, which can be bolted on to existing machines, is helping the U.S. heavy equipment maker mitigate the heavy impact of the coronavirus crisis on sales of its traditional workhorses.
With both small and large customers looking to protect their operations from future disruptions, demand has surged for machines that don't require human operators on board.
Sales of Caterpillar's autonomous technology for mining operations have been growing at a double-digit percentage clip this year compared with 2019, according to previously unreported internal company data shared with Reuters.
By contrast, sales of its yellow bulldozers, mining trucks and other equipment have been falling for the past nine months, a trend that's also hit its main rivals including Japan's Komatsu Ltd (T:6301) and American player  Deere & Co  (N:DE).
Fred Rio, worldwide product manager at Caterpillar's construction digital & technology division, told Reuters that a remote-control technology, which allows users to operate machines from several miles away, would be available for construction sites in January.
The company is also working with space agencies to use satellite technology to allow an operator sitting in the United States to remotely communicate with machines on job sites in, say, Africa or elsewhere in the world, he said. 
Caterpillar's automation strategy was not born during the COVID-19 era, though. The company stepped up investments in such technologies as it emerged in 2017 from the longest downturn in its history, as part of a plan to increase recurring revenue from lucrative sales of services.
But it's early days, and such tech remains a niche part of Caterpillar's operations. Though it does not break out the revenue from technology sales, the rising demand is unlikely to make a major impact anytime soon on the group's revenue, which stood at about $54 billion last year.
It is also a costly endeavor with the company pumping billions into R&D as a whole. Yet it is not clear if demand for autonomous and remote tech will hold up in a post-pandemic world while, in the longer term, there is the risk that a technology-driven improvement in productivity could drive down sales of new equipment.
'IT HAS GOT CRAZIER'
Nonetheless, autonomous technology is helping Caterpillar win equipment deals from customers that were previously not buying a lot of its machines.
Last year,  Rio Tinto  (L:RIO) signed up the company to supply self-driving trucks, autonomous blast drills, loaders and other machines for the construction of the Koodaideri iron ore mine in Australia, which is expected to be operational next year. 
Rio Tinto declined to comment on the equipment deal.
The mining industry has already adopted some technologies for self-driving trucks and remote operation of load-haul-dump machines. However the suspension in activities worldwide following government-mandated lockdowns at the peak of COVID-19, as well as recent outbreaks of infections at coal mines in Poland, have accelerated the deployment of those technologies.
Anthony Cook, general manager for autonomous haulage systems at Caterpillar's rival Komatsu, said a lot of customers had brought forward their spending plans following the pandemic in a bid to take drivers out of mining trucks.
He said the COVID-19 crisis had not hit the fortunes of his autonomous business: ""If anything, it has got crazier.""
CATERPILLAR'S IN SPACE
Caterpillar and Komatsu hold the lion's share of the global autonomous haulage system market worldwide. 
But Illinois-based Caterpillar has a competitive advantage, according to some analysts, as its technology can be retrofitted onto competitors' equipment, making it a better fit for mixed fleets. Komatsu's technology currently only works with its own machines.
Komatsu's Cook said that while retrofitting offered a short-term solution, his company was developing technology to allow different brands of equipment to operate together ""safely and efficiently"", which he added would offer long-term benefits.
But Jim  Hawkins  (NASDAQ:HWKN), general manager at Caterpillar's resource industries division, said the ability to retrofit had helped drive up sales, because mining companies can buy the hardware and software to make machines operate autonomously without paying the much larger cost of overhauling their whole fleet. 
That is a selling point at a time when miners are grappling with the virus-induced business uncertainty.
Caterpillar sells autonomous operation technology separately from its machines. While retrofitting existing fleets has been the biggest driver for growth until now, Hawkins says an increasing number of customers are now ordering autonomous-ready mining trucks.
The company charges mining customers a hardware fee, a software fee and recurring licensing fee. In all, the technology could cost from $50 million to hundreds of millions of dollars, depending upon the size of the fleet and the duration of the contract, Hawkins said.
All these applications are part of the company's endeavor to increases services revenue, which tends to be more resilient and profitable than equipment sales. It aims to increase services sales to $28 billion by 2026 from $18 billion in 2019.
Rob Wertheimer, machinery analyst at Melius Research, said the need for mining companies to replace an aging mining fleet and their growing demand for autonomous upgrades should help Caterpillar, with its tech giving it a ""differential"" advantage over rivals.

""Strategically, they are in a better place,"" he added.

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Goldman Sachs financial targets jeopardized as pandemic slows revamp,"By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) management is considering whether to scale back financial targets set earlier this year, as the coronavirus pandemic has hindered the bank's business model revamp, analysts and sources inside the bank told Reuters.
Goldman unveiled plans to boost returns on equity and cut costs during its first-ever investor day in January. To reach its goals, Goldman would squeeze more revenue from existing businesses like wealth management as well as relatively new ones like consumer lending, while launching additional corporate services like cash management.
Since then, the pandemic has slammed into the economy, crippling loan demand and causing widespread unemployment. It has also prevented Goldman bankers from drumming up business with new customers the way they could before coronavirus lockdowns.
Although Goldman's trading revenue has soared thanks to market volatility, other initiatives have stalled.
""Unless there's a silver bullet vaccine cure, it looks like Goldman will not hit its targets,"" said Viola Risk Advisors bank analyst David Hendler. ""It's behind on wealth management and it's behind on consumer.""
A spokesman for Goldman referred Reuters to executives' prior statements but declined to comment further.
Goldman Sachs executives have stood by their targets, stressing that the path to achieving them in the coming years would not be ""linear."" They are not expected to move the goalposts on Wednesday when the bank reports third-quarter results.
Instead, the bank may change targets in January, a year after they were set, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly.
As it stands, Goldman pledged to produce a return on tangible common shareholders' equity (ROTE) of more than 14% by 2023, compared with 10.6% in 2019. 
The bank also outlined plans to cut expenses by $1.3 billion over that time frame, producing an efficiency ratio of 60% compared with 68.1% in 2019. A lower efficiency ratio means a company is better at managing costs relative to revenue.
Failing to hit the targets would deal a blow to Chief Executive David Solomon, who has pledged to make Goldman Sachs look more like a conventional bank. However, analysts already anticipate target revisions and say there is little Solomon could do about the financial consequences of the pandemic.
Analyst estimates for Goldman's ROTE do not exceed 12% in the coming years, and the consensus for its efficiency ratio is 63.2% by 2024, suggesting a lack of confidence in the bank's targets, UBS analyst Brennan Hawken noted in a recent report.
So far this year, Goldman has had to delay the launch of a new digital wealth management initiative and slow hiring of private wealth advisors in response to the pandemic. The bank also slowed loan growth in the consumer division and set aside more money for loans that could go bad.
Helping Goldman's profits, analysts expect trading revenue to stay aloft through year-end and for the bank to see cost-cutting benefits in 2021.
Goldman has been automating more roles and recently said it was laying off a ""modest"" number of staff, primarily in back-office functions. Automation is likely to accelerate as the pandemic continues, leading to more job cuts, the sources said.
Although Goldman may miss its pre-pandemic targets, Odeon Capital analyst Dick Bove thinks Solomon is pursuing the correct strategy in shaping Goldman more like a conventional bank.

""Overall, this company is moving in the right direction at the right time,"" he said.

1596,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Edge Higher; Banks to Lead Earnings Season,"By Peter Nurse
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening slightly higher Monday, continuing the recent positive tone as investors remain focused on the possibility of new stimulus - albeit possibly after the election - as the new earnings season approaches
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT),S&P 500 Futures traded 15 points, or 0.5%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 19 points, or 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 157 points, or 1.3%.
These cash stock indices are coming off a three-day win streak, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, for example, turning positive year-to-date for the first time since Sept. 2.
President Donald Trump on Sunday called on Congress to pass a scaled down coronavirus relief package, suggesting the redirecting of unused funding from a small-business lifeline to help the likes of the airlines. This comes after Senate Republicans as well as House Democrats objected to the new comprehensive offer from his administration over the weekend.
This piecemeal approach is unlikely to gain traction. But opinion polls point to a Democratic sweep in the November elections, and this is giving markets confidence that stimulus will be forthcoming at some point, if not immediately.
The U.S. corporate earnings season gets underway this week. After second-quarter earnings results came in better than expected, there are some relatively positive forecasts for this next quarter.
The big banks will lead the way, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) both due to release results on Tuesday, followed by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) later in the week. Key here will be whether the banks continue to rack up loan loss provisions at the same pace as in July.
Also in the corporate sector, the tech sector will be in focus following a report in the Financial Times that European Union regulators are drawing up a list of up to 20 large internet companies, likely to include the U.S. tech giants, that will face new and tougher rules aimed at curbing their market power.
This is likely to be a big week for the tech sector, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) expected to launch its 5G iPhone 12 on Tuesday and Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Day occurring on Oct. 13-14. 
Oil prices weakened Monday as supply risks subsided. Output was restored in Norway, the world's third largest exporter of oil and gas, with the end of a strike. Production is expected to resume shortly at Libya's biggest oilfield, while U.S. producers have also begun pumping again after Hurricane Delta moved inland at reduced intesity.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% lower at $40.09 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.1% to $42.38. Both contracts gained more than 9% last week.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,925.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1795.

Investing.com -- Stimulus talks remain deadlocked as Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearings take center stage. Europe plots new regulations for Big Tech, China stops the yuan's rally and oil falls as Norway's strike ends and Hurricane Delta passes. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, October 12th.
1. Stimulus stalls as ACB hearings begin
Talks between House Democrats and the Trump administration on a package of economic relief measures remained deadlocked over the weekend, making it less and less likely that a deal can be found before the election.
The stimulus talks are now having to fight for limited political resources with the confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barratt, President Trump’s pick to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court.
White House economic advisor Larry Ludlow told CBS at the weekend that “I don’t think the recovery is dependent on it.”
Investors now appear to be betting more on a stimulus package being passed in January under a new administration.
2. Europe plots new move against Big Tech
The European Union is drawing up a list of Big Tech companies that it intends to subject to increased regulation, to stop them abusing their market power, according to the Financial Times.
The report suggests a new line of attack on the big Internet platforms, aimed at curbing their power without having to prove that they have broken existing laws. The change of tack comes after Europe’s top court struck down a landmark ruling against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) by the European Commission’s antitrust directorate general.
According to the FT, the new rules will force companies such as Apple, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to share data with rivals and oblige them to be more transparent on how they gather information.
“Big platforms are invasive, they pay little tax and they destroy competition. This is not the internet we wanted,” it quoted one official involved as saying.
3. Stocks set for mixed opening
U.S. stock markets are set to open mixed, with modest losses in the Dow and marked gains in tech stocks.
By 6:20 AM ET (1020 GMT), Dow futures were down 17 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 Futures were up 0.3% and NASDAQ Futures were up 1.1%.
Stocks in focus later are likely to include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), whose iPhone launch event takes place on Tuesday.
Airline and other travel stock may also get a lift from weekend reports that the U.S. and U.K. aim to lighten quarantine requirements for transatlantic travelers in time for the holiday season.
4. China moves to stop yuan rally
China moved to put the brakes on the yuan’s rally by lightening restrictions on betting against the currency. The dollar rose 0.8% against the offshore yuan in response to 6.7460
The People’s Bank of China said on Saturday that, as of today, banks no longer need to deposit 20% of their sales when trading currency forwards denominated in U.S. dollars for clients.
The yuan hit a 17-month high against the dollar on Friday, after completing its strongest quarterly performance in 12 years. That was part of an overall move lower by the dollar that has only reversed a little in weekend trading. 
5. Oil falls as supply constraints ease
Oil prices fell as Norwegian offshore workers ended a strike that had threatened to take a quarter of the country’s output offline, while producers in the Gulf of Mexico also tentatively restarted production as Hurricane Delta moved inland.
More downward pressure on prices came from the news that war-torn Libya had restarted production at its biggest field, El Sharara, which produces up to 300,000 barrels a day. Actual output is likely to be much less in the coming days, however.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>","U.S. bank stocks are fine, if you are rich in patience","By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - The U.S. bank sector has been pummeled this year but investors hunting for bargains there may need deep reserves of patience as banks are particularly sensitive to low interest rates, the uneven economic recovery and the muddy stimulus outlook.
The S&P 500 Bank subsector , which kicks off its third-quarter earnings season on Oct. 13, was last down 33.7% for the year-to-date compared with a 5.8% gain for the S&P 500 index. 
Banks have been such a drag on the broader S&P financial index that its 19% year-to-date decline is second only to energy's 49.9% drop among the S&P 11 major sectors.
To be sure, if lawmakers in Washington manage to reach an agreement, a new fiscal stimulus package could help banks if it boosts U.S. loan growth, interest rates and economic activity. 
And the bank index is up 12% from its intraday trough on Sept. 2 to a peak on Oct. 6 as yields for longer-dated U.S. treasuries have risen with stimulus hopes as banks profit from higher interest rates.
But investors are unconvinced that recent gains will be sustainable as the Federal Reserve has signaled plans to keep overnight rates low for the foreseeable future in order to aid an economic recovery, which is expected to take years. 
“You’re looking at years for this sector to make a full recovery. It will take a lot of positive things to happen in the U.S. economy for it to get back to the type of performance we are seeing in the broader S&P,"" said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""Investors, in my view, will need to be patient.""
Banks were outperforming the market on Thursday on renewed hopes for stimulus pact after U.S. President Donald Trump said, without giving details, that there was a good chance of a deal. 
But as of Thursday afternoon there was no deal although U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were set to continue with talks.
Meckler says further stimulus would be ""a good first step towards a better environment for (banks) to generate top-line and bottom-line growth.""
But he does not see stimulus as a panacea to provide much change to low interest rates, low borrowing and weak credit, which has plagued the sector.
Money manager Villere & Co has been drawn by low valuations in bank stocks such as First Hawaiian (NASDAQ:FHB) Inc, down 44% year-to-date, and  Kearny Financial  (NASDAQ:KRNY) Corp, off 41% so far in 2020.
Lamar Villere, co-portfolio manager, says these banks are small enough that he can more easily examine their risks than the exposures of more geographically diverse and larger banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co or  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co . 
But even this cautious strategy is only suitable for those who can ""wait it out long term,"" said Villere who expects weaker results from the sector in the short and intermediate term. 
""What's baked in is some pretty terrible numbers,"" he said.
JPMorgan and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) will start the ball rolling on the third-quarter earnings season on Oct. 13 followed by Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) the next day. 
On average the S&P 500 bank sector is expected to show a third-quarter earnings decline of 31% and a revenue decline of 6.7%, according to estimates gathered by Refinitiv. 
The majority of big U.S. banks did manage to beat very low earnings per share and revenue expectations for the second quarter, according to Refinitiv. 
But for now, John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio is staying away from the sector citing weak net interest margins. 
""Banks need to deliver this quarter,"" Augustine said.

1601,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 05:54AM ET</span>",StockBeat: ECB Tells Banks to Get Ready for a Wave of Bad Loans,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s top bank supervisor sounds like the man who wasn’t too careful about what he wished for, because it’s now come true.
Andrea Enria, who heads the European Central Bank’s supervisory board, sounded an alarm bell in an interview published on Monday warning the banks under his institution to make sure they put out some credible loan loss estimates when they issue their quarterly updates over the next few weeks.
He also hinted heavily that unless he was satisfied that banks were making realistic assessments of their loan books, the ECB will be forced to extend its deeply unpopular ban on dividend payments and stock buybacks beyond the end of the year. That factor has weighed heavily on the share prices of banks, such as Italy’s Unicredit (MI:CRDI), that had prepared generous payouts before the pandemic struck. The ban has been one reason why the Stoxx 600 Banks has been one of the worst performing sub-indexes in the market this year, losing 39% year-to-date. It rose 0.4% on Monday, in line with the broader market.
In an extreme case, Enria told the German newspaper Handelsblatt, Eurozone banks could face up to 1.4 trillion euros ($1.7 trillion) in bad loans resulting from the pandemic. He added that it’s “too early to rule out such a scenario.”
Enria’s message underlines a shift in policy that has gradually taken shape over the summer. Regulators’ first instinct was to avoid a credit crunch that would unnecessarily make the economic damage worse. They consequently relaxed bank capital standards and softened the guidelines for measuring bad loans. Eurozone banks responded in the summer with a wave of generic writedowns of things like goodwill, but booked relatively few specific loan loss provisions.
Given that this is the euro zone, where the last bad loan crisis has hardly been cleaned up, this was not a state of affairs that could last for long.  
Enria’s changed messaging is thus a signal to banks that it’s alright to start pulling the plug, especially on companies for whom the pandemic is accelerating an end that was already likely.
“The banks should take an honest look at their loan books and see, which of their customers will survive the crisis,“ Enria said.
Indeed, he stressed, they need to start building provisions now, “so that the wave of bad loans doesn’t get too big.”
Interestingly, Enria declined an open invitation to press strongly for the creation of a Eurozone 'bad bank', or 'asset management company' as he preferred to call it, to deal with the coming wave of bad loans.
""A network of national asset management companies can function well,"" he suggested.
Enria has been a strong advocate for a region-wide institute in the past, but bumped into stubborn resistance from a number of countries across the continent.

BEIJING (Reuters) - General Motors Co (GM) (N:GM) on Monday said continued market recovery from the COVID-19 crisis helped its China vehicle sales grow 12% on year in July-September, marking the Detroit automaker's first Chinese quarterly sales growth in two years.
The second-biggest foreign automaker in China by units - after Germany's Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) - said on Monday it delivered 771,400 vehicles in China in the third quarter. That followed a 5% fall in the second quarter, when parts of China were still emerging from virus-busting lockdown measures.
GM has a Shanghai-based joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104) making Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac vehicles. It has another venture, SGMW, with SAIC and Guangxi Automobile Group, producing no-frills mini-vans and which has started manufacturing higher-end cars.
Sales rose 26% for cars under its mass-market Buick brand in the third quarter versus the same period a year earlier, while those of premium brand Cadillac jumped 28%, GM said in a statement. Sales of its mass-market Chevrolet marque fell 20%.
Sales of no-frills brand Wuling grew 26%, whereas those of mass-market Baojun vehicles tumbled 19%.
""GM's compact models returned to four-cylinder engines and that helped sales growth,"" said LMC Automotive senior analyst Alan Kang, referring to an attempt to market cleaner but noisier three-cylinder versions. ""Cadillac also has a more complete lineup this year.""
China's biggest automakers' association expects overall car sales to grow by double digits in July-September versus a year earlier. Makers such as Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175) saw sales jump in the just-finished quarter.
GM has seen its China sales suffer in a crowded market and slowing economy. To revive its fortunes, it plans to have electric vehicles (EVs) make up over 40% of new models in the next five years in China, where the government promotes greener cars. 
The automaker's Wuling Hong Guang MINI EV, a micro two-door EV with a starting price of 28,800 yuan ($4,200), was China's biggest-selling EV in August.

GM's sales fell 15% in 2019 from a year earlier to 3.09 million vehicles. The automaker delivered 3.65 million vehicles in 2018 and 4.04 million in 2017.

1603,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 05:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: TikTok rival Triller explores deal to go public - sources,"By Joshua Franklin and Echo Wang
(Reuters) - Triller Inc, a budding competitor to popular short-video app TikTok, is in discussions with blank-check acquisition companies about a merger which would take the U.S. social media company public, according to people familiar with the matter.
The deal would come as Triller seeks to capitalize on TikTok's woes. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has ordered TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance to divest the app, citing concerns that the data of U.S. citizens could be accessible to China's Communist Party government. TikTok has sued the U.S. government to stave off a ban from U.S. app stores while deal negotiations continue.
Triller, which was launched in 2015 and only has a fraction of the 100 million users that TikTok boasts in the United States, has said it hopes that the uncertainty over its rival's future will drive more influencers and users to its platform.
Triller is working with investment bank Farvahar Partners as it negotiates a potential deal with a so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC), the sources said. A SPAC is a shell company that raises money in an initial public offering (IPO) to merge with a privately held company which then becomes publicly traded as a result. 
Triller's SPAC negotiations are happening alongside discussions with investors about a private fundraising round, led by investment bank UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG), in which the Los Angeles-based company is seeking to raise around $250 million, the sources said.
Triller has so far secured around $100 million in that round at a $1.25 billion valuation, according to the sources. It is deliberating whether to proceed with the private fundraising or opt for the deal with a SPAC, one of the sources added.
The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. 
Farvahar Partners and UBS did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
SPACs have emerged as a popular IPO alternative for companies this year, providing a path to going public with less regulatory scrutiny and more certainty over the valuation that will be attained and funds that will be raised. U.S. SPACs have raised $53.8 billion so far in 2020 through IPOs, more than the total raised in the prior seven years, according to industry tracker SPAC Research. 
Triller said earlier this year it had 65 million monthly active users on its short video app, although many analytics companies have said they have not been provided enough access to independently verify Triller's figures.
Triller's celebrity users include musicians Alicia Keys, Cardi B and Eminem, and its financial backers include Kendrick Lamar and The Weeknd.
Triller is owned by media industry veteran Ryan Kavanaugh and healthcare executive Bobby Sarnevesht. Kavanaugh in 2004 founded U.S. film studio Relativity Media LLC, whose films included the award-winning ""The Fighter"". The studio ended up filing for bankruptcy twice, in 2015 and 2018.
Sarnevesht was a partner at Bay Area Surgical Management, which lost a $37.4 million legal battle against  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET) after the health insurance firm alleged in 2012 that it had been defrauded by the surgery centers operator. 
BID FOR TIKTOK
Triller sued TikTok in July, alleging it infringed its patent for stitching together multiple music videos with a single audio track. 
In August, Triller said it had partnered with investment firm Centricus Asset Management Ltd in a bid for TikTok. ByteDance, however, said it was not engaged in such discussions. 
Trump last month said he had given his preliminary blessing to a deal that would give a 20% stake in TikTok to computer networking conglomerate  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. The negotiations subsequently stalled, as ByteDance maintained it would keep an 80% stake in TikTok, rather than distribute it to its investors. 

TikTok is widely popular with U.S. teenagers, though its advertising business is still nascent. Major companies, including Procter & Gamble Co, Danone and  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) told Reuters last week they would keep spending on advertising with TikTok despite the uncertainty over its future.

MUMBAI/DUBAI (Reuters) - Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty has filed a complaint with federal investigative agencies in India seeking a probe into two former top executives of his companies and two Indian banks related to a multibillion dollar financial scandal engulfing his group.
Several companies linked to Shetty, including top United Arab Emirates hospital operator NMC Health PLC and payments firm  Finablr  PLC (L:FINF), have come under severe financial strain this year after short-seller Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) questioned NMC's financials.
At issue, Muddy Waters said, were questions about NMC's asset purchase prices and capital expenditures, which it said were both inflated.
NMC and Finablr subsequently announced far higher debts than they had previously reported.
Shetty's 55-page complaint, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, accuses the former chief executives of NMC and Finablr, along with their associates and bankers, of inflating the companies' balance sheets, arranging ""illegal"" credit facilities and misappropriating funds since 2012.
It calls on India's federal police, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) - India's financial crime fighting agency - to investigate. 
The complaint, with more than 100 pages of supporting documents, indicates it was also sent to India's prime minister's office, central bank and other investigative agencies.
A spokesman for the two former CEOs, brothers Prasanth and Promoth Manghat, rejected Shetty's allegations, saying he had significant control over the running of NMC after stepping aside as CEO in 2017 and that he or his family remained on the boards of companies including Finablr.
""These unfounded allegations against Prasanth Manghat and Promoth Manghat are a clumsy attempt to distract attention away from the skills and real value added by them to the success of NMC, Finablr ... and Shetty's own role in what has taken place,"" the spokesman said in an emailed statement.
Bank of Baroda and Federal Bank, the Indian lenders named in Shetty's complaint, did not respond to Reuters request for comment. 
The CBI, ED and prime minister's office did not respond to requests for comment. India's central bank declined to comment.
London's High Court placed NMC into administration in April after it reported debts of $6.6 billion. UK-listed Finablr said in March it was preparing for potential insolvency and warned a month later it might have nearly $1 billion more in debt than previously reported.
In a news conference on Wednesday, NMC's administrators Alvarez & Marsal said its investigation team was working with legal advisers to develop a strategy to recover losses, likely to be in the billions of dollars, and obtain compensation for damage incurred by NMC as a result of the alleged fraud.
Finablr's CEO Bhairav Trivedi told Reuters last week the company continues to cooperate with all relevant authorities that are investigating potential wrongdoing by former management, advisors and bankers of the company.
Shetty, now in India and himself facing a criminal complaint in Abu Dhabi, is fighting court cases in India and Dubai as banks seek to recover loans from his companies. In April, the UAE central bank ordered banks to freeze accounts of Shetty and his family, sources told Reuters.
""We have submitted every shred of evidence into that complaint, which, if anybody examines, will clearly conclude that Dr Shetty is innocent and that all of that has happened under his nose - unfortunately, behind his back,"" Shetty's lawyer Zulfiquar Memon of MZM Legal told Reuters.

Memon said the complaint was filed after a month-long internal investigation and the investigating agencies are examining the complaint.

LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Global stocks hit five-week highs on Monday led by China's post-holiday surge as investors bet on a steady recovery for the world's no. 2 economy, but worries about rising COVID-19 infections capped gains in Europe and the United States.
European countries were considering adding fresh travel curbs due to rising coronavirus, a contrast to Asia-Pacific countries including Singapore, Australia and Japan, where a gradual easing of some international travel restrictions was under way.
Still, U.S. and European markets were a tad higher as investors hoped for coronavirus aid in the United States, with the Trump administration on Sunday calling on Congress to pass a stripped-down relief bill.
European stocks and U.S. stock futures rose 0.2%. FTSE 100 and sterling meanwhile were wobbly ahead of a Brexit summit later in the week.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1% to 2-1/2-year highs, buoyed by a 3% gain in Chinese blue chips and a 2.2% rise by Hong Kong's Hang Seng index.
China has returned from an eight-day Mid-Autumn festival with investors encouraged by a robust rebound in tourism and ebbing coronavirus cases.
""If capital is moving on relative growth rates, then China is looking quite attractive,"" said Chris Weston, head of research brokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne. Equities are cheap, yields advantageous and the outlook solid, he said.
""From a virus perspective as well, we're seeing concerns in Europe, while China is considered a quasi-safe haven.""
Chinese stocks were also boosted by rising chances of Joe Biden's victory in the U.S. presidential election -- an administration seen less likely to incline toward tariffs and trade disputes. 
Chinese blue chips have gained 17% this year, compared with an almost 8% gain by the S&P 500. Foreigners' buying of Chinese government bonds hit its fastest pace in more than two years last month.
""The economic fallout of COVID-19 has accelerated the relative decline of the U.S. as the world's economic engine,"" said ANZ chief economist Richard Yetsenga. ""It is also increasing the centrality of Asia - and particularly, of China.""
U.S. markets are also gearing up for the earnings season. Major Wall Street banks including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citi and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) poised to report later this week.
YUAN WOBBLES

The People's Bank of China has scrapped a requirement for banks to hold a reserve of yuan forward contracts, removing a guard against depreciation.
The yuan is up more than 7% since late May and had shot higher on Friday as investors wagered that a Joe Biden presidency would drive smoother Sino-U.S. relations. It last sat at 6.7115 per dollar in onshore trade. [CNY/]
""We continue to expect a stronger yuan on the back of our expectation of solid Chinese growth and favourable interest rate differentials between China and the U.S.,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' analysts said in a note, with a 12-month yuan forecast at 6.50. 
The euro edged 0.1% lower to $1.1819 and the yen firmed to 105.54 per dollar. The kiwi dipped 0.1% with the softer yuan to sit at $0.6661.
In commodity markets, oil prices were back under pressure after the resolution of an oilworkers strike in Norway and the resumption of production after a storm in the Gulf of Mexico. [O/R]

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>","Daimler, Swiss Re launch mobility insurance venture","FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Swiss Re  (S:SRENH) and carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) announced a joint automotive and mobility insurance venture on Monday, seeking to tap into a wealth of new data generated by highly automated vehicles to help insurers to calculate risk. 
The reinsurer and Daimler, parent of the Mercedes-Benz passenger car brand, set up Movinx, a Berlin-based intermediary they will co-own equally, the companies said in a statement. 
As connected and autonomous cars generate live data about traffic flows, vehicle reflexes and driver behaviour, the companies expect new opportunities will arise to customise automotive and mobility insurance products. 
""Even before cars come off the manufacturing line, we know the specific features and how that car would react in an emergency situation and we can provide a score to insurance partners to better underwrite the risk,"" said Pravina Ladva, Swiss Re’s digital transformation officer.
Swiss Re already offers to price risk by looking at the number of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) fitted to a car, calculating a car's capability under various traffic conditions considering safety as well as the cost of repairs. 
Daimler, which has spent decades refining advanced driver assistance systems, sees an opportunity for monetizing its know-how about vehicle safety.
Ingo Telschow, chief executive of Daimler Insurance Services, said his company was ""going deeper into the value chain of insurance business, having more influence on product development and pricing.”
Aside from technological advances in the area of automated and connected vehicles, customer behaviour is also shifting from long-term ownership to short-term usage, creating new insurance challenges in the area of pricing and claims handling.
Movinx will position itself as a so-called Managing General Agent (MGA) to help insurers introduce new products across a range of currently fragmented markets, using a new jointly owned risk technology platform. 
The first insurance products and services are planned to launch in France in 2021. In the coming years, further market entries are planned across Europe, in the Americas and in Asia.
“We want to offer products for people who use car sharing for minutes, or long-term insurance, or cover for rental, or subscription. Movinx will start with a motor insurance focus and explore mobility elements to enhance the respective solutions,"" Daimler's Telschow said.

The joint venture will be open for cooperation with car manufacturers or mobility service providers, the two companies said in their statement.

Investing.com - European stock markets largely edged higher Monday, helped by renewed M&A talk as well as bullish brokerage upgrades amid uncertainty over the U.S. stimulus package and continued worries about the Covid-19 autumn surge.
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.2%. 
Market attention continues to be focused on the prolonged U.S. political negotiations over a new coronavirus relief bill, with the passage of such a deal still up in the air. 
The Trump administration proposed a new comprehensive $1.8 trillion stimulus deal on Friday, but this immediately ran into opposition on both sides of the political divide. Although this offer moved closer to the $2.2 trillion proposition House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had already put on the table, it was still not sufficient to appease the Democrats, while it also annoyed some Republicans, many of whom are reluctant to add to a growing federal debt pile. 
That said, many are now looking past this administration, with polls showing Democrat candidate Joe Biden increasing his lead in the presidential election. Investors are increasingly expecting a Democrat-run White House, which should result in a large stimulus package.
""The prospects for stimulus in January look good,"" said Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, in a morning note. ""The prospects for stimulus before the election are fading again, though they have not disappeared entirely.""
Also helping was some corporate news, with KPN (AS:KPN) stock soaring 8.1% after Bloomberg reported that private-equity group EQT (NYSE:EQT) was considering a takeover offer for the Dutch telecom.
Additionally,  Societe Generale  (OTC:SCGLY) SA (PA:SOGN rose 3.1% after Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) upgraded the French bank to buy from hold, while  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) climbed 1.5% as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded the automaker to buy from sell.
However, the coronavirus remains a thorn in the side of European markets: Italy is preparing new nationwide restrictions in response to a spike in new cases, and Germany is also considering this possibility. 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce new measures to tackle a growing crisis on Monday, outlining three alert levels aimed at helping tailor restrictions for different parts of England. Johnson addresses the House of Commons at 10:30 AM ET (1430 GMT).
Oil prices weakened Monday, as output was restored in Norway, the world's third largest exporter of oil and gas, with the end of a strike. U.S. producers also began pumping again after Hurricane Delta weakened.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% lower at $39.98 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.4% to $42.24. Both contracts gained more than 9% last week, the biggest weekly rise for Brent since June.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,931.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1820.

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 03:40AM ET</span>",New IAG boss appoints Aer Lingus' Doyle as BA CEO,"By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - Luis Gallego, who took over as CEO of IAG (L:ICAG) last month, stamped his mark on the airlines group on Monday by promoting Aer Lingus boss Sean Doyle to lead British Airways, replacing Alex Cruz with immediate effect.
It was one of a number of management changes announced by the Anglo-Spanish airlines group and marks a return to BA for Doyle, who worked as director of network, fleet and alliances before leaving for Aer Lingus in 2019.
Cruz had been BA boss since 2016 and will stay on as its non-executive chairman for a transition period, IAG said.
Doyle faces a huge challenge at BA, which like all airlines, is struggling due to low levels of flying during the pandemic.
IAG last month raised 2.74 billion euros ($3.24 billion) to reduce its debt and help it survive the pandemic.
""We're navigating the worst crisis faced in our industry and I'm confident these internal promotions will ensure IAG is well placed to emerge in a strong position,"" Gallego said in a statement. 
The last few months have been tough for Cruz who was tasked with driving through 13,000 job cuts at BA, making him a frequent target of trade union hostility.
Gallego, who had been boss of IAG airline Iberia, pipped Cruz to the IAG top job earlier this year, replacing Willie Walsh.
Gallego and Cruz previously worked together at Spanish airline Vueling, now also owned by IAG. 
Analysts suggested that a number of high-profile blunders at BA under Cruz, including a data breach for which it was fined $230 million in 2019, and an IT failure in 2017 which left tens of thousands of passengers stranded, would not have helped his cause. 
Cruz was also at the helm last year when BA pilots went on strike for the first time, costing the airline more than 137 million euros. 
IAG said Fernando Candela, CEO of its airline Level, would take on the new role of group chief transformation officer.
It named Aer Lingus' Donal Moriarty as interim CEO at the Irish carrier and said a permanent replacement would be announced in due course.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The customers of software group SAP (DE:SAPG) are suffering severe declines in revenue and earnings while at the same time facing intensifying pressure to hike IT spending to go digital, a survey showed on Monday.
The poll of SAP's German-speaking user community found that nearly three-quarters were experiencing sharp drops in revenue. At the same time, over four-fifths said the coronavirus pandemic made digital transformation a more pressing task.
""At the centre of this crisis is the need for businesses to do more with less,"" said Marco Lenck, chairman of the German-speaking DSAG user group that commissioned the survey.
The DSAG, which represents 3,700 businesses, is an influential lobby that has called on SAP to make it easier to upgrade systems traditionally hosted on site to run in remote datacentres.
Such cloud hosting makes it easier for firms to scale up or pare back their business process operations in line with need. But the initial cost and difficulty of making that move deters many.
SAP's new CEO, Christian Klein, welcomed the DSAG survey's findings, which he said were representative of how the group's global business was performing.
Klein told a joint briefing with the DSAG that SAP had taken on board calls to improve integration between its four main processes: sales, procurement, human resources and supply chain management.
Work on creating a common data model, user interface and consistent security and identity management in these four areas was now 57% complete, he said. By the end of the year, 90% of the job will be done.
Klein also said that, given the cost pressures that some clients were facing, for example in the airlines sector, SAP was offering flexible payment terms to help ride out the economic slump.
""We expect the transformation in the IT and technology sectors to gather pace and that demand will rise,"" he said. ""We are of course offering targeted support to those customers in economic difficulty - we want long-term client relationships.""

1612,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>","As globe gallops into vaccine trials, insurers remain unfazed","By Noor Zainab Hussain, Carolyn Cohn and Ludwig Burger
LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The world is racing towards a vaccine in record time, stirring public concerns about safety to the extent that nine leading developers have felt compelled to issue a pledge to uphold scientific standards and testing rigour.
Yet, while more than 40 experimental COVID-19 vaccines are being tested on humans, the insurance companies with decades of experience in assessing the risks of clinical trials don't see anything to be unduly concerned about.
Executives at insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) and brokers Gallagher and Marsh, among the leading players in clinical trials insurance, told Reuters that premiums had only marginally increased so far in the current pandemic. 
They argued there was little structural difference to trials carried out in the past, despite drugmakers around the world competing to shatter the fastest time in history for developing a vaccine, which stands at around four years. 
""Rates have been relatively stable. Even this year we have so far seen only moderate price increases on average, with higher price jumps for particularly exposed COVID-19 trials,"" said Mark Piazzi, senior underwriter liability at Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty (AGCS).
This was echoed by David Briggs, managing director, life sciences practice at Gallagher, who said every trial was rated on its methods and the kinds of patients involved.
Gallagher said premiums in Britain, for example, started at about 5,000 pounds ($6,500) per trial. 
Total claims limits in policies were typically set at roughly $6-12 million, depending on the country's rules, according to several insurance companies interviewed by Reuters. 
In Britain, for instance, claim limits were usually set at no lower than 5 million pounds, while in Germany the figure was around 10 million euros ($11.8 million). 
'LOSS EXPERIENCE NOT DRAMATIC'
However part of the reason why premiums have not risen as sharply as some people might have expected is that claims from trial are generally uncommon, according to executives. This is because patients have often signed so-called informed consent agreements, they said.
Jim Walters, managing director of Life Sciences & Chemical Group at broker Aon (NYSE:AON), said such agreements outlined the risks that patients were taking by participating in the trial.
""So, you know, everything from you could have a sore spot on your arm. To you could potentially die. And you know, they would literally go that far in some of these protocols,"" he added. 
""Those generally tend to hold up in courts and in legal systems around the world. That means that the loss experience coming out of clinical trials is not very dramatic.""
Claims are often limited to circumstances linked to the improper conduct of trials or any wrongdoing, rather than side-effects of the treatment, executives said. 
Such have been the worries about the vaccine race among some members of the public, who fear safety standards could slip, that nine developers issued a joint pledge last month to ""uphold the integrity of the scientific process"".
ASTRAZENECA TRIAL SUSPENSION
AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) and Oxford University's suspension of global Phase III trials of their experimental COVID-19 vaccine early last month due to a participant's illness brought the risk of side effects in clinical trials to the public fore.
But the insurers said such delays were not unexpected, and could even reflect the extra caution of vaccine developers given the lack of data about COVID-19.
""Side effects always happen with clinical trials, but these are typically mild and expected. It is not very common to delay or suspend trials, it does happen though,"" said Piazzi at AGCS, whose main peers in underwriting trials include Chubb (NYSE:CB), HDI and Fairfax's Newline. 
""Pharma companies and insurers alike are even more careful than usual with COVID-19 trials because there is so much at stake, particularly for the patients' safety.""
All trials of the vaccine candidate have resumed, with the exception of the U.S. study. 
There have been examples in recent memory of drug trials going catastrophically wrong, though.
In 2016, for instance, one participant died and five were hospitalised in a Phase I trial run by French company Biotrial in the city of Rennes, testing an experimental mood brightener made by Portuguese drugmaker Bial. 
In 2006, six patients required intensive care after receiving a potential treatment against leukaemia and auto-immune disease in London. One was described as looking like ""the elephant man"" after his head swelled. Another lost fingertips and toes. Germany's TeGenero, the initial developer of the medicine, folded.
But insurance executives stress such disasters are rare, given the thousands of clinical drug trials being carried out every year.
Walters of Aon, speaking about the 2016 trial, said it was ""obviously a horrible situation"". 

""But that's one of very few incidents of really bad loss experience that the industry has faced. So, clinical trial insurance is not hugely expensive. Let's put it that way.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese trading house Mitsui & Co Ltd (T:8031) plans to sell its remaining stakes in coal-fired power stations by the end of the decade as it shifts to gas from coal to help achieve its 2050 net zero emission target, its chief executive told Reuters.
""We still own stakes in coal-fired plants in Indonesia, China, Malaysia and Morocco, but our goal is to make it zero by 2030,"" Mitsui CEO Tatsuo Yasunaga said in an interview on Friday.
The comment - Mitsui's first on selling out of coal-fired power generation - comes as firms worldwide move away from coal to cut harmful carbon dioxide emissions and slow climate change.
Mitsui, which generates about two-thirds of profit from energy and metals, is also shifting away from oil.
""With the COVID-19 crisis, we have postponed investment in a few upstream oil deals, but our liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects are on track,"" he said.
Through equity holdings, Mitsui's energy assets comprise 78,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and 181,000 bpd in gas measured in oil-equivalent terms.
Its crude ratio will decline by 2030 due to the scheduled launch in about four years of LNG projects in Mozambique and arctic Russia, Yasunaga said.
""Renewable energy can't replace all other power sources in one fell swoop. Gas goes well with volatile renewable energy as gas-fired power generation is easy to switch on and off,"" he said, adding Mitsui is also keen on cleaner energy such as offshore wind farms and hydrogen projects.
Outside of energy and resources, Mitsui is betting on healthcare, especially through Malaysian hospital operator  IHH Healthcare Bhd  (KL:IHHH) of which it owns 32.9%.
""The pandemic has helped spread virtual diagnosis and other services in Singapore and Malaysia, helping our plans to use data to provide new services, including nutrition and disease prevention,"" he said.
Mitsui is one of five trading houses that Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) bought 5% stakes in August with the possibility of increasing its holdings to 9.9%.
Mitsui has been in mail contact with the U.S. investor and has received no specific requests, Yasunaga said.
""We are committed to implementing our growth plans as promised and seeking new opportunities that bring mutual benefit,"" he said, citing as an example its alliance with U.S. dialysis provider  DaVita Inc  (N:DVA) whose biggest shareholder is Berkshire. 
Growing DaVita in Asia will bring mutual benefit and Mitsui is eager to pursue similar collaborations, he said.

""We have to show an outcome that could prompt Berkshire to boost its stake to 9.9%,"" Yasunaga said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening marginally higher Monday, helped by fresh impetus in the search for a new U.S. stimulus package but continued worries about the Covid-19 surge will likely limit gains.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%. 
On Sunday, the Trump administration called on Congress to pass a stripped-down coronavirus relief bill. This comes after it proposed a new comprehensive $1.8 trillion stimulus deal on Friday that immediately ran into opposition on both sides of the political divide,
Although that offer moved closer to the $2.2 trillion proposition House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had already put on the table, it was still not sufficient to appease the Democrats, while it also annoyed some Republicans, many of whom are reluctant to add to a growing federal debt pile. 
At the same time, worries about the coronavirus remain a constant thorn in the side of the European markets.
France may have reported a drop in new Covid-19 cases to 16,101, the lowest number in five days, but this followed two record-breaking 24-hour periods. Italy is preparing new nationwide restrictions in response to a spike in new cases, while Germany is also considering this possibility.
Additionally, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce new measures to tackle a growing crisis on Monday, outlining three alert levels aimed at helping tailor restrictions for different parts of England. 
In corporate news, the tech sector will be in focus following a report in the Financial Times that European Union regulators are drawing up a list of up to 20 large internet companies that will be facing new and tougher rules aimed at curbing their market power.
These new rules will force the companies to share data with rivals and be more transparent on how they gather information, the report said.
Oil prices weakened Monday, as output was restored in Norway, the world's third largest exporter of oil and gas, with the end of a strike. U.S. producers also began pumping again after Hurricane Delta weakened.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $40.17 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1% to $42.41. Both contracts gained more than 9% last week, the biggest weekly rise for Brent since June.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,933.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1817."

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the country's top securities watchdog, had accepted the application from StanChart HK on Oct. 10 to set up a securities firm in the mainland, Xinhua reported.
The HK unit of StanChart told Reuters in an email that it was ""looking to further develop onshore business through acquiring new licences"".
Beijing scrapped foreign ownership caps on securities firms and mutual funds for foreign investors on April 1, part of an interim Sino-U.S. trade deal signed in January.

1616,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 01:00AM ET</span>","Hyundai to expand Kona EV recall to North America, Europe over battery fire risk: Yonhap","SEOUL (Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) is set to triple the number of recalled Kona electric cars over battery cell fire risks with plans to recall around 51,000 vehicles in North America, Europe, China and other markets, Yonhap news agency reported on Sunday. 
The recalls would come after the South Korean automaker announced last week a voluntary recall plan for 25,564 Kona EVs at home starting Oct. 16.
Hyundai said in a statement on Monday it ""is in the final stages of filing a voluntary recall notice with the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) for U.S. Kona EVs and will start the process of informing owners of these vehicles.""
Hyundai will recall 37,366 vehicles and 11,137 vehicles in Europe and North America, respectively, according to Yonhap. 
The Hyundai statement did not mention the other markets, the total number of additional electric vehicles (EVs) it intends to recall or the dates of the recalls.
South Korea's transport ministry said last week Hyundai will voluntarily recall its Kona EVs as a possible short circuit due to what may be faulty manufacturing of its high-voltage battery cells could pose a fire risk.
LG Chem Ltd (KS:051910), which supplies batteries for Kona EVs, said last week faulty battery cells were not the cause of fires in Kona EVs, and the exact cause had not been determined. 
It said a re-enactment experiment conducted jointly with Hyundai had not led to a fire, so the fires could not be attributed to faulty battery cells. LG Chem declined on Monday to comment beyond what it said last week. 
Recalled Kona EVs in South Korea will undergo software updates for all affected models and battery replacements of select models after inspections. 
KB Investment& Securities said in a report on Monday it could cost Hyundai as much as 600 billion won ($522.10 million) if they offer battery replacements for the nearly 77,000 affected vehicles identified worldwide so far.

Shares of Hyundai Motor and LG Chem fell 0.8% and 2.0%, respectively, on Monday while the broader KOSPI market (KS11) was up 0.3% as of 0430 GMT.

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 12:55AM ET</span>",Stock lenders wince as hedge funds lose their shorts,"By Tom Westbrook and Alun John
SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Short selling has declined this year as hedge funds ditch bets against a relentless, stimulus-driven stock market rally, prompting a drop in income for asset managers and brokers involved in such trades.
Figures from research firm DataLend showed stock lenders' revenue tumbled almost 15% in the year to Sept. 30 from 2019 while revenue for the September quarter alone was $1.8 billion, the lowest in the four years of comparable records.
That drop, led by declines in Asia and the United States, shows how an apparently unstoppable equities rally has caused many hedge funds to reduce shorting, typically a crucial way of earning market-beating returns.
""It's 'whatever it takes,' globally, and it is by far the most frustrating rally for all our client base,"" said George Boubouras, head of research, at K2 Asset Management, a Melbourne based fund which invests worldwide.
""With so much liquidity from central banks it is a difficult macro environment to run sustained short positions.""
In one sign short interest has declined, the volume of units of the index-tracking SPDR S&P 500 ETF (P:SPY) on loan hit a six-month low in mid September, data from research firm FIS Astec shows.
Analysts and brokers say this trend means less liquidity for traders and pressure on those who use stock lending revenue to keep trading fees low.
Blackrock (N:BLK), for example, the world's largest asset manager, earned roughly 6% of its $3.6 billion in quarterly revenue from stock lending in the June quarter, while  State Street  (N:STT) earned about 4% of its Q2 revenue.
""For Blackrock and others, a hit to securities lending revenues is likely to be a pain point,"" said Stephen Biggar, director of financial services research at Argus Research in New York.
""The revenues generated were a big rationale for how fund companies were able to lower their fees.""
Blackrock declined to comment ahead of reporting earnings on Tuesday.
NO SPECIALS
A large driver of the drop in revenues this year is the lack of ""specials,"" crowded short-seller targets that can net lenders good fees, said DataLend director Nancy Allen.
Last quarter, the top five fee earners, German battery maker  Varta  (DE:VAR1), electric truck maker Nikola (O:NKLA), cruise line Carnival Corp (N:CCL), cannabis producer Canopy Growth (TO:WEED) and drugmaker Inovio (O:INO) earned lenders $120 million, DataLend said. That was less than half what the top five made a year earlier.
To be sure, short interest has not totally evaporated, with some $2.2 trillion of stock globally on loan, Allen said, while rising share prices have powered other revenue streams for lenders and brokers.
But market participants warn reduced short-selling could have other consequences.
""Lending and short-selling activity are important to the health of the market ecosystem as a whole,"" said Stuart Jones, chairman of industry body the Pan Asia Securities Lending Association. ""Without them, you start to lose liquidity and a corrective force that can counter more exuberant prices.""

Investing.com – Malaysia's Top Glove Corp. (KL:TPGC), the biggest rubber glove maker globally, is reportedly considering a listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that it hopes will raise more than $1 billion.
Top Glove’s Singapore shares (SI:TOPG) were up 1.39% to SGD2.910 ($2.15) by 12:37 AM ET (4:37 AM GMT). The company’s shares are also listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.
The company is reportedly consulting with advisors about the potential Hong Kong listing, which would be the biggest ever by a Malaysian company in Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg data.
The ongoing deliberations with its unspecified financial advisors over the listing mean that details, including its size, could increase depending on the feedback received, and could take anywhere from six to nine months, executive chairman Lim Wee Chai said during a September briefing.
Top Glove declined to comment ahead of any official announcements, and the company has yet to file an application for the listing.
The company reported a record net income of MYR1.29 billion ($311.49 million) in its fiscal fourth quarter as the COVID-19 increased expectations for “fresh highs” for the coming year, with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continuing to drive demand for medical protective gear.
The demand has seen Top Glove’s Malaysian shares soar more than 460% in 2020. The country’s benchmark index has fallen around 3.7% in 2020, putting the company well ahead of the trend."

The leader of neighbouring Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, later said she would postpone her annual policy address scheduled for Wednesday and travel to Shenzhen instead, though she said no meeting with Xi was scheduled.
Lam said she would go to Beijing later this month and aimed to hold her policy address by the end of November.

Investing.com – Asian Pacific stocks were mostly up on Monday morning after U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration proposed a new stimulus deal. China has also acted to constrain the recent rises in the yuan.
The White House’s latest COVID-19 stimulus bill acted as a driver for markets, with news of the $1.8 trillion proposal giving investors encouragement. However, neither Democrat nor Republican lawmakers are yet to agree on the measures, with both sides still far apart on levels of spending, with talks between the two parties still deadlocked.
Investors were also focused on the upcoming U.S. elections where Democrat candidate Joe Biden appears to be leading President Trump as the race enters its final weeks. Should Mr. Biden win, a substantial stimulus package is likely to be delivered.
“Markets still have high hopes of a large-scale stimulus package and are indifferent about whether it occurs this side of November or not,” said National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) economist Tapas Strickland.
In China, the country's central bank pushed measures to reduce the yuan’s recent steep gains after the nation’s national Golden Week holidays.
The Shanghai Composite rose 1.80% by 10:30 PM ET (2:30 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen SZSE Composite jumped 1.83%.
The yuan had risen steeply on Friday, pushing up 1%, with overall gains of 7.2% since May. The People’s Bank of China has responded by cutting forward reserve requirements in an attempt to reduce the currency’s upwards impetus.
“The authorities have not stood in the way of yuan strength, but this move could be seen as a sign that they want to slow the pace of appreciation … We still see scope for further yuan appreciation, especially with China’s strong growth momentum ... but the authorities want to encourage more two-way flows, and removing the reserve requirement will help.”” said ANZ Bank’s head of Asia research, Khoon Goh told Reuters.

(Reuters) - The United Kingdom's hospitality industry is mounting a legal challenge to the government's lockdown restrictions, aiming to stop its plans to close pubs and other venues to tackle the rise in coronavirus cases.
The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), a UK trade body, told Reuters late Sunday that the industry has taken legal action to prevent lockdown measures from being imposed.
The judicial review, reported earlier by the Financial Times, will argue that no evidence supports hospitality venues having contributed to the spread of COVID-19.
""The industry has been left with no other option but to legally challenge the so called 'common sense' approach narrative from government, on the implementation of further restrictions across the North of England,"" NTIA CEO Michael Kill said in an email.
""These new measures will have a catastrophic impact on late night businesses, and are exacerbated further by an insufficient financial support package,"" the statement read.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will set out new measures to try to contain a growing coronavirus crisis on Monday, outlining three new alert levels to better coordinate the government's response.
Northern England has been particularly hard hit by a new surge in coronavirus cases that has forced local lockdowns as students returned to schools and universities across Britain.
On Monday, Johnson will hold a meeting of the government's emergency COBRA committee and then address parliament, offering lawmakers a vote later in the week on the measures.

National Commercial Bank, Saudi Arabia’s largest lender by assets, agreed to buy rival Samba Financial Group for $15 billion in the biggest banking takeover this year.
NCB will pay 28.45 riyals ($7.58) for each Samba share, according to a statement on Sunday, valuing it at about 55.7 billion riyals. NCB will offer 0.739 new shares for each Samba share, at the lower end of the 0.736-0.787 ratio the banks set when they signed an initial framework agreement in June.
The offer is a 3.5% premium to Samba’s Oct. 8 closing price of 27.50 riyals and about 24% higher than the level the shares traded at before the talks were made public. Bloomberg News first reported the merger discussions.
The new bank will have total assets of more than $220 billion, creating the Gulf region’s third-largest lender. The entity’s $46 billion market capitalization nearly matches that of Qatar National Bank QPSC, which is still the Middle East’s biggest lender with about $268 billion of assets.
Banks in the oil-rich Gulf have been combining as regional economies suffer the twin shocks of lower energy revenues and the global coronavirus pandemic. The Saudi consolidation also coincides with a long-awaited wave of banking mergers in Europe, where lenders are exploring tie-ups or have begun taking over smaller rivals.
Merging two major domestic banks is a key component of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s “Vision 2030” initiative to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by creating local champions in industries such as finance. The kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund -- the Public Investment Fund -- of which the crown prince is the chairman, will be the largest shareholder in the combined NCB-Samba entity with a 37.2% holding.
“Saudi Arabia is undergoing a historic transformation with Vision 2030,” said NCB’s current chairman, Saeed Al-Ghamdi. “Such a transformation requires a robust financial services sector, especially highly capitalized, resilient banks that can fund economic development, as well as support Saudi Arabia’s trade and capital flows with the region and the rest of the world.”
More details:
The deal comes almost a year after NCB abandoned plans to merge with Riyad Bank, a deal that would have created a bank with about $200 billion of assets. HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) Plc’s local affiliate Saudi British Bank completed its acquisition of Alawwal Bank, which was part-owned by Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:NWG) Plc, in June last year.
Saudi Arabia has almost 30 local and international lenders serving a population of more than 30 million people.
The combined bank’s targeted cost synergy of 9% is below regional peers, leaving room for an upside post integration. A better funding structure and an opportunity in cross-selling products should boost revenue by at least 2%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Edmond Christou.
The new leadership will assume their new roles after the conclusion of the merger in the first half of 2021, subject to approval of the nominations by the new board of directors.

Repairing the transatlantic relationship would be EU's top priority, and the U.S. should withdraw its Airbus-related tariffs as a confidence-building measure, the EU's new trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis told https://on.ft.com/2GEqmap the FT.
""Of course, if the US is not withdrawing their tariffs we have no choice but to then introduce our tariffs,"" he was quoted as saying.
Washington was awarded the right by the World Trade Organization (WTO) last October, to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion of annual EU imports in its case against Airbus. Washington then imposed 25% duties on products ranging from single-malt whisky to olives and cheese and 10% tariffs on most European-made Airbus jets.
In mid-February, the U.S. government said it would increase tariffs on aircraft imported from the EU to 15% from 10%, ratcheting up pressure on Brussels in a nearly 16-year dispute over aircraft subsidies.
The EU for its part, has been cleared by the WTO to impose tariffs on U.S. products worth $4 billion to retaliate against subsidies for American planemaker Boeing, sources told Reuters last month, with the award expected to be published within weeks.
Dombrovskis refused to speculate about the impact a Joe Biden presidency might have on the dispute, but told the FT that a more protectionist approach was something that came with the administration of Donald Trump.

""But in any case we will be engaging . . . and trying to bring the US administration back within the framework of multilateralism,"" he added.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retailer Marks & Spencer, seeking to avoid a repeat of last Christmas when its performance was ruined by excessive food waste, is rolling out a supply chain programme it says will crack the problem.
Reporting on festive trading in January, two months before the COVID-19 pandemic brought much of Britain to a standstill, Chief Executive Steve Rowe said that while M&S had enjoyed record food sales its profit margins were dented by high levels of waste.
M&S normally accounts for just over 3% of the UK grocery market but at Christmas it punches above its weight, selling, for example, one in four of all fresh turkeys consumed.
Nevertheless, the group has been dogged by food availability issues and waste levels that are amongst the highest in the industry.
For Rowe, attempting to boost M&S's fortunes after a decade of failed reinventions, the antidote to waste is a supply chain initiative called Vangarde - named after the shopping park in the northern English city of York where the group frequently tests new ideas.
""It's absolutely going to reset the foundations of our business and the platform to grow,"" Ryan Lemon, M&S head of retail supply chain told Reuters.
The Vangarde programme aims to get all parts of M&S's supply chain working better, from planning, to suppliers, to logistics and stores.
Its first phase included 92 M&S stores served by a regional distribution centre (RDC) in Barnsley, northern England. A second phase starts on Monday with a further 65 stores served by a RDC in Thatcham, southern England, with a full roll-out serving 595 stores by July 2021.
WASTE REDUCTION
""We believe that we're going to see an improvement in sales in these stores, a reduction in waste and an improvement in availability,"" said Lemon.
He explained that Vangarde lowers the total levels of stock in stores, finely tailors deliveries from depots to an individual store's needs and increases the number of deliveries to stores out of trading hours.
Ambient foods are delivered to stores consistently seven days a week instead of four or five previously.
There are more frequent and smaller deliveries from M&S suppliers to RDCs, with delivery timings aligned more closely to store requirements. 
M&S store workers' shift patterns have also been upended so more are available to re-stock when stores are closed. That means customers aren't bumping into staff stacking shelves - a key benefit during the COVID crisis.
The programme also embraces new technology. For example shop floor workers use handheld Honeywell (NYSE:HON) devices to gauge stock levels.
""The customer's going to see a massive difference because every Vangarde store will be ready to trade from opening,"" said Lemon.
COVID means Christmas 2020 is shaping up to be a unique trading period.
""Last Christmas there was some big challenges. This Christmas there's going to be a lot of complexity in terms of customer behaviour,"" said Lemon.

""We're hugely better planned this year.""

Inc (TO:TRZ), with the deal now worth about C$188.7 million ($143.86 million), down from C$720 million, as COVID-19 weighs on travel demand, the companies said in a statement on Saturday.
The country's largest carrier had secured Transat shareholders' approval for the deal last year with an C$18.00 a share bid, to bolster its then thriving leisure business. 
But with the pandemic grounding flights globally, Air Canada faced shareholder pressure to renegotiate the deal which is still pending approval from European and Canadian regulators, Reuters reported in May.
Montreal-based Air Canada, like many of its global peers, has slashed flights, suspended financial forecasts and sought government aid as the industry deals with its worst slump. 
Companies have been cancelling deals amid COVID-19 uncertainty, with aircraft parts suppliers  Hexcel Corp  (N:HXL) and  Woodward  Inc (O:WWD) abandoning their planned $6.4 billion all-stock merger in April.
Under revised terms of the deal, Air Canada said it will acquire all shares of Transat for C$5 per share, representing a premium of about 30.5% to Transat's last close on Friday. 
""Air Canada intends to complete its acquisition of Transat, at a reduced price and on modified terms,"" said Calin Rovinescu, the carrier's chief executive officer, in a statement.
""Consummating the initial deal at $18.00 was not an option that was viable given the full set of circumstances the Corporation is facing,"" Jean-Yves Leblanc, chair of the special committee of the board of Transat said in a statement.

1634,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 10, 2020 08:59AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: The Case for Beyond Meat,"By Liz Moyer and Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com --  Beyond Meat Inc  (NASDAQ:BYND) has soared with the wider embrace of plant-based ""meat"" products.
They are a far cry from the particle board vegetable-based products of old. Beyond and its competitors are capturing the attention of younger consumers, and inviting big competition from established giants in the food industry.
But shares are trading in the stratosphere, leading many to wonder whether Beyond can keep up the trend.
Investing.com's Liz Moyer argues the bull case for Beyond Meat (no pun intended), while Christiana Sciaudone writes that it can't go on forever. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bull Case 
If teenagers love it, it must be good, right?
Research by Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) found that young people were increasingly on board with plant-based food products, prompting analysts at the firm to raise their price target on Beyond Meat earlier this week.
The maker of meatless meatballs, packaged ground meat and sausage products has rallied 157% this year and is well above its May 2019 IPO price of $25. Analysts are expecting Beyond to report full year 2020 profit of 6 cents a share, up from a loss of 29 cents a share last year, and on their way to forecasted profit of 52 cents a share for 2021, according to Zacks.
Net revenue for the second quarter rose 69% from last year. To respond to the Covid-19 crisis, Beyond repackaged its commercial products for sale to consumers during the quarter, incurring costs that pushed the bottom line to a $10 million loss for the period.
The company pointed out that it continued to introduce new products during the crisis, including its value pack called the Cookout Classic, which lowered the cost of its burgers from nearly two-times that of real meat patties to about 20% more per pound.
“Though the Cookout Classic only reached stores in the last 2 weeks of the second quarter, it accounted for 16 points of the year-over-year volume growth in our U.S. retail business,” the company said. “We look forward to continuing to serve our consumers and customers alike as we all hope for a resolution to the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Meatless meat has grown to a big industry, with sales estimated to grow 15% annually for the next few years to reach $27 billion in 2025. It has attracted competition from newcomers like Impossible Burger to established food giants like Tyson as consumers adapt to a healthier lifestyle.
Piper recently asked teens about plant-based meat to gauge consumer preferences. Of the respondents, 47% said they either eat it now or are open to consuming plant-based meat. The research firm also found that interest in plant-based meat rises in younger people, indicating a big base of potential future growth as teenagers grow older and establish their own households.
Beyond’s burgers are supposed to look, cook and satisfy appetites like a traditional beef burger. The company says its meatless meat is made from simple, plant-based ingredients without GMOs, soy or gluten.
It has since branched out to meatballs and breakfast sausage links, which are sold through grocery stores across the U.S., including Kroger (NYSE:KR), Albertsons, Sprouts, Harris Teeter, Wegmans, and Whole Foods. And it is poised to start production in China at the end of the year.
The company has also expanded a relationship with Walmart, tripling the number of sales outlets for Beyond Burger from 800 locations to more than 2,400 stores. Beyond says its products are available at 112,000 stores in 85 countries.
The Bear Case
Beyond Meat is trading at a material premium to such big wigs as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Need I say more?
Beyond Meat is beyond reason, no matter how much one might like plant-based meat.
The stock has rallied this year, and shares spike every time the company publishes a press release -- even if it's old news.
The company is barely eking out profits. Since it went public in May 2019, it has reported just two quarters of actual earnings per share -- 3 cents and 6 cents. For the second quarter, the most recent data available, Beyond Meat reported a loss per share of 16 cents -- that's 8 times worse than expected by analysts. Granted, it beat on revenue, but it took in a grand total of $113.34 million for the three months.
The company is valued at $7.81 billion. Let that sink in.
And don't take my word for it. Check out the analysts that cover Beyond Meat. Shares have two buy ratings, seven holds and six sells. Since analysts hate to ever give sell ratings, those six have more weight than it would initially appear.
So, what's their beef with Beyond Meat?
In August, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reiterated its sell rating with foodservice declining more than 60% from a year earlier.
That same month Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) maintained a hold rating on the stock, even while boosting the price target, because of valuation, according to StreetInsider.
Beyond Meat trades on an enterprise value to sales basis fairly in line with Freshpet (NASDAQ:FRPT), but at a material premium to  Monster Beverage  (NASDAQ:MNST), Netflix, Tesla and McCormick (NYSE:MKC), ""all either higher-growth food & beverage companies or sector-specific disruptors,"" Jefferies analyst Rob Dickerson said.
In September, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) downgraded the stock to underweight from neutral, citing Impossible Foods's increasing presence on shelves and many restaurants not adding menu items.
""We think the stock is ahead of itself,"" JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman said, according to StreetInsider. Shares are up 30% since that report was published. Imagine what Goldman thinks now.
Going back to the magic of the press releases, every time something is published, it is almost guaranteed that the stock will rise, no matter the content.
Let's take the recent example of a Sept. 29 announcement that Beyond was doing a major expansion with Walmart (NYSE:WMT), with products being offered at more than 2,400 locations versus the previous 800. Chief Executive Officer, Founder and President Ethan Brown had let the news slip on the Aug. 4 earnings call. No matter. That press release helped shares jump 14% the day it came out, almost two months later. On old news. Something doesn't smell right here.

1635,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 10, 2020 08:55AM ET</span>",Wall Street's Next Deal Frontier: Mom-And-Pop Convenience Stores,"By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com -- The special acquisition vehicle has become a convenient way to go public this year. So much so, that even convenience stores are getting in on the SPAC game. 
Last month, Israel-based ARKO holdings agreed to combine with  Haymaker Acquisition Corp II  (NASDAQ:HYAC), a year-old SPAC helmed by former Starwood Hotels chief and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) executive Steven Heyer, with the goal of taking ARKO public in the U.S. after the deal closes later this year. 
But wait, what does this have to do with convenience stores? ARKO Chief Executive Officer Arie Kolter started in the business almost a decade ago and in that time has expanded his convenience store empire via 18 acquisitions. The most recent was a deal for GPM Investments, of which ARKO owns a 70% controlling interest, to buy Empire Petroleum. That tie-up closed this past week.
And there's plenty more opportunity out there. 
Kolter points out that there are about 152,000 convenience store locations in the U.S., and just 20% are operated by the 10 biggest companies. That leaves some 120,000 mom-and-pop shops to be snapped up.
""It's so fragmented, there's an unlimited amount of opportunities,"" Kolter said in a phone interview from Miami. ""We're not an idea. We have a track record. We're an acquisition machine.""
The deal for Empire almost doubles its independently operated fueling stations to about 3,000, and adds 85 convenience stores for a total of more than 1,300 retail locations. GPM will now be present in 10 additional states, for a total of 33, and the District of Columbia.
Kolter said the focus is on rural and small town locations, where in some cases the convenience store is the local grocery store.
""We're buying family businesses; we keep their employees, we're keeping their brands,"" Kolter said.
ARKO is also investing in upgrading stores. It's current plans call for some 350 stores to get facelifts -- including with Covid-friendly measures. Kolter says the improvements pay off as units already upgraded have seen up to a 60% return on investment.
Expansion will likely take place in states where they already have stores. 
""It's all about economy of scale,"" Kolter said. ""We know how to achieve great economies of scale. We were able to double profit in some stores we bought.""
Casey's General (NASDAQ:CASY) Stores is the fourth-largest chain in the U.S. -- ARKO's family of stores is the seventh -- and recent results show how profitable such businesses can be. Earnings per share for the three months ended July 31 came in at $3.24, compared to the expected $2.06. The result was 40% higher than a year earlier. 
Murphy USA (NYSE:MUSA) is the sixth-largest player in the U.S. The El Dorado, an Arkansas-based company reported profit of $5.73 per share, up from $1.01 a year earlier.  
“Murphy USA’s record second quarter performance once again demonstrated the competitive advantages of our distinctive business model and customer positioning,"" said Chief Executive Officer Andrew Clyde in a statement in July. ""Our outlook for the remainder of 2020 and 2021 remains very positive."" 
Some 4,000 convenience stores change hands every year, a number that started rising about six years ago. Seven & i, the Japanese company that owns 711 stores -- and the biggest chain with 6% of the U.S. market -- recently paid $21 billion for Speedway gas stations from Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC). Speedway is the third-biggest operator, with 2.6% of the market, Kolter's not looking at such headline-generating purchases. 
""I'm just concentrating on smaller transactions in small markets,"" Kolter said. ""How can we increase profitability? That's the bottom line.""

Carmakers have warned that European Commission proposals to cut average new car emissions in 2030 by 50% below 2021 levels threaten manufacturing jobs, which are heavily dependent on assembling combustion engine cars.
Overall demand for cars could suffer if ownership of electric vehicles was not made more attractive with more readily available charging networks, Brecht said.
""The political establishment should not decide on a green deal to tighten carbon dioxide emission limits unconditionally,"" Brecht told Reuters. ""There has to be a master plan for ramping up charging infrastructure. There are lots of small initiatives but there is nobody bringing it all together.""
Earlier this week, the European Parliament voted in favor of a legally binding target for the European Union to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2030.
""Fundamentally its a good strategy, but ramping up electric mobility is problematic. We will not end up with the same number of employees,"" Brecht warned. 

Brecht said the carmaker has reviewed its strategy to free up resources to retool its factories and retrain workers to build low emission cars.

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: U.S. earnings improvement expected, but still a weak quarter","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - While good business news has been in short supply, investors may take slight comfort in coming weeks from U.S. corporate earnings that are likely to be bad, but not as bad as they have been.
Analysts expect third-quarter S&P 500 earnings to have fallen 21% compared with the year-ago quarter, a big improvement from second-quarter's 30.6% drop that was most likely the low point for earnings this year because of coronavirus-fueled lockdowns, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Earnings reporting will get rolling next week with results from some of the big U.S. banks, likely impacted by near record low interest rates and the pandemic-induced recession. JPMorgan & Co. (N:JPM) and  Citigroup  (N:C) both release results on Tuesday.
(Graphic: S&P 500 Q3 earnings look bad, but not as bad as Q2 - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/azgvoaoyzvd/chart.png)
Overall, S&P 500 quarterly results tend to beat analysts' cautious expectations, and they could do that even more than usual this reporting season, strategists said. In a break from the typical trend, guidance from U.S. companies has been more positive than negative and estimates have been improving in recent weeks to reflect more upbeat guidance. 
Whether that will be enough to support stocks in the weeks ahead is up for debate.
""Very rarely in the last 10 years have we seen earnings estimates moving higher after a quarterly reporting season,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
""That's a very good sign. It's a sign there's a strong possibility this quarterly earnings season is now going to be better than expected,"" he said. ""The only problem is, now that we've entered the fourth quarter, a lot of the economic indicators are plateauing.""
That could weigh on fourth-quarter guidance and overshadow some of the better-than-expected results, he said.
Data this past Thursday on U.S. jobless claims was among the latest to underscore the view the labor market recovery was struggling to gain momentum, with coronavirus cases continuing to rise.
Earnings season comes as the nation also prepares for the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential vote, which lands in the middle of one of the heaviest weeks of profit reporting. That, along with focus on prospects for additional fiscal stimulus from Washington, could overshadow earnings news. 
Companies that have reported so far on the quarter have not seen much cheer from investors, despite their much stronger-than-expected results, some strategists have noted.
""Firms that reported Q3 already have declined 1% on average despite the big beats, suggesting the bar is much higher for investors,"" UBS strategist Keith Parker wrote in a note.
U.S. stocks registered sharp gains for the third quarter, but they fell in September in the first monthly decline since March, when the coronavirus began its rapid spread across the United States. 
Among the sectors, earnings from the S&P 500 energy sector (SPNY) are expected to have declined the most, with a projected 115% year-over-year drop, based on Refinitiv's data.
The consumer discretionary sector (SPLRCD), which includes some of the companies most heavily impacted by coronavirus lockdowns such as those in retail, travel and tourism, is slated to post a 34% year-over-year decline in earnings, Refinitiv's data showed. 
(Graphic: Wall Street braces for lower earnings - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjvqnrdxpx/Pasted%20image%201602175244692.png)
But analysts expect earnings from the S&P 500's heavyweight sector, technology (SPLRCT), to decline just 0.5% from a year ago in the third quarter, the smallest decline among all sectors.
""Admittedly, things are better than they were at the end of June,"" wrote Tobias Levkovich, Citi's chief U.S. equity strategist.

But with many uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, treatments, the U.S. election and the economy, ""forward guidance will be crucial, and we suspect C-suites may stay guarded,"" he said.

1638,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 09:30PM ET</span>","U.S. should try to delay IPO of China's Ant Group, Senator Rubio says","By Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Marco Rubio, who has successfully urged the Trump administration to pursue investigations of Chinese companies, called on Friday for the U.S. government to consider options to delay an initial public offering of China's Ant Group, the fintech arm of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (HK:9988). 
""It's outrageous that Wall Street is rewarding the Chinese Communist Party's blatant crackdown on Hong Kong's freedom and autonomy by orchestrating Ant Group's IPO on the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges,"" Rubio, a Republican, said in a statement to Reuters.
""The Administration should take a serious look at the options available to delay Ant Group's IPO,"" he added. 
The Hong Kong leg of the IPO, part of a dual listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong, is being sponsored by China International Capital Corp (HK:3908),  Citigroup  (N:C), JPMorgan (N:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS).  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) is working as a joint global coordinator. Goldman Sachs (N:GS) is also involved.
Ant declined to comment on Rubio's remarks, but said its business was primarily in China and it is excited about growth prospects there.
It was not immediately clear how the U.S. government could postpone the listing of a Chinese company abroad. But Rubio's remarks are a sign of growing pressure among China hardliners in Congress, within the administration and elsewhere, for President Donald Trump to sanction Ant before it lists later this month.
Some fear the offering, worth up to $30 billion, could expose scores of U.S. investors to fraud. Others fear it could give the Chinese government access to sensitive banking data belonging to U.S. citizens. 
""These digital payment systems are the source of well-founded national security concerns, and the Trump administration should move to protect American users’ sensitive financial data as quickly as possible,"" Republican Representative Jim Banks said in a statement when asked whether the administration should impose sanctions on the company.
Ant is China’s dominant mobile payments company, offering loans, payments, insurance and asset management services via mobile apps. Based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, Ant is 33% owned by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and controlled by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.
Ant's Alipay payment platform, like Tencent's WeChat's platform, is used primarily by Chinese citizens with accounts in renminbi. Most of its U.S. interactions are with merchants accepting payment from Chinese travelers and businesses in the country.
An anti-China advocacy group known as the Committee on the Present Danger: China, whose membership includes hedge fund manager Kyle Bass and former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, penned a letter to Trump last month calling for the company to be added to a trade black list and the IPO to be delayed. 
""We believe that the IPO should, at a minimum, be delayed to ensure that...disclosures are faithfully done and properly evaluated as, regrettably, a sizeable portion of the IPO proceeds will almost surely end up in the investment portfolios of millions of retail American investors,"" the group said in the letter, dated Sept. 14. 
The company could become the latest victim of a years-long technology battle between Beijing and Washington that saw the Trump administration lash out at such Chinese companies as telecoms giant Huawei and surveillance camera maker Hikvision over everything from intellectual property theft, to breaches of sanctions and human rights abuses. 

Rubio was the first to publicly call for a probe into popular Chinese-owned social media app TikTok by a powerful national security committee, which did review it. The Trump administration ultimately banned the app, but a court-imposed injunction pending review has kept the ban from going into effect.

The U.S. health agency will provide the funding to AstraZeneca for two Phase 3 clinical trials under operation Warp Speed, which is aimed at speeding up treatments and vaccines for COVID-19. 
One trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the experimental treatment to prevent infection for up to 12 months, in about 5,000 participants, while the second trial will evaluate post-exposure preventative and pre-emptive treatment in roughly 1,100 participants.
AstraZeneca said it plans to supply up to 100,000 doses starting towards the end of 2020 and the US Government can acquire up to an additional one million doses in 2021 under a separate agreement.

In a video posted on Twitter on Wednesday, Trump credited Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's (O:REGN) therapeutic for his recovery. Trump received Regeneron's treatment last week after he was diagnosed with COVID-19.

Investing.com – The Dow notched its best week since August on Friday, as hopes for further fiscal aid to keep the economy on track were boosted on reports the White House raised its coronavirus stimulus offer to $1.8 trillion, though that is still short of the Democrat’s $2.2 trillion proposal.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.57% or 161 points, and had its best week since the week ending Aug. 7. The S&P 500 ended 0.88% higher, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.39%, with indexes notching their biggest gains since the week ending July 3.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected to discuss the new $1.8 trillion proposal with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when the two speak Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.
Earlier on Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said another fiscal package was unlikely in the next three weeks, while Trump said he wanted to see a larger relief bill than either side had offered so far.  “I’d like to see a bigger stimulus package than either the Republicans or Democrats are offering,” Trump said on Rush Limbaugh radio show. “I’d like to see money going to people.”
Reports the White House is raising its offer comes a day after Pelosi rejected the idea of passing standalone aid bills, preferring instead to roll out a broader relief package that would include support for individuals, small businesses and airlines.
Economists have repeatedly highlighted the importance of fiscal aid to keep the recovery intact, though have recently suggested that possible delays could eventually lead to a larger deal.
""The lack of additional fiscal support will create downside momentum for economic activity in the fourth quarter ... but it is not necessarily bad news. More stimulus is coming in early 2021, and the odds are that it will be bigger than would otherwise be the case,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said. 
Sectors tied to the progress of the economy advanced. Consumer discretionary was among the gains eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) easing leading the upside.
Big tech continued to add to gains, led by a more than 2% rise in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rose 1%, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ended marginally higher.
Energy proved an exception to the rally, down more 1%, as oil prices fell 1%, though are set to end the week sharply higher with weather-related supply disruptions easing demand concerns somewhat.
Tech was also pushed higher by a rise in chip stocks after strong gains in  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) and Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), with the latter ending 14% higher on reports that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) was in advanced talks to buy the company.
NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) closed up 5% as it lifted quarterly guidance, citing a “material improvement” in demand across all end markets.

1648,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>","Airbus ramps up deliveries in September, seen targeting 500 jets in 2020","By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) reached the highest number of monthly deliveries of passenger planes so far this year in September, but logged no new sales as crisis-hit airlines continue to bleed cash.
The European planemaker delivered 57 jets in September, up from 39 in August, bringing nine-month deliveries to 341, down 40% from the same period of 2019, company data showed on Friday.
The drop matches a 40% output fall triggered by the coronavirus crisis, with Airbus deciding last month to maintain the new rates unchanged. A significant number of jets were delivered from a parked backlog.
Airbus axed guidance at the outset of the pandemic but is internally targeting around 500 deliveries in 2020 and is three quarters of the way towards its goal, industry sources said.
It delivered a record annual total of 863 jets in 2019.
Jet markets are moribund due to the impact of the crisis on demand and airline balance sheets, although Boeing (NYSE:BA) is seen chasing some deals to bolster its 737 MAX.
Boeing this week cut its long-term demand forecasts for the first time in more than ten years and warned of a challenging decade ahead.
According to Airbus data, Macquarie Financial Holdings, a unit of Australia's  Macquarie Group  (AX:MQG), cancelled three out of 40 A220 jets originally ordered from Canada's Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF), which sold the passenger jet programme to Airbus in 2018.
So far this year, Airbus has sold 379 aircraft or a net total of 300 after cancellations.
It remains far in front of its U.S. rival which had sold 67 aircraft by the end of August and had a negative net total of 378 orders dominated by cancellations for the Boeing 737 MAX, which has been grounded for 18 months after two crashes.

Boeing delivered 87 jets between January and August.

The stock, while dramatically underperforming the market year-to-date, has recently outperformed noticeably. 
On Friday it was up 0.1% at $17.76 after rising 27.6% from Sept 18 to Thursday's close. The S&P 400 (IDX) was up 0.5% on Friday after gaining 6.8% between Sept. 18 and Thursday. 
H&R Block has fallen about 24% year-to-date versus a roughly 3% drop in the index. 
BTIG analyst Mark Palmer said the rally has hinged on investor expectations going forward ""politically and in terms of the pandemic.""
While Trump in 2016 promised a tax code so simple it would put H&R Block out of business, investors see Biden tax changes leading consumers back to H&R Block. On Thursday, its shares closed 20% lower than the day Trump won the 2016 election.
""Obviously it didn't have the kind of impact (Trump) was ascribing,"" said Palmer. ""The flip side is the view that if we see significant tax changes under a democratic administration there could be an increased need for consumers to seek help.""
Investors are also betting a coronavirus vaccine will allow more in-person tax appointments. 
""HRB's ability to operate was severely impaired by the pandemic ... particularly for their in-store assisted tax preparation,"" said Palmer who rates the stock neutral. 
Barrington Research analyst Alexander Paris sees a low price to earnings ratio as a key to the recent rally with the stock trading around 5 times his 2020 earnings per share estimate and 4 times his 2021 estimate versus a five-year average of 13.5. 

Also Paris expects a much better 2021 than 2020 when tax day moved from April to July because of the coronavirus lockdown.

1650,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 01:40PM ET</span>","U.S. expects over 1 million COVID-19 antibody doses from Regeneron, Lilly in 2020","By Michael Erman and Manas Mishra
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government expects to be able to provide at no cost more than 1 million doses of antibody treatments for COVID-19 similar to the one President Donald Trump received to treat his illness, according to a top U.S. health official on Friday.
The government's Operation Warp Speed program currently has ""a couple of hundred thousand doses"" of the monoclonal antibody treatments being developed by drugmakers Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc (O:REGN) and Eli Lilly & Co (N:LLY), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official Paul Mango said on a call with reporters. That would top 1 million doses by the end of the year, he said.
Trump received Regeneron's treatment last week. In a radio interview with Rush Limbaugh on Friday, Trump said he is working to get both drugs approved quickly and that he may not have recovered without the treatments he received.
Both companies have said the drugs were shown to work in clinical trials and that they have submitted an emergency use authorization to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
The drugs are not identical: Regeneron's treatment is a cocktail of two antibodies meant to protect against the virus, while Lilly's is a single antibody. Because they have not been tested against the other, it is difficult to know if one is more effective than the other.
It is unclear how long the FDA process to authorize emergency use of the drugs will take. Unless the companies receive that authorization, doctors cannot administer the drugs to patients outside of clinical trials or without a compassionate use authorization like the one President Trump received.
If the drugs are authorized for use by the FDA, Mango said that the government will allocate the treatments to the states based on need, similar to the mechanism used with  Gilead Sciences Inc 's (O:GILD) antiviral drug remdesivir for COVID-19. 
Regeneron signed a $450 million deal in July to sell Operation Warp Speed enough doses of its antibody treatment, REGN-COV2, to treat around 300,000 people. 
The company said it has not signed any additional deals with Operation Warp Speed, and has around 50,000 doses of its treatment ready now.

Lilly said on Friday it has not signed an agreement with Operation Warp Speed. It said earlier this week that it expects to produce around one million doses of the treatment this year.

1654,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 10:40AM ET</span>","$30,000 turkey highlights Equinor's 'control problems' in U.S.","LONDON (Reuters) - A report on Norwegian energy firm Equinor's (OL:EQNR) loss-making investments in the United States detailed significant problems the state-controlled company should have dealt with faster, its chair and chief executive said on Friday.
Equinor made a series of acquisitions of onshore and offshore petroleum reserves in the United States in the years before the 2014-2016 oil price crash, eventually leading to accumulated losses and write-offs of $20.4 billion dollars.
In June, Norway's energy minister said Equinor must be more transparent about its foreign businesses.
""Equinor has recorded large financial losses in the US. These were mainly driven by an ambitious growth strategy and investments that were based on overly optimistic price assumptions,"" Equinor's chairman Jon Erik Reinhardsen said.
""Rapid growth for a period led to significant control problems. The board and management should have seen and addressed this sooner.""
The review, led by a PWC accountant Eli Moe-Helgesen, was based on more than 120 interviews and documents dating back to 2005, Equinor said.
It revealed, among many things, that Equinor bought a turkey at a charity rodeo in Houston for $30,000; just one of many decisions the report criticised.
It referred to Equinor's ""limited onshore competence experience in senior leadership"". It said the company did not properly check if assets would make money at lower prices and key risks were ""not sufficiently understood and challenged by decision makers"".

BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said on Thursday the energy sector will bounce back one day but shareholders need to be very patient and he is not urging people to buy.
Icahn, with stakes in CVR Energy (NYSE:CVI), Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), said the key to making money is to buy when companies are out of favor.
""I'm not saying go out and buy energy stocks tomorrow,"" he noted at the 13D Monitor Conference on activist investing.
But Icahn said, without elaborating, that he was bracing for a sweep of bankruptcies in the sector, which is in a slump as demand has plunged during the coronavirus pandemic. He joked that in three years time, people may kick themselves for not having snapped up inexpensive energy companies in 2020.
Icahn's investment style, he acknowledged, is a little different as an activist who proposes remedies to companies with management problems and often wins board seats.
""We've been really helpful at many companies,"" often by freeing them from incompetent management, Icahn said. Forbes estimates his net worth at $16.7 billion.
Critics have called him a corporate raider for his hostile takeover in 1985 of Trans World Airlines whose assets he stripped, leading to its demise.
""I work all day, don't ask me why,"" said Icahn, aged 84, when most people are comfortably retired. ""I have a lot of different deals going on. I like the action.""

1657,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 10:20AM ET</span>","U.S. bank stocks are fine, if you are rich in patience","By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - The U.S. bank sector has been pummeled this year but investors hunting for bargains there may need deep reserves of patience as banks are particularly sensitive to low interest rates, the uneven economic recovery and the muddy stimulus outlook.
The S&P 500 Bank subsector , which kicks off its third-quarter earnings season on Oct. 13, was last down 33.7% for the year-to-date compared with a 5.8% gain for the S&P 500 index. 
Banks have been such a drag on the broader S&P financial index that its 19% year-to-date decline is second only to energy's 49.9% drop among the S&P 11 major sectors.
To be sure, if lawmakers in Washington manage to reach an agreement, a new fiscal stimulus package could help banks if it boosts U.S. loan growth, interest rates and economic activity. 
And the bank index is up 12% from its intraday trough on Sept. 2 to a peak on Oct. 6 as yields for longer-dated U.S. treasuries have risen with stimulus hopes as banks profit from higher interest rates.
But investors are unconvinced that recent gains will be sustainable as the Federal Reserve has signaled plans to keep overnight rates low for the foreseeable future in order to aid an economic recovery, which is expected to take years. 
“You’re looking at years for this sector to make a full recovery. It will take a lot of positive things to happen in the U.S. economy for it to get back to the type of performance we are seeing in the broader S&P,"" said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""Investors, in my view, will need to be patient.""
Banks were outperforming the market on Thursday on renewed hopes for stimulus pact after U.S. President Donald Trump said, without giving details, that there was a good chance of a deal. 
But as of Thursday afternoon there was no deal although U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were set to continue with talks.
Meckler says further stimulus would be ""a good first step towards a better environment for (banks) to generate top-line and bottom-line growth.""
But he does not see stimulus as a panacea to provide much change to low interest rates, low borrowing and weak credit, which has plagued the sector.
Money manager Villere & Co has been drawn by low valuations in bank stocks such as First Hawaiian (NASDAQ:FHB) Inc, down 44% year-to-date, and  Kearny Financial  (NASDAQ:KRNY) Corp, off 41% so far in 2020.
Lamar Villere, co-portfolio manager, says these banks are small enough that he can more easily examine their risks than the exposures of more geographically diverse and larger banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co or  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co . 
But even this cautious strategy is only suitable for those who can ""wait it out long term,"" said Villere who expects weaker results from the sector in the short and intermediate term. 
""What's baked in is some pretty terrible numbers,"" he said.
JPMorgan and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) will start the ball rolling on the third-quarter earnings season on Oct. 13 followed by Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) the next day. 
On average the S&P 500 bank sector is expected to show a third-quarter earnings decline of 31% and a revenue decline of 6.7%, according to estimates gathered by Refinitiv. 
The majority of big U.S. banks did manage to beat very low earnings per share and revenue expectations for the second quarter, according to Refinitiv. 
But for now, John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio is staying away from the sector citing weak net interest margins. 
""Banks need to deliver this quarter,"" Augustine said.

1658,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 10:15AM ET</span>",Huawei ousted from heart of EU as Nokia wins Belgian 5G contracts,"By Supantha Mukherjee and Mathieu Rosemain
STOCKHOLM/PARIS (Reuters) - Orange and Proximus have picked Nokia (NYSE:NOK) to help build 5G networks in Belgium as they drop Huawei amid U.S. pressure to exclude the Chinese firm from supplying key telecoms equipment. 
The moves are among the first by commercial operators in Europe to drop Huawei from next-generation networks and come after months of diplomatic pressure from Washington, which alleges Huawei equipment could be used by Beijing for spying. 
The Belgian capital Brussels is home to the NATO alliance and the European Union's executive and parliament, making it a matter of particular concern for U.S. intelligence agencies. 
""Belgium has been 100% reliant on Chinese vendors for its radio networks - and people working at NATO and the EU were making mobile phone calls on these networks,"" said John Strand, an independent Danish telecoms consultant.
""The operators are sending a signal that it's important to have access to safe networks.""
The United States welcomed the decisions by Orange Belgium and Proximus, which have a network sharing agreement.
""This is the latest example of evaporating Huawei deals and further confirmation of this worldwide momentum towards trusted vendors,"" said Keith Krach, the U.S. undersecretary at the State Department for economic growth, energy and the environment.
Huawei [HWT.UL], the world's biggest telecoms equipment supplier, strongly denies the U.S. allegations and has been highly critical of calls to ban it from 5G contracts. 
However, it said on Friday it accepted the decisions by Orange Belgium and Proximus, which confirmed an earlier Reuters exclusive.
""This is the outcome of a tender organised by operators and the result of the free market,"" a Huawei spokesman said. 
""We embrace fair competition, the more diversified a supply chain the more competitive it becomes,"" he said, adding Huawei had been supplying equipment in Belgium for more than a decade and its commitment remained unchanged.
The decisions leave Liberty Group's Telenet as the only mobile carrier in Belgium yet to say which supplier it will use for its next mobile networks. Telenet currently relies on equipment made by China's ZTE (HK:0763), and plans to announce its 5G decision in the first half of 2021, a spokeswoman said. 
CLOSER SCRUTINY
The deals to supply radio gear to Orange Belgium and Proximus are a boost for Nokia, which struggled to make headway in the 5G market earlier this year even as Huawei was under pressure.
""I have tried to become RAN (radio access network) supplier to Orange Belgium since 2003 when the company was still Mobistar. Here we are, finally,"" tweeted Tommi Uitto, president of Nokia Mobile Networks.
The companies did not disclose a value for the contracts.
Nokia shares were up 3% in afternoon trading.
Orange Belgium and Proximus said Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) would supply the core of their 5G networks, a smaller slice of business.
EU members have been stepping up scrutiny of so-called high-risk vendors. This subjects Huawei's governance and technology to critical examination and is likely to lead other European operators to strip it from their networks, analysts say.
Nokia and Ericsson have been the main beneficiaries of the challenges facing Huawei. From Bell Canada and Telus (NYSE:TU) Corp in Canada to BT in Britain, the Nordic companies have been grabbing market share from the Chinese firm.

Separately, Nokia said it had won a contract to provide data management software to Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) UK, which said the Finnish firm would replace the less than 1% of Huawei kit in its network.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday, on course for their highest weekly close in over a month, on sustained hopes that warring factions in Washington will still cobble together a stimulus package for the economy before the elections in November.
The time for any such package to have any effect on the economy, or even on consumer and business confidence, before the vote is fast running out. That is heaping pressure disproportionately on the administration, given polls showing a widening gap between President Donald Trump and his Democratic Party challenger Joe Biden. Trump had abruptly called off negotiations with House Democrats earlier in the week, only to backpedal over the next 48 hours. 
The market shrugged off newswires reports citing Senate Leader Mitch McConnell as telling an event in Kentucky that a deal is ""unlikely in the next three weeks."" 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 131 points, or 0.5%, at 28,547 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.8%.
The most prominent gainer was chipmaker Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), which rose 17% after The Wall Street Journal reported that it's in advanced talks to be acquired by rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in a deal that would value it at over $30 billion. The high price tag knocked AMD stock down 2.4%.
Another chipmaker stock,  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI), rose 4.6% after it said demand had recovered faster than it had expected in a release of some preliminary third-quarter numbers. NXP's guidance for third-quarter revenue was some 13% above consensus forecasts.
Another riser was Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) stock. The biotech company rose after final data from a study of its remdesivir Covid treatment showed the drug cut recovery time by five days compared with patients who received a placebo.
Data transfer company Fastly (NYSE:FSLY), which counts TikTok and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) amongst its biggest customers, also renewed its seemingly unstoppable rally, rising another 6.9% to a fresh all-time high. It's now increased five-fold since April, making it one of the biggest winners of a pandemic that has massively accelerated long-term trends towards greater Cloud usage.
Among the losers,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) slipped another 0.7% despite speculation that it could soon become the target of activist investors. Exxon earlier this week lost its crown as the U.S.'s most valuable oil and gas producer to  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) - the first time that's happened since it was carved out of Standard Oil."
1660,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>","White House Open to Bigger Stimulus Bill as Mnuchin, Pelosi Talk","(Bloomberg) -- The White House shifted tack on Thursday, signaling that the administration is again leaning toward a large-scale stimulus bill after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed back on the idea of individual measures for parts of the economy hit by the Covid-19 crisis.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Pelosi in a 40-minute call that President Donald Trump wants agreement on a comprehensive stimulus package, according to Drew Hammill, a Pelosi spokesman.
Meanwhile, White House spokeswoman Alyssa Farah said, “we’ve made very clear we want a skinny package,” though she later clarified that position, telling reporters the administration is “open to going with something bigger.” She reiterated opposition to the $2.2 trillion plan from House Democrats.
Prospects for coming to an agreement have proved volatile since Trump pulled his negotiators out of talks on a comprehensive package on Tuesday.
Stocks, too, have proved volatile, with airline shares rising and falling on shifting indications of the potential for a separate aid package for the industry. The broader S&P 500 Index climbed for a second session Thursday, after a tumble Tuesday, when Trump pulled his negotiators from stimulus talks.
‘Testing, Tracing’
Pelosi sent a letter to House Democrats Friday morning casting further doubt on negotiations.
“The Administration does not share this priority of crushing the virus. The President does not have the capacity, leadership or plan for testing, tracing, and isolation that is needed,” Pelosi wrote. “Instead, Trump’s delay, denial, distortion of reality and disdain for science has exacted a deadly and preventable human toll.
Mnuchin and Pelosi held a follow-up call Thursday afternoon with House Small Business Committee Chairwoman Nydia Velasquez and Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT) about small businesses and access to capital.
The negotiations are proceeding against a frenzied backdrop, with the president recuperating from Covid-19 and the final stretch of the election campaign under way. Pelosi and Trump publicly questioned each other’s ability to perform their jobs on Thursday.
The House speaker said earlier Thursday there could be no action on a stand-alone bill to aid airlines or any other sector of the economy without an agreement with the White House and Republicans on a broader stimulus package.
Pelosi said airline aid could move through Congress before a comprehensive deal is voted on -- but that would have to be advanced in the “context” of a broader bill. “I have made the case to my colleagues that this is a special case,” Pelosi said on Bloomberg TV.
“There is no stand-alone bill without a bigger bill,” she said. Pelosi has also said this week she is pressing for language that would limit Trump’s ability to divert virus testing and treatment funds to other projects.
“I’m always optimistic,” Pelosi said. “Maybe the president seeing the reaction to his walking away from the table is the opportunity that we have for them to come back to the table for us to get an agreement -- and the sooner the better.”
Trump’s Shift
Trump changed course soon after his Tuesday tweet that ordered an end to talks until after he wins the election, blaming Pelosi for not negotiating in good faith. That move baffled Trump’s allies and created the political risk he’d be blamed entirely for the economic fallout. On Thursday, he told Fox Business that talks on a stimulus plan are now “starting to work out.”
Trump on Thursday claimed that multiple separate measures, including $1,200 individual checks, are on the table.
“We started talking again. And we’re talking about airlines and we’re talking about a bigger deal than airlines,” Trump said in the Fox Business interview. “We’re talking about a deal with $1,200 per person, we’re talking about other things.”
Speaking later in Kentucky, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the two sides should continue to try to negotiate a deal, but there are “vast differences about how much we should spend.”
“The speaker insists on an outrageous amount of money” McConnell said, adding that there are members of his GOP majority that think enough has been done already. “Hopefully there will be a way forward soon.”
The comments marked a shift for McConnell, who earlier this week said he supported Trump’s decision to call off talks.
The Democratic plan calls for $2.2 trillion in spending, while Mnuchin has offered $1.6 trillion. The administration’s figure is higher than what many Senate Republicans have said they could support.
Even if there were a breakthrough in Pelosi’s talks with Mnuchin, negotiations among House Democrats and the Senate’s calendar make it unlikely that a comprehensive stimulus package or a stand-alone bill to help airlines -- which are already hemorrhaging tens of thousands of jobs -- will reach the president’s desk before the end of October.
While a measure could pass quickly if no lawmaker in either chamber objects, that’s unlikely to happen. Two Republican senators, Pat Toomey and Mike Lee, said in a statement Thursday that they oppose a bailout for the airline industry without some protections for taxpayers and the ability to make changes to the legislation.
Without additional aid, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. will cut more flights in addition to jobs, said Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker. The carrier began implementing 19,000 layoffs last week.
“There will absolutely be discontinuation of service to small communities and there will be much less service to larger communities,” Parker said Thursday in an interview with CNBC.

LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls Royce (L:RR) shares on Friday were heading for their best weekly gain since listing in 1987 as the British aircraft engine maker's plan to raise money to cope with the coronavirus travel crisis triggered bargain hunting among investors.
The value of Rolls Royce shares more than doubled in the last week to 228.90 pence, although that is still a far cry from the 690 pence they traded at before the coronavirus outbreak.
The company aims to raise a total of 5 billion pounds, including 2 billion from shareholders, to cope with a ""worst case scenario"".
""(The recapitalisation plan) sets up Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) sufficiently to navigate an uncertain recovery and removes any lingering concerns about liquidity - and even solvency,"" said Berenberg analyst Andrew Gollan, keeping a ""buy"" rating on the stock.
Worries over a long-haul travel slump reduced Rolls Royce's market value to just 3.8 billion pounds ($4.9 billion) from 20.5 billion pounds two years back.
""There is a clear willingness to go bargain hunting as traders begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG. 
Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) said there has been ""renewed retail investor interest"" with Rolls Royce shares the most purchased by her clients in the week ending Oct. 8.
The Capital Group of Companies, a major investor, raised its stake in Rolls to 8.70% from 7.91% on Thursday.
Rolls Royce shares were up 17.8% on Friday by 1136 GMT, among the top performers on the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index. Analysts said the stock still looked cheap.

1663,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>",Ant’s IPO Runs Low on Time to Avoid U.S. Election Turbulence,"(Bloomberg) -- Jack Ma’s Ant Group has a narrow window to make its much-anticipated market debut ahead of U.S. election turbulence. Now its bankers must grapple with any potential delays stemming from a debate in Washington over restrictions on the payments behemoth.
Discussions over how and whether to restrict Ant -- as well as Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.’s payments systems -- have accelerated among senior U.S. officials in recent weeks though a decision isn’t imminent, Bloomberg reported.
They come as Ant is expected to raise about $35 billion from simultaneous initial public offerings in Shanghai and Hong Kong as early as this month. China’s biggest payments company already has approval for its mainland listing, but is waiting for a hearing with the Hong Kong stock exchange. That green light would need to come roughly by the middle of October if Ant aims to beat the U.S. presidential vote on Nov. 3.
The Hong Kong hearing before a 28-member panel of external professionals was expected last week but has yet to happen. If it’s delayed much further, the IPO risks straddling the U.S. election where some expect a surge in postal ballots to create a prolonged period of uncertainty. The one-week gap in Hong Kong between the pricing of an IPO and the start of trading means investors would be left exposed to an increase in market volatility.
China’s foreign ministry said the U.S. was abusing the concept of national security during a Friday briefing.
“Without being able to produce any substantial evidence, the U.S. has been cracking down on non-American companies that have gained a competitive edge,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. “This has fully exposed some U.S. politicians’ intention to rob Chinese companies and their ugly faces of economic bullying.”
Ant is said to be targeting a valuation of $250 billion, which would make it one of the world’s most valuable financial firms ahead of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). Its attraction rests on its reach into the pockets of more than 700 million monthly users, most of whom are in China where the ubiquitous Alipay app offers everything from loans and travel services to food delivery. Still, potential U.S. restrictions would raise questions about Ant’s overseas ambitions and could hurt its relationships with American firms.
“Ant’s business is mostly in China and is self-sufficient,” said Ram Parameswaran, founder of San Francisco-based Octahedron Capital Management, which owns shares in Ant’s affiliate  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and plans to invest in the IPO. “It is highly unlikely that U.S financial institutions will be banned from doing business with Ant.”
Ant declined to comment in an emailed statement.
Potential options the Trump administration could consider range from a U.S. ban to the far more damaging possibility of putting Ant on a specially designated national list, which would turn one of China’s crown jewels radioactive for any U.S. company.
Its guideline for Tencent’s instant-messaging app WeChat could offer clues to how the U.S. might handle the payment platforms. It has allowed U.S. companies to continue working with WeChat outside of the U.S.
Institutional investors in America will have less of an impact on the demand-supply equation with Ant as the listings are focused on Hong Kong and Shanghai, Parameswaran said.
Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte plans to invest more than $1 billion in Ant shares, according to people familiar with the matter. State investor Temasek Holdings Pte, China’s $318 billion National Council for Social Security Fund and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund are among those who’ve been reported to be weighing investments.
Early feedback prompted Ant to decide against locking in cornerstone investors for the Hong Kong leg, confident there would be plenty of takers, people familiar have said.
“There is great demand from clients and global asset managers,” said Joel Ng, an analyst at KGI Securities (Singapore) Pte. “Most of Ant’s business is in China and the rest of Asia so U.S. restrictions will not be a huge deal.”
According to Ant’s IPO prospectus, it gets less than 5% of its revenue from outside China. And only a tiny portion of that is from the U.S., a person familiar has said. Even so, a ban on Ant doing business in the U.S. could curb the potential for growth in the future.
Alipay has also become a less dominant part of Ant’s business in recent years, accounting for just 36% of its revenue in the first half of this year. Its single biggest revenue maker is now its micro-lending platforms.
With a dominant position in China, Ant has been spreading its reach into the rest of Asia, where it is working with digital payment providers in India and Thailand as well as peddling its expertise in wealth management and risk controls.
“The domestic market is quite penetrated already by Ant and WeChat Pay, so the future growth is going to have to come through international expansion,” said Martin Chorzempa, research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The key question for a Chinese fintech is whether it can expand internationally.”"

1667,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Rise 107 Pts; Semiconductors in Focus,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Friday, continuing the week’s strong tone, as investors retain hopes of a new stimulus deal to boost the country’s stuttering recovery.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 13 points, or 0.4%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 107 points, or 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 29 points, or 0.3%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Thursday 0.4% higher, while the S&P 500 index climbed 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.5%. These stock indices are at their highest levels since early September, gaining in eight of the last 11 sessions.
Driving a lot of these gains has been the belief that the U.S. lawmakers will eventually get together with a fresh stimulus deal to help the country’s labored recovery from the pandemic. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are still deadlocked, however, against a backdrop of shifting comments from President Donald Trump.
“By most accounts, the practicalities of passing a comprehensive bill by the end of the month are challenging and we would be wary of attributing market optimism to this factor only,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
The need for additional stimulus has been made clear by the latest employment data. Thursday’s jobless claims and last week’s nonfarm payrolls both showed that unemployment in the world's largest economy remains historically high and a recovery in the labor market is losing momentum.
The World Health Organization reported a record one-day increase in global coronavirus cases on Thursday. This was led by a surge of infections in Europe, but also included several U.S. states seeing record hospitalizations in recent days.
In the corporate sector, the semiconductor sector is likely to be in focus Friday after the Wall Street Journal reported that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is in advanced talks to buy rival Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), in a deal that could be worth more than $30 billion. Additionally,  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI) reported stronger than expected preliminary third quarter revenue and profit numbers.
Oil prices weakened Friday, consolidating after a week of strong gains on the prospect of tighter supply. This follows a strike in Norway, the world's third largest exporter of oil and gas, and as Hurricane Delta shuts 92% of the Gulf of Mexico's oil output, the most since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
U.S. crude futures traded 1% lower at $40.80 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.8% to $42.98. Both contracts are still on course for gains of around 10% this week.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.4% to $1,921.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% higher at 1.1803.

1669,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>","Honda makes a U-turn to catch U.S. truck, SUV trend","By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co (T:7267) is redesigning the looks and the marketing for its sport utility vehicles and trucks to appeal to U.S. consumers who are paying premiums for rival automakers' vehicles that offer a more rugged, off-road adventure image.
Since the 1970s, Honda has been synonymous in the United States with understated, well-engineered and highly efficient cars such as the Honda Civic and Accord. Honda's SUVs, minivans and its Ridgeline pickup truck are built on the smooth-handling chassis of those sedans. 
But over the past five years, U.S. consumers have shifted toward larger vehicles with all-wheel drive, beefed-up suspensions, big grilles and body armor designed for plowing over desert paths and mountain trails - though most such vehicles never leave pavement.
 Ford Motor Co 's (N:F) new Bronco sport utility and its F-150 Raptor model are chasing this trend.  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) is expanding its Jeep brand to harvest more profit from a segment it dominates.
More than 70% of vehicles sold in the United States last year were midsize trucks and SUVs, while 53% of Hondas sold fit those categories. Honda does not sell a large pickup that competes with the Ford F-150, and is therefore shut out of one of the U.S. market's most profitable segments.
""We are not on trend with the rest of the industry,"" Jay Joseph, Honda's U.S. automobile marketing vice president, said during a conference call. 
Honda on Thursday unveiled a new look for its midsize Ridgeline pickup, giving the vehicle a bigger grille and other off-road cues. A new advertising campaign launching on Friday shows the Ridgeline hauling dirt bikes and charging down unpaved roads in the Rocky Mountains. Former wrestler John Cena gives the ads a ""tough guy"" voice.
Honda is hoping the new approach will boost Ridgeline sales to 50,000 trucks a year from about 33,000 in 2019, Joseph said.
The automaker has forecast a 68% decline in global operating profit for the current fiscal year that ends March 31, mainly due to the sales lost to the pandemic. 
Honda's Passport midsized SUV will be one of the next models to get the off-road makeover, Joseph said. The five-seat Passport is outsold nearly seven to one in the United States by the Jeep Grand Cherokee, according to sales data compiled by Automotive News.

1670,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 05:38AM ET</span>",StockBeat: LSE's Borsa Sale to Euronext Unlocks Refinitiv Deal,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The biggest stock exchange deal in Europe in years is finally complete.  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE) said on Friday it’s agreed to sell Borsa Italiana, which includes the historically lucrative MTS trading platform for Italian bonds, to  Euronext  (PA:ENX) for 4.325 billion euros ($5.1 billion).
While not a transformative deal in itself for either, it’s a substantial win for both parties, as Euronext, which owns the Paris, Amsterdam and New York stock exchanges, gets to strengthen its presence in the European Union’s biggest bond market while LSE gets over one of the biggest stumbling blocks in the antitrust review of its deal for Refinitiv.
Refinitiv is the rebranded data operation of what used to be called  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) before it was bought by a Blackstone-led consortium back in 2018 (Blackstone (NYSE:BX) reportedly is set to double its money in the process).
LSE originally agreed to buy it for $27 billion over a year ago, but the acquisition, which promises to make LSE a worldwide competitor to Bloomberg in the sale of financial market data, has been stuck in Brussels amid concern about a possibly excessive concentration of such data.  
The review hasn't been made easier for either the EU or LSE by the fact that the U.K. is trying its hardest to put itself outside the reach of EU regulation and has sent increasingly strong signals that it intends to go its own way as soon as the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st.
LSE said it now expects the Refinitiv deal to go through by early 2021.
LSE’s shares have risen by over 56% since the deal was first announced, and anticipation of the Borsa Italiana deal closing has kept them well bid in recent weeks. The shares rose another 0.5% on Friday. Euronext shares, which have participated in full measure in the frothing rally of financial marketplace stocks this year, fell 3.7% but they’re still up by one-third year-to-date.
The deal comes just at a time when doubts are starting to emerge about the value of that MTS franchise. Trading Italian bonds was a fantastically profitable thing to do when volatility was high during the euro crisis, but the EU’s recovery fund and the European Central Bank’s 1.35 trillion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program – the ultimate monetary fire blanket – have dampened volatility in a market worth over 2 trillion euros.
Just as importantly, recent local elections suggest Italy’s long flirtation with the kind of populist agenda that infuriates its Eurozone neighbors to the north is fading. That’s allowed Italian 10-Year bond yields to plummet to a record low of 0.73%, with the spread over 10-year German bonds also falling to its lowest in four years, at a mere 127 basis points.
That trend decline in volatility has also been visible elsewhere recently, in interdealer broker TP ICAP's  (LON:TCAPI) decision to spend $700 million on U.S. equity trading platform Liquidnet, in an effort to grow beyond its traditional swaps and bond businesses. 
If the death of bond volatility in the post-pandemic world turns out to the broader phenomenon that many say, that will play to Refinitiv's strengths in foreign exchange and equity indices, which is where volatility is migrating to, at the expense of Bloomberg, which is still largely a fixed-income powerhouse. While LSE's owners might not have been able to foresee that when they made their move, it looks an even cleverer deal now than it did 12 months ago.

1671,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>",'Treasuries on steroids': U.S. banks' mortgage bond trading bonanza,"By Kate Duguid and Lawrence White
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street banks are on track for a record year of revenue from trading U.S. government-backed mortgage debt, industry sources told Reuters, amid a surge in demand - from the Federal Reserve in its battle against the pandemic, and from investors hunting yield.    
Revenue from trading bundles of home loans at the biggest global banks - including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citi and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) among others - is expected to top $3 billion in 2020, one source with direct knowledge of the banks' trading revenue said, besting last year's peak of $2.5 billion.
The source declined to be identified because the data isn't publicly available.
""Buying mortgages in March was one of the best trading opportunities in mortgages since the last financial crisis,"" said Daniel Hyman, head of agency MBS portfolio management at Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO). 
The surge in demand and activity has also allowed new names to enter the space. Bank of Montreal, which acquired mortgage security broker-dealer KGS-Alpha Capital Markets in 2018, is now actively trading residential mortgage-backed securities or RMBS, according to the source.
Bank of Montreal and JPMorgan did not respond to a request for comment. Goldman Sachs and Citi declined to comment.
The trading boom is likely to provide a silver lining in an otherwise tough period for U.S. banks amid record low interest rates and rising bad debts. They start reporting third-quarter earnings next week, with JPMorgan and Citi kicking things off on Oct. 13.
The Fed's coronavirus stimulus measures are responsible for the rally in mortgage bonds guaranteed by government agencies Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC), say investors.
The premia that investors demanded to hold these bonds over risk-free Treasury debt, as measured by the Ginnie, Fannie and Freddie MBS ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA indexes, were the widest since the 2007-2009 financial crisis in mid-March. That was just before the Fed announced it would increase its holdings of the securities, which are known as agency RMBS.
Since then, the Fed has bought more than $600 billion of agency RMBS and the spreads have narrowed by more than 50 basis points.
Graphic: U.S. March mortgage trade was golden opportunity - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjpqnboyvx/Pasted%20image%201602066583313.png
But the Fed isn't the only one buying. Demand for safe-haven assets jumped when the pandemic first roiled financial markets, and has persisted since. Investors have rushed into agency RMBS, which have the benefit of government backing, while also offering a higher yield than Treasury debt.
Yields on Treasury bonds have fallen to all-time lows since the Fed cut interest rates near zero. 
""Agency MBS are Treasuries on steroids,"" said Greg Parsons (NYSE:PSN), chief executive officer at Semper Capital Management, a hedge fund specializing in mortgage-backed securities.
Some investors who bought heavily in March are making more than a percentage point in yields above the benchmark, according to investors, a huge return in this rate environment. The PIMCO Ginnie Mae fund has returned 4.59% in the year through August, versus its benchmark at 3.32%.
THE PRE-PAYMENT RISK
Average daily trading volume in agency RMBS hit a peak in March of this year, according to data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and new issuance in 2020 stood at a record $2.6 trillion by the end of September.
Agency RMBS differ from the non-agency variety which gained notoriety for their central role in the 2008 crisis. If a homeowner defaults on a mortgage that is packaged into an agency RMBS, the agency -- Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae -- makes up for that defaulted principal. Investors in non-agency RMBS, however, absorb the loss.
Though defaults pose less of a problem, agency-backed RMBS do face a significant risk from borrowers pre-paying the mortgage, which shortens the duration of the security, reducing the number of installments paid to investors.
Pre-payments increase dramatically when low interest rates enable borrowers to refinance loans.
Semper Capital is not investing in traditional agency RMBS for precisely that reason.
""If there's one specific issue that is limiting the return potential on the agency side it is that pre-payment speeds remain elevated, which on the non-agency side is a strong positive for credit quality and performance, but on the agency side is really holding back price,"" said Parsons.
But banks are likely to keep buying. Though they may be overtaken by the Fed this year, commercial banks are still currently the largest holders of agency MBS. Flooded with deposits during the coronavirus crisis, big banks have put that money to work in agency MBS, among other securities, bringing their holdings to $2.3 trillion according to Fed data.
""If you talk to a Wall Street firm, they're making huge money selling to banks right now,"" said Ken Shinoda, portfolio manager at DoubleLine, which manages strategies that invest in both agency and non-agency MBS.

""There is just insatiable demand for agency mortgages by all the depository institutions. And deposits are up. Savings rates are up. Everyone is kind of hoarding cash.""

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - World shares pushed on from one-month highs, with Asian stocks closing in on two-and-a-half-year highs, as expectations grew of a Democratic victory in U.S. elections next month, reviving hopes for more U.S. stimulus.
A widening lead for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and the possibility his party will win both the Senate and the White House in the Nov. 3 vote has raised the prospect of a big economic stimulus. 
The possibility of stimulus is also helping to counter investor wariness about a Democrat pledge to hike corporate tax rates.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.3%, set for its second straight week of gains. Wall Street futures (ESc1) were up 0.4%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.3%, inching closer to its Aug. 31 peak, which was its highest level since March 2018. China's CSI300 index (CSI300) gained 2% after the Golden Week holidays.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) dipped 0.1% after reaching a seven-and-a-half-month high.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up 0.1% at a more than one month high. 
On Wall Street on Thursday, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.80% and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 0.5%.
In a sign markets are pricing in a Biden victory, clean energy-related shares have outperformed in recent weeks. The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (O:ICLN) has gained 14% so far this month, compared with 4% gains in the S&P 500 energy index.
""Biden seems to have a clear lead following the TV debate and a coronavirus cluster in the White House, which has raised questions about Trump's crisis management capabilities,"" said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities.
A new Reuters/Ipsos poll found Americans are losing confidence in U.S. President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. His net approval on the issue that has dropped to a record low.
The November contract of Volatility Index futures  dropped to 30.25, its lowest level in three weeks, another sign of reduced worries about a contested election.
""The rise in U.S. yields, particularly at the long end, suggests increased expectations of a blue wave in the election,"" said Koichi Fujishiro, economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield has risen 8.5 basis points so far this week, to 0.779% (US10YT=RR). It hit a four-month high of 0.797% on Wednesday, but has slipped in part due to weak economic data.
The 10-year German bond yield was unchanged at -0.525% (DE10YT=RR). Other core yields were a touch lower (FR10YT=RR), (BE10YT=RR).
Data on Thursday showed the number of jobless claims in the U.S. came in 20,000 higher than economists expected at 840,000, showing unemployment in the world's largest economy remains historically high and a recovery in the labour market is losing momentum.
Additionally, the World Health Organization reported a record one-day increase in global coronavirus cases on Thursday, led by a surge of infections in Europe.

The Chinese yuan was the biggest beneficiary of the rising hopes of a Biden win, posting its biggest daily rise in more than four years after the holidays.
The yuan  was last up 1.2% at 6.7112 per dollar in onshore trade and up half a percent to 6.7024 per dollar offshore .
The euro (EUR=EBS) rose 0.1% to $1.1776, while sterling  added 0.2% to $1.2961 but fell against the euro after worse-than-expected UK gross domestic product data.
Oil prices edged up, propelled by supply outages caused by a storm in the Gulf of Mexico and a strike of offshore workers in Norway. Both benchmark contracts were on course for their biggest weekly gains since early June. [O/R]

1673,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 05:15AM ET</span>",Judge upholds majority of Canada's privilege claims in Huawei CFO's U.S. extradition case,"By Moira Warburton
(Reuters) - A judge has upheld the majority of Canada's privilege claims over documents sought by lawyers for Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in her U.S. extradition case, Canada's justice department said late on Thursday.
In August Meng's lawyers argued for the release of more confidential documents relating to her December 2018 arrest in Vancouver, including emails between Canadian and American authorities, to support their claim that her rights were violated by the authorities.
Lawyers representing David Lametti, Canada's justice minister and attorney general, had handed over some documents requested by Meng's lawyers, but have declined to release additional documents claiming solicitor-client and litigation privilege.
The Canadian Department of Justice said in a statement that Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes of the British Columbia Supreme Court ""upheld a majority of Canada's privilege claims.""
""Canada respects the decision... and the court process that led to this decision,"" the statement added.
Meng was arrested in Vancouver, British Columbia on a warrant from the United States, charging her with bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC on Huawei's [HWT.UL] business dealings in Iran and causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions.
She has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition while under house arrest in Vancouver.
Huawei lawyers were also denied access to related documents by a federal court ruling that came down in Canada's favour in August. Government lawyers had argued that releasing the documents would threaten national security and a federal judge agreed, saying the information requested was not relevant to Meng's arrest.
Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The text of the decision was not immediately available from the B.C. Supreme Court.

Meng is set to next appear in court on Oct. 26, as hearings continue over whether Canadian and American authorities committed abuses of process while arresting her. The extradition hearings are expected to last until April 2021.

1675,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 05:06AM ET</span>",LSE agrees to sell Borsa Italiana to Euronext for $5 billion,"By Maya Nikolaeva and Rachel Armstrong
PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) -  Euronext  (PA:ENX) is to buy Borsa Italiana from  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) for 4.3 billion euros ($5.1 billion) in cash, the companies said on Friday, in a major expansion of the French operator's network of European trading platforms. 
LSE entered exclusive talks with Euronext last month after the Paris bourse owner saw off competition from Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) and Swiss rival SIX.
The deal could bring LSE a step closer to winning approval for its $27 billion purchase of data provider Refinitiv, which is 45% owned by Thomson Reuters (TO:TRI), the parent company of Reuters News. LSE put Borsa up for sale to alleviate the European Commission's concerns about its control over the European bond market.
While LSE said it would have preferred to keep its Italian arm, it will bank a significant profit on the 1.6 billion euros it paid in 2007 when buying Borsa. 
For Euronext, which operates bourses in Paris, Amsterdam and Dublin among others, the deal will bulk up its equity operations, with the combined group operating exchanges with more than 1,800 listed companies and an aggregate market value of around 4.4 trillion euros. 
Borsa's bond trading platform MTS will also give Euronext its first foray into fixed income trading. 
""Euronext will significantly diversify its revenue mix and its geographical footprint by welcoming the market infrastructure of Italy, a G7 country and the third largest economy in Europe,"" Euronext CEO Stephane Boujnah said in a statement.
According to Jeffries analysts, the deal values Borsa at 16.7 times 2019 EBITDA earnings before synergies versus the 15.5 times average for recent market infrastructure mergers and acquisitions ""which we think looks reasonable as exchanges of this size and quality rarely come to market"".
FUNDING
However it will be a big deal for the French market operator, which has a market value of around 7 billion euros, to swallow. It plans to issue 1.8 billion euros in debt and raise 2.4 billion euros in new equity to fund it.
Its share price was down 3% and LSE’s up 0.4% by 0833 GMT.
""Overall, higher synergies coming at a higher price and a bigger rights issue than we expected,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said in a note.
Euronext said the transaction was expected to be immediately accretive to its adjusted earnings per share before synergies. Based on its 2019 financials, the combined group would have generated 1.3 billion euros in revenue. 
The sale of Borsa is politically sensitive in Italy due to its ownership of MTS, which handles trading of Italy's 2.1 trillion euro ($2.5 trillion) government bond market.
To secure the Italian government's backing, Euronext has teamed up with state agency Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and Italy's biggest bank Intesa SanPaolo (MI:ISP), who will subscribe to 700 million euros of Euronext's equity issue. 
The sale is contingent on the European Commission formally stating it will only approve LSE's Refinitiv deal if all or part of Borsa Italiana is sold. 
""We believe the sale of the Borsa Italiana group will contribute significantly to addressing the EU's competition concerns,"" LSE Chief Executive David Schwimmer said in a statement. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) were among the advisors to LSE, Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) advised CDP, while Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) and JP Morgan helped Euronext.

1676,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>","Exclusive: HSBC targets net zero emissions by 2050, earmarks $1 trillion green financing","By Lawrence White, Sinead Cruise and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) will target net zero carbon emissions across its entire customer base by 2050 at the latest, and provide between $750 billion and $1 trillion in financing to help clients make the transition, Chief Executive Noel Quinn told Reuters.
The pledge is the strongest statement by Europe's biggest bank on climate change to date, although it met with criticism from some environmental groups for not taking more immediate action to curb its fossil fuel financing.
""COVID has been a wake-up call to us all, including me personally. We have seen how fragile the global economy is to a major event, in this case a health event, and it brings home the reality of what a major climate event could do,"" Quinn told Reuters in a video interview.
HSBC aims to achieve net zero emissions in its own operations by 2030, he added.
While other UK banks such as NatWest (L:NWG) have already set similar net zero goals, HSBC's aim to achieve it across its huge Asia-focused client base is one of the most significant pledges made by a global lender to date.
However, the bank will be closely watched for how quickly and fully it pursues its new goals, which are mainly stated as aims rather than hard commitments.
It will also face scrutiny on whether it has allowed itself leeway to continue financing some fossil fuel-linked clients, especially in developing markets. 
HSBC has come under increasing pressure from activists, shareholders and politicians who say it is contributing to climate change by financing environmentally harmful projects.
Quinn said the bank was focused on expanding its capital markets-focused carbon transition policies to a broader one encompassing all its activities across financing, asset management, and corporate and retail banking.
""What we have given the market is an ambition that our total financing by 2050 will be net zero, that is a far bigger prize or goal than picking a sub-segment of our portfolio and saying 'I am not going to bank you' because that's not what the world needs,"" he said.
""That industry or that customer may then just go to Bank X, Bank Y or Bank Z. They won't have changed their business model.""
LAGGING PEERS
Critics have said HSBC lagged peers in responding to the climate challenge and risked losing out to rivals such as  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) that are ahead on setting carbon reduction targets. 
This week, Wall Street heavyweight JPMorgan (N:JPM) became the latest bank to expand investment in clean energy and work towards net zero emissions by 2050, in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate.
With many Asian clients directly connected to or reliant on the coal sector - from which emissions are a leading contributor to global warming - HSBC is in a relatively tougher position.
It gave no detail on plans to tighten its policy on lending to the coal industry - still a key driver of many Asian economies - in a move likely to anger campaigners.
Instead, the bank said it would apply ""a climate lens"" to financing decisions and would also continue to take into account ""the unique conditions for our clients across developed and developing economies"".
Several pressure groups said they were disappointed the bank was not taking more immediate action.
""The very bare minimum would be to immediately exclude all companies with coal expansion plans and require others to adopt a coal exit strategy, as BNP Paribas and many more serious banks have already done,"" said Lucie Pinson, founder and executive director at Reclaim Finance.
Adam McGibbon, UK energy finance campaigner at Market Forces, said the plan was ""zero ambition, not ‘Net Zero Ambition.’.... If you want to know what HSBC's stance on climate change really is, look at what they fund, not their fluffy marketing.""
Jeanne Martin, senior campaign manager at ShareAction, said that, while welcome, the commitment to net zero by 2050 was ""becoming the baseline in the banking industry"".
""As Europe’s second largest financier of fossil fuels, we urge HSBC to commit to a global coal phase out and take immediate steps to curb its fossil fuel financing.""
The ramped up financing plans, including infrastructure projects, equate to a seven-fold increase compared with HSBC's last financing climate pledge of $100 billion, made in 2017, with investments making up the remainder. 
To help stakeholders track its journey to net zero, HSBC said it would use the science-based Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment tool (PACTA) and would report on progress regularly.
In addition, the bank said it would work with peers, central banks and industry bodies to help create ""a globally consistent, future-proofed standard"" to measure financed emissions and a ""functioning carbon offset market"".

HSBC will also aim to invest $100 million in clean technology, and donate a further $100 million towards climate innovation ventures and renewable energy sources, alongside its previous commitment of funding to a new natural capital venture.

1679,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 04:18AM ET</span>",Half a Billion Trips Show China’s Moving Past Covid,"(Bloomberg) -- Hotel prices shot up, ride-hailing apps crashed, tickets to the Great Wall sold out: after more than nine long, housebound months, almost half a billion Chinese people are taking a vacation.
With the Covid-19 pandemic largely under control in China, the Golden Week holiday is putting on display the country’s confidence in its economic rebound and its public health measures. Through the first four days of the week-long holiday that started Oct. 1, some 425 million local trips were taken, according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, nearly 80% of last year’s level.
The surge of activity stands in stark contrast to the rest of the world -- the global tourism industry is expected to lose at least $1.2 trillion in 2020 -- and underscores the relative strength of China’s economic recovery. As of September, the OECD forecast a 1.8% expansion this year, putting China alone among the Group of 20 on pace to expand.
That positive outlook assumes the country can avoid another wave of coronavirus and the aggressive lockdowns China’s used to quash it. As millions crisscross the country during the holiday that marks the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, no virus tests or quarantines required, the risks grow. Late last month, China opened its borders to foreign nationals holding valid residence permits.
“There is undoubtedly a risk in allowing mass tourism to resume and, in some ways, this is an early exercise in what the rest of the world will have to go through as global travel restarts next year,” said Nicholas Thomas, associate professor in health security at the City University of Hong Kong.
China hasn’t reported any local virus infections since Aug. 15, though it found two asymptomatic cases in late September, and the government has eased almost all of its peak-Covid travel restrictions. The ban on group tours was lifted in the middle of July, every district in every city has been designated ‘low-risk,’ and coronavirus test results are no longer required for cross-province travel.
“We have gone at least six weeks without reporting a single confirmed case domestically, which means the environment accessible by ordinary people is virus free,” said Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center of Disease Control and Prevention, at a briefing in Beijing last week. “The chance of you running into an asymptomatic person is very very low, almost negligible.”
Other countries are more reluctant to endorse a return to 2019-style vacationing. South Korea, for example, which has seen daily new cases hover around 100 a day, tightened social distancing rules for two weeks of back-to-back holidays starting in late September. European cities and countries are instituting new restrictions in an effort to fight a new wave of the pandemic sparked by summer travel.
In China, tourists seem confident. “I’m not worried about the virus,” said 35-year-old Zora Li, who plans to fly Beijing to the southern Chinese province of Guangxi with her two children and her parents, their first trip of 2020. “I don’t have a choice. The kids can only travel during vacation.”
Sold Out
She wasn’t the only one ready for a change of scenery. Flight bookings for the holiday were up 11% compared with 2019, according to a report from travel data and analytics agency Cirium. Reservations for domestic hotels began rising near the end of August, and prices soared: As of Sept. 10, the average hotel booking cost around 20% more this year compared with last year, according to data released by travel booking site Qunar.com Inc.
Ride-hailing apps Didi and Dida crashed as the holiday period began on Sept. 30, according to local news agency Xinhua. Some 11.7 million passengers traveled by train on Oct. 3, down just 15% from 2019.
Tickets at the Badaling section of the Great Wall sold out by mid-morning on Oct. 3, the first time daily tickets have sold out since late March. Popular sites from the Forbidden City in Beijing to the Mogao Grottoes in Gansu province were fully booked before the holiday started.
Other Chinese destinations saw an influx of domestic tourists who might have otherwise spent the week abroad. While foreign travel isn’t explicitly banned, the lack of flights and onerous quarantine and testing requirements for re-entry has discouraged most people. Tibet, Xinjiang and Ningxia were among regions where spending rose fastest on Oct. 1 and 2, based on China Unionpay data reported in Xinhua. Hotel spending in Tibet more than doubled from a year earlier, and food-and-beverage spending jumped 49%.
Beach Holidays for Some in China, Belt Tightening for Others
Kick-starting economies hobbled by the pandemic has been tricky. In the U.S., Japan and almost everywhere else, eagerness to reopen the economy -- or reluctance to close it -- has led to new waves of infection, often worse than the first.
Since the coronavirus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, the government has used its unchecked authority to lock down cities, require testing and track the movements of infected people. Still, as recently as late last month, Qingdao, a coastal city, found two asymptomatic coronavirus cases, the first in five weeks without local transmission. Some frozen seafood imports have also been banned, after the virus was found in some samples.
“We will only know how successful China has been 2-3 weeks after the holidays as we see how many new infections emerge,” Thomas said. “If they manage to avoid an upsurge in cases, it will be evidence that China is truly moving into a post-Covid period.”
The specter of Covid and the fragile recovery are still taking a toll. Even travelers may not be ready for a Golden Week spree. Through the first four days of the holiday, tourism revenue was 312 billion yuan, according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, down 31% from the same period last year.
And plenty of people are still staying home. Shirley Zhang, a 29-year-old auditor in Shenzhen, canceled her travel plans this year, including a long-planned trip to Japan.
“This year is so difficult for everyone,” she said. “Some of my friends lost their jobs lately. For first time in my life, I feel I need to save some money for future uncertainties.”"

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher in cautious trading Friday, helped by growth in China’s service sector as well as renewed confidence of a U.S. stimulus package but with coronavirus worries ever present.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.4% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.4%. 
Earlier Friday, China’s Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index rose to 54.8 in September, against August’s reading of 54, remaining in positive territory for a fifth consecutive month, suggesting the second largest economy in the world is quickly returning to health.
However, the economic news was less impressive in Europe. 
Britain's economy grew much more slowly than expected in August, with gross domestic product rising by just 2.1% from July, its slowest month-on-month increase since the economy began its recovery in May.
Additionally, French industrial production rose 1.3% in August from July, increasing at a much slower pace than in previous months, data from France's statistics agency Insee showed Friday.
Worries about the coronavirus continue to haunt the European markets, particularly after the World Health Organization reported a record one-day increase in global coronavirus cases on Thursday, led by a surge of infections in Europe.
More French cities are set to close bars in the coming days as Covid-19 infections spike, a move Berlin is set to adopt as Germany’s capital has one of the worst outbreaks in the country. In the U.K., some 17,540 new cases were logged Thursday, a rise of more than 3,000 from Wednesday.
Still, hopes of a coronavirus stimulus package are a boost to the markets with Democrat House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin continuing efforts to reach a consensus.
In corporate news, Danish jewellery maker Pandora (OTC:PANDY) stock jumped 13% and German online fashion company  Zalando SE  (DE:ZALG) rose 4.6% and Danish pharma company Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) gained 3.3% after all raising their outlooks for 2020.
British brokerage TP ICAP (LON:NXGN) fell 1.3% after agreeing to buy electronic trading network Liquidnet Holdings for up to $700 million, in a deal that will be partly funded via a $425 million rights issue.
Oil prices edged higher Friday, continuing a week of strong gains on the prospect of tighter supply given a strike in Norway, the world's third largest exporter of oil and gas, and the approach of Hurricane Delta in the Gulf of Mexico.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $41.28 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.3% to $43.46. Both contracts are on course for gains of around 10% this week.

LSE, which is selling Borsa Italiana to get approval from the European Union for its $27 billion Refinitiv deal, announced the transaction in a statement Friday after exclusive talks between the parties started last month.
The LSE will sell its entire shareholding for 4.3 billion euros in cash plus an additional amount reflecting cash generation through to the deal’s completion.
“We believe the sale of the Borsa Italiana group will contribute significantly to addressing the EU’s competition concerns,” said David Schwimmer, LSE’s chief executive officer. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of next year.
Adding Borsa Italiana would give Euronext about a quarter of all equity trading in Europe and mean that 28 of the Euro Stoxx 50 companies are listed on its markets. Bloomberg News first reported about the deal completion Thursday.
Borsa Italiana is seen as a strategic asset in Italy because of its ownership of MTS SpA, a platform used to trade government bonds, and the Italian government has sought to engineer a deal for months. Euronext, the owner of the Paris and Amsterdam exchanges, is bidding with Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA, a state-backed lender, and Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) SpA, Italy’s biggest bank. Those institutions would take stakes in Euronext.
Euronext will finance the deal through 1.8 billion euros of new debt and a 2.4 billion euro capital raise, including a 700 million euro private placement with CDP and Intesa SanPaolo, and a rights offer to existing shareholders.
Italian institutions will also have the right to name the new chairman of Euronext. Their combined stake will be at the same level of French shareholders, Euronext CEO said last month.
The deal is the second major transaction involving Italy’s CDP announced this week, after Nexi (MI:NEXII) SpA agreed to buy SIA SpA to create one of Europe’s biggest payment providers.

1685,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>",It's a rough ride for Spanish firms in the liquidity trap,"By Belén Carreño
MADRID (Reuters) - Brother and sister Juan and Dolores Balsa applied for emergency state loans in April to keep their funfair business in the northern Spanish city of Coruna afloat despite having to shut because of the pandemic.
But with a second wave of coronavirus infections keeping the bumper cars and toddlers' joy ride firmly shuttered, they lost out on the late-summer revenues they hoped would help pay off the loans. Now, the family business is in a fight for survival.
Their plight is being mirrored by other small enterprises across Spain, whose economy has been the worst hit in Europe but which cannot offer the same level of support to its companies as its wealthier neighbours to the north.
""We need to pay for a lot but there's no money coming in,"" Dolores, who runs the toddlers' rail circuit, said as she listed the mountain of fixed costs from insurance premiums through to expenses related to their truck that keep building up.
Spanish companies already endured one of Europe's toughest lockdowns earlier this year as the country became one of the region's epicentres for the virus. A fresh surge in infections is compounding the hit to the economy, which is expected to shrink by more than 11% in the year as a whole.
Yet fiscal aid to prop up the economy only amounted to 3.7% of GDP against 8.3% in Germany, the Brussels-based think-tank Bruegel estimates. That left small Spanish companies rushing to take up short-term loans as their only lifeline.
""The greater recourse to guaranteed loans in Spain can be partly attributed to the lower availability of alternative fiscal relief measures for corporations,"" the European Central Bank said in its September bulletin. 
Spanish companies have taken 102 billion euros of emergency loans compared with 70 billion by their German counterparts, which the ECB noted had access to ""other policy measures"". One such support is the generous ""Kurzarbeit"" wage subsidy scheme.
All across Europe, policy-makers face the dilemma of deciding which businesses have been made unviable by the pandemic and so should be allowed to fail, and which are facing short-term difficulties and should be kept afloat.
Alicia Coronil Jonsson, chief economist at Singular Bank, says it is patently clear that once the pandemic abates, the tourism sector in Spain can return to being the economic mainstay it has been for decades.
""Tourism is not a zombie sector. Life will return to its former self,"" said Jonsson, who is calling for an extended waiver on loan repayments and extra aid for small business.
In Spain, such support is all the more pressing because small companies make up a huge 95% of the economy and typically have less access to long-term finance than larger firms - a fact the IMF has identified as a vulnerability for the economy.
That has led some critics of the government to argue that state-backed loans were precisely the wrong policy tool.
""Liquidity assistance is an absolute trap,"" said Eduardo Abad, the president of one of the UPTA association of self-employed workers. ""This leads us to over-indebtedness.""
The Balsas, who currently rely on modest unemployment benefit for day-to-day household bills, are a case in point.
At present they are using Juan's 20,000 euro loan to cover the 900 euro monthly instalments on an existing 60,000 euros of debt. But from next April they will have to start paying off the emergency loan too, plus Dolores' separate 8,100 euro credit.
""At the time I asked for these credits, I could pay for the instalments,"" said Juan Balsa, arguing that what he needs is an extension of the moratorium to hold them over at least until their main season gets going next June.
Official data in August showed the toll already taken on the small business sector: at least 85,000 businesses have collapsed since February and 83% of them had fewer than five workers.
Asked for comment, a spokesman for the Economy Ministry said that, while the overall term of state-backed loans was set at five years under EU rules, the length of the grace periods was for individual banks to set.
Like the funfair siblings, thousands of self-employed Spaniards applied for state-backed loans with grace periods between six months and one year, meaning the first payments fall due from this month.

Santiago Carbó, Professor of Economics at the University of Granada, said that meant things were about to get worse: ""If the crisis drags on, delinquency will increase significantly.""

1686,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 01:45AM ET</span>",Total Adds Fuel-Cell Truck Maker to Alternative Energy Bets,"(Bloomberg) --  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) is making an investment as part of a small funding round in U.S. fuel-cell truck startup Hyzon Motors, an effort by the French oil giant to boost development of cleaner energy sources.
The strategic investment was made by the company’s venture-capital arm, Total Carbon Neutrality Ventures, and included other investors such as Ascent Hydrogen Fund, Hydrogen Capital Partners and Audacy Ventures Ltd. The size of the round was not disclosed but totaled more than $15 million and valued Hyzon at around $200 million, according to people familiar with the matter. It could rise to $20 million, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing private information.
The funding follows other recent alternative-energy investments made by Total, including production of electric-vehicle batteries and biofuels. It and other European oil companies are ramping up their exposure to renewable energy as governments, consumers and investors demand swifter moves to tackle climate change.
“We are pleased to partner with Hyzon, one of the leading suppliers of hydrogen-fuel-cell-powered commercial vehicles and look forward to working closely with them as they expand their operations around the world,” Girish Nadkarni, Total Carbon Neutrality Ventures’ chief executive officer, said in a statement.
Former GM Plant
Earlier this year, Hyzon was spun out of Singapore-based Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies Pte Ltd., which has been developing fuel-cell technology for commercial applications for more than 17 years. The startup makes hydrogen-powered big rigs, buses and coaches.
It plans to use the new funding to support engineering and manufacturing of fuel cells at its headquarters, a former General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). facility in Honeoye Falls, New York. In July, Hyzon announced plans for a plant in the Netherlands as part of a joint venture with Holthausen Clean Technology BV. It also has unspecified manufacturing activities with an undisclosed partner in Shanghai, China.
Hydrogen-powered commercial-vehicle technology has been in the spotlight since Nikola Corp. gained a public listing through a reverse merger in June without having sold a single vehicle. Last month, GM took a $2 billion stake in Nikola, agreeing to build its pickup truck and provide fuel-cell technology for its big rigs. Nikola has also held talks with energy giant BP (NYSE:BP) Plc over a network of hydrogen fueling stations, crucial for making hydrogen-powered big rigs mainstream.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp., Hyundai Motor Co (OTC:HYMLY) and other global automakers also aim to bring hydrogen-powered semi trucks to market.
Hyzon says it already has around 400 commercial vehicles on the road using its own fuel-cell technology. It expects to deliver about 5,000 fuel-cell-powered trucks and buses in the next three years, targeting an annual capacity of 40,000 vehicles by 2025. In August, Hyzon penned a deal with Australian mining company Fortescue Metals Group (OTC:FSUGY) Ltd. to build a fleet of hydrogen-fuel-cell buses.
“Unlike some of its startup competitors, Hyzon has strong backing,” said Asad Hussain, an analyst at researcher Pitchbook. “In our view, Hyzon represents an example of fuel-cell electric vehicles gaining traction in the freight sector.”

1687,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 01:15AM ET</span>",Investors' bets on a Democratic sweep grow after Biden debate performance,"By April Joyner and David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The debate between Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and President Donald Trump, marred by frequent interruptions and name-calling, did little to enlighten the electorate. But it was enough to turn the consensus on Wall Street toward Biden.
The fractious Sept. 29 faceoff led to a jump in Biden's lead over President Donald Trump in several national polls, fueling moves in a broad range of assets sensitive to a decisive Democratic victory, from clean energy companies and U.S. govenrment bonds to foreign exchange derivatives that hedge against market volatility. 
A second debate - which may be delayed or not take place at all - “is critical for the president, but I don’t think it matters at all to Biden. He can coast to the election,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group.
The former vice president opened up a 10-point advantage among likely voters in an Oct. 3 poll by Reuters/Ipsos, a 1 to 2 point increase over his previous lead, following the presidential debate.
Despite the skepticism about opinion polls after Trump's surprise win in 2016, investors have since increased bets that the Democrat will have a clearcut victory. 
""Our highest probability is of a Biden win and a Democratic sweep and that keeps increasing,"" said John Briggs, Americas head of strategy at NatWest Markets. ""We had some client pushback on that idea but after the debate that turned around quite a bit."" 
Graphic: Betting markets : Biden's lead - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmbzwdpr/Pasted%20image%201602189822327.png
Shares of alternative energy companies, which analysts expect to prosper from policies under a Biden administration, have climbed sharply since the debate.
In currency markets, bets on post-election volatility are waning - evidence of investors positioning for a strong win for the Democrat. In Treasury markets, a bout of selling on expectations of a hefty Biden-led stimulus package has helped send yields to their highest levels in months.
""Pence delivered his messaging better than Trump, but I want to see how Trump performs in the next debate,"" said Akira Takei, global fixed income fund manager at Asset Management One in Tokyo, after Wednesday's vice presidential debate between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris. ""It may appear that Biden has the lead, but I don't trust the opinion polls.""
    A Biden victory is far from a foregone conclusion, and investors continue to hedge their bets. The Democratic candidate's widening lead, for example, has done little to dispel expectations of post-election volatility in stock options, which continue to anticipate market swings persisting into the end of the year.
""The (options) market is just pricing in that question mark,"" said Jon Cherry, global head of options at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Capital Markets in Chicago.
Investors also remain on guard against possible reversals in sentiment in the race. Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas, is holding around a fifth of his portfolio in cash.
""Those polls measure the popular vote,"" Phipps said. ""The popular vote doesn't decide the presidency.""
Graphic: Positioning for U.S. election volatility - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-MARKETS/BIDEN/azgpoaodapd/chart.png
A basket of stocks tracked by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co, which includes green technology and trade-linked companies that would likely benefit from Democratic policies, has outperformed a basket of companies that could be hurt by a Biden presidency by about 10% between early September and Wednesday, according to a Reuters analysis.
Per Stirling's Phipps said his portfolio's biggest winners had been in the alternative energy space. ""Every time Biden's poll numbers go up, those investments go up,"" he said. 
The rising probability of a Democratic takeover of Washington by winning the presidency and control of the Senate has also helped push U.S. Treasuries out of a range in anticipation of Democrats passing a broad stimulus plan.. 
Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasuries could rise as high as 1.25% with a Biden victory, up from its current level around 0.75%, NatWest's Briggs said.
Graphic: The Biden bump - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmvjbaxavr/Pasted%20image%201602189648995.png

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 12:45AM ET</span>",China funds targeting Ant IPO rake in $9 billion from over 10 million investors,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Five newly launched Chinese funds targeting Ant Group's upcoming mega stock listing raised 60 billion yuan ($8.93 billion) cumulatively from more than 10 million retail investors, selling out within days, the funds' distributor said.
An average of eight investors placed orders each second during the subscription period, highlighting retail frenzy over Ant's initial public offering (IPO) despite possible U.S. sanctions against the Chinese fintech giant.
The rush also underscores the marketing clout of Ant's online payment platform Alipay, the sole third-party distributor of the five mutual funds that threatens to disrupt traditional fund sales models.
Ant ,  Alibaba  Group's (N:BABA) fintech arm, aims to raise about $35 billion in a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai's STAR Market, expected in October, in what could become the world's largest IPO.
The five funds launched on September 25 to raise 12 billion yuan each and invest up to 10% of their assets to buy Ant's IPO shares as strategic investors.
Two of the funds, launched by E Fund Management Co and Penghua Fund Management Co, hit their fundraising target even before the week-long Chinese National Day holiday that began on October 1.
As business resumes on Friday, Alipay announced that the other three funds, managed by China Asset Management Co (ChinaAMC), China Universal Asset Management and Zhong Ou Asset Management Co, were also sold out.
The market has so far brushed aside worries that Ant's IPO could suffer from any U.S. restrictions, after a Bloomberg News report saying U.S. President Donald Trump is considering curbs on Ant and Tencent (HK:0700) over concerns their payment platforms threaten national security.
The successful fund sales could give a boost to Ant's rapidly growing wealth management business. Revenue from this business segment jumped 56% during the first half of 2020, and Ant's fintech platform has facilitated investments worth over 4 trillion yuan.

1689,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 12:09AM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Up, Following U.S. Stimulus Hopes","By Adam Claringbull
Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly up on Friday morning, tracking with U.S. markets and the news that Democrats and Republicans were continuing to try and iron out a COVID-19 stimulus deal. China’s markets also came back on stream after the Golden Week national holidays.
Hopes for a U.S. coronavirus stimulus package were raised yet again, with President Trump making a U-turn on his Tuesday decision to cancel talks on a deal. Democrat House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are continuing efforts to reach a consensus, though the two sides are still far apart in their conceptions of the shape of the package.
Markets are also starting to factor in the possibility of a Democrat clean sweep in the upcoming U.S. elections, with recent polling suggesting that both President Trump and his Republican Party will lose both the presidency and control of the Senate. Should the Democrats control both houses of government and the presidency, a much larger stimulus package is expected, though not until the transference of power is complete.
“Biden seems to have a clear lead following the TV debate and a coronavirus cluster in the White House, which has raised questions about Trump’s crisis management capabilities,” Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities, told Reuters.
China’s markets reopened today after the Golden Week holidays and quickly made up for lost time, with both the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses seeing rapid rises as investors looked to catch up with events. China’s Caixin Services rose to 54.8 in September, against August's reading of 54.
The Shanghai Composite rose 1.89% at 12:05 AM ET (4:05 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Composite jumped 3.21%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.39% and South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.21%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 inched up 0.02%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng inched down 0.09%.
U.S. jobless claims data came in higher than expected, suggesting that the world’s largest economy has quite some way to go yet before a recovery is on the cards. 840,000 Americans applied for unemployment claims during the past week against the forecast 820,000 claims, although the number was down from the previous week's 849,000 claims.
In the meantime, global COVID-19 cases hit a record one-day increase on Thursday, according to the World Health Organization, with Europe particularly affected. The U.S. also recorded a rise in cases in some 30 states."

BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Five Democratic U.S. senators on Thursday asked BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) to justify why it rarely supported shareholder resolutions tied to climate change issues despite its increased focus on the environment this year. 
The proxy voting record of the top asset manager is ""troubling and inconsistent,"" according to a letter sent to Reuters by the office of U.S. Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii and signed by four others.
In a statement sent by a spokesman, BlackRock said its work on behalf of clients includes both voting and engagement, or talks with corporate managers. It cited certain negative proxy votes cast this year and noted the company now more often publishes details about votes.
""We are currently reviewing our engagement priorities and voting guidelines,"" BlackRock said.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in January had vowed to press companies to do more to combat climate change, underscoring the shifting moods of clients and reflecting new money pouring into sustainable investing strategies.
But a pair of recent studies found that BlackRock supported climate-related proxy resolutions only around 10% of the time this year, in line with its past record. Other companies took a more aggressive tack this year, notably the asset-management arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (N:JPM)
Schatz's letter cited one of those studies and noted how in several cases BlackRock's support for management was decisive. He also wrote that BlackRock backed nearly all directors at oil, gas and utility companies.
Earlier on Thursday, speaking at an online news conference about efforts to limit climate change, BlackRock Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand said the company had appointed new leaders to its stewardship team.

""As a result of our commitment and these changes that were implemented during this transition year, you should certainly expect that our voting engagement outputs in 2021 around climate will look materially different from the past year,"" Hildebrand said.

1691,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 08:09PM ET</span>",Thai Petrochemicals Giant to Add Green Power to Cut Carbon Print,"(Bloomberg) -- Indorama Ventures Pcl, the world’s top producer of material used in plastic bottles and polyester, plans to quadruple its use of renewable energy over the next decade as part of efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions.
The Bangkok-based company will increase solar, wind and other renewable energy sources at its more than 120 manufacturing facilities worldwide to 30% of it power bill in 2030, said Chief Sustainability Office Yash Lohia. That’s an increase from 6%, he said, adding the move will help the company’s efforts to reduce its carbon footprint.
“We are going to install more solar panels at our facilities in Thailand, India and many other countries,” Lohia, the 33-year-old son of Indorama’s billionaire founder Aloke Lohia, said in an interview Tuesday. “We will also buy more clean energy from other developers to demonstrate our effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
Thai power producers including Gulf Energy Development Pcl, and B. Grimm Power Pcl are also accelerating investments in renewable energy as climate-change concerns prompt governments to turn to cleaner sources. Southeast Asia’s second-biggest economy plans to add at least 56,000 megawatts of new electricity capacity by 2037, with almost four-fifths of the amount set to come from renewables, according to the energy ministry’s website.
Indorama is also actively seeking recycling business acquisitions as part of a $1.5 billion spending plan to increase its reuse of plastic bottles in the production of polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, said Lohia.

With its business spanning the U.S., Brazil, China, India, France and Nigeria, Indorama’s customers -- especially beverage makers -- have raised the proportion of recycled materials in packaging to meet environmental regulations and funds’ investment policies, he said.
Indorama’s shares have slid 33% this year, compared with a 19% decline in the benchmark SET Index. The company’s first-half net income tumbled 88% as prices of its products fell amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.

1692,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 08:09PM ET</span>",China’s Solar Stocks Are Surging After Xi’s 2060 Carbon Pledge,"(Bloomberg) --
China’s massive renewable energy industry has seen shares soar since President Xi Jinping announced the country aims to go carbon neutral by 2060.
That surge is set to be supercharged Friday by mainland-listed solar giants like Longi Green Energy Technology Co. and Tongwei Co., which will be trading for the first time after a week-long holiday during which some peers in Hong Kong posted gains of more than 20%.
The furious rally illustrates the growth potential investors see in Beijing’s effort to go from the world’s biggest polluter to carbon neutrality. The shift could require anywhere from $5 trillion to $15 trillion in investment, much of it in wind- and solar-power generation.
The premium that mainland stocks, known as A-shares, normally have over Hong Kong counterparts has narrowed during the trading holiday, said Dennis Ip, an analyst with Daiwa Capital Markets. “So it’s very likely that A-shares of solar companies are going to have very good performances” on Friday.
China is home to the most solar panels and wind turbines in the world, and is also the leading manufacturer of both. Its companies are technology leaders in photovoltaic panels, which are seen as the leading source of future power, according to BloombergNEF.
Government officials are already considering proposals to accelerate adoption of clean energy, which would boost installations of solar and wind, in its next five-year plan, which begins in 2021.
Here is how some key companies have fared since Xi’s announcement, made in a Sept. 22 speech to the United Nations:
Stocks to watch Friday when mainland trading resumes include:
Longi and Tongwei will be able to move as much as 10% from their Sept. 30 finishes on Friday while Sungrow’s trading limit is 20%. The trio’s stocks have risen from 5% to 10% since Xi’s announcement.

1693,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 07:45PM ET</span>",Oil Set for Best Week Since May as Hurricane Shuts Gulf Output,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil in New York is poised for the biggest weekly gain since May with Hurricane Delta forcing operators to shut-in almost 92% of crude output in the Gulf of Mexico as it barrels toward the U.S. coast.
Futures edged higher for a second day and are up almost 12% this week. Delta regained major hurricane strength and is forecast to slam into the already battered Louisiana coast on Friday after barreling across the Yucatan Peninsula earlier in the week. Prices have also been buoyed by an oil-workers strike in Norway, which is threatening almost a quarter of its the nation’s output.
While oil has climbed back above $41 a barrel, further gains could be limited as fiscal stimulus talks in Washington drag on without resolution at a time when demand continues to be constrained by the pandemic. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said there could be no action on a stand-alone bill to aid airlines or any other sector of the economy without an agreement on a wider package.
OPEC expects to emerge from the pandemic with a greater share of global oil sales, after 2020’s price downturn battered rivals in the U.S. and elsewhere. The producer cartel has boosted forecasts for the amount of oil it will need to supply over the next four years, shifting last year’s prediction that it would lose market share until the middle of the decade.

The Justice Department said Yale's discrimination on the basis of race and national origin violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Thursday's lawsuit followed a two-year investigation that followed a complaint by Asian-American groups about the New Haven, Connecticut-based university's practices.
The Justice Department said in August it was prepared to sue if the school did not take ""remedial measures.""
Yale had no immediate comment on the lawsuit. It has previously denied accusations of discrimination, and has said it cooperated with the government's investigation.

The Justice Department has previously filed legal briefs supporting a lawsuit by affirmative action opponents accusing Harvard University of discriminating against Asian-Americans.

(Reuters) - U.S.-listed shares of major cannabis producers surged on Thursday after Democratic vice president nominee Kamala Harris said marijuana would be decriminalized at a federal level in the United States under a Biden administration.
During Wednesday night's debate with Vice President Mike Pence, Harris said she and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden would also expunge the criminal records of people convicted of marijuana-related offences in the past.
Cannabis stock tracker MJ ETF (P:MJ) rose 5.5% to mark its best session since early June, while  Tilray Inc  (O:TLRY) jumped 19.2% on the Nasdaq. U.S.-listed shares of  Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC) Corp (TO:WEED),  Aphria Inc  (TO:APHA) and  Aurora Cannabis  Inc (TO:ACB) closed between 10% and 13% higher.
Even though many U.S. states have legalized marijuana use, banks and other traditional financial institutions have so far largely refused to work with the industry as cannabis is still a classified substance at the federal level.
""Access to safe banking will transform the industry, freeing up capital markets for investment and reducing the risk of operating a cannabis business,"" said Keith Cich, co-founder of cannabis-related products manufacturer Sunderstorm Inc.
Regulatory issues have also restricted cash availability for companies in the nascent sector at a time when they are struggling with a lack of profitability due to high costs.
""From a business perspective, (decriminalization) will level the playing field by allowing companies to expense normal operational costs instead of being taxed on gross profit,"" said Sam Armenia, vice president at producer C21 Investments Inc (CD:CXXI).
Harris, who has supported cannabis decriminalization even before Biden picked her as his running mate, is the lead sponsor of the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act of 2019, which sought to end federal prohibition of marijuana.

BOSTON (Reuters) - ValueAct Capital Management, a long-time investor in  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), threw its weight behind the third largest U.S. bank in an unusually public way on Thursday by saying its share price could double in the near term.
""The upside is very compelling,"" Mason Morfit, chief executive officer and chief investment officer of the $12 billion investment firm said at the 13D Monitor Investor Summit on Thursday. He said the bank is inexpensive now and well positioned for growth.
Citigroup stock has languished compared to its peers as the bank struggled for years to convince Wall Street that it could reliably hit its financial targets. Shares have fallen 44% so far this year while the KBW Bank index has fallen 30%. 
Morfit spoke one day after U.S. banking regulators fined Citi $400 million and ordered it to repair its risk-management systems.
The government's rebuke was largely seen to have accelerated Citi CEO Michael Corbat's decision to retire early next year and hand the reins to Citi President Jane Fraser.
Morfit supported Fraser's appointment and said the firm, which has owned Citi shares since early 2018, was looking forward to working with her.
Citi's institutional clients group is a star business, Morfit said, saying that it alone is worth at least $70 to $110 per share, which is double what the stock is trading today.
He forecast this part of the business can continue to grow earnings per share over the next decade.
Citi's stock price, currently trading at $44.91, could jump to $80 in the near term and rise more to hit $150 over time, he said.
Morfit called Citi an ""irreplicable platform"" and said it is well positioned for long-term growth because it is stable, safe and steadily taking share. As its core platform ""chugs along,"" Morfit said the payoff will come as the company's return on tangible common equity can reach 15% to 16%.

ValueAct, which recently saw founder Jeff Ubben depart, is an activist investor that likes to work behind the scenes over years by advising senior management instead of waging noisy proxy fights. ""We try to transform companies from underachievers to overachievers,"" Morfit said, adding that ValueAct has in the past lost money on bets before they pay off big.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A top executive at Institutional Shareholder Services does not forecast big changes in how the firm interacts with clients and others after the U.S. government earlier this year adopted new rules on how proxy advisers like ISS advise in corporate votes.
""I don't see a fundamental change in the way we interface with companies and investors,"" said Cristiano Guerra, who weighs in on some of America's most hotly contested mergers and proxy fights as head of special situations research at ISS.
Two months ago ISS reactivated its lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after it crafted a new rule that will require proxy advisers to provide a copy of their reports to corporations at the same time they release them to clients. They will also have to inform clients if corporations plan to rebut their reports.
Proxy advisers and regulators have faced off for months as corporations have long argued that ISS and its main rival, Glass Lewis & Co, have too much power in guiding investors on hot-button issues like executive pay and should be more transparent in their recommendations.
""The efforts to silence ISS is a proxy for silencing shareholders,"" Guerra said at the 13D Monitor Conference on Thursday. He said it would be professional suicide if he favored 
the views of a specific investor client over another investor client in matters that ISS recommends on. ""I trust my team, I trust our analysis and I'm very comfortable with our track record,"" he said.

Guerra also said the pandemic has forced his team to alter work habits and conduct all business through phone calls rather than in person. He said he does not permit video meetings because Zoom calls can become too distracting with a large number of participants.
