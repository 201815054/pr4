LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) will use some of the savings from the new U.S. corporate tax cuts to give domestic employees pay raises, company stock and expanded benefits with a combined worth of more than $250 million, the company said on Wednesday. 
With the announcement, the world's biggest coffee chain joins companies like Walmart (N:WMT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) , Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) and  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) in sharing their tax savings with employees.
Starbucks is known for giving its workers, which it calls ""partners,"" more generous pay and benefits than other mass-market restaurants and retailers.
""Investing in our partners has long been our strategy, and due to the recent changes in U.S. tax law, we are able to accelerate some significant partner investments,"" Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said in a letter to employees. 
Starbucks declined to say how much it expected its tax bill to drop under the new plan, and said executives would give details on its earnings call on Thursday. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Jason West recently estimated that Starbucks' global tax rate could fall to about 24-25 percent from around 33 percent, which would drive roughly $425 million in annual tax savings.
Seattle-based Starbucks said it will give hourly and salaried employees, who received pay raises in January, a second wage increase in April. 
It is giving additional stock grants to eligible employees on April 16. Coffee shop workers will receive a grant of at least $500 and store managers will receive $2,000 grants. 
Starting July 1, all employees will accrue paid time off to care for themselves and loved ones when they are ill. Starbucks said the national benefit was designed to match or exceed the benefits some partners were already due under existing city or state-mandated paid sick leave laws. 

Starbucks also expanded its parental leave policy for cafe workers, giving non-birth parents up to six weeks of paid leave when welcoming a new child.

2,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Plug wars: the battle for electric car supremacy,"By Christoph Steitz
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmakers hope a network of high-power charging stations they are rolling out with Ford will set an industry standard for plugs and protocols that will give them an edge over electric car rivals.
At the moment, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and carmakers in Japan and Germany use different plugs and communication protocols to link batteries to chargers, but firms building the charging networks needed for electric vehicles to become mainstream say the number of plug formats will need to be limited to keep costs down.
Carmakers behind the winning technology will benefit from having an established supply chain and an extensive network, making their vehicles potentially more attractive to customers worried about embarking upon longer journeys, analysts say.
Manufacturers that back losing plugs, however, could end up with redundant research and development and may have to invest to adapt assembly lines and vehicle designs so their customers can use the most widespread fast-charging networks.
Swiss bank UBS has estimated that $360 billion will need to be spent over the next eight years to build global charging infrastructure to keep pace with electric car sales, and it will be key to limit the numerous technologies now in use.
""The quick-charging marketplace might be growing fast but the issue of different types of connectivity and communication will need to be resolved going forward,"" UBS said in a study published this month.
To try to build critical mass for the Combined Charging System (CCS) favored by Europe, BMW, Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler, Ford and the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) group, which includes Audi and Porsche, said in November they would develop 400 high-power charging stations on main roads in 18 European countries by 2020.
""In the end, it is about safe-guarding investments for those that are investing in electric mobility,"" said Claas Bracklo, head of electromobility at BMW and the chairman of the Charging Interface Initiative (CharIN), which is backing CCS.
""We have founded CharIN to build a position of power.""
It is still early days for electric cars and difficult to predict which plug technology will prevail or even whether there will always be different ways to charge vehicles, unlike the one-size-fits-all nozzle that can refill all petrol cars.
But there is a lot at stake for the carmakers ploughing billions of dollars into the development of batteries and electric cars.
FORMAT WARS
Besides CCS, there are three other standards that will charge batteries fast: Tesla's Supercharger system, CHAdeMO, or Charge de Move, developed by Japanese firms including carmakers Nissan and Mitsubishi, and GB/T in China, the world's biggest electric car market.
""I think over time CHAdeMO and CCS converge, likely into the current CCS standard, and the jury is out as to what will happen to Tesla,"" said Pasquale Romano, chief executive officer of Silicon Valley-based ChargePoint, which runs one of the world's largest charging station networks.
So far, there are about 7,000 CCS charging points worldwide, according to CharIN, with more than half in Europe. The European Union backs CCS as the standard for fast-charging but does not prohibit other plugs being installed.
That compares with 16,639 charge points compatible with CHAdeMO - most in Japan and Europe - and 8,496 Tesla Superchargers, with the majority in the United States. In China, there are 127,434 GB/T charging stations, according to the China Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Promotion Alliance.
Just as in previous format wars such as the battle for videotape dominance between VHS and Betamax, each charging standard has its pros and cons.
Tesla's system is exclusive to its clients, for example, while CCS features a double-plug that can charge DC and AC, increasing the number of spots where drivers can recharge.
CHAdeMO, meanwhile, allows cars to sell power from their batteries back to the grid, a process known as bi-directional charging that can help stabilize energy networks in times of demand swings and earn car owners some extra cash.
""If I were Nissan, I'd be wanting to take that standard and make it the dominant one,"" said Gerard Reid, founder of Alexa Capital that advises companies in the energy, technology and power infrastructure sectors.
""It creates a competitive advantage for them,"" he said. 
TIME IS TIME
Most plugs used to charge cars at home use alternate current (AC) and are slow, so building networks that can power vehicles fast when on the road is seen as key by the industry, given many potential consumers still worry about battery range.
Able to deliver more powerful direct current (DC), fast-chargers can load electric cars up to seven times faster.
The fastest DC stations, capable of delivering up to 400 kilowatts, can recharge cars within 10 minutes, a vast improvement on the 10-12 hours it can take to reload at some AC charging points today. 
Developers hope drivers will feel more confident about undertaking longer journeys if they know they can reboot with a quick pit stop similar to stopping at a petrol station.
With that in mind, the joint venture set up by the German carmakers and Ford to install CCS fast-chargers has teamed up with companies that have service station networks in Europe: Shell (LON:RDSa), OMV, Germany's Tank & Rast and retailer Circle K.
For traditional carmakers, getting ahead in the electric car race is also about staying relevant in an industry that has been shaken up by Tesla.
Elon Musk's company is now worth $11 billion more than Ford, even though Tesla delivered just 76,230 cars in 2016 while the U.S. car industry pioneer sold 6.65 million vehicles.
The German carmakers teaming up with Ford, however, believe their deeper pockets should give them the upper hand in the long run and they see charging technology as an important factor in the fight.
TIPPING POINT
For now, CCS, Supercharger and CHAdeMO plugs continue to be installed in Europe as well as the United States, while China is pressing ahead with GB/T, suggesting it is too early to call a winner in the plug wars - especially as no carmaker will want to lose out on the Chinese market.
Tesla, for example, said in October it was modifying its Model S and Model X cars for China to add a second charge port compatible with the country's GB/T fast-charging standard.
Most other rivals are also incorporating the GB/T standard into their vehicles for China, which has ambitious quotas for electric car sales, although some industry officials still hope the country will adopt one of the other standards at some point.
While sticking with developing its proprietary network for now, Tesla is a member of the CHAdeMO and CharIN initiatives. It is also selling adapters so owners of its cars in North America and Japan can use CHAdeMO charging stations.
Tesla declined to comment on whether it would consider joining a rival charging standard at some point, a move analysts say could be a tipping point in the race for plug dominance.
""For Tesla it was always very important to have a charging infrastructure for our clients from the get-go,"" a spokeswoman said, adding that it welcomed all investment in car charging.
Tomoko Blech, who represents CHAdeMO in Europe, said fussing over which standard would prevail was not helpful given that the electric car industry was still in its early days and carmakers should fight it out with their models.
Some also argue there will always be several ways to charge battery-powered cars.
""If you drive a petrol car you can fuel it any place in the world. This is the best you can get,"" said Nicolas Meilhan, principal analyst at consultancy Frost & Sullivan.
""You will not get that for electric vehicles.""

19,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>","As China's Didi looks abroad, challenges spring up at home","By Cate Cadell
BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing is on a roll overseas, snapping up assets in South America and flexing its financial muscles to drive growth.
At home, however, the road is bumpier.New rivals have cropped up since Didi vanquished Uber [UBER.UL] in China two years ago. Drivers complain that reduced subsidies mean they are working longer hours for the less pay. And increased attention from regulators and police has made it harder for the company to grow.
Didi, valued at more than $50 billion, is banking on its huge volume of rides in China as it squares off against Uber and other competitors globally. Any threat to its home dominance could take the gloss off its appeal for investors.
""Didi has to improve its profitability inside the Chinese market and expand overseas if it wants to make its story more convincing to investors, as the Chinese market is kind of reaching the roof,"" said Mo Jia, a Shanghai-based analyst at Canalys.
Didi, which has $12 billion in cash reserves following a recent $4 billion funding round, is pouring money into overseas expansion and projects like artificial intelligence. 
This month, it acquired control of 99, a Brazilian ride-hailing company. It has also started hiring in Mexico as part of a plan to enter the country this year and is looking to make inroads in Taiwan.
The company still holds more than 87 percent of the Chinese private ride-share market, but in the first weeks of 2018 several companies have signaled their intention to mount a challenge, including $30 billion valued on-demand services platform Meituan Dianping.
Didi is also dealing with the fallout of a costly subsidy battle with Uber in China. The company said it cut subsidies after the deal with its rival; drivers confirmed their incomes suffered as a result.
""In 2016 (Uber) and Didi were fighting like dogs. If you earned 100 yuan, they gave you 100 yuan in subsidies,"" said one Beijing driver, surnamed Hu, who said he took out a loan to buy his Honda Civic that year when earning more than 18,000 yuan a month. 
""Now I still work eight hours a day, six days a week, but if I'm lucky I earn 6,000 yuan,"" Hu said, adding that he had only managed to pay off the loan in December with help from his wife's family.
NEW RIVALS
In China, the number of rides per day on Didi's platform rose from 14 million to 20 million following the August 2016 deal with Uber. New regulations and a drop in subsidies caused a slump in the company's ride growth soon afterward, but company data shows rides bounced back to 20 million a day, then edged up to 25 million at the end of 2017.
But competitors are pressing in.
Meituan Dianping, backed by Sequoia Capital and Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), launched its first ride-hailing project in Nanjing last year and is rolling out seven more pilot projects in 2018, including in Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu, a spokeswoman said. 
""My hope is that (Meituan Dianping) will pay a lot of attention to attracting drivers,"" said a 28-year-old Beijing Didi driver surnamed Zhou, who says he has been too lazy to switch employers until now.
""If there's subsidies around their early launch then I'll definitely go to Meituan,"" Zhou said. ""I want to try something new.""
The internet company, better known for its ticketing and restaurant services, is hoping to gain an advantage from its sophisticated location-based technology, and lure drivers like Zhou, whose loyalty to Didi has suffered as pay has fallen.
Cao Cao, another platform backed by automotive giant Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175), which owns Swedish car brand Volvo, raised 1 billion yuan in funding this month and now has around 10 million users across 17 cities.
Popular bike sharing platform Mobike, also backed by Tencent, announced this month it would launch its own car ride-sharing platform in Guizhou province, backed by investors such as FAW Car Co Ltd (SZ:000800).
Didi says it has an advantage in technically complex services, such as the car-pooling feature that now makes up roughly 30 percent of its total private car rides and cuts down on the number of drivers required. 
""This market is not about burning cash, it's not about subsidies anymore. People want reasonable wait times (and) reliable service,"" a Didi spokeswoman said. 
TOUGHER RULES, ""FAST PASSENGERS""
All the companies will have to grapple with tightening Chinese regulations, already slowing growth in larger, congested cities. Migrant drivers, for example, cannot get a permit to work and live - called a hukou - in major urban centers such as Beijing and Shanghai. And cars used for ride-hailing services in those cities must be registered there.
""It has made the barrier to entry higher for all the ride-sharing players,"" Jia said. 
Drivers who evade the regulations can face big fines. Statistics released by Didi show that drivers accepted 13 to 40 percent fewer ride calls in some densely populated areas across China's largest cities. 
Two drivers in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou said sting operations involving police are common, where drivers are hailed by police and photographed.
""There's a couple of solutions,"" said one driver surnamed Deng, 41, who has been working as a Didi driver for four years in Guangzhou even though his car is registered elsewhere.
""You can put the trunk of your car up so they don't see your number plate, or instead of stopping you can drive very slowly past and the passenger gets in quickly"" to avoid police noticing a waiting car, Deng said.

""Times are tough,"" he added. ""So these 'fast passengers' make me especially happy.""

Analysts and fund managers reckon the Warsaw bourse can repeat at least some of this in 2018. Valuations remain low, economic fundamentals are supportive, and Warsaw's political battles with Brussels are mostly ignored by investors.
So Poland is again in the top five in value of the 34 countries ranked by Blodgett's company, California-based Accuvest Global Advisors.
""Poland has great momentum leading into this year and still has cheap valuations,"" he said. ""That could lead to another great year.""
In its favor, Poland is the biggest of the European Union's fast-growing eastern emerging economies. The local exchange's turnover is also by far the highest in the region. 
The global stocks rally may lose momentum, but the Warsaw Stock Exchange is still expected to post strong gains, even though the zloty is unlikely to repeat last year's surge against the dollar.
""(A stock index) increase at the level of 10-12 percent is still possible,"" said Ryszard Rusak, Investment Director for Equities at Union Investment TFI in Warsaw.
The median estimate in a Reuters survey of nine analysts projected a 7.6 percent zloty-denominated gain in the main index (WIG20) this year. 
POLITICS SHUNNED AS ECONOMY ROARS 
The market did not look a good bet when two years ago S&P downgraded Poland, blaming a weakened independence of key institutions under the government of the conservative PiS party.
Last month the European Commission launched a process to suspend Poland's EU voting rights over its judicial reform which Brussels says is a threat to the rule of law. Hungary has pledged to block the procedure.
""Investors generally ignore political risks (in Central Europe),"" said Viktor Szabo, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Investment Management. ""Premiers come and go, policies do not change much, budgets do not blow up, and the region performs well."" 
Indeed, rating agencies were most positive on Poland's outlook last year. Sectors including banks, which initially suffered under PiS rule, have improved their performance.
The currency helped. The zloty, along with the Czech crown, was the world's top-performing currency last year.
Its gains versus the Swiss franc (CHFPLN=), in particular, reduced political pressure for a forced conversion of franc-denominated mortgage loans at the cost of banks.
The franc's earlier strength made those loans sour and weighed on the dividends and prospects of Polish banks.
""It was a sword that hung over the banks,"" said Michal Sobolewski, analyst at DM BOS. 
With that problem fading, Warsaw-listed bank stocks have surged, igniting the bourse's rocket.
BANKS KEY DRIVERS
The Warsaw index of banks (BNKI), which have almost 40 percent weight in the bourse's blue chip index (WIG20) have started 2018 with record highs. 
""After banks hit the bottom in their profitability in 2015-2016 due to a bank tax and interest rate cuts, they are now improving it,"" said Kamil Stolarski, analyst at Pekao IB.
The sector's net interest income rose by 12.5 percent in annual terms in the January-November period. Net fee income was up 9.6 percent.
Margin's may rise if the central bank starts to raise its record low rates late this year or in 2019. 
""Banks are very cyclical,"" said Sobolewski. ""These factors should have even stronger impact in 2018."" 
Banks in the region are expected to perform strongly. A labour shortage boosts wages and investments, while lending is booming.
And while it is a deep-rooted view that the European Central Bank's monetary stimulus indirectly helped Central European asset prices, analysts said it was not a key factor.
""We don't believe that any (ECB) taper will hurt Poland or EM markets more than other markets, and instead rely on time tested principles to help us decide how to invest,"" said Blodgett.
What really counts is valuations, he added.
Poland still has a low price-to-book ratio of 1.38 and it has the lowest price-to-cash-earnings ratio at 5.6 among the 34 countries covered in Accuvest's model, compared with an average 10.7.

23,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 03:53AM ET</span>","Exclusive: China's state-owned firms to face more mergers, bankruptcies","By Soyoung Kim and Paritosh Bansal
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - China's state-owned enterprises will face more mergers and bankruptcies as the government overhauls the lumbering state sector, the head of the country's state asset regulator told Reuters.
In a rare interview with a foreign news outlet, Xiao Yaqing, chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), stressed Beijing's commitment to streamline its bloated and debt-ridden state-owned sector and create conglomerates capable of competing globally.
China embarked on a revamp of its state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in 2015 to tackle rising corporate debt and also to make them more profitable and responsive to market forces.
It has claimed progress in its SOE restructuring through mergers, reductions in excess capacity, the relocation of workers, closure of ""zombie"" firms, and implementing a controversial scheme under which debt is converted into equity.
""Our wish is for them to be bigger, stronger and more efficient. And this is what they're about to be in the future,"" Xiao told Reuters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday.
He said the focus would be to strictly separate government functions from the SOEs' business operations, though it was vital for the ruling Communist Party to retain control of the state sector during the process.
The number of enterprises administered by the central government has been reduced to 98 from 117 in 2012.
The merger of China's top coal miner, Shenhua Group Corp , and China Guodian Group Corp , among the country's top five state power producers, created the world's largest power utility worth $278 billion.
When asked about further SOE consolidation, Xiao said the number of central government-owned companies would continue to decrease through mergers in ""a voluntary process"", though the SASAC did not have a target for this reduction.
Xiao also pointed out the importance of the relocation of workers during the reforms, saying that SOEs, with the help from local governments, ought to create programs to absorb laid-off workers after consultation with them.
""We do not want them to be laid off or just fired in this process,"" he said. ""We need them to be allocated into new positions.""
PROFIT RECOVERY, CUTTING DEBT
Enterprises owned by China's central government reported robust growth in 2017, with total profit up 15.2 percent, the fastest in five years.
In the interview, Xiao attributed the rebound of SOEs' profitability to China's stable economic growth, rising commodity prices and ongoing state-sector reforms.
""We reduced a lot of 'zombie enterprises'. Now the management efficiency of the companies is significantly improved,"" he said.
The Communist Party's People's Daily reported this month that central government-owned SOEs had met their target of shutting 1,200 zombie enterprises by the end of last year. 
Moreover, state-owned enterprises will target coal capacity cuts of 12.65 million tonnes in 2018, and will also aim to reduce excess capacity in coal-fired power, non-ferrous metals, shipbuilding and construction materials.
Xiao said SOEs' leverage is at ""healthy levels"", and bankruptcies and liquidation have only happened at second-tier companies, not at the holding group level.
SASAC has pledged to further lower debt ratios of central government-owned firms by another 2 percentage points by the end of 2020.
Xiao expects market-driven SOE bankruptcies to continue.
""As long as you're market player, you have your good times and you have your bad times, and sometimes you just go bankrupt,"" Xiao said.
STRENGTHENING PARTY CONTROL
As SOEs spearhead investment in infrastructure projects overseas under Beijing's Belt and Road initiative, the strengthened leadership of the Communist Party at SOEs is raising concerns that political factors will be prioritized. 
The value of overseas assets held by China's centrally owned enterprises has exceeded 6 trillion yuan ($940 billion), with investments in more than 185 countries and regions.
While saying the government will slowly move to play a less direct role in the business operations of state firms, Xiao defended the Communist Party's control of the state sector. 
Imposing party discipline on state firms remains a key part in choosing top management and in fighting graft at SOEs, he said, adding that he did not see any conflict of interest between state political goals and commercial interests of SOEs.
""SOEs are owned by the general public, which means everyone in this country is a shareholder. Then we need a representative, which is the Chinese communist party, to supervise and play a scrutiny role for the companies,"" Xiao said.
Xiao said that during his meetings with CEOs in Davos, business leaders had expressed strong interest in China, in working with its SOEs and in the future of SOE reforms.
""I can't tell you what the SOE sector will be in 10 or 20 years, but we do hope that SOEs could be exactly like other companies: they will have higher liquidity of their assets and respond more efficiently to market changes,"" Xiao said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China’s HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL] said on Wednesday several global banks have given it a clean chit after conducting compliance checks, a rare bit of good news for the cash-strapped conglomerate amid questions about its governance and ownership.
HNA said in a statement emailed to Reuters that it has passed know-your-customer (KYC), or internal due-diligence checks, of JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), UBS Group AG (S:UBSG),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and Nomura (T:8604), among others, in the past few months.
The aviation-to-financial services conglomerate has been facing additional scrutiny and due-diligence checks from banks and regulators following its July announcement that it changed its shareholding structure, while indicating that two previously named shareholders were in fact proxies for company founders.
Several regulators have subsequently blocked or questioned its overseas deals. HNA has also recently struggled for cash, asking some lenders to extend loans and lessors to delay due payments in several cases. 
Banks are required to periodically verify the identities of clients through KYC, the most basic of checks. Clearances for HNA on KYC from the four banks would mean they have satisfied themselves about the conglomerate's identity and could pursue fundraisings and deals of HNA and its units, subject to other checks and requirements.

Ueki, a former pilot who was named president in 2012, will become chairman while Yuji Akasaka, currently managing executive officer in charge of engineering and maintenance, will become the new president, the company said.
Ueki is credited with being instrumental in revitalising the once-bankrupt carrier by slashing costs and clinching code-sharing deals. But his successor will face a tough road in gaining back market share from rival ANA Holdings (T:9202). 
JAL was freed from government-imposed restrictions on route expansion only last April, more than seven years after filing for bankruptcy and receiving a taxpayer-funded bailout.

ANA benefited from JAL's bankruptcy by winning slots at Haneda Airport, the airport preferred by business travelers departing from or arriving in Tokyo.

The closure of about 180 U.S. stores will begin in early February and continue until mid-April, Chief Executive David Brandon said in a letter on its website. Brandon, who joined as CEO in 2015 after spearheading a turnaround at Domino's Pizza Inc (N:DPZ), acknowledged gaps in customer experience during the vital holiday season but pledged to focus on improving shopping experience, both at its stores and online. The Wayne, New Jersey-based company, contesting growing competition from regional independent toy retailers and online giant Amazon.com (O:AMZN), will also roll out deep discounts and revamp its loyalty program to lure more shoppers. The company filed for bankruptcy protection just ahead of the 2017 holiday season in the United States and Canada to restructure $5 billion of long-term debt, casting doubts over the future of its 64,000 employees and nearly 1,600 stores. Toys ""R"" Us, which also operates the infant- and toddler-focused Babies ""R"" Us chain, has set aside more than $400 million out of its $3.1 billion in bankruptcy loans for sprucing up stores over the next three years with more experiences and better-paid staff.

All 83 Toys ""R"" Us stores in Canada will remain open, said president of the Canadian unit, Melanie Teed-Murch, in a letter to customers.

33,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 01:19AM ET</span>",Battle of the beans: Monsanto faces a fight for soy market,"By Rod Nickel and Tom Polansek
WINNIPEG, Manitoba/CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Monsanto  Co (N:MON) is facing major threats to its historic dominance of seed and herbicide technology for the $40 billion U.S. soybean market.
Rivals BASF SE (DE:BASFn) and DowDuPont (N:DWDP) are preparing to push their own varieties of genetically modified soybeans. At stake is control over seed supply for the next generation of farmers producing the most valuable U.S. agricultural export.
The market has opened up as Monsanto's Roundup Ready line of seeds - engineered to tolerate the weed killer glyphosate - has lost effectiveness as weeds develop their own tolerance to the chemical. Compounding the firm's troubles is a national scandal over crop damage linked to its new soybean and herbicide pairing – Roundup Ready 2 Xtend seeds, engineered to resist the chemical dicamba.
The newly competitive sector has sown confusion across the U.S. farm belt, particularly among smaller firms that produce and sell seeds with technology licensed from the agrichemical giants.
Many of these sellers told Reuters they are amassing a surplus of seeds with engineered traits from multiple developers - at substantial extra cost - because they can only guess which product farmers will buy.
""Our job is to meet our customers' needs, and we don't know what those are going to be,"" said Carl Peterson, president of Peterson Farms Seed near Fargo, North Dakota. ""I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this.""
Monsanto has much to lose. Soybeans are the key ingredient in feed used to fatten the world's cattle, pigs, chickens and fish. 
Net sales of Monsanto's soybean seeds and traits totaled almost $2.7 billion in fiscal 2017, or about a fifth of its total net sales. Gross profits from soybean products climbed 35 percent over 2016, beating 15 percent growth of its bigger corn seed franchise.
The firm faces multiple lawsuits, along with regulatory restrictions in some U.S. states, because dicamba has drifted onto neighboring farms and fields and damaged crops not genetically modified to resist it.

For a map on Monsanto's crop damage crisis, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2zHETwz
BASF and DowDuPont, however, have their own obstacles to overcome, fueling unprecedented uncertainty among farmers over which seeds they will plant on an estimated 90 million acres of U.S. farmland this spring.
BASF is just entering the market, aiming to compete with an older soybean line called LibertyLink, which the firm is acquiring from  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn). DowDuPont is eager to join the fray but needs approval from Chinese regulators before it can broadly market and sell its new soybean product, Enlist E3.
Monsanto declined comment to Reuters on competition from rivals in the soybean market. But the firm has previously acknowledged the intensifying threat to its bottom line as rivals launch new products. 
""Our competitors' success could render our existing products less competitive, resulting in reduced sales compared to our expectations or past results,"" Monsanto said in an annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last year.
DICAMBA DISASTER
The name of Monsanto's new dicamba-based herbicide - XtendiMax with VaporGrip - reflects the problem it tries to solve: the chemical's tendency to vaporize and drift to neighboring fields, damaging crops.
But last summer, after farmers planted Monsanto's new dicamba-resistant seeds en masse, the herbicide damaged an estimated 3.6 million acres of soybeans, or 4 percent of all U.S. plantings.
Monsanto maintains its new formulation of dicamba reduces drift effectively. It blames farmers for not following spraying instructions and for illegally applying older versions of dicamba on Xtend seeds.
Despite the controversy, Xtend soybeans have sold briskly, spanning 20 million U.S. acres in 2017, their second year of sales. Monsanto projects that acreage will double this year, accounting for about 44 percent of all planted acres. 
Still, Monsanto faces a slew of regulatory, legal and public relations challenges from the crop-damage crisis.
Regulators in Arkansas, where crops were heavily damaged in 2017, have prohibited the use of dicamba-based herbicides between dates that likely will cover the entire growing season. Missouri, Minnesota and North Dakota have also restricted when farmers can spray dicamba. 
Missouri farmer Bobby Aycock joined one of several class-action lawsuits against Monsanto after dicamba spraying by nearby farmers damaged his crops in 2016. 
He then planted Xtend in 2017 to ensure that drifting dicamba could not harm his crop again. He found another benefit at harvest time: his highest yield in 33 years of soybean farming.
Despite his lawsuit against Monsanto, Aycock plans to sow Xtend seeds again this spring.
""If something's working,"" he said, ""I hate to change it.”
BASF ENTERS BEAN BATTLE
BASF is waiting for Monsanto and Bayer to close their proposed $63.5 billion merger before it can take over Bayer's LibertyLink brand of seeds, which are engineered to withstand the chemical glufosinate.
The timing of the takeover, expected in the spring planting season, is awkward because farmers may have already bought seeds. BASF aims to prevent any ""customer disruption"" when it assumes control of the LibertyLink brand as part of a $7 billion deal with Bayer, BASF vice president Scott Kay said in an interview. 
BASF declined to elaborate further on its strategy because the purchase of LibertyLink is not yet completed.
The acquisition complements BASF's herbicide business with a seed line that should ""continue to grow profitably,"" BASF's outgoing chief executive Kurt Bock said in October.
Bayer has sold LibertyLink in the United States since 2009, steadily gaining market share to reach about 15 percent, said Rob Schrick, who runs North American corn and soy strategy for Bayer. The company expects the brand to capture 20 percent of the market in 2018.
BASF had a strategic urgency in the LibertyLink acquisition, said Patrick Jahnke, portfolio manager at Deka Investments, which owns BASF stock.
""The Bayer seed assets were not a bargain,"" Jahnke said. ""But the purchase eliminates the risk of being the only major supplier in the agro business without a seeds offering.""
WILD CARD FROM DOWDUPONT
DowDuPont faces the greatest obstacle in the fight for soybean market share because it is waiting for Chinese regulators to approve imports of soybeans harvested from its Enlist E3 seeds.
Enlist E3 soybeans are bred to resist glyphosate, glufosinate and 2,4-D, a chemical with roots stretching to the Vietnam War as an ingredient in Agent Orange, used by the U.S. military to defoliate jungle.
Launching Enlist widely without Beijing's approval would risk causing unapproved seeds or soybeans to be inadvertently shipped to China, the biggest importer. So for now, DowDuPont's seeds will be grown by a limited, undisclosed number of U.S. farmers who agree to deliver their harvests only to facilities run by Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM), according to the company. 
The deal will give Enlist - one of DowDuPont's biggest crop-system investments - a toehold in the U.S. market. Approval by Chinese regulators, an uncertain process, could translate to huge profits, but DowDuPont would still face the challenge of catching rivals who have a head start, said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer of Capital Innovations, which manages shares of DowDuPont, Bayer and Monsanto.
""To go into this market, and be late to the game, you have to be exceedingly aggressive,"" Underhill said.
238 BILLION EXTRA SEEDS
DowDuPont's entry makes it especially hard for farmers to decide what to buy because Enlist E3 may or may not be widely available, said Mark Denzler, president of Indiana-based 1st Choice Seeds, which scooped up surplus soybean seeds last autumn.
In Iowa, Stine Seed acquired 238 billion extra soybean seeds to sell because of the uncertainty, Chief Executive Harry Stine said. Illinois-based Great Heart Seed has amassed extra supplies of five varieties of genetically modified soybeans.
""It's a real pain and it will continue to be so going forward, trying to manage the inventory,” said company co-owner Nels Kasey.
Like the seed sellers, Missouri farmer Milas Mainord plans to hedge his bets by planting at least three soybean varieties.
He will devote up to 30 percent of his 5,000 acres of soybeans to Monsanto's Xtend seeds to protect himself from neighbors spraying dicamba. He also plans to plant some LibertyLink and other seeds in areas where he doesn't expect dicamba use.
""We're covering our bases,"" Mainord said.

34,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 01:14AM ET</span>",Puerto Rico utility sale sets up fight with creditors,"By Nick Brown and Jessica Resnick-Ault
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Puerto Rican governor's plan to privatize PREPA, the island's bankrupt power utility, could herald hard times for holders of its $9 billion in bonds, who are concerned the deal could strip their ability to collect on their investments. 
Governor Ricardo Rossello on Monday unveiled an 18-month plan to sell pieces of PREPA to potential private buyers, including renewable energy producers. 
The plan will need buy-in from the federally appointed board managing Puerto Rico's finances, which has voiced support for privatization in the past, as well as approval by the court overseeing Puerto Rico's bankruptcy. 
PREPA's investors, many of them hedge funds and mutual funds, have long called for wresting the utility from government control, but a piecemeal privatization push run by the government is not what they had in mind. 
Some are concerned ""the governor and board will sell the assets out from underneath creditors, and claim the liens have no value,” said a source familiar with some creditors' thinking. 
The sources who spoke with Reuters on Tuesday declined to be named, citing the possibility of future litigation over the sale plan.
In a statement released late on Monday, one group of PREPA bondholders warned that a sale that does not respect creditors' rights could ""result in years of litigation.""
Assured Guaranty, which insures PREPA bonds, said in a statement on Wednesday that Puerto Rico and the board should ""collaborate meaningfully with stakeholders"" during the sale process, adding that PREPA cannot be sold unless creditors are paid off or given new collateral.
The looming dispute over PREPA's fate is the latest chapter in a three-year battle over how to fix Puerto Rico's outdated energy grid and the troubled, debt-laden utility that monopolizes it.
Natalie Jaresko, the board's executive director, did not address creditors' specific concerns but told Reuters in a statement, ""We have long said that a full operational and financial transformation of PREPA — including private investment — is necessary to deliver the resilient ... power system that Puerto Rico needs for its economic recovery.""
A spokeswoman for Rossello had no immediate comment.

'WEIRD TERRITORY'
The U.S. territory is reeling, navigating both the largest government bankruptcy in U.S. history, with $120 billion of bond and pension debt, and its worst natural disaster in 90 years in September's Hurricane Maria.
The storm killed dozens and exposed PREPA's structural weaknesses, cutting power to all of Puerto Rico's 3.4 million American citizens. More than a third still haven't gotten it back, toiling in the dark more than four months later. 
PREPA, already insolvent when Maria hit, has fetched more unwanted attention since, drawing investigations over a questionable repair contract and the discovery of undistributed hurricane recovery materials in one of its warehouses.
The utility's bondholders have lobbied for fresh blood at PREPA's helm, either in the form of an independent receiver or an injection of private capital.
But outright privatization creates uncertainty on how to carry over creditors' claims - and their collateral - to whoever buys PREPA's assets, said two sources familiar with creditors' thinking. 
PREPA's bonds are secured not by physical assets but by PREPA's revenues, putting it ""in weird territory,"" said Drew Dawson, a bankruptcy expert and professor at Miami University School of Law. 
""Normally when collateral is sold, the security interest travels with it,"" Dawson said, ""but when the lien is future revenues generated by PREPA, and PREPA is no longer in existence, it's uncertain."" 
Creditors would likely litigate any attempt to strip the lien, said the sources familiar with their thinking - a long and costly prospect.
Ultimately, Dawson said, it was likely parties to a sale would negotiate some debt repayment, though creditors may not have the leverage they would like. 
Even if they lost, creditors could assert a claim against Puerto Rico's central government for impairing their PREPA lien, though that might be of little comfort given the island's bankrupt status.
NO MAGIC BULLET
The sale plan met with skepticism among locals, too. 
Israel Morales, a spokesman for a group of Puerto Rican mayors, said, ""People think this privatization will be like magic, because the situation is so awful,"" but that rate hikes sometimes follow privatization. 
""They privatized the highways, and now we are going to pay more expensive tolls every three to five years,"" Morales said.
Currently, PREPA's rates must be approved by the commonwealth's Energy Commission, which did not respond to requests for comment.
Even if the privatization plan passes the review of the court, finding a buyer may prove difficult, as the acquisition would be fairly small by U.S. utility standards, said Travis Miller, a strategist at Morningstar. 

""Any U.S. utilities that might be interested would drive a hard bargain in terms of securing ratemaking protections,"" Miller said.

40,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 09:40PM ET</span>",China trash town's cleanup bolstered by import ban,"By David Stanway
GUIYU, China (Reuters) - The dizzying stench of burning plastic still drifts through the alleys, workshops and warehouses of Guiyu, the southern Chinese town that has long symbolized China's role as the main recycler of the world's waste.
But residents say the air isn't half as noxious as it was five years ago, when authorities launched a drive to industrialize the town's recycling operations – and address the chronic health problems that came from dismantling things like old computers and mobile phones by hand.
The acrid black smoke that once billowed from the backstreets has gone, and the rivers that wind their way through the town of about 100,000 people, though still cluttered with trash, are much cleaner, residents say.
Now, the residents of Guiyu – located in the economic powerhouse province of Guangdong, about 175 miles from Hong Kong – are grappling with a new cleanup of the recycling industry that remains a mainstay of the town's economy.
In an effort to deal with its fast-growing domestic waste problem, the Chinese government has blocked all imports of 24 types of foreign trash. 
The ban, which took effect on Jan 1, has left countries like Britain and the United States reeling, with few alternative destinations for mountains of old mobile phones, paper, textiles and plastics once treated in backyard operations along China's eastern coast.
It has also forced recycling centers like Guiyu to step up their efforts to transform informal, backstreet industries into fully regulated, more technologically advanced and environmentally friendly ones. 
The effort in Guiyu also underlines the ability of the Chinese government to address the country's chronic pollution issues when it has the political will - and offers the right incentives - to do so.
While residents in Guiyu generally welcome the cleaner environment, the ban on foreign waste - which is usually better sorted than domestic trash and therefore more lucrative to handle - has been a damaging blow for many recyclers.
The boss of one recycling facility, who requested anonymity, said she was ""close to bankruptcy"".
""We don't have any foreign trash any more,"" she said. ""The ban has made it harder to make money.""
These backyard facilities still receive local trash, but are mostly limited to handling lower-end plastics. Higher-end electronic and metal waste is limited to those companies that move into a new recycling park set up by the local government that has facilities to deal with the pollution risks.
The new regulations come as China struggles to tackle the country's soaring domestic waste problem. Beijing has said it plans to invest nearly 200 billion yuan ($31.07 billion) in household waste treatment alone over 2016-2020 and has vowed to stop being a receptacle for the world's junk.
""The fundamental purpose was to solve the problem of pollution,"" said Wang Jingwei, a professor at Shanghai Polytechnic University who runs an experimental recycling facility and advises governments on waste treatment.
""Some big cities, and even some remote rural areas, are besieged with trash,"" he said. ""The dependence on foreign waste meant no one was dealing with domestic garbage.""
In the 2000s, Guiyu became a symbol of the environmental devastation caused by recycling hazardous waste with little regulation after being singled out by groups like Greenpeace and featuring in a string of international media reports.
Trash is still the mainstay of Guiyu's economy, but hundreds of recycling businesses have been consolidated or shut completely in recent years and authorities are now cracking down on smuggled waste, further starving small and polluting businesses of supplies.
""Although the dismantling of old electronics is the leading industry in Guiyu, we should say it was more a profession than an industry,"" said Zheng Jinxiong, vice chairman of a government commission tasked with running the recycling industry park, set up on the edge of town.
""The local government had an obligation as well as an ability to lead, standardize, make it scientific,"" he said.
Zheng said the government had tried to make the changes easier for residents, funding land purchases and renting them new buildings at low cost, as well as providing discounts on environmental protection equipment.
UPGRADING WASTE
Five years ago, sacks of trash provided a decent living for thousands of farmers and laborers in Guiyu. Much of that involved dismantling modems, mainframes and mobile phones in homes or backstreet workshops.
Workers would rip out the innards of electronic products with their hands, applying acid and melting down casings with cigarette lighters, extracting metals like copper and shredding plastic into reusable pellets.
With backyard operators banned from handling electronic waste, truckloads of broken computers and circuit boards are now delivered to the sprawling industrial park, where authorities can monitor environmental, health and safety standards.
Some big recycling companies have been encouraged to invest in the park, including TCL, whose local branch, TCL Deqing, invested 50 million yuan in a production line for dismantling household appliances.  
A subsidiary of China Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Equipment Group also invested 100 million yuan in a circuit board recycling facility.
The government said 1,243 businesses have been consolidated into 29 larger enterprises and relocated to the park. As many as 3,245 makeshift chimneys built to expel toxic recycling fumes from residential buildings have been removed.
However, almost 1,500 households are still recycling plastic in Guiyu's old town, a warren of cluttered backstreets, where sacks packed with waste - keyboards, cigarette lighters, toys, old tires - spill out of shops and warehouses.
A woman who would only provide her surname, Su, said she used to recycle small amounts of electronic waste to help supplement the family income.
""We stopped doing it because it was bad for our health,"" she said.
Su said she and her husband got involved in the business to pay their youngest child's school fees. Middlemen would visit their home every week and pay them for the recycled materials, with no questions asked. 
""We didn't know where it came from,"" she said. ""We know some people actually went overseas directly and shipped it back in containers.""
SMUGGLING TRASH
In addition to the ban on waste imports, China is also targeting smugglers who bring in trash from abroad.
Last year, China's customs authorities vowed to ""unflinchingly crack down"" on waste smuggling, and 421 suspects were arrested over the course of the year, including 127 caught in December, accused of bringing in 323,000 tonnes of plastics and mine slag.
According to court documents, some gangs were involved in schemes to launder imported cargoes of scrap mobile phones and computers by shipping them from Hong Kong to the North Korean port of Nampo.
There, they would be dismantled, stripped of identifying features and smuggled to the Chinese border port of Dandong, from where they were sent to Guiyu, classified as domestic waste.
Wang, the Shanghai waste expert, said Chinese ships delivering goods to Europe and elsewhere had an incentive to bring waste into China: whatever the price, it would be preferable to returning home with empty holds.
Guiyu's industrial park said it had tightened procedures to stop smuggled waste from entering its gates, and was cooperating with police, customs and environmental authorities.
""I dare not say there is no smuggling at all, but right now we can say that it is harder to come across, and fundamentally it isn't happening anymore,"" said Zheng.
He also said that Guiyu had been struggling to handle waste from the surrounding province of Guangdong, as well as China and the rest of the world.
""If we can handle all the various waste in our province and still have capacity, then we can also do more from the rest of the country,"" he said.

(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has still to complete flight tests on the newly certified 787-10 Dreamliner with  General Electric  Co (N:GE) engines, but has finished tests with Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (L:RR) engines, a Boeing executive said on Tuesday.
The U.S. jet manufacturer on Monday said the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had certified the biggest model of the fuel-efficient Dreamliner for commercial use.
The first delivery, to Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) with Rolls-Royce engines, is due in the first half of the year and will be used on mid-length routes in the Asia Pacific region. United Airlines (N:UAL) is expected to accept the first 787-10 with GE engines in the second half of the year.
""We are complete with all flight testing required for the first deliveries to Singapore and the Rolls-Royce family,"" Boeing 787 programme chief project engineer Bob Whittington told reporters on a conference call, speaking from Seattle.
""There is a little bit more testing to be done for the GE-powered airplanes a little bit later on.""
The 787-10 has 95 percent of its parts in common with the mid-sized Dreamliner, the 787-9. The main differences are in the environmental control system, which is larger due to the longer length of the airplane and higher number of passengers, and in the landing gear, Whittington said. 
The smaller 787-8 model, the first Dreamliner, has roughly 80 percent commonality with the 787-10 and has been a slower seller as Boeing considers whether to launch a ""New Mid-Sized Airplane"" with 220-260 seats targeting the market between the 737 MAX 10 and the 787-8.
The 787-10 seats around 330 passengers and has a shorter range, at 6,430 nautical miles (11,910 kms), than the other Dreamliners, but Whittington did not rule out extending the range over time.
""We will continue to look and see if the market needs a couple of thousand more pounds take-off weight and we will continue those studies,"" he said.
The 787-10 has received 171 firm orders from nine customers, the largest of which is Singapore Airlines. It is similar in size to the rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A350-900 model, which seats around 325 passengers but has a longer range. 

Qatar Airways is expected to accept the first delivery of Airbus's larger A350-1000 next month.

(Reuters) - The Weinstein Company has entered into exclusive negotiations to sell the studio with a group of investors led by former Obama administration official Maria Contreras-Sweet, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The offer would assume all liabilities related to the business operations, inject new cash and pay down liabilities on the balance sheet, according to the source, who added that the new company would be led by a majority-female board of directors and team of investors. The company has $375 million in debt.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the talks on Tuesday and that the company could be sold for around $500 million, citing people close to the negotiations. (http://on.wsj.com/2Bop76v)
The Weinstein Company has been looking for a buyer or rescue financing since late last year after accusations of sexual harassment against its former co-chairman, Harvey Weinstein. The company fired him in October following the allegations.
In November, Contreras-Sweet assembled a consortium of investors who offered $275 million for company.
Another source familiar with the talks told Reuters on Tuesday that the offer had been improved from the earlier one. 
Earlier in January, Killer Content Inc, the movie producer that has partnered with philanthropist Abigail Disney in a consortium vying to acquire the Weinstein Company, said a bankruptcy may be the best way forward for the company.

 Lions Gate Entertainment Corp  (N:LGFa) has also made an offer for some of the company's assets, as has Qatar-owned film company Miramax, originally founded by Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob Weinstein.

(Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc (O:TXN) on Tuesday posted the slowest revenue growth in four quarters on softer demand for its chips used in communications equipment, disappointing investors who expected sales for automotive chips to drive strong results.
Shares of the Dallas-based company fell about 7 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday after earnings also failed to exceed Wall Street expectations for the first time in at least two years.
Investors also reacted to a tepid forecast for current-quarter revenue.
TI's revenue rose nearly 10 percent in the fourth quarter, but growth is expected to slow down to about 7 percent in the quarter ending March, based on the mid-point of the company's forecast.
That compares with growth of 12 percent to 13 percent each in the first three quarters of 2017.
Though TI saw strong demand for chips used in automobiles and by industries, Chief Executive Officer Richard Templeton said the business that makes chips used in communications equipment faced soft demand.
""That's a market that traditionally is choppy,"" he said.
Communications equipment made up 13 percent of Texas Instruments' revenue in 2016.
TI has benefited in recent years as many automakers pivot toward self-driving vehicle technology. The automotive market contributed 18 percent of the company's revenue in 2016.
The company reported a 67 percent slump in profit to $344 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, mainly due to tax-related expenses from new U.S. tax laws.
Excluding the tax expense, Texas Instruments earned $1.09 per share, matching analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""It's not a blow-out result, but it is perfectly fine,"" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein.
TI forecast current-quarter earnings of $1.01 to $1.17 per share. Analysts were expecting $1.06.

The chipmaker's shares have climbed nearly 15 percent this year after a 43 percent rise in 2017.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The top U.S. securities regulator on Tuesday rejected arguments by  Rio Tinto  Plc (L:RIO) (AX:RIO) and two former top executives that its civil lawsuit claiming they concealed the plunging value of coal assets owned by the big Anglo-Australian mining company should be dismissed.
In letters filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the Securities and Exchange Commission said its complaint adequately alleged that fraud occurred, and that Rio Tinto, former Chief Executive Thomas Albanese and former Chief Financial Officer Guy Elliott intended to deceive investors.
Rio Tinto responded by referring to its statement in October that it believed the lawsuit was unwarranted and that a court or jury would reject the SEC's claims. [nS9N1LO008]
Lawyers for the defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment or had no immediate comment.
The SEC accused Rio Tinto of ignoring the need to write down most of the value of Mozambique coal assets it had bought for $3.7 billion in April 2011, while it was raising roughly $5.5 billion from U.S. investors.
Rio Tinto wrote off most of the value in January 2013, and sold the assets in late 2014 for just $50 million.
""This is not simply a case about Rio Tinto's valuation of Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique,"" the SEC said in one of Tuesday's letters.
""Rio Tinto, Albanese, and Elliott faced enormous pressure to structure a successful deal in light of the fact that they were responsible for an earlier disastrous multibillion dollar acquisition,"" the SEC said.
The SEC also rejected Rio Tinto's contention that any alleged misstatements and omissions might be immaterial because the writedown was for only 3 percent of company assets.
It said that had Rio Tinto properly written down the assets, its net earnings for the first half of 2012 would have been reduced by more than 50 percent.
""Accordingly, the question of materiality must be decided by a jury,"" the SEC said.
In letters on Jan. 16 explaining why the lawsuit should be dismissed, Albanese said he acted at all times as a ""reasonable"" CEO would, and Elliott said he relied on a ""well-tested and rigorous process"" to ensure that Rio Tinto reported its financials properly. [nL1N1PB26O]

The SEC case is being overseen by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres. It is unclear when she will rule on defense motions to dismiss it.

""Seventy-five percent of our deposit growth comes from customers who use our branches,"" Thasunda Duckett, chief executive of Chase consumer banking said in an interview. ""Customers still visit branches, on average, four times a quarter.""
JPMorgan said on Tuesday that it will build up to 400 new branches to expand into 15 to 20 markets in several new states. The building is part of an investment plan that includes $15 billion of new lending and nearly $5 billion in spending and is due in part to the reduction in U.S. corporate taxes and a more favorable regulatory environment.
While the New York-based bank did not say which markets it intends to enter, it noted that it does not have branches in Boston, Philadelphia or Washington, D.C.
JPMorgan has found that people who want to open new accounts look to see which banks have convenient branches even though they will do most of their transactions electronically.
Duckett said branches are critical to establishing the bank's presence locally and serve as hubs for mortgage lending, asset management and services to small businesses, such as accepting daily cash deposits. 
Across its established markets where it has 5,130 branches in 23 states, the number of locations is slowly decreasing as the bank consolidates and uses more ATMs, Duckett said. 
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said for years that he would like to try to expand into more cities. But Dimon held back because of the need to build capital for higher regulatory requirements and fund upgrades in information technology.
The federal tax cuts are expected to save JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, more than $4 billion annually, analysts estimate.
Duckett said the new branch building will be different from that before electronic transactions were popular. Chase will start with higher mix of ATM kiosks in the markets than it has now. And, the bank will also open scaled-down ""Everyday Express"" offices of ATMs and as few as two employees.
In 2013, to add to its Florida franchise and gain experience entering new cities, JPMorgan opened three branches in Jacksonville. Now it has 20 branches there.

46,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 06:58PM ET</span>","United Air shares tumble as it vows to match low fares, expand capacity","By Alana Wise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Continental Holdings Inc (N:UAL) shares fell more than 6 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday as the airline said it plans to increase capacity, likely threatening its profit margin as it is locked in a price war with low-cost carriers. 
""The best way to compete with low-cost carriers is to match their prices,"" one of its executives said on an earnings call with analysts and investors. ""We can't let low-cost carriers have price advantages in our hubs.""
The warning spooked investors, who are keeping a close eye on United's bottom line as the company tries to prevail in a fierce fare war that has sent some ticket prices tumbling. Shares of Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) also fell more than 5 percent after hours. 
United said it expected to increase its capacity by between 4 percent and 6 percent in 2018, and would likely grow by a similar amount in 2019 and 2020, on the grounds that it would give the carrier a competitive edge in its fight against low-cost airlines.
The No. 3 U.S. carrier by passenger traffic earlier reported fourth-quarter net profit of $580 million, or $1.99 per share, compared with $397 million, or $1.26 per share, in the year-ago quarter, helped by costly last-minute ticket purchases.
Excluding special charges, United reported profit of $1.40 per share, beating Wall Street's average estimate of $1.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
In the current period, higher labor costs, costlier fuel and the ongoing pricing battle are weighing on the carrier's profit margins. United added to investors' unease by saying it will continue to compete with low-cost airlines on price.
In the fourth quarter, United posted a 0.2 percent increase in passenger unit revenue, a closely watched measurement of an airline's success, after a posting a sharp decline in the prior quarter.

The Chicago-based airline's results follow a strong fourth-quarter performance and quarterly outlook by rival Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), which reported better-than-expected profit earlier this month.

NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) is buying a software firm that specializes in authenticating government-issued identification cards, the two companies said on Tuesday, a step that may help the social media company learn more about the people who buy ads on its network.
U.S. lawmakers have expressed alarm at Facebook's limited ability to know who is buying advertisements, including election-related ads, on the world's largest social network.
Boston-based Confirm Inc, which is privately held, said on its website that the acquisition was the culmination of three years of work to build technology to keep people safe online. 
Facebook said in a statement Confirm's ""technology and expertise will support our ongoing efforts to keep our community safe.""
Terms of the deal and how Facebook would apply Confirm's software were not revealed.
Confirm will wind down its operations and its employees will join Facebook in Boston, a person familiar with the acquisition told Reuters.
Confirm's website listed 26 employees earlier this month, according to a version archived by the Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search engine. It says on its website that it has more than 750 clients.
Last year, Facebook said that suspected Russian agents had been paying to boost Facebook posts in the United States in an attempt to divide the electorate around the 2016 presidential election. Moscow denies the allegations.
The company later said it would begin requiring organizations running election-related ads to confirm their identities.
Facebook has more than 6 million different advertisers, and buying ads has historically required little more than a Facebook page and a credit card. 
Confirm says that its software allows for proof of identity for online transactions, allowing users to detect potentially fraudulent activity. 

Moelis & Co and Goodwin Procter advised Confirm on the transaction. Hogan Lovells advised Facebook.

Almost a third of consumer complaints to the CFPB have been tied to debt collectors, and those concerns deserve attention, Mick Mulvaney, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the CFPB, wrote in the Wall Street Journal.
""We will be prioritizing,"" Mulvaney wrote about how debt collection concerns are a persistent area of consumer concern.
Mulvaney is Trump's budget chief but has been leading the CFPB on a temporary basis since late November. Under his leadership, Mulvany said, industry will have a voice.
""We work for the people. That means everyone: Those who use credit cards and those who provide the credit,"" he wrote.

The CFPB was created to stamp out exploitative loans, but the agency also can be too concerned with punishing industry, wrote Mulvaney.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET) will pay a $1.15 million civil fine and improve its privacy practices to settle charges that it leaked the HIV-positive status of 2,460 New York members in a mailing where it used envelopes with large transparent windows.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on Tuesday said names, addresses, claim numbers and HIV medication instructions in the July 28, 2017 mailing were ""clearly visible"" to outsiders because of how Aetna folded letters and inserted them into the envelopes.
The mailing was intended to notify members of a class action settlement permitting them to buy HIV medication at brick-and-mortar pharmacies rather than by mail, where their privacy might be compromised if neighbors or family saw the drug packages.
While about 1 million Americans live with HIV or AIDS, the associated stigma can lead to a denial of proper healthcare, discrimination and other negative consequences, according to settlement papers signed by Aetna and Schneiderman's office.
""Through its own carelessness, Aetna blatantly violated its promise to safeguard members' private health information,"" the attorney general said in a statement.
Schneiderman said his office uncovered similar issues with a Sept. 25, 2017 mailing by Aetna to 163 New York members with atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat condition.
The Hartford, Connecticut-based company did not admit or deny wrongdoing, and agreed to retain an independent consultant for two years to monitor its efforts to improve member privacy.
It agreed last week to a $17.2 million settlement in the federal court in Philadelphia of private litigation over similar claims by more than 11,000 members in New York and other states.
""We have worked to address the potential impact to members following this unfortunate incident,"" Aetna said in a statement. ""We are implementing measures designed to ensure something like this does not happen again as part of our commitment to best practices in protecting sensitive health information.""
Aetna agreed last month to be bought by CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) in a $69 billion transaction.

HIV is short for human immunodeficiency virus, and AIDS for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome.

Procter & Gamble dropped 3.09 percent as investors focused on a drop in gross margins at the world's largest consumer goods maker.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday approved steep import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels, a move that was criticized by China, South Korea and Europe and stoked fears about potential retaliation.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Bombardier (TO:BBDb) risks losing a hotly-contested U.S. trade dispute on Thursday which would effectively bar its CSeries jet from the United States for at least a year, a potential setback as the Canadian plane-and-train maker races to meet its 2018 delivery targets and attract sales from American carriers.
The International Trade Commission's (ITC) ruling this week is unlikely to put an end to months of wrangling between  Boeing Co  (N:BA), the world's largest maker of jetliners, and Bombardier, along with Canada and the United Kingdom, which have sided with the smaller planemaker.
The Boeing-Bombardier trade dispute has cast a shadow over the ongoing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) modernization talks, which entered its sixth round this week in Montreal.
The ITC, which oversees U.S. trade remedy laws and sides more often with American companies, is expected by some experts to back the U.S. Commerce department's recommendation to slap Bombardier's CSeries with a near 300-percent duty on sales to American carriers. 
Boeing has argued that its business was hurt because Bombardier received illegal government subsidies and dumped the CSeries in the United States through the 2016 sale of 75 jets at ""absurdly low prices"" to Delta Air Lines (N:DAL).
For Bombardier to win, at least three of the body's four commissioners would have to rule for the Canadian planemaker.
""A tie vote goes to petitioners,"" said U.S. trade expert William Perry who believes Boeing will win the case.
But former ITC chairman Dan  Pearson  (LON:PSON) said he would not rule out a Bombardier victory in what's an ""unusual"" case for the commission.
""If I was there still, I'd be looking skeptically at Boeing's claims,"" he said.
The trade case has left Bombardier seeking delivery alternatives to Delta, which was supposed to start taking its CSeries orders this year.
One option under consideration includes AeroMexico (MX:AEROMEX), which is 49-percent owned by Delta, taking an unknown number of CSeries, Reuters reported last year.. 
But no decision has been made and AeroMexico could still buy jets from Bombardier's Brazilian rival Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3), said a source familiar with the matter Reuters earlier this month.
AIRBUS-BOMBARDIER DEAL
A win for Boeing would not deter Bombardier from continuing to target U.S. airline customers. Bombardier has struck a deal with Airbus SE (PA:AIR), expected to close this year, giving the European planemaker a majority stake in the CSeries and the ability to assemble the planes in Alabama starting in 2019 for delivery to Delta.
While Bombardier says CSeries assembled in Alabama would be duty-free, Boeing has challenged those plans. The two planemakers have clashed on whether the case that mentions aircraft and ""partially assembled"" aircraft from Canada, would lead to duties on parts used in the CSeries. 
Pearson said by email that foreign parts, like a wing made in Belfast, should not face a duty, but there could be charge on Canadian-made parts. 
""This week's vote by the ITC is an opportunity to restore a level playing field and recommit to the global trading rules we have all agreed to,"" said Boeing spokesman Dan Curran on Tuesday. 
But Bombardier called Boeing's trade case self-serving after the U.S. planemaker revealed on Dec. 21 it was discussing a ""potential combination"" with Embraer.
""This case is nothing more than Boeing's transparent attempt to misuse the U.S. trade laws to create an artificial market advantage for itself, including its recent move to acquire Embraer – the CSeries’ true competitor – while simultaneously trying to block the CSeries from the U.S. market,"" Bombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said by email. 
Boeing spokesman Curran denied that the company's ongoing conversations with Embraer have anything to do with its case against Bombardier.

Embraer declined to comment.

(Reuters) - Wall Street banker turned Silicon Valley executive Anthony Noto has left  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) to become chief executive officer of online lender Social Finance Inc, the companies said on Tuesday. 
The move sowed fresh doubts that the microblogging site will be able to pull off an ambitious turnaround plan and eventually make a profit, and renewed speculation about SoFi possibly pursuing an initial public offering.
Noto started on Wall Street just before the dot-com bubble burst and eventually became a top tech banker at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), handling the IPO of then-Silicon Valley darling Twitter. 
He became Twitter's chief financial officer months after the November 2013 IPO, and was promoted to chief operating officer in 2016 when his predecessor quit.
But Twitter's perceived fortunes have turned during Noto's time there, with analysts and investors raising questions about its plans for growth and eventual profitability.
Though Twitter expects to turn a corner soon, it has yet to make a quarterly profit, losing $2.5 billion from the start of 2012 through the third quarter of 2017. The company has come under fire for issues including how it handles harassment on its platform as well as errors it disclosed in how it counted users.
Noto had worked to add video and create a better advertising platform. And he was the Twitter executive most responsible for assuring Wall Street that better days were ahead,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Peter Stabler said.
""We view the departure as a key loss for Twitter,"" Stabler wrote in a research note on Tuesday, echoing the view of several analysts.
""In his absence, we believe the company will need to elevate the visibility of another key operating executive to address investors, as we believe Twitter continues to face significant challenges in its turnaround strategy.""
Twitter did not announce a replacement, but said Noto's responsibilities will be absorbed by other executives. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who is also CEO of payments processor  Square Inc  (N:SQ), called Noto ""an incredible advocate"" for the company and thanked him for his work.
Twitter shares fell 2.5 percent to $22.76 in afternoon trading. The stock is still well above an August low of $15.67, but below its IPO price of $26.
TWITTER'S LOSS, SOFI'S GAIN
Noto may be a welcome arrival at SoFi, where a sexual harassment scandal erupted in September that was followed by the departure of its prior CEO and a rethink of its business model.
SoFi launched in 2011 as an online lender that primarily refinanced student loans for young, affluent borrowers. But it soon expanded into a range of financial services, from mortgage lending to hedge fund investing. 
It had threatened to upend traditional lenders by applying for a U.S. banking license and appealing to young customers by hosting happy hours and match-making events.
SoFi's valuation soared along with its ambitions. The company was worth $4.3 billion as of its last round of funding in February 2017.
But in September, then-CEO Mike Cagney left the company following an investigation into claims that current and former employees were sexually harassed at work. Efforts to reach Cagney for comment at the time were unsuccessful, and a representative for Cagney did not comment on Tuesday.
That departure threw SoFi's strategy into doubt, along with the timing of an IPO that many investors and analysts had been expecting. In October, it withdrew its application for a banking license.
Noto on Tuesday signaled he would look to return SoFi to its prior aspirations.
""SoFi has a significant opportunity to build on its leadership position in student and personal loans to revolutionize consumer finance and build a next-generation financial services company,"" he said in a statement.
The company might revisit its banking application in light of Noto's arrival, Joanne Bradford, SoFi's chief marketing officer, told Reuters at an event on Tuesday.
At the event, SoFi said it has opened a waiting list for its no-fees deposit account service called SoFi Money partnered with headhunting firm Korn Ferry to offer career counseling services to its clients, and would launch a chat service for members on its mobile app.

Tom Hutton, an investor in SoFi who had served as interim CEO, said Noto's experience made him the perfect fit. Hutton will become non-executive chairman on March 1, when Noto takes on his new role.

Treasuries rose and the dollar edged lower.
The Nasdaq 100 Index surged as Netflix powered past subscriber forecasts, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped on disappointing results from Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Blowout earnings in the past two weeks have bolstered stocks to records, with 82 percent of S&P 500 firms that have reported topping estimates.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell after the Bank of Japan signaled it’ll maintain generous stimulus. The dollar dropped toward lows of the year. Emerging-market stocks advanced an eighth day and West Texas crude futures hit $64 a barrel.
“The earnings season is going phenomenally well, and the government shutdown on Friday was reversed yesterday, so we’ve got the government behind us for the next couple of weeks,” Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said by phone. “But the reason the stock market is up is very simply that investors are reflecting on the fact that earnings are much better than expected.”
With earnings season in full swing, investors held to the risk-on stance that’s taken stocks around the world higher. The synchronized global economic recovery shows no signs of slowing and the BOJ’s signal added to optimism that central banks won’t rush to tap the brakes. Investors also kept an eye on Davos, Switzerland, where the world’s business elites gathered for an annual conference roiled by protectionist moves across the Atlantic.

94,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 02:04PM ET</span>",New York City sues drug companies over opioid epidemic,"By Jonathan Stempel and Nate Raymond
NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City on Tuesday sued eight companies that make or distribute prescription opioids, blaming them for fuelling a deadly epidemic afflicting the most populous U.S. city.
Mayor Bill de Blasio said the lawsuit sought $500 million of damages to help fight the crisis, which kills more people in the city annually than homicides and car accidents combined, including more than 1,100 from opioid-induced overdoses in 2016.
""Big Pharma helped to fuel this epidemic by deceptively peddling these dangerous drugs and hooking millions of Americans in exchange for profit,"" de Blasio said in a statement.
The defendants include manufacturers Allergan Plc (N:AGN), Endo International Plc (O:ENDP), Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ), Purdue Pharma LP and Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA), and distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC),  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH) and McKesson Corp (N:MCK).
All were accused in the city's complaint of creating a public nuisance, and the distributors were accused of negligence.
Allergan, Endo, J&J, Purdue, Teva, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson in separate statements emphasized the importance of using opioids safely.
Endo, J&J and Purdue also denied the city's allegations, while McKesson declined to comment on the lawsuit. Cardinal Health did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
New York City, whose population is about 8.54 million, joined a long list of U.S. states and municipalities to sue drug companies over opioid abuse, which U.S. President Donald Trump has called a national public health emergency.
Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, played a role in 42,249 U.S. deaths in 2016, up 28 percent from 2015 and 47 percent from 2014, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In its complaint filed in state court in Manhattan, New York accused manufacturers of having for two decades misled consumers into believing that prescription opioids were safe to treat chronic non-cancer pain, with minimal risk of addiction.
The city also said distributors fueled abuse through oversupply, including a failure to identify suspicious orders and report them to authorities, contributing to an illegal secondary market.
Prescription opioids, such as Purdue's OxyContin and Endo's Percocet, are regulated as controlled substances.
New York City said roughly 2.5 million to 2.7 million opioid prescriptions were filled there each year from 2014 to 2016.

The case is City of New York v Purdue Pharma LP et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 450133/2018.

The merger talks are in the final stages and the combined company will be independently run, with BMW and Daimler as largest shareholders, the source said, adding that the assets being pooled include BMW's ParkNow parking app.
The likely deal - first mooted more than a year ago - is seen as a way to help the German brands compete with the U.S.-based ride-hailing service Uber [UBER.UL]. 
Daimler's Car2Go, which launched in 2008, describes itself as the world's largest one-way car-sharing service. It operates around 14,000 cars in 26 cities in North America, western Europe and China.
DriveNow is a joint venture between BMW and car rental firm Sixt (DE:SIXG) founded in 2011, which operates more than 6,000 vehicles in nine major European cities.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper reported, without citing its sources, that both brands would keep their names, but their technology would be merged. It said a deal could be signed next month.
A Daimler spokeswoman declined to comment on what she described as speculation. Representatives of BMW and Sixt were not immediately available to comment.
Reports of a possible merger first emerged more than a year ago, but the plan was rejected by Sixt. The FAZ said Sixt was close to agreeing to BMW buying part of its stake and brand rights.

Car2Go's customer numbers rose 30 percent in 2017 to almost 3 million, including 870,000 in Germany, while DriveNow's rose by a quarter to 1 million users, including 720,000 in Germany.

(Reuters) - Healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on Tuesday took a $13.6-billion charge related to the new U.S. tax law and plans to bring back billions of dollars from overseas immediately.
The company reported a quarterly loss due to the charge, but beat analysts' profit estimates excluding items, helped by growth in cancer drugs and treatments from its $30-billion purchase of Actelion last year.
Still, J&J shares fell 4.2 percent to $141.97 in afternoon trading as investors sold off after the shares closed just below their all-time high on Monday.
""It's just kind of a low-quality earnings beat,"" said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. He noted that the company's fourth-quarter tax rate was only 9 percent, ""so maybe the beat wasn't as big as it looked on a headline basis.""
Also on Tuesday, U.S. appeals court upheld a ruling that invalidated a crucial J&J patent on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed the new U.S. tax law late last year, and many large U.S. corporations and drugmakers have said they will take advantage of its new, lower tax rate on repatriated foreign earnings and cash.
J&J reported a year ago that it had $66 billion in undistributed international earnings and on Tuesday said it had $16 billion in cash outside the United States. 
The company, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, plans to move $12 billion of that cash immediately, J&J CFO Dominic Caruso said during a conference call with analysts, and will be used to fund U.S. operations, primarily by paying down debt. 
Caruso also expects the new tax law to lower J&J's 2018 tax rate by 1.5 percentage points to 2.5 percentage points, and forecast an effective tax rate of 16.5 percent to 18 percent. 
He said that money generated from lower taxes would primarily be funneled toward more research and development spending.
J&J's tax hit is the biggest announced for the pharmaceutical industry so far. Drugmaker  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN), for instance, said it would take a charge of more than $6 billion, while  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) has not yet given details on its tax plans.
QUARTERLY LOSS
International operations accounted for nearly half of J&J's total fourth-quarter sales of $20.20 billion, which were up 11.5 percent from a year earlier.
Cancer drugs Darzalex, Imbruvica and Zytiga helped drive a 17.6-percent rise in pharmaceuticals sales to $9.68 billion. 
A U.S. administrative court recently invalidated Zytiga's patent, but J&J said it does not expect its competitors to launch a generic version of the drug this year.
High-margin treatments from Actelion, acquired by J&J for $30 billion in 2016, accounted for about a quarter of the pharmaceutical unit's sales growth.
Sales at J&J's consumer products unit, which makes Band-Aids, Neutrogena beauty products and Tylenol, rose 3.1 percent to $3.5 billion.
Including the tax charge, J&J lost $10.71 billion, or $3.99 per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $3.81 billion, or $1.38 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, J&J earned $1.74 per share, slightly above analysts' average estimate of $1.72 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
J&J forecast an adjusted 2018 profit of $8 to $8.20 per share on revenue of $80.6 billion to $81.4 billion. 

Analysts were expecting profit of $7.87 per share and revenue of $80.7 billion.

100,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 01:18PM ET</span>",U.S. appeals court decertifies class action in Hyundai fuel economy settlement,"By Tina Bellon and Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday overturned a lower court's decision to grant class certification to car owners who settled with Hyundai Motors (KS:005380) and its Kia affiliate over the fuel efficiency of its vehicles.
In their 2-1 order, the judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit said the lower judge had erred in concluding that common questions existed to justify a class action status.
The companies in 2013 agreed to pay $395 million to resolve claims from vehicle owners who had sued the company over misrepresenting its vehicles' average mileage claims. 
The lawsuits were filed after an investigation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which found that the companies used improper test procedures to develop their fuel efficiency data.
A 2012 restatement by Hyundai and Kia reduced the automakers' fleetwide average fuel economy from 27 miles to 26 miles per gallon for the 2012 model year.
Vehicles included the Hyundai Accent, Elantra, Veloster and Santa Fe and the Kia Rio and Soul. 
Hyundai did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision. Lawyers representing the car owners did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A U.S. District Court judge in 2015 gave the final approval of the class settlement, but the companies appealed, saying the agreement was not fair and adequate and that the attorney fees were unreasonable in proportion to the payout the class members would receive.
The majority of the appeals court judges on Tuesday agreed with those arguments, finding that the lower court had failed to define a relevant class by also including owners of used cars who were not exposed to misleading advertising.
But the circuit judges added that the lower court, on reconsideration, could decide to certify a class again, but must first determine what value is created by a settlement.
Lawyers representing the car owners had been awarded roughly $9 million in attorneys fees and costs.

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange took a swipe on Tuesday at its London rival in their battle to attract the foreign listing of shares in oil giant Saudi Aramco, saying it didn't need to ""bend over backwards"" to lure what could be the world's biggest IPO.
Britain's markets watchdog, hoping that hosting the huge float in London would boost the city's status as a global financial hub as it prepares for Brexit, came under fire last year for appearing to be ready to bend its rules for Aramco.
Saudi Arabia has shortlisted New York, London and Hong Kong -- singly or in a combination of two or even all three -- for the international portion of the state-owned company's listing, sources have told Reuters.
It is likely to be the world's biggest IPO, and Riyadh could raise up to $100 billion by selling 5 percent of Aramco, on the basis of an estimated overall valuation of $2 trillion. It is set for late 2018 and will include a local listing, sources say.
John Tuttle, who is in charge of global listings at the NYSE, said the exchange would not need to water down its stricter disclosure requirements to land such a huge IPO.
""You don't see the United States bending over backwards to accommodate any specific company like you see in other jurisdictions,"" he told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
The London stock exchange declined to comment on Tuttle's remarks and pointed Reuters to exchange data showing that nine out of its top 10 listings were by international companies and that North American firms accounted for 20 listings last year.
NYSE rules on minimum free floats are much less stringent than those in the UK. Tuttle said the New York exchange only required a global market capitalization of 200 million dollars and a float of more than 40 million dollars.
""So that's not a problem for many companies,"" he said.
""The greatest companies in the world are listed on the New York Stock exchange and disclosure is one of the pieces of that, and part of the reason why our market is robust and as liquid and investor-based as broad as it is, is because it's a very transparent market place,"" he added.
However, the NYSE has its own disadvantages, sources say.
They said Aramco's lawyers have warned about litigation risks linked to the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. Passed last year, the law allows the Saudi government to be sued on the grounds it helped plan the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Riyadh denies the allegation.
Touting the merits of a U.S. listing for Aramco, Tuttle said he could not discuss specific companies but that over the past 25 years all privatizations or even partial sales of state-owned oil companies had taken place in part or completely on the NYSE.
""The U.S. marketplace is the deepest pool of capital, the most liquid market place on earth by multiples of any other jurisdiction and many institutional investors, particularly long-term investors, either by charter or by choice only choose to invest in companies listed in the U.S.
""Obviously this is a large transaction, we know they are doing their due diligence and we think the merits of the U.S. market are much greater than any other jurisdiction.""
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority has proposed loosening some requirements, including its principle that companies with a premium listing have a free float of at least 25 percent.
Asked whether it would make sense to split such a big float over a number of exchanges, Tuttle said: ""Every transaction is different. I assume they have the smartest bankers and lawyers and advisers working on the transaction who will give them the best advice with regards to where they ultimately want to be listed, if it's one or multiple jurisdictions and exchanges.""
Citing  BP  (LON:BP), Total and Petrobras as examples of other major foreign energy companies which listed in New York, he said: ""Many of these national energy champions trade more volume in the United States than they do on their local exchanges.""

Earlier on Tuesday, Russia's top state investment officer told Reuters in Davos that Russian pension funds were considering investing in Aramco's IPO in a move to strengthen a partnership between the world's two top oil producers.

131,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",Netflix shares hit record high after blockbuster results,"By Muvija M
(Reuters) - Netflix Inc's (O:NFLX) shares rose 13 percent to a record high on Tuesday after the video streaming service trounced Wall Street targets for new subscribers in the fourth quarter.
At least 16 brokerages raised their price targets for the company's shares by as much as $72. Analysts at Bernstein were most bullish, setting targets of $302 compared to the $252 it traded at on Tuesday.
The video-streaming giant crossed $100 billion market value for the first time and was on track to add more than $10 billion if current prices hold. 
In a statement after markets closed on Monday, Netflix said it added 6.36 million subscribers in international markets in the fourth quarter, beating analysts' expectations of 5.1 million, according to FactSet.
It now has 117.58 million streaming subscribers globally.
""Overall, this was a 'home run quarter' for Netflix and should put any lingering worries to rest around sub(scriber) growth, international ramp, and the 'negative' possible effects from the (subscription) price increase,"" GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said.
The company, which showcased popular returning series ""Stranger Things"", ""The Crown"" and ""Black Mirror"" in the quarter, in October hiked its monthly fees for U.S. customers for the first time in two years. 
""The subscriber growth validates management's ongoing content investment, and should contribute to comfort with 2018's increased $7.5-8.0B content spend and associated marketing to support the content slate and ever-growing library,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said.
Netflix and its peers Hulu and Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Prime Video are steadily increasing budgets for producing original shows as they gain market share from traditional cable TV providers.
In contrast, U.S. wireless carrier  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) said on Tuesday that it lost a net of 29,000 Fios Video connections in the latest quarter, reflecting the shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings.
Netflix spent $90 million on Will Smith action movie ""Bright"" last year, its largest investment in an original film to date, and is already planning a sequel and additional investment in original films.
""Netflix continues to prove out the thesis that Internet TV is replacing linear TV on a global basis,"" Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Jayant said.
Out of the 44 analysts that cover Netflix's stock, 27 now rate it at ""buy"" or higher, 15 at ""hold"" and two at ""sell"" or lower. The median price target for the stock was $275.
Hulu ended 2017 with 17 million subscribers while analysts estimate Amazon's Prime service, which includes a free video subscription, has around 90 million customers.

Shares in Los Gatos, California-based Netflix were up 11.7 percent at $254.31 on the Nasdaq. At Tuesday's session high of $257.71, the company was worth about $111.5 billion.

133,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 10:44AM ET</span>",JPMorgan rolls out $20 billion investment plan after tax gains,"By Sweta Singh and David Henry
(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) unveiled a $20 billion investment plan on Tuesday to hike wages, hire more, open new branches and expand its business as it takes advantage of sweeping changes to the U.S. tax law and a more favorable regulatory environment.
The bank joined several other U.S. companies that have already announced spending plans after the federal tax overhaul was signed into law in December, bringing lower corporate rates and other changes. 
In the most explicit use of tax savings announced by any major bank, JPMorgan said it would raise wages for 22,000 employees by an average of 10 percent, to between $15 and $18 per hour, hire 4,000 employees and add up to 400 Chase branches. 
The five-year plan comes after Chief Executive Jamie Dimon's push to ramp up investment in businesses as the bank has finished the majority of work needed to clean up troubled home mortgages and comply with tougher capital requirements following the 2007-2009 financial crisis. 
The largest U.S. bank by assets will also increase small business lending by $4 billion and increase loans to customers seeking affordable homes by 25 percent to $50 billion. 
Analysts expect JPMorgan to save about $4 billion a year on taxes because of the new law, but have worried that banks would quickly compete away the savings to take business from one another. 
Dimon has acknowledged some of that will happen, but to varying degrees and at different rates in the bank's assorted business lines. 
He had set the stage for Tuesday's announcement in a post-earnings conference call on Jan. 12, when he said new spending would eat into the bank's tax savings but enhance future growth. 
""It isn't like a giveaway,"" he said on the call. 
Some analysts have described the bank's aggressive moves in credit cards and commercial lending as examples of a strategy Dimon is pursuing to use financial strength to take business from competitors.
JPMorgan is first or second in market share in many of its businesses. That has made Dimon think that regulators would not allow it to make acquisitions to become bigger out of concern for risk to the financial system.
In a statement on Tuesday, Dimon said ""having a healthy, strong company allows us to make these long-term, sustainable investments."" 
The bank will also increase community-based philanthropic investments by 40 percent to $1.75 billion over five years, it said.
JPMorgan employed 252,539 people worldwide at year-end, some 134,117 of which work in Chase consumer businesses which include the branch, small business and mortgage operations that are the focus of the new spending and hiring. 

JPMorgan's shares were down 0.03 percent $114.30 shortly after the market opened in New York. The stock had risen nearly 37 percent in the past 12 months through Monday, outperforming the S&P 500 index's 25 percent increase.

135,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 10:38AM ET</span>","P&G second quarter beats, but margins worry investors","By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - The world's largest consumer goods maker Procter & Gamble Co reported better-than-expected sales and profit for its second quarter on Tuesday, but investors focused on a drop in gross margins, sending its shares down 2 percent. 
Margins fell by nearly 1 percent in the quarter, hit by higher commodity costs, investment outlays and cuts in prices in the grooming business that includes Gillette razorblades.
The company has just quelled activist investor Nelson Peltz's attacks on its strategy by offering him a board seat but is struggling to boost Gillette sales against cheaper competitors like Unilever's Dollar Shave Club.
It has reduced prices on the shaving products, upping volume growth but eating into profits and headline revenue from one of its biggest businesses.
Some of that was offset by its efforts to pour more money into other lines including beauty and health care, leading to a 2 percent increase in organic sales. 
Analysts, however, characterized the results as mixed and stopped short of predicting any upside for P&G shares after a rally spurred by the proxy fight with Peltz.
""Second quarter was not a quality beat, with gross margin lower than expected, and little near term benefit from the Tax Act,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a note.
DON'T EAT SOAP
The company said it was doing all it could against a social media fad that has teenagers daring each other to eat its Tide Pods laundry detergent live on video.
""Our product labeling is clear ... but it can't prevent intentional abuse fueled by poor judgment,"" P&G's Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told a media call.
""We're going to have to work with the broader part of society to address that.""
P&G raised its full-year adjusted earnings per share growth forecast to 5-8 percent from 5-7 percent as it expects a $135 million net benefit from the recent U.S. tax overhaul, which sees corporate taxes falling to 21 percent. 
Net income attributable to the company fell to $2.50 billion, or 93 cents per share, in the second quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $7.88 billion, or $2.88 per share, a year earlier. 
The company said the drop reflects a net charge of $628 million it took related to the tax overhaul and a gain it incurred from the sale of a chunk of its beauty brands to Coty Inc in the same period last fiscal year. 
Excluding items, the company earned $1.19 per share, including a 5 cent benefit from the tax changes. Analysts had expected $1.14 per share, but several Wall Street brokerages said those estimates did not account for the tax benefit.
Net sales rose 3 percent to $17.4 billion, boosted by strong Demand for Olay skincare products and its high-end SK-II brand and brisk sales of Oral-B toothbrushes as well as Vicks cough and cold products in a colder-than-usual winter season. 

P&G's shares, which have risen 9.3 percent in 2017, were down 3 percent at $89.54.

SAO PAULO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (N:WMT) is looking to sell part of its operations in Brazil, where it has struggled for a decade, yet missteps by the U.S. retail giant have narrowed the field of potential buyers and could lower the value of any deal.
The world's largest retailer is shopping a major stake in its Walmart Brasil Ltda unit to buyout firms with Latin American experience, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Sunday.
Wal-Mart's operating losses in Brazil, which began in 2009, will likely attract investors with turnaround plans and modest valuations in mind, according to one of the sources, who spoke anonymously due to the sensitivity of the talks.
The company reported almost 30 billion reais ($9.4 billion) of Brazilian revenue from about 500 stores in 2016, but poorly integrated acquisitions, labor disputes and headwinds from Brazil's economic downturn have hurt its bottom line. (http://reut.rs/2DWNOtp)
Making matters worse, some stores Wal-Mart opened during Brazil's economic boom a decade ago are poorly located and have little appeal to rivals. Several retailers passed up the chance last year to make an offer on them, the same source said.
To lure buyers with the prospect of robust online growth, Wal-Mart combined its local e-commerce unit with its Brazilian brick-and-mortar operations in December, according to two people with knowledge of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer's plans.
The company declined to comment on the talks with buyout firms or its problems in the Brazilian market.
Investors were largely unsurprised by reports of Wal-Mart shopping a stake in the Brazilian unit. Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon announced in 2016 that he was planning to review global operations.
""If they have decided to pull out of Brazil after being there for as long as they have, they have realized their model is not working,"" said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, which owns shares of Wal-Mart.
""I can definitely see Wal-Mart making similar decisions about other international businesses going forward,"" he added. 
Wal-Mart shares closed higher on Monday but gave back some of those gains on Tuesday.
FOCUSING ELSEWHERE
Wal-Mart's struggles in Brazil are a far cry from its performance in Mexico, the company's largest market outside the United States. Wal-Mart de Mexico SA de CV (MX:WALMEX) is Mexico's No. 1 retailer.
That success is due to Wal-Mart's decision to partner with Mexican retailer Cifra to launch the operation in the 1990s as well as help from local executives who have kept it attuned to the market, according to Carlos Bernal, an analyst with brokerage Actinver in Mexico.
In contrast, Wal-Mart struggled to gain traction from the $1 billion it spent in 2004-2005 on a patchwork of acquisitions in northeast and southern Brazil, two regions with stark economic, geographic and cultural differences.
Poor real estate investment decisions, incompatible computer systems and unforeseen tax and labor costs added to the difficulties integrating the disparate network of stores, dragging on the Brazilian unit's earnings for years. 
Analysts and former executives in Brazil said one of Wal-Mart's biggest setbacks in Brazil was losing a bidding match for cash-and-carry wholesaler Atacadão to rival  Carrefour  SA (PA:CARR), which paid $1.1 billion for it in 2007.
Atacadão and rival Assaí, which was acquired in the same year by French retailer Casino's (PA:CASP) subsidiary GPA (SA:PCAR4), went on to dominate the booming cash-and-carry segment, delivering profits even during the country's recent recession. Wal-Mart's entry into the segment was largely a flop.
Wal-Mart now looks ready to focus elsewhere while retaining what may be a more passive interest in Brazil, said one of the sources familiar with the conversations between the company and private equity firms.
The source added that the details of a partnership have not been clearly established.
""They still want to retain a stake there so they can be around and not take attention away from what they must focus on,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. ""This does fit into the strategy that Doug McMillon laid out a couple of years ago. Wal-Mart is focusing more domestically where they have a dominant share.""
One of the funds that Wal-Mart has spoken to, according to one source, is Acon Investments LLC, which bought regional Brazilian retailer GBarbosa in 2005 and resold it two years later to Chile's  Cencosud  SA (SN:CEN).

Another is Advent International Corp, which invested in Brazilian apparel retailer Restoque Comercio e Confeccoes de Roupas SA (SA:LLIS3) and home improvement chain Quero Quero. A third, GP Investments Ltd , has a stake in sporting goods retailer Lojas Centauro, which recently filed for a Brazilian initial public offering.

The company said it expects to close or sell about ten manufacturing facilities and would exit or divest some lower-margin businesses.
The restructuring is expected to broadly impact all the business segments of the company, it said.
The cost-savings program, which will begin in the current quarter, is expected to be completed in two years and the company sees incurring related pretax charges of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion over that period.
Kimberly-Clark said the program would generate annual pretax cost savings of $500 to $550 million by the end of 2021.
It expects cash costs for the restructuring, mainly related to workforce reductions, to be between $900 million to $1 billion.
The company on Tuesday also reported a near 1 percent rise in fourth-quarter net sales to $4.6 billion, compared with a year earlier.
Kimberly-Clark said it expects net sales in 2018 to improve by 1 percent to 2 percent.
""Although we expect market conditions will remain challenging in the near-term, we plan to deliver better results in 2018 while we begin to implement our new restructuring"", Chief Executive Thomas Falk said in a statement.

Shares of the company, which also raised its quarterly dividend by 3.1 percent, were marginally up at $117.24 in early trading.

But unfortunately for the 400,000 or so people who have preordered Teslas, Musk's compensation won't be tied to his companies ability to build cars.
Tesla has a history of struggling with production and has missed key targets. For example, Musk originally said Tesla aimed to produce 20,000 Model 3 vehicles a month by December. The company only delivered 1,550. Musk has also said he wants to build 500,000 vehicles this year, but given the now delayed production of the Model 3, that seems unlikely.
An analyst note from December projected just 100,000 Model S Teslas coming off the line in 2018.
Unlike other car companies, Tesla's stock has continued to soar over 1,000% since its IPO in 2010.
Instead of focusing on building cars, like GM or Ford does, Musk's new compensation schedule is ""entirely contingent on achieving market cap and operational milestones that would make Tesla one of the most valuable companies in the world,""  according to a press release.
For Musk's compensation to fully vest, ""Tesla’s market cap would have to grow to $650 billion (an increase of almost $600 billion), and important revenue and profitability goals would also have to be achieved,"" the company said.
""Elon will receive no guaranteed compensation of any kind – no salary, no cash bonuses, and no equity that vests simply by the passage of time,"" the release continued.
Musk's previous compensation plan included vehicle production targets alongside milestones in increasing market capitalization, but that clause has been dropped from the new plan. 
Tesla did mention plans to build ""the company’s vehicle product line to cover all major forms of terrestrial transport,"" as well as ""expanding solar energy generation through Solar Roof and other solar products and seamlessly integrating them with battery storage,"" but made no direct mention of increasing car production or reliability.
In Tesla's release, it refers to itself as ""the world’s first vertically-integrated sustainable energy company,"" but in the electric car business, Tesla finds itself increasingly flush with competitors offering similar or in some ways better vehicles much more reliably. "

PALESTINE, Texas/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Workers at the Sanderson Farms plant in Palestine, Texas, are cutting up chickens for export to Mexico, a market that has become a pillar of the town's economy and a key focus of the U.S. poultry sector.
The facility's roughly 1,000 employees process a quarter of a million chickens a day, with parts zipping along racks to a packing area where legs and thighs are prepared for delivery to the United States' southern neighbor. 
But the Mexican market may find its way to the chopping block if talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement collapse and President Donald Trump makes good on a threat to pull out of the 1994 deal with Canada and Mexico. 
The stakes are high for the U.S. poultry sector, which exports products worth more than $1 billion a year to Mexico.
Mexico could slap a 75 percent tariff on U.S. chicken and turkey under its commitments to World Trade Organization rules, compared to the 20 percent tax on imports the Latin American nation could apply to other major U.S. exports like pork.
""It would effectively prohibit us from selling product to Mexico,"" Sanderson Farms Chief Financial Officer Mike Cockrell said. He added that the loss of the market would be comparable to the impact of Russia's 2002 ban on U.S. chicken imports.
The bulk price of chicken leg quarters in 10 U.S. states including Texas sank to 18 cents a pound in March 2002, down from 26 cents a pound before the Russian ban, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Mexico accounted for about 4.5 percent of Sanderson Farm's gross sales in the 12 months through October.
Mexican officials have made clear they don't want consumers to face the price hikes that would be triggered by tariffs, although they have also said global trade rules would allow import taxes in the absence of NAFTA.
""There is nothing standing in the way,"" said Raul Urteaga, the top trade official in Mexico's agriculture ministry and one of the people involved in the NAFTA negotiations of the 1990s. ""What I can't say is what the tariff would be.""
Mexican, Canadian and U.S. officials will meet in Montreal on Tuesday for talks to modernize the 24-year agreement, with negotiators aiming to reach a deal before Mexico's presidential campaign kicks into gear ahead of a July election.
Even a 25 percent tariff would make it hard to sell in Mexico, leading to a glut of chicken legs in the U.S. market, Cockrell said.
""Nobody really goes to the Olive Garden to buy a leg quarter,"" Cockrell said, referring to U.S. consumers' general preference for white chicken meat rather than the dark meat found on leg quarters.
Lost sales to Mexico would add to the pain already felt from the virtual closure of the Chinese market to U.S. chicken.
Beijing has lowered the stiff anti-dumping tariffs on U.S. broiler chickens that it enacted in 2010, though Washington maintains China has not gone far enough to comply with a WTO ruling against the tariffs.
WAITING IN THE WINGS
The United States exports about 20 percent of its poultry production - it sent about $800 million in chicken and turkey meat to Mexico in 2016. Mexico buys more U.S. chicken than the next two markets combined.
If NAFTA disappears, U.S. poultry could face increased competition from Brazil, which is the world's top chicken exporter and has tariff-free access to the Mexican market through 2019, as well as the possibility of lost jobs.
Palestine Mayor Steve Presley says he is worried about the economic future of his town of 18,000. Sanderson Farm's plant opened in 2015. 
The poultry industry, for its part, has responded by lobbying U.S. officials.
James Sumner, president of the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council, said he has met with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the issue. Zippy Duvall, a Georgia chicken grower who is the head of the American Farm Bureau Federation, met briefly with Trump in Nashville on Jan. 8, said AFBF lobbyist Dave Salmonsen.
Texas, Georgia, Arkansas and Mississippi are the top four states sending poultry meat to Mexico. Each is a Republican stronghold that voted heavily for Trump in the 2016 presidential election.
Some observers speculate the potential impact of a NAFTA collapse on agriculture could prompt the Trump administration to ultimately stick with the deal.
""It wouldn't be in the Republicans' interest to hit a big part of their constituency in their pockets,"" Caroline Freund, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said earlier this month in an interview.

LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's $15.7 billion takeover of European broadcaster Sky should be blocked unless a way is found to prevent the media tycoon from influencing the network's news output, Britain's competition regulator said.
The initial ruling complicates a separate plan by Walt Disney Co to buy the majority of Murdoch's assets, including Sky. Disney had hoped Murdoch would own 100 percent of the company by the time it completed its takeover.
Shares in Sky rose on Tuesday as investors said concerns about Murdoch's influence could still be overcome, for example by spinning off Sky News, Britain's first 24-hour news channel. The regulator also indicated it would not object to Disney owning Sky eventually.
""It's good news today that the regulator isn't going to block the deal outright,"" said Michael Wegener, managing director at Case Equity Partners, a Sky shareholder.
""The Murdochs will come up with remedies that work around Sky News.""
Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own in December 2016, re-igniting a political row in Britain about the influence he wields through his ownership of newspapers the Sun and the Times and his stake in Sky, the biggest pay-TV platform.
Critics of the deal argue that Murdoch could hold sway over the editorial output of Sky's loss making news channel. Sky warned that were the deal to be rejected because of Sky News, it could shut the channel itself.
The British government, which will take the final decision on the deal, asked the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to judge if Murdoch had too much influence in Britain and would uphold broadcasting standards.
""We have provisionally found that if the Fox/Sky merger went ahead as proposed, it would be against the public interest,"" the CMA's Anne Lambert said on Tuesday.
""It would result in the Murdoch family having too much control over news providers in the UK, and too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.""
A WAY OUT?
Murdoch's news outlets are watched, read or heard by nearly a third of Britons and have a combined share of public news consumption that is significantly greater than all other news providers, except the BBC and commercial TV news provider ITN.
Possible ways to resolve concerns about Murdoch's influence in Britain could include spinning off or divesting Sky News, or insulating Sky News from Fox's influence, the CMA said. A third option is to block the deal outright.
On the issue of broadcasting standards, the regulator cleared Murdoch, saying that recent allegations of sexual harassment at his Fox News network in the United States did not call into question his commitment to standards in Britain.
An objection on broadcasting standards would have likely sounded the death knell for the deal.
""Broadcasting standards is not an issue anymore,"" said one hedge fund manager that holds Sky shares. ""That's a pretty big positive."" The manager cautioned however that it was unclear how motivated the Murdochs were to secure the deal, seeing as they have already agreed to offload it to Disney.
Shares in Sky, which also has major operations in Germany and Italy, rose 2.3 percent to 10.26 pounds by 1335 GMT. Fox agreed to pay 10.75 pounds in cash for each Sky share in December 2016.
TOUGH LANGUAGE
""The initial reaction would be to suggest there is an easy fix in that Sky News could be disposed of, either by sale or closure or some other form,"" said broker Liberum, which downgraded Sky to hold from buy.
""However, the language of the CMA in its provisional findings suggests they are more minded to blocking the deal as a way of addressing concerns.""
Fox has already offered up remedies to protect the independence of Sky News including the establishment of a Sky News Editorial Board.
But the CMA said media regulator Ofcom had received complaints suggesting that previous attempts by Murdoch to guarantee the editorial independence of the Times newspapers in Britain and the Dow Jones company had proved ineffective.
The CMA said a ""comprehensive solution"" to the questions posed by the deal would be simply to block it.
Fox said it was disappointed about the provisional judgment, although it welcomed the decision that it had a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards.
It said it would continue to engage with the CMA ahead of the final report in May, and it anticipated approval of the deal by June 30.
Britain's newly appointed Media Secretary Matt Hancock said on Tuesday he would decide on the deal by 14 June, 30 working days after he is due to receive the CMA's final report.
DISNEY OPTION
An eventual rejection would be a personal blow to Murdoch, who has spent decades building ties with prime ministers and politicians in Britain. His son James oversaw Sky's growth as chief executive and currently chairs the broadcaster.
The 86-year-old tycoon sought to buy Sky in 2010, but a phone-hacking scandal at his News of the World tabloid forced him to drop the bid. Since then he has split his companies into two to separate the newspapers from the TV businesses.
If Fox is eventually blocked, Disney could buy the rest of Sky itself at a later date, and it would face fewer regulatory objections than the Murdochs.
""On the face of it, these concerns would fall away if the Disney/Fox transaction went ahead as announced,"" the CMA said.
Disney will buy Fox's 39 percent Sky stake in its $52.4 billion purchase of Fox assets, a deal that faces its own lengthy regulatory process in the United States.
That level of ownership would normally require an owner to bid for the whole company, but Disney has asked regulators to allow it leeway to decide whether to bid or not.

Although GoPro managed to return to profitability at the end of 2017, these experts think that that investors may be giving the firm “too much credit”.
Morgan Stanley admitted that its prior recommendation on the company was “too generous”, especially now that the holiday season is over and the firm cut prices on its latest HERO6 camera due to competition.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks clocked up their 13th record high of the year on Tuesday, as relief at a temporary U.S. government funding deal boosted already sky-high confidence about global growth and corporate earnings.
Wall Street futures were pointing to a steady start (N) but records in Asia and 0.3-0.5 percent gains on Europe's biggest bourses <0#.INDEXE> after upbeat data from German and Britain, ensured the new year bull run rumbled on. (MIWD00000PUS) (EU)
The International Monetary Fund revised up its global growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019 to 3.9 percent, which would be the highest since 2011. There was also a lift from Japan as its central bank said it would keep stimulus flowing.
""We should not confuse a mature bull market with a decrepit one,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in its 2018 outlook to clients.
""For the first time in a decade, the major economies of the world are all expanding at the same time, providing a foundation for global profits that fundamentally support risk assets.""
Global borrowing costs also eased as the Bank of Japan's reassurances in Asia added to the relief that U.S. lawmakers had struck a short-term deal on Monday to fund the government through to Feb. 8.
It resolved what had been a three-day shutdown in Washington and pushed yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries - one of the biggest drivers of world borrowing costs - down for the first time in five days to 2.62 percent.
European bonds followed suit with Spain's 10-year bond yield dropping to a seven-month low at 1.36 percent  to cut its premium to ultra-safe German debt down to the leanest since March 2015. Yields move inversely to prices. [GVD/EUR]
Major currencies stuck to the narrative too, for the most part. The dollar edged up against the euro to $1.2240  though it failed to cling on to earlier gains against the Japanese yen and sagged back to 110.50 yen. .
Some investors are sensing that a recent fall in the dollar to a three-year low may be coming to a close amid brewing concerns over the U.S. stance on global trade policy.
U.S. President Donald Trump slapped steep import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels on Monday, putting a cloud over global trade at a time when its revival has fueled hopes for a stronger world economy.
Trump is slated to give the closing address at this year's Davos summit of political and business leaders on Friday and some analysts expect him to strike a protectionist stance, which may increase pressure on emerging market currencies.
""If Trump decides to strike a strong anti-trade stance, it will spark a selloff in global trade-oriented currencies such as the Korean won and the Chinese yuan and eventually weigh on the U.S. dollar as well,"" said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London. 
STERLING EFFORT
The other eye-catching currency market move came from Britain's pound as it topped $1.40  for the first time since voters there chose back in 2016 to leave the European Union. [GBP/]
It is benefiting from both upbeat UK domestic data and hopes of a favorable post-Brexit deal with the EU. On a year-to-date basis it up 3.5 percent, making it is the best performing major currency, beating even the high-flying euro .
Data on Friday showed too that currency traders on the Chicago futures exchanges have increased their net long sterling positions - or bets that it will rise - to the highest level in 3-1/2 years.
""Sterling is benefiting from the broad dollar weakness story and the recent data has been mildly supportive,"" said Thomas Flury, head of FX strategies, UBS Wealth Management, Chief Investment Office.
Despite the unease over U.S. tariffs, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) had risen 0.9 percent overnight.
Australian stocks (AXJO) climbed 0.75 percent and South Korea's KOSPI (KS11) added 1.4 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Sang (HSI) meanwhile scaled a record high, Singapore (STI) reached a 10-year top and Japan's Nikkei (N225) rose to a 26-year peak.
Japan's central bank meeting had maintained both its interest rate target at minus 0.1 percent and a pledge to keep 10-year government bond yields around zero percent, which showed it remains firmly in stimulus mode.
At the same time it also said ""inflation expectations have moved sideways recently,"" offering a slightly more upbeat view than three months ago when it said they looked weak.
The BOJ ""still remains a step behind other central banks looking to normalize their policies,"" said Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan FX strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).

U.S. crude oil futures (CLc1) rose 0.6 percent to $63.94 per barrel and Brent gained 0.56 percent to $69.42 per barrel (LCOc1). Spot gold  tacked on 0.2 percent to $1,336.70 per ounce.
In the virtual currency world, bitcoin was down 5.5 percent on the Bitstamp exchange (BTC=BTSP) at $10,220.13 following news that South Korea will ban the use of anonymous bank accounts in cryptocurrency trading from Jan. 30.

While it was a widely telegraphed move designed to stop virtual coins from being used for money laundering and other crimes, the step also underscored authorities' intent to close down avenues for spurious speculation.

169,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 08:32AM ET</span>","Verizon quarterly profit jumps, helped by tax reform","NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) on Tuesday reported quarterly revenue that exceeded analyst estimates as phone subscribers grew while tax cuts helped its profits soar, boosting its shares in premarket trading.
The company added 431,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill on a net basis. Analysts at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said in an earlier note that they expected 320,000. 
Verizon shares were up 1.03 percent at $54.00 in trading before the U.S. stock market opened. 
The No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier said last week a tax-overhaul bill signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump late last year would result in a one-time reduction in net deferred income tax liabilities of about $16.8 billion. 
Verizon estimated that the impact of that law to earnings per share for the year ended Dec. 31 was about $4.10.
Net income attributable to Verizon was $18.7 billion, or $4.56 per share, in the fourth quarter through Dec. 31, up considerably from $4.5 billion, or $1.10 a share, a year earlier. 
Excluding items such as the impact of the tax law, earnings per share were 86 cents.
Total revenue rose to $34.0 billion from $32.34 billion a year earlier.
According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, analysts expected adjusted earnings per share of 88 cents on revenue of $33.26 billion.
The company expects full-year revenue for 2018 to grow at a low single-digit percentage rate and service revenue growth to turn positive around the end of the year or early in 2019. 

It also expects low single-digit percentage growth in adjusted earnings per share, excluding the impact of tax reform and a new accounting standard it has adopted.

It said employees whose roles disappear would be offered alternative jobs in the business but that could be a role with less status and pay.
Sainsbury's said its intention was not to reduce overall headcount.

207,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>","Carrefour steps up e-commerce push, chases deal in China","By Dominique Vidalon
PARIS (Reuters) - Carrefour's (PA:CARR) new chief executive promised to slash costs, step up e-commerce investment in the face of competition from Amazon (O:AMZN) and open up  Carrefour  China to local investors, sending its shares higher on Tuesday. 
Alexandre Bompard, at the helm only since July and tasked with boosting cash flow, promised to invest 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in digital commerce by 2022, six times its current investment, as Carrefour plays catch-up in online retail.
Under pressure to lift profits, Bompard also announced cost savings of 2 billion euros by 2020, including a voluntary redundancy plan for 2,400 employees at its French head office.
""We must revamp our model by simplifying our organization, opening ourselves up to partnerships, improving our operational efficiency... (and) building an efficient omnichannel model,"" Bompard said in a statement.
Carrefour shares leapt 6.3 percent, the biggest one-day gain since October 2015, as investors cheered the five-year strategic plan's focus on investing in online and competitiveness.
Carrefour has spent years trying to reduce its reliance on hypermarkets, particularly in France, a model that once drove its bricks-and-mortar retail business but which has come under crushing pressure from digital commerce and the rise of online giants such as Amazon (O:AMZN).
Former Fnac executive Bompard unveiled the plan after Carrefour said last week that its 2017 operating profit could fall by 15 percent amid weak sales. This marked its second profit warning in six months.
The retailer, the world's largest after Wal-Mart (N:WMT), with more than 380,000 employees, said it was targeting a 20 percent market share in food e-commerce in France by 2022.
Carrefour's online sales accounted for just 1.7 percent of its total French food sales in 2016, while more digital-savvy rival Leclerc managed 8 percent, according to Bernstein analysts. 
CHINA PARTNERSHIP
In China, Carrefour remains loss-making amid fierce competition from local players and a buoyant online market.
In response, Bompard announced the possible acquisition of a stake in Carrefour China by Internet giant Tencent (HK:0700) and local retailer Yonghui (SS:601933). Carrefour would remain the largest shareholder of Carrefour China.
""While some will be disappointed not to see an outright sale of China, these are both strong strategic partners and we would argue give the group the best possible ability to turn the business around,"" brokerage Bernstein said in a briefing note.
Amazon's acquisition of U.S. food retail chain Whole Foods has fueled speculation that the U.S. online group is looking to crack the European market next. It has held exploratory talks with some of Carrefour's rivals, the companies have confirmed. Carrefour's five-year plan was welcomed by investors and analysts who had wanted the retailer to make further moves into e-commerce after it acquired a stake in online fashion retailer Showroomprive.com (PA:SRPG) this month. 
It is the largest private sector employer in France, where its weak performance have weighed on group profitability and performance of its shares. France accounts for 44 percent of the operating profits.
Targeting 1 million additional fresh food customers by 2022, Carrefour said it would accelerate growth in supermarkets and convenience stores and improving the efficiency of its hypermarkets, including by reducing sales areas.
No hypermarket closures were planned, it said.

Bompard's plan to shed 2,400 jobs out of a total French HQ workforce of 10,500 could set the chief executive on a collision course with France's muscular trade unions, including Force Ouvriere, which has already called for a walkout on Feb. 8. Britain's supermarket group  Tesco  (L:TSCO) said on Monday it will cut a net 800 jobs from its UK business to simplify operations and achieve targeted cost savings.

208,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 04:33AM ET</span>",Five Solar Firms That Actually Stand to Gain From Trump's Tariff,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump just decided to slap tariffs on solar equipment imported into America for four years.
There are plenty of losers from the decision: Chinese manufacturers, U.S. rooftop panel installers and renewable energy developers including utilities that are planning large-scale solar farms. There are also a few in the industry that stand to gain -- some more surprising than others.
Here’s a look at them:
First Solar
Tempe, Arizona-based  First Solar Inc  (NASDAQ:FSLR). is the most obvious winner. That’s because it makes some of its panels in the U.S. Also, the kind of thin-film panels it manufactures may be exempt from the tariffs that Trump approved Monday.
Wall Street has been anticipating a boost for First Solar for months. The trade case triggered a mad dash for its panels through 2019, and the company’s stock has rallied almost 140 percent since the dispute that resulted in Trump’s tariffs began.
Gordon Johnson, the U.S. solar industry’s most notorious bear, initiated coverage of First Solar this month with a buy rating and a $95 price target. It closed at $68.96 on Monday.
Tesla’s Gigafactory
Then there’s Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. You’d think, as a big-time rooftop solar installer, Tesla would be a big-time loser. But coincidentally, Elon Musk’s Palo Alto, California-based company recently opened one of its so-called gigafactories in Buffalo, New York, with Panasonic Corp. The plant manufactures solar equipment.
In a statement issued Monday, Tesla cited the factory and said it’s committed to expanding its domestic manufacturing “regardless of the solar tariff decision.”
It’s unclear exactly how much of Tesla’s needs the factory will ultimately fulfill, but at the very least, the plant gives the company a leg up over its peers who rely on imports from overseas for the vast majority of supplies. And some of the remaining equipment Tesla imports may prove to be tariff-free since Trump’s allowing an exemption on 2.5 gigawatts of imported solar cells annually.
“The market hasn’t really given value to the solar production,"" Ben Kallo, an analyst at Robert W. Baird and Co., said, noting that investors have been focused on Tesla’s Model 3 electric car. “The tariff gives Tesla and Panasonic the runway to ramp up that facility.”
SolarWorld, Suniva
The two solar manufacturers that pushed the Trump administration for tariffs, SolarWorld Americas and Suniva Inc., clearly stand to gain -- despite Trump’s decision falling short of expectations.
Suniva had sought duties of 32 cents a watt on imports. Trump’s tariffs translate to a charge of about 10 cents a watt, according to Hugh Bromley, a New York-based analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
Still, the tariffs stand to boost the value of the companies -- and aid their debtors -- as they explore potential sales. And they may prove to be a step toward resolving a much larger solar trade dispute with China that dates back to at least 2012. Trump said in his statement that the U.S. Trade Representative will hold discussions that could lead to a “positive resolution” to the solar trade measures that were previously imposed on Chinese solar products and U.S. polysilicon.
Those earlier U.S. duties generated an estimated $1.5 billion that Suniva and SolarWorld could get a cut of should China, the U.S. and the solar industry strike some sort of a deal.
Read this story for more on that separate dispute.
If it’s any testament to whether they gain, Suniva thanked Trump for “holding China and its proxies accountable,” and SolarWorld said it “appreciates the hard work of” Trump and is “hopeful” the tariffs will be enough to rebuild solar manufacturing in the U.S.
And Lastly, Wait for It: Chinese Manufacturers
The prospect of tariffs had already prompted some Asian solar companies to consider building factories in the U.S., including China’s Longi Green Energy Technology Co. To the extent that it follows through with those plans, the company could remain in the game and gain an advantage over its peers abroad.
And if the tariffs really do lead to a resolution over the much larger solar trade dispute between China and the U.S. and ease previously imposed duties,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG sees another “silver lining” for Chinese solar manufacturers:
“Such a resolution could bring Chinese solar products to par pricing with imports from other countries,” the bank’s analysts, including Michael Weinstein, said in a report late Monday.

210,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 03:00AM ET</span>",Signs point to revival in international use of China's yuan,"By Michelle Chen
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The sale of a 900-million-yuan ($140 million) offshore bond has added to signs that the international use of the Chinese currency is recovering after several years in the doldrums.
The bond issue by India's IL&FS Transportation Networks (NS:ILFT) was the first sale of a high-yield offshore yuan bond in more than a year.
Yuan deposits in Hong Kong, the biggest offshore center for the Chinese currency, are their highest in a year and Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said it is looking to place some of its reserves in yuan, one of the first central banks outside of Asia to make such a move.
The signs are emerging as the yuan continues to rally, rising this month to its strongest against the dollar in more than two years. Broader trends, including China's ambitious Belt and Road project to build an economic superhighway across Asia and beyond, are supporting the currency's internationalization, analysts and Chinese officials say.
""This high-yield dim sum bond issuance is a sign which shows the offshore yuan market has started to recover after backsliding for two years,"" said Liao Qun, China chief economist at Citic Bank International in Hong Kong.
""Negative factors that hindered the internationalization process, such as strong yuan depreciation expectations, have been cleared and now it's time to see this process gaining momentum again,"" Liao said.
To be sure, sources in China involved in internal discussions of policy but who are not part of the decision-making process, said there was no sense of urgency in Beijing to push forward the yuan's internationalization, the name given to the process under which China permits increased use of the closely controlled currency outside China.
""We will follow the tide,"" said a policy source, who declined to be identified. ""We won't push it forward too forcefully. This will be a long process.""
In 2015, interest in the yuan offshore collapsed after China's dramatic intervention to head off a financial crisis as its stock markets crashed. Regulators tightened China's financial borders to stop a flood of capital flowing out of the country. The outflows were brought under control in 2017, and they are growing once again.
IL&FS, an Indian infrastructure firm, completed the sale of its three-year yuan bond earlier this month priced to yield 8 percent. Order books for the bond reached more than 2 billion yuan, underscoring strong demand for the asset.
""Demand for dim sum bonds is increasing as the yuan has been gaining growth momentum, so it's good timing for companies which need to raise funds in this market,"" said Chao Li, a director of Standard Chartered's Asia Bond Syndicate, which was involved in the deal.
Yuan deposits in Hong Kong, the biggest offshore yuan hub, rose to 559.2 billion yuan in November, their highest since November 2016, while cross-border yuan trade settlement hit a 17-month high, Hong Kong Monetary Authority data shows.
Analysts said more broadly, China's Belt and Road project will help support more use of the yuan. Yin Yong, a vice-governor of the People's Bank of China, was quoted on Jan. 15 by Xinhua as saying that the Belt and Road initiative was providing strategic opportunities for yuan internationalization.
Nathan Chow, an analyst at DBS in Hong Kong, said many Belt and Road projects are expected to ""step up pace, which will benefit the yuan's internationalization.""
The central bank also introduced measures this month to encourage companies to increase their use of yuan for settling cross-border trade deals and support foreigners' use of the currency for direct investments in China.
However, the China policy sources said they don't expect any significant relaxation of capital controls on currency flows, which would limit any offshore growth in the currency's availability.
The yuan  rose 6.8 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2017, its best annual performance since 2008, reversing three straight years of depreciation.
China International Capital Corporation (CICC) has forecast that the yuan would rise this year to 6.28 per dollar. On Tuesday it fetched around 6.4 per dollar. ($1=6.4 yuan)

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Doha on June 5 last year, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Doha vehemently denies the charges.
The government of Qatar issued its last international bond in 2016, raising $9 billion through the debt sale. There is no clarity on the size of the upcoming, potential bond sale, but banking sources say Qatar will likely raise a similar amount.
A spokesman for the government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Governments in the Gulf have been borrowing huge amounts of money internationally over the past few years to refill their coffers, hit by a slump in oil prices.
Qatar's request for proposal (RFP) comes just after Saudi Arabia's RFP, sent out to banks last week, for the refinancing of an outstanding $10 billion syndicated loan and for further U.S. dollar-denominated bond sales.

213,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 01:00AM ET</span>",Casino mogul Steve Wynn confident on Macau concession extension,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S. casino magnate Steve Wynn, head of the eponymous Wynn Resorts (0:WYNN), said he was confident his casino business in the world's largest gambling hub of Macau would continue after casino contracts start to expire by 2020.
The Chinese-controlled territory has been a goldmine for Wynn, generating more than 75 percent of its total revenues through subsidiary  Wynn Macau  (HK:1128). 
The expiry of casino licenses in the former Portuguese colony has been a critical issue for operators, such as Sands China (HK:1928),  MGM China  (HK:2282) and SJM Holdings (HK:0880), with the first round of licenses due to expire in two years.
Wynn's concession with the Macau government runs until 2022, but authorities have provided little information about whether, and how, the licenses will be renewed. 
Wynn told analysts on a conference call on Monday that his confidence stemmed from talks with the government in Macau.
""We have been given reason to have confidence that our businesses will continue after the initial concession expiration dates,"" he said. ""That confidence is based upon the kind of conversations we have had with the government.""
Privately, some casino executives have expressed concern over the uncertainty, and have been making increasing efforts to stay on the right side of the authorities.
Wynn, who operates two luxury resorts in Macau and is also the Republican National Committee Finance chair, said China, which controls the special administrative region, was adamant about stability and did not like disruptions.
He had frequent discussions with casino bosses Sheldon Adelson, owner of  Las Vegas Sands  (N:LVS) and Sands China, and James Murren, head of MGM Resorts (N:MGM), he added.
""We are so stitched into that community, with our employees and our company, that we feel comfortable in this situation,"" he said. 
Wynn said the local government had encouraged him to file plans for the company's second phase on Macau's fast-growing Cotai strip, modeled after Las Vegas with large, glitzy properties.
The company said it had about 11 acres (5 hectares) of adjacent property to develop on the Cotai strip, but gave no further details.
Shares in Wynn Macau jumped as much as 8 percent on Tuesday, after the company reported better-than-expected earnings, boosted by strong revenues at its newest resort, Wynn Palace.
Macau's licenses were first awarded in a complex process in the early 2000s. Government officials have said there may be a new public bidding process when they expire.

The casino sector is a huge part of Macau's economy, employing two-thirds of its workforce, and paying taxes amounting to about 80 percent of government revenue.

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's state-backed Beijing Automotive Group (BAIC) will take its electric vehicle unit public by injecting it into another listed subsidiary, boosting its financial muscle as the battle for the country's hotly contested green car market heats up.
The de facto backdoor listing values the unit, Beijing Electric Vehicle Co, at $4.5 billion and comes as the government engineers a dramatic shift away from conventional gasoline cars with strict quotas for electric and hybrid vehicles set to come into effect next year.
The shift has prompted major investment and a spate of deals between global automakers, tech firms and local rivals as companies rush to bring out new vehicle models and set up local ventures and facilities in the world's biggest car market.
The deal is also a rare listing for China's green car sector and marks the first time that a state-owned manufacturer of so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs) will debut on one of the country's main stock exchanges.
Beijing Electric, established in 2009, said this month that sales jumped 98 percent in 2017 to 103,199 vehicles.
That puts it just behind Warren Buffett-backed BYD Co Ltd (SZ:002594) which said its NEV sales last year totalled 113,669, up around 13.5 percent.
Under the deal, ChengDu QianFeng Electronics Co , one of the listed arms of BAIC, will buy the electric car unit and then sell 761.1 million shares at 37.66 yuan per share. Beijing Electric will become the listed entity.
China's automotive market slowed sharply in 2017, but new energy vehicles have been a bright spot. An industry body said this month NEV sales would likely grow 40 percent this year, topping 1 million vehicles.
Car makers, however, are worried about the rapid pace of the shift to fully electric vehicles and some have called for Beijing to maintain financial support for the auto market to help drive consumer demand.

(Reuters) - Investors are getting a high-octane way to bet on or against the stock market's technology leaders.
A new product aims to let investors triple the return of 10 stocks, including the so-called FANG stocks -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL).
The BMO REX MicroSectors FANG+ Index 3X Leveraged Exchange Traded Note (ETN) starts trading on Tuesday under the ticker FNGU, the product's backers said in a note on Monday.
If the target stocks gain 10 percent, the notes should trade up 30 percent.
A companion product, BMO REX MicroSectors FANG+ Index -3X Inverse Leveraged Exchange Traded Notes, which will trade under the ticker FNGD, aims to let investors triple the inverse of the same index.
If FANG and the other stocks fall by 10 percent, the notes would gain 30 percent.
FANG stocks have profited tremendously during the U.S. bull market since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, and for some investors they have come to symbolize the market's excesses.
Netflix, the best performer of the four, has gained more than 5,000 percent since the end of 2008.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), Baidu Inc (O:BIDU),  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA), Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) round out the other holdings in the index.

WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump slapped steep tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels on Monday, giving a boost to Whirlpool Corp (NYSE:WHR) and dealing a setback to the renewable energy industry in the first of several potential trade restrictions.
The decisions in the two ""Section 201"" safeguard cases followed findings by the U.S. International Trade Commission that both imported products ""are a substantial cause of serious injury to domestic manufacturers,"" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement.
The washer tariffs exceeded the harshest recommendations from ITC members, while the solar tariffs were lower than domestic producers had hoped for. The restrictions aim to help domestic manufacturers but drew complaints that consumer costs for new washers and solar installations will rise. 
Trump will impose a 20 percent tariff on the first 1.2 million imported large residential washers in the first year, and a 50 percent tariff on machines above that number. The tariffs decline to 16 percent and 40 percent respectively in the third year.
A 30 percent tariff will be imposed on imported solar cells and modules in the first year, with the tariffs declining to 15 percent by the fourth year. The tariff allows 2.5 gigawatts of unassembled solar cells to be imported tariff-free in each year.
Whirlpool, which sought the washers ""safeguard"" action against rivals Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and LG Electronics after years of anti-dumping cases, saw its shares rise 1.8 percent in after-hours trade.
""By enforcing our existing trade laws, President Trump has ensured American workers will compete on a level playing field with their foreign counterparts,"" Whirlpool Chairman Jeff Fettig said in a statement.
The move punishes Samsung, which recently began washer production in South Carolina, and LG, which is building a washer factory in Tennessee. 
""This tariff is a tax on every consumer who wants to buy a washing machine. Everyone will pay more, with fewer choices,"" Samsung said in a statement.
LG Electronics said that the decision will hinder the ramp-up and employment prospects of its new plant, which will not begin production until late 2018 or early 2019.
Trump ignored a recommendation from the ITC to exclude South Korean-produced washers from LG from the tariffs, as prior anti-dumping duties on these machines have been dropped. The decision could also hurt retailer Sears Holdings, whose Kenmore brand sources its larger washers from LG's overseas factories.
LG shares fell as much as 5 percent in Seoul trading against the wider market’s 0.4 percent gain. Shares in Samsung Elec were up 0.83 percent.
BLOW TO RENEWABLE ENERGY 
The tariffs are expected to slow a shift to renewable energy in the United States, just as solar was becoming cost competitive with electricity generated from fossil fuels like coal, an industry that Trump has pledged to protect.
MJ Shiao, head of renewable energy research for Wood Mackenzie, said the tariffs would likely reduce projected U.S. solar installations by 10 to 15 percent over the next five years.
""It is a significant impact, but certainly not destructive to the end market,” Shiao told Reuters.
The domestic solar panel producers who sought the trade remedies wanted tariffs of 50 percent - the highest allowed under law. Petitioners Suniva and SolarWorld have said they cannot compete with the influx of cheap imports, mostly from Chinese producers, which has caused solar panel prices to drop more than 30 percent since early 2016.
The U.S. solar trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, campaigned against the tariffs and estimated the decision would create a ""crisis"" for the burgeoning industry and result in the loss of 23,000 U.S. jobs this year as billions of dollars in solar investments are canceled.
Suniva, majority-owned by Hong Kong-listed Shunfeng International Clean Energy Ltd, applauded the decision, saying that Trump ""is sending a message that American innovation and manufacturing will not be bullied out of existence without a fight.""
FIRST OF SEVERAL POTENTIAL ACTIONS
The decisions were the first of several potential tariff actions that Trump may take in the coming weeks and months. He is considering recommendations on import restrictions for steel and aluminum on national security grounds under a 1962 trade law and tariffs or other trade sanctions against China over its intellectual property practices.

The intellectual property, washer and solar panel probes were done under a 1974 trade law that has been seldom invoked since the World Trade Organization was launched in 1995.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The judge hearing the Justice Department's lawsuit to stop AT&T (NYSE:T) from buying Time Warner ordered the department on Monday to seek permission to give the two companies access to rivals' pricing data.
Judge Richard Leon, living up to a pledge made during a hearing last week, ordered the Justice Department, which has the data, to ask the companies that gave it to the government for consent to pass it on to AT&T and Time Warner's legal team.
The Justice Department sued in November to stop AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. wireless company, from buying Time Warner for $85 billion because of concerns that it could raise prices for rivals and pay-TV subscribers as well as hamper the development of online video. Trial is set for March 19.
Fights over data are common during antitrust trials since companies that are subpoenaed frequently fear that their rivals' executives will gain access to sensitive internal data that put them at a competitive disadvantage.
AT&T is expected to use the data to show that previous mergers did not lead to price increases for content as a way to bolster its argument that this deal also will not lead to higher prices when cable companies seek to buy content.
AT&T and Time Warner are seeking data from five programmers, including Walt Disney Co, Twenty-First Century Fox, Viacom Inc, Discovery Communications Inc (NASDAQ:DISCA) and  Scripps Networks Interactive  Inc (NASDAQ:SNI), according to the judge's order. 
They are also seeking it from distributors Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA),  Charter Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:CHTR), Cox Communications Inc and Altice USA Inc, the judge's order said.

Leon had given access to confidential information to the court, Justice Department lawyers and staff, service providers and AT&T and Time Warner's outside counsel.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America (N:BAC) is offering cash and interest rate incentives to Merrill Lynch clients for opening first-time checking and savings accounts as it tries to seize the large chunk of wealth that brokerage customers hold at other institutions. 
The bank is missing out on as much as $200 billion in deposits and other assets from the roughly half of Merrill Lynch clients who bank elsewhere, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday. Clients with both bank and wealth management accounts have on average 15 percent more assets at Bank of America, according to a study the bank conducted last September.
""The ultimate objective is developing a deeper relationship with their affluent wealth management clients,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at the rate-comparing website Bankrate.com.
The effort comes the same day that an online petition criticizing Bank of America for charging fees on checking accounts with low balances gathered nearly 45,000 signatures on the website Change.org. 
Customers in the bank's core checking accounts, including many who were recently shifted out of e-banking accounts, will be charged $12 a month if their account balance falls below $1,500 or if they receive less than $250 a month in direct deposits, according to Bank of America.
The petition, started three weeks ago by a Bank of America client, called for the bank to preserve fee-free checking accounts. 
Bank of America spokeswoman Carla Molina said the bank offers many ways to avoid paying a monthly fee, such as waivers for students under the age of 24, and by receiving $250 in monthly direct deposits, which works out to $3,000 annually.
""This is one of the lowest qualifiers in the industry,"" Molina said.
Starting this week in the wealth business, select Merrill Lynch clients will receive letters in the mail offering them $200 cash if they open a new checking account and receive at least $4,000 in direct deposits in the first three months. 
Clients must also open a new savings account at the same time and deposit at least $25,000 within 30 days, for which the bank will pay them 1.35 percent in interest the first year. 
The $200 cash incentive is similar to what competitors offer, McBride said, but the interest rate is higher.
On the low end of offers, a money market deposit account currently pays just 0.17 percent on balances of $25,000. The highest-yielding savings account available at a national bank pays 1.70 percent, according to Bankrate.com.

Big banks have been slow to raise the rates they pay customers on their deposits, despite making more on the money they loan to clients as a result of the U.S. Federal Reserve steadily raising interest rates over the last year.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Archer Daniels Midland Co's (N:ADM) proposed takeover of  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG) could signal a change in the company's strategy on oilseeds, giving the top U.S. grain merchant a much bigger capacity to crush soy just months after ADM's chief executive said the firm would cut spending on the sector.
The potential strategic change comes as the world's biggest agricultural merchants search for new ways to offset four years of bumper harvests that are hurting their ability to make money through the traditional channels of buying, selling and shipping crops.
Consolidation is seen as one remedy, and ADM has proposed a takeover of Bunge, one of the world's top oilseed processors, a source said on Friday.
ADM and Bunge have declined to comment on the takeover approach. 
Both companies crush soybeans to make vegetable oil and livestock feed for customers around the world, including meat producers.
Just three months ago, though, ADM chief Juan Luciano said the company would reduce capital spending on oilseed crushing and increase spending on higher-margin businesses, such as food ingredients, ""in support of the growth portion of our strategic plan.""
The company placed its biggest bet on that strategy in 2014 when it acquired natural flavorings company Wild Flavors for about $3 billion.
""A merger would differ from the value-added push that ADM described as its strategy when it bought Wild Flavors,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Robert Moskow said. ""That said, this represents a golden opportunity for ADM to grow its oilseeds division and improve its long-term competitiveness.""
Especially valuable to ADM could be the chance to expand oilseed operations in Brazil, the world's biggest soy exporter, traders said. Bunge controls 27 percent of the oilseed crush market there, while ADM has 10 percent, according to data from Credit Suisse. 
JP Morgan analyst Ann Duignan also said Bunge's processing capacity outside of the United States would likely be considered ""prize assets"" for ADM.
ADM and Bunge shares rose 4.4 percent and 5.9 percent, respectively, on Monday.
Bunge had rebuffed an acquisition offer from  Glencore  Plc (L:GLEN) last year, but Heather Jones, analyst for Vertical Group, placed the odds of a Bunge takeover above 50 percent after ADM's approach. 
She said a bigger bet by ADM on oilseeds could pay off as that market grows over time - presenting a simpler path to improved returns than a lengthy strategic overhaul.

""Arguably the most bullish longer-term theme in the agribusiness sector is global vegetable protein demand,"" she said.

223,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 06:20PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Ackman cuts staff, shuns limelight as he seeks to turn around fund","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - William Ackman is cutting almost a fifth of staff and looking to lower his public profile as he seeks to turn around Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management after three straight years of losses, people familiar with the move told Reuters on Monday.
The billionaire hedge fund manager, who recently suffered big losses on Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX) International Inc (TO:VRX) and  Herbalife  Ltd (N:HLF) and lost a proxy fight with Automatic Data Processing Inc (O:ADP), will spend more time investing and stop being the firm's No. 1 marketer, the people said.
The first step in turning around Pershing Square is laying off 10 people, shrinking the firm to 46 employees from 56, to oversee the roughly $9 billion in assets the firm manages for clients, the people said. 
That is about half the assets he had at Pershing Square's peak in 2015. Most of the reduction will involve back-office employees, although one investment team member is also leaving.
Ackman also plans to go silent, at least for awhile, the people said, a major change in style for one of Wall Street's most voluble investors.
The 51-year-old hedge fund manager, who made his name with winning bets on Allergan Plc (N:AGN),  Canadian Pacific Railway  Ltd (TO:CP) and others, became one of the world's most visible activist investors through lengthy public appearances. He hosted hours-long conferences in Manhattan to answer every question about his short bet against Herbalife and his plan for drugmaker Valeant to buy rival Allergan.
Ackman plans to curtail all of his own marketing and public relations meetings associated with running a big hedge fund, said the people familiar with the matter, who were not authorized to discuss the changes publicly.
Instead, Ben Hakim, a partner who joined Pershing Square in 2012, will do the traveling and bulk of talking to clients. Ackman will stay in the office, concentrating on financial analysis.
Pershing Square spokesman Francis McGill declined to comment.
DINNER DATE 
Ackman plans to announce the personnel changes and new direction on Thursday at the firm's annual client dinner at the New York Public Library.
That dinner, and another similar event in London, will become the once-a-year chance for pension funds, endowments and wealthy investors to see and hear Ackman discuss performance and lay out his strategy, the people said. This time, Ackman will detail how his private funds lost between 1.6 percent and 3.2 percent in 2017.
For months, Ackman has been promising a comeback. In the first few weeks of this year, Pershing Square's funds are up about 2 percent while the stock market has been setting new records, with the S&P 500 Index gaining more than 5 percent year-to-date.
As Ackman's fame and investing prowess grew over the years with successful bets on Canadian Pacific, General Growth Properties and Air Products and Chemicals Inc (N:APD), Pershing Square's assets also grew. But investors traditionally pull 10 percent to 15 percent of capital from a hedge fund every year, making it more difficult for larger firms to keep replacing assets.
New clients often demand an audience with the boss, but Ackman has told people he is putting an end to that practice. He still plans to communicate with investors through letters and quarterly calls, and occasionally make public statements about investments.
Hakim and Pershing's investor relations team will be available to handle day-to-day queries that Ackman previously spent a significant amount of time on.
In making the changes, Ackman wants the firm to operate more as it did in 2012, when he won a big proxy contest at Canadian Pacific, people familiar with the matter said. Pershing Square then employed 46 people and managed $11 billion. The firm's staff peaked at 70 people in 2016.
One member of the investment team is among the job cuts, people familiar with the matter said. 
David Klafter, a senior lawyer at the firm, will join the investment team to handle legal matters associated with the firm's bets, which usually total only about a dozen.
Pershing Square's investment team has historically had between eight and 10 members and will stay at its current size of 10 people, the people said. 

Ackman also laid off his driver, saying he can walk or take the subway to his Midtown Manhattan office, the people familiar with the matter said. The staff were told the news of the layoffs late last week.

224,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 05:58PM ET</span>",U.S. says audit watchdog staff helped KPMG pass audit inspections,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Monday announced criminal and civil charges against three former staffers of an audit watchdog, accusing them of providing confidential information to help accounting firm KPMG pass regulatory inspections. 
Three ex-KPMG executives also were charged with encouraging disclosure of the data on Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) audit inspections, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department said in separate filings. 
The incidents occurred between 2015 and 2017, the government said.
Two of the former PCAOB staffers charged, Cynthia Holder and Brian Sweet, left the watchdog to work for KPMG during that period, authorities said, taking confidential information with them. The third, Jeffrey Wada, also tried to move to KPMG, they said.
Holder's lawyer could not immediately be reached. A lawyer for Wada could not immediately be identified, and calls to phone numbers linked to his name were not immediately returned.
Sweet has already pleaded guilty to criminal conspiracy charges, according to a spokesman for the prosecutors. He has also reached a settlement with the SEC, the agency said. Sweet's lawyer, Richard Morvillo, declined to comment.
The ex-KPMG executives charged were David Middendorf, David Britt and Thomas Whittle. Gregory Bruch, Middendorf's lawyer, said his client was a ""very well regarded accounting professional"" who ""intends to defend himself.""
Melinda Haag, Britt's lawyer, said her client was innocent, and that the conduct he was accused of was not criminal.
A lawyer for Whittle could not immediately be reached.
The government charged that the PCAOB and KPMG employees conspired to share information about which audits the watchdog would be reviewing, giving KPMG an opportunity to shore up those before facing scrutiny.
The PCAOB is a private non-profit corporation that monitors the audits of public companies.
In a statement on Monday, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said he did not believe the improper actions compromised the integrity of the KPMG audits embroiled in the scandal.
Last year, KPMG said it had fired six people over the PCAOB leaks, which the company had identified and brought to the government's attention. The company hired outside legal counsel to investigate the matter and took ""remedial actions"" to prevent a recurrence, KPMG spokesman Manuel Goncalves said on Monday in an email. 

Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC’s enforcement division, said the enforcement action was unrelated to a December shake-up of the PCAOB in which the SEC named a new head for the watchdog and four new board members.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico said on Monday it would sell off its troubled power utility to the private sector, saying the process could take roughly 18 months to complete.
The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) has yet to recover fully from the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria, which in late September knocked out power to the entire island and left all 3.4 million residents of the U.S. territory in the dark.
""The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) has become a heavy burden on our people, who are now hostage to its poor service and high cost. What we know today as the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority does not work and cannot continue to operate like this,"" Governor Ricardo Rossello said in a statement.
Less than 64 percent of homes and businesses are receiving power, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Energy.
Rossello described how the process for breaking up the company would occur in three phases, calling it a move toward a ""consumer-centered model.""
Phase one consists of defining the legal framework via legislation. Phase two will be evaluating bids, and phase three will be ""the terms of awarding and hiring the selected companies that meet the requirements for the transformation and modernization of our energy system will be negotiated.""
PREPA has been hampered by years of underinvestment, frequent turnover in management and inefficient collections that forced it to go deeply into debt. The utility incurred about $9 billion in debt before declaring bankruptcy in July.
An ad hoc group of investors holding much of the utility's $9 billion in bonds had no immediate comment.
Given PREPA is currently trying to work its way through bankruptcy and all of the island's financial dealings must go through the federally appointed Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, selling off PREPA's assets could be a long process.

The Oversight Board did not have an immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb praised food group Nestle's chief, but is keeping up the pressure with demands that the company move faster to overhaul its strategy.
""We hope now that Dr. Schneider has completed his first year and there is new blood on the board, the company is able to move with greater alacrity,"" Loeb wrote about CEO Mark Schneider in a letter to his own investors. A copy was seen by Reuters.
Loeb said he wants the Swiss company to buy back more of its stock at a quicker pace and sell its stake in beauty business L'Oreal. 
Loeb's hedge fund Third Point made a $3.5 billion investment in Nestle in June and has - for now - given Schneider, who became Nestle's first external leader in nearly a century when he took over as CEO a year ago, room to maneuver.
Schneider has taken positive steps including announcing plans to buy back as much as 20 billion Swiss francs ($20.8 billion) worth of stock and make portfolio adjustments, Loeb wrote.
But the influential investor said the company now has to make good on promises, including boosting its exposure in high-growth areas such as coffee, pet care, bottled water and nutrition while selling ""ill-fitting businesses"" more quickly.
It should also buy back shares more quickly before the price climbs, Loeb wrote, adding that there are better uses for the money currently tied up in its L'Oreal stake.
Loeb expressed some concern about why the company pushed more deeply into consumer healthcare with the purchase of Canadian vitamin maker Atrium Innovations [AIII.UL] and said he wants a better explanation of that move.
To date, Loeb has given Schneider a tentative thumbs up, but his patience may not last forever. 
Famous for his sharply-worded letters to corporate chieftains, Loeb has helped push out bosses at Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) and Sotheby's. Activist investors have recently become quicker to push out chief executives who they think are not up to the job.
Loeb's Third Point Offshore fund returned 18.1 percent last year, largely as stock investment powered ahead. 
Looking at the outlook for this year, Loeb said growth is unlikely to accelerate much more. 
""While we remain optimistic about the trajectory of the economy and markets, we have weighed our positioning with an acute awareness of the risks,"" he said.

Office-using jobs growth in New York has been robust and is the single most important statistic for real estate, said Spencer Levy, head of research for the Americas at CBRE.
""The U.S. economy is in a surprisingly good place where we sit in the cycle,"" Levy told reporters. ""The good news extends here to New York City as well.""
The International Monetary Fund on Monday lifted its world economic growth forecast in 2018 and 2019 due to the tax cuts and said the U.S. economy is now likely to expand by 2.7 percent this year and slow to 2.5 percent next year.
Office employment rose to a record 1.66 million people last year and helped contribute to the best year of leasing activity in Manhattan since 2014, CBRE said.
While a tight labor market will provide a headwind for the economy, further jobs growth and strong leasing activity are expected for New York this year, the brokerage said.
New York City's economy grew at an annual 3.6 percent in the third quarter of last year, or triple the same period's pace in 2016, CBRE said, citing the New York comptroller's office.
Average hourly earnings for private employees in the city increased 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter, the largest gain for that quarter since 2008, according to New York state data.
The growth and hourly earnings data are higher than the U.S. average. 

""The biggest risk factor out there is a black swan event or a stock market correction,"" Levy said, adding he did not believe the Federal Reserve will mistakenly raise interest rates too quickly.

Bank of Japan press conference 
The Bank of Japan is expected to leave its 10-year yield rate and policy rate unchanged at 0% and -0.1%, respectively, when it delivers its decision Tuesday following a two-day meeting.
Following a brief bid in the yen early January after the Bank of Japan trimmed its purchases of bonds, the safe-haven currency has come under pressure against the greenback as traders scaled back expectations that the central bank was poised to announce plans to taper its loose monetary policy measures.
Markets expectations were perhaps too hawkish concerning the Bank of Japan's timeline to normalization, Action Economics said, adding that it expects BoJ chief Haruhiko Kuroda to stress the importance of a gradual approaching to unwinding the central bank's stimulus programme.
USD/JPY rose 0.23% to Y110.96.
U.S. crude oil stockpiles to show large decline?
Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute due Tuesday. 
The American Petroleum Institute reported crude oil stockpiles fell by about 5.12 million barrels for the week ended Jan. 12.
Crude oil futures have made bullish start to the week amid positive commentary on OPEC-led output cuts, and expectations that ongoing oil demand growth would underpin rebalancing in markets.
Netflix to inspire Nasdaq to record highs ?
Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported fourth-quarter earnings of $0.41 per share on revenue of $3.286 billion, up from $0.15 per share and $2.478 billion respectively.
The company said it added 8.3 million subscribers during the quarter, well above analysts’ estimates of a range between 6.2 million and 7 million.
U.S. net subscriber additions, meanwhile, were 1.98 million, compared to expectations of 1.27 million. International subscriber net additions were 6.36 million compared to expectations of 5 million.
Forward guidance was estimated at $3.67 billion for the first quarter 2018, ahead of analysts’ estimates of $3.49 billion, while EPS is expected to rise to $0.63 per share, compared to analysts’ estimates of $0.56 per share. Despite the threat of rising competition, the company said it expects to add 1.45 million U.S. subscribers in the first quarter, and 4.90 million international subscribers.
Netflix closed more than 9% higher in after-hours trade following a close of $227.58 Monday."

Dozens of little-known companies across the globe have seen their share prices leap in recent months after unveiling plans to enter the bitcoin industry or that of its underlying distributed ledger blockchain technology.
In December, the SEC temporarily suspended trading in the shares of Crypto Company (PK:CRCW), a small firm that saw its stock rise more than 2,700 percent after signing a deal to buy a cryptocurrency data platform.
Clayton warned that it was not acceptable for companies without a meaningful track record in the sector to dabble in blockchain technology, change their name and immediately offer investors securities without providing adequate disclosures around the risks involved.
""The SEC is looking closely at the disclosures of public companies that shift their business models to capitalize on the perceived promise of distributed ledger technology and whether the disclosures comply with the securities laws, particularly in the case of an offering,"" he told a conference on Monday.
The chairman also said the SEC had seen ""disturbing"" evidence that legal professionals have been wrongly counseling clients that initial coin offerings, whereby cryptocurrency start-ups solicit funds from investors who receive tokens in return, do not need to comply with federal securities law.
The SEC has previously said that such fundraisings should comply with securities law and has warned investors more broadly over the risks of cryptocurrency fraudsters. 
""I have instructed the SEC staff to be on high alert for approaches to ICOs that may be contrary to the spirit of our securities laws and the professional obligations of the U.S. securities bar,"" Clayton said.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Monday as each of Wall Street's main scored records in the wake of a deal by U.S. senators to end the federal government shutdown.
Legislation to renew federal funding to the government cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate and was expected soon to pass votes in the Senate and House of Representatives, allowing government to re-open through Feb 8.
""You would think something like the threat of a government shutdown or an actual government shutdown would serve as a catalyst to spook some weaker holders out of the market,"" said Eric Marshall, portfolio manager and director of research at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas. 
""That hasn't happened, which speaks to underlying strength of what we're seeing right now in equity markets.""
Earnings growth of 12.4 percent is expected for the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 55 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings through Monday morning, 80 percent have topped expectations, well above the 72 percent beat rate for the past four quarters. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 142.88 points, or 0.55 percent, to 26,214.6, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 22.67 points, or 0.81 percent, to 2,832.97 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 71.65 points, or 0.98 percent, to 7,408.03.
 Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) climbed 6.40 percent after posting a much bigger-than-expected quarterly profit in the fourth quarter, benefiting from a shale-driven surge in U.S. oil production.
The Nasdaq biotech index (NBI) rose 3.15 percent to notch its best day since June 21 after a flurry of merger activity in the sector with French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) and U.S.-based Celgene (O:CELG) splurging a combined total of more than $20 billion.
Shares in U.S. hemophilia specialist Bioverativ (O:BIVV) soared 61.89 percent after Sanofi agreed to buy the company for $11.6 billion.
Juno Therapeutics (O:JUNO) jumped 26.83 percent after Celgene agreed to buy the biotech for about $9 billion in cash.
In other M&A news, AIG (N:AIG) said it would buy reinsurer Validus Holdings (N:VR) for $5.56 billion, sending the target's shares up 44.03 percent.
Industrial stocks were one of the few laggards, as woes continued for  General Electric  (N:GE), down 0.55 after BofA-Merrill Lynch downgraded its stock. GE fell below $16 for the first time since 2011 and is down nearly 8 percent for the year.
Shares of Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), a major contributor to the recent stock rally, closed up 3.23 percent ahead of its quarterly results and added to gains in extended trading after its quarterly numbers were released. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.70-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.38-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 123 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 202 new highs and 16 new lows.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Days after Detroit lost out in the race to host Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) second headquarters, the city's mayor and the billionaire owner of auto supplier Flex-N-Gate Corp offered a sneak preview of what will be the largest new auto factory built in the city since the 1990s.
The $160 million plant will make metal and plastic parts for  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) vehicles and is projected to employ more than 400 people when it opens in October. For Detroit, the plant represents a more realistic, smaller scale approach to bringing jobs back to areas of the city abandoned as manufacturers left for the suburbs, other states and overseas.
""This is the way we'll go about employing"" city residents, ""four or five hundred jobs at a time,"" Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said on Monday during a walk through the cavernous plant on Detroit's east side. The plant is about 60 percent complete. Large pits in the concrete floor marked where metal forming presses will stand.
Shahid Khan, owner of Flex-N-Gate and the National Football League Jacksonville Jaguars, said Ford urged him to consider locating the factory in the city, an idea Khan said he supported. Duggan said the city helped locate the property and will pay for training workers. Khan did not say how much jobs at the factory will pay but he expressed support for the idea of a $20 an hour wage ""to break the cycle of poverty.""
Jobs at the plant will require ""more brain power and less muscle,"" Khan said, as workers operate automated presses and other equipment.

The investment resulted from a collaboration of Flex-N-Gate, Ford and the city to train city residents to work in an automated factory.

259,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>","Sellers Want to Sell, Buyers Want to Buy: The Emerging Bond Boom","(Bloomberg) -- Emerging markets are racking up bond sales at a record pace this year as issuers scramble to lock in low yields before the Federal Reserve’s next interest-rate increase.
1. The Tally so Far
“Issuers want to issue, investors are happy to buy and therefore a lot of deals get printed,” said Ng Kheng Siang, Asia Pacific head of fixed income at State Street Global Advisors, which has $2.67 trillion under management. “Ahead of the impending rise in the U.S. bond yields with the Fed hiking rates, the issuers are going to take advantage of the current levels.”
2. Spreads Tighten
“The thirst for yield remains a dominant theme of our time,” said Burkhard Varnholt, global deputy chief investment officer at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG. “It will not go away, given the demographics of aging and rising longevity, which are pushing pension-funds into high-yielding assets around the world. It stands to reason that this super trend will continue to unleash demand for GEM-bonds.”
3. Catch the Hunger While It Lasts
“It may be the case that emerging-market bonds can’t get more attractive right now,” said David Lafferty, Boston-based chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers, which oversees $961 billion. “Given the spread between high-quality developed and emerging markets as central banks in the developed world begin tightening, it isn’t clear you’re going to have that much of a spread going forward.”
4. December Dues
“Debt levels remain emerging markets’ Achilles heel,” said Delphine Arrighi, a London-based portfolio manager at Old Mutual Global Investors, which oversees $53 billion. “But as long as inflows keep pouring into the asset class, governments will continue to find relatively cheap funding in the market.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global business travel is expected to thrive in 2018, according to a report by a travel management group, as an improving world economy buoys confidence in the private sector and investment community.
 American Express  (NYSE:AXP) Global Business Travel (GBT) is forecasting growth across the travel sector, including air and ground transportation and hotel stays, with higher fares and increased bookings supporting the industry's growth.
""The travel outlook looks bright as economic conditions continue to strengthen and growing business and consumer confidence translates into increased demand for travel,"" GBT said in its report.
The travel company projected Asia will experience the most robust growth largely on the strength of economic progress in China and India. 
Despite the generally optimistic outlook, increasingly protectionist policies across the globe and looming geopolitical instability continue to drag on the industry and stir uncertainty among stakeholders, according to the report. 
GBT cited U.S. foreign policy and trade deal renegotiations as a potential hindrance for international travel, in addition to some route overcapacity and rapid expansion by low-cost carriers into the market.
The U.S. industry, however, has been preparing for a business travel boom in the wake of a U.S. tax overhaul that sharply reduced corporate income taxes.

Other policies supported by the Trump administration, including a pledge to reduce U.S. trade deficits and support initiatives that will put American corporations ahead of foreign competitors, have heartened businesses and investors and raised expectations for the near-term future of business travel.

266,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>","Icahn, Deason join forces to demand Xerox explore options","By Muvija M
(Reuters) - Hedge fund managers Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason joined forces on Monday to push  Xerox Corp  (N:XRX) to explore strategic options, oust its ""old guard"", including its CEO, and negotiate better terms for its decades-long deal with Japan's Fujifilm.
Icahn and Deason – respectively the No.1 and No.3 Xerox shareholders with a combined stake of over 15 percent – plan to nominate four board members if their demands were not met, they said in a joint letter to Xerox shareholders.
Xerox shares were up 2.5 percent in late afternoon trading on Monday.
Declining demand for office printing has limited prospects of the 50-year-old JV, which is 75 percent owned by Fujifilm Holdings Corp (T:4901) and sells photocopy products and services in the Asia-Pacific region.
Chief Executive Jeff Jacobson is ""incapable"" of leading Xerox or negotiating a better deal with Fujifilm, while the company's veteran directors ""are unwilling to make the tough decisions necessary to prevent the Xerox ship from sinking,"" Icahn and Deason said.
Three of Xerox's 10 board members have held their post for more than a decade. Jacobson, who joined Xerox in early 2012, is also a board member.
In a statement, Xerox said: ""The Xerox Board of Directors and management are confident with the strategic direction in which the Company is heading and we will continue to take action to achieve our common goal of creating value for all Xerox shareholders.""
The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday Icahn and Deason were pushing the company to consider options, including selling itself.
Icahn's interest in Xerox goes back to 2015, when he disclosed his stake and called the shares ""undervalued"".
Jacobson became CEO in January last year after Xerox split itself in two. One part retained the legacy name and printer operations, and the other became a publicly listed business process outsourcing company called  Conduent Inc  (N:CNDT).
Since the split, Xerox has reported declining sales in every quarter.
Its shares have risen 38 percent since Jacobson took the reins, compared with the roughly 46 percent gain in the S&P 500 technology index (SPLRCT) over the same period.
But Xerox's stock gains include a near 20-percent jump on the first trading day as the new Xerox.

The stock is also up about 7.5 percent since Jan. 10 when the Journal reported Xerox and Fujifilm were in deal talks that could include a change in control of Xerox, but not a full takeover.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Investors are betting Canada's smaller financial firms could see a jump in revenues after they helped fund marijuana companies ahead of the country's planned legalization of the drug this year.
Equity offerings by Canadian weed companies tripled to a record high of nearly $1 billion in 2017, with nearly two-thirds of that in the final quarter, data from Thomson Reuters showed. 
Much of the issuance for pot producers has been led by small independent brokers, such as Canaccord Genuity Group Inc (TO:CF). 
In addition to being paid underwriting fees, the brokers can sometimes receive warrants, which could have become significantly more valuable after a surge in the marijuana companies' stock, market players said. 
BMO Capital Markets' move last week to help Canopy Growth Corp (TO:WEED), Canada's biggest cannabis producer, raise C$200.7 million ($161.3 million) was a sign that established brokers were likely to take some market share away from the smaller brokers.
But smaller players have an early lead in funding research and banking relationships with marijuana companies after bigger, bank-owned rivals saw the industry as too risky or bad for their reputations, market players said.
""The smaller independent brokers are fairly opportunistic and good at jumping on trends, so crazed market activity in anything to do with cryptocurrency and marijuana plays right into that ability,"" said Matt Skipp, president of SW8 Asset Management.
POT KICK
Canada's plans to legalize pot for recreational use in mid 2018 would make it the first Group of Seven country to allow the drug nationwide and the second in the world after Uruguay.
Shares of Canaccord and another small cap broker  GMP Capital Inc  (TO:GMP) have surged as much as 67 percent and 110 percent respectively since November, when marijuana stocks started to take off. GMP has also helped raise money for miners of digital currencies, which have also soared in recent months.
In addition to increased underwriting in the most recent quarter, small brokers could also have benefited from the investor trading of pot stocks in the secondary market as well as the potential increase in value of any warrants they hold.
Compensating the underwriters with warrants can help lower the cost of financing for some pot companies who are growing and short of cash, said Skipp.
An underwriting agreement for  Aurora Cannabis  Inc (TO:ACB) from October shows that Canaccord, the lead underwriter, and other participating brokers were granted options that would give them the right for a period of three years to purchase the shares of the company at the transaction's offering price, which was C$3. Shares of Aurora were trading at around C$14 on Monday.
""To the extent that you want to buy a business that is pretty transparent, with proper cash flows and a business that you understand and like, some of these independent brokers could be a play on the kind of activity that has been going on,"" said Diana Avigdor, head of trading at Barometer Capital Management. 
It remains unclear how many of Canada's biggest banks will eventually participate in the market. Those that do could target the more established producers, rather than the many smaller, potentially riskier ones.
The 2018 financing pipeline has already got off to a brisk start, including the equity offering from Canopy Growth and a C$200 million issue of convertible debentures by Aurora Cannabis, that was led by Canaccord. 

""Obviously there is a healthy market here for companies that raise money,"" said Vahan Ajamian, an equity research analyst covering the cannabis sector at Beacon Securities Ltd. ""I don't see that shrinking any time soon.""

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said on Monday that some of General Electric's flagship new gas turbines in Pakistan were still suffering from technical issues such as ""vibration"" but he was confident the American company will fix the problems.
The 9HA-class gas turbines are GE power division's newest and most prestigious product but last year a series of delays and outages interrupted their installation in three power stations vital to Pakistan's efforts to end electricity shortfalls.
GE (N:GE) has described last year's problems as ""teething"" issues, but the troubles have frustrated Pakistani officials and concerned analysts.
GE, undergoing a restructuring, saw its share price tumble below $16 on Monday for the first time since 2011.
Former petroleum minister Abbasi told Reuters it was normal for problems to arise in large projects with new technology but he had faith in GE to fix the problems.
""There have been technical issues. GE is working to resolve them, and there are issues that remain today. Some have been solved, some are still there. Those will get resolved,"" Abbasi told Reuters in an interview in the prime minister's chamber in Pakistan's Parliament in the capital Islamabad.
""I’m very confident that these will be very robust plants that will be a flagship for both GE and Pakistan.""
The Pakistani power plants are being upgraded to operate at 1,200 MW combined cycle, having worked in simple cycle mode - delivering around 800 MW per power plant - for much of 2017.
Abbasi did not elaborate on how many of the six turbines operating in three 1,200 MW power plants were suffering installation difficulties.
""Some have vibration issues, some have technical issues, GE is working on that,"" said Abbasi, who is a trained engineer. 
""These (power plants) are still with the EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contractor under GE's supervision, so we don’t have any liability for them at the moment.""
China's Harbin Electric International Company and SEPCOIII Electric Power Construction Corporation are the contractors building the power stations. 
In response to Abbasi's remarks, a GE spokesperson pointed to a statement the company issued to Reuters in December about last year’s problems.
""Together we’ve encountered and communicated openly about launch challenges and readily resolved issues during this time – it's important to note that challenges are common with power plants of this size and complexity during the commissioning and early operations phase,"" GE said in the statement.
""We remain committed to supporting customer and site needs with the highest standards of quality and excellence,"" GE added.
The 9HA-class gas turbines entered the Guinness World Records for efficiency, based on the amount of electricity generated from natural gas at the power plant in Bouchain, France, where it was first put into commercial operation in 2016. Pakistan ordered six turbines in 2015.

GE’s record efficiency of 62.2 percent has since been exceeded by rival manufacturer Mitsubishi Hitachi Power systems.

Senior financiers say they were told after the summer that the government would issue a position paper setting out Britain's negotiating priorities for a sector that pays more corporate tax than any other industry.
""When so many other sectors and issues have been given this clarity, the City is left in the dark,"" Catherine McGuinness, policy chair at the Corporation of the City of London, the capital's financial district, said on Monday.
""This really is disheartening."" 
Meanwhile, Treasury Committee Chair Nicky Morgan said the government's failure to publish the paper will send the ""wrong signals"" and leave financial services companies ""seriously concerned at the chronic state of uncertainty"".
""Financial services will be one of the most challenging elements of the Brexit negotiations. A paper articulating a clear sense of direction, and a desired end-state, could have boosted confidence that the government is up to the task"", Morgan said in a statement. 
Financial services, which account for about 12 percent of Britain's economic output, potentially have a lot to lose from the end of unfettered access to the EU market once Britain leaves in March 2019.
Banks in London are setting up new hubs in the EU, but have said they may have to shift more staff and operations than they need unless there is clarity on what sort of new trading deal Britain will negotiate with the EU.
Britain's Department for Exiting the European Union declined to say if any services paper would ever be published. 
""We will keep under review what is the best way of advocating our position – be that in private discussions with the EU, speeches, or a formal position paper,"" a spokesperson said.
Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman told reporters: ""We always let you know in the normal way if there is to be one."" 
Still, finance executives say relations with the government have improved since Britain and the EU last month agreed to the principle of a transition deal and to talks about future trade relationships.

Bankers had complained last year that their concerns were not being heard, but May told them this month they were a priority for her in Brexit talks.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks surged in Monday afternoon trading after senators in Washington reached a deal to reopen the federal government, ending a 2-1/2-day shutdown that world markets had largely taken in stride.
U.S. stocks jumped to new session highs after reports that the Senate had struck an agreement to keep the government open until Feb. 8.
In midday trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 66.8 points, or 0.2 percent, to 26,137.12, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 12.7 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,823.00 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 49.75 points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,383.34.
“It's almost a non-event at this point and would have to go on for at least a week before it would become an issue for the stock market,” said Tom Plumb, president of Madison, Wisconsin-based Plumb Funds. 
U.S. Treasury yields, which have tended to fall during previous government shutdowns, rose as investors saw limited economic fallout from the political standoff and focused instead on a global economy motoring ahead and U.S. inflation pressures. 
World markets had been unfazed by the shutdown in morning trading. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) on Monday reached close to its highest in more than three years, an extension of the selloff in U.S. bonds since September.
The gain in U.S. shares followed broad gains in Europe, where markets focused on a flurry of mergers and acquisitions and upcoming corporate earnings reports. Progress towards an end to political deadlock in Germany helped the mood. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was up 0.3 percent, with major indices rising in France and Germany. UK's FTSE (FTSE) was the main exception, dropping 0.2 percent. 
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.4 percent. 
DOLLAR NEAR THREE-YEAR LOW 
The dollar remained stuck near three-year lows, continuing its weak start to the year. The dollar index (DXY) fell 0.17 percent, with the euro  up 0.25 percent to $1.225.
In European bond markets, Spain's borrowing costs  dropped to a six-week low and the gap over its German peers  fell to its tightest in almost three years after Fitch Ratings gave Spain its first ""A"" rating since the euro zone debt crisis.
Greece's short-dated yields  also fell after S&P Global Ratings upgraded the country's credit ratings for the first time in two years. 
Most other euro zone bond yields were little changed. Analysts said investors were probably moving to the sidelines before the European Central Bank's first meeting of 2018 this Thursday.
Oil prices dipped slightly, with U.S. crude  down 0.08 percent to $63.26 per barrel and Brent  at $68.68, up 0.1 percent.

Spot gold  added 0.2 percent to $1,334.12 an ounce. U.S. gold futures  gained 0.05 percent to $1,333.80.

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron sought on Monday to show that his activity on the world stage and his pro-business reforms were bearing fruit with a highly-publicized summit of global CEOs in Versailles and a flurry of investments worth about $3 billion.
A 300 million euro ($368 million) investment by Japanese carmaker Toyota (T:7203) to increase capacity at its northern French plant producing the Yaris model was the centerpiece of the day, with 800 new jobs to be added by 2020.
But beyond the rare bricks-and-mortar factory investment, a trio of pledges by U.S. giants Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and German software maker SAP to boost their footprint in the French technology sector was likely to catch the eye of investors.
Facebook, whose chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg met Macron in the gilded palace of Versailles, said it would double the number of staff at its Paris artificial intelligence (IA) hub, while Google will open its own IA center at its campus in the French capital.
""Showcasing these projects will create a snowball effect,"" a presidential adviser said. ""When on the same day two groups like Google and Facebook make these announcements, it's natural to expect more in the sector to rethink how they view France.""
Germany's SAP committed to spend more than two billion euros in France over five years to help it develop internet-based cloud services and other advanced technologies.
""There is a real sense of economic momentum in France,"" Bill McDermott, the American-born CEO of SAP said in statement after meeting Macron. 
SUN KING'S PALACE
Eight months into his presidency, Macron is keen to convince the French that the tax cuts he is providing to corporates and millionaires are not a giveaway to the rich but can yield higher investment and curb an unemployment rate of nearly 10 percent.
Some 140 of the world's most powerful business executives had lunch at the Sun King's palace outside Paris, where Prime Minister Edouard Philippe answered questions in English before ""speed dating"" sessions with French ministers.
The French premier also announced new measures to attract investors, including the opening of a new international court in March in Paris to handle English law disputes and 1,000 new places in multilingual schools from September
The summit dubbed ""Choose France"" is held just two days before Macron heads to the global elite's annual gathering at Davos, making sure the event catches the top executives on their way to the Swiss Alps.
If the list of attendees - including Goldman Sachs's (N:GS) Lloyd Blankfein and Google's Sundar Pichai - is a sign of the 40-year old leader's pulling power, it is also a reminder of France's more pressing need for foreign investment to reduce a trade deficit of almost 50 billion euros.
In a study published last week, the COE-Rexecode think-tank said French companies had continued to lose market share to their euro zone rivals on global markets, with French goods and services accounting for 12.9 percent of the bloc's exports last year, down from 13.2 percent in 2016 and 17 percent in 2000.
In 2016, France was the 16th highest recipient of foreign direct investments in the world, UN data showed, with $28 billion, well below Europe's top two inflow hosts, Britain and the Netherlands, with $254 billion and $92 billion respectively.
But a flurry of smaller agrobusiness investment projects announced on Monday showed producing in France may be starting to become more attractive.

U.S. giant  General Mills  (N:GIS) said it would invest 17 million to make more ice cream at Arras in the north, Korean company SPC said it would create a 20 million euro factory to make frozen pastry, while Florida-based Fresh Del Monte (N:FDP) would build a nine million euro fresh fruit factory.

(Reuters) - An electronic product made by Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) that heats rather than burns tobacco contains lower levels of harmful and potentially harmful compounds than cigarettes, a preliminary review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded on Monday.
Laboratory data showed that the aerosol produced by the product, iQOS, can damage cells and affect human tissue, but that the effects ""are generally less severe and observed at much higher concentrations,"" compared to cigarette smoke.
The reviewers said full results from a pending study would provide more information about the carcinogenic potential of iQOS, but the results are not expected to become available until later this year.
The review comes two days before a meeting of outside advisors to the FDA who will discuss the product and recommend whether it should be allowed on the market. The panel will also decide whether the company should be allowed to claim iQOS is less harmful than cigarettes.
The FDA is not obliged to follow the recommendations of its advisors, but typically does.
Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities, said the hurdle is high, but she believes the company's application ""has a decent chance of prevailing.""
That is in part because the FDA under Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has committed to a tobacco policy that relies on the availability of reduced-risk products to help smokers obtain nicotine in a less damaging form.
The FDA's plan, announced last year, ""signals its seriousness with regard to supporting the development of a viable market of FDA-approved reduced-risk product alternatives to combustible cigarettes,"" Herzog said in a research note
In order to be authorized at all, Switzerland-based Philip Morris and its partner  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc must show that the iQOS is ""appropriate for the protection of public health,"" meaning any benefit to an individual smoker cannot come at the expense of added danger to the population as a whole.
In theory, the agency could allow the product on the market, but not permit the company to specifically market it as less dangerous. Philip Morris hopes to claim iQOS is less risky or less harmful than cigarettes.
Failing that the company would like to claim that the product reduces a smoker's exposure to harmful compounds compared with cigarettes, a potentially easier hurdle to clear.
The FDA found in its review that by some respiratory and cardiovascular measures, iQOS aerosol exposure produced less damage than cigarette smoke. The reviewers also noted there was little difference seen in the development of certain potentially pre-cancerous lesions in the respiratory tract.
Overall, data from the nonclinical studies suggest that iQOS aerosol has lower toxic potential than cigarette smoke under the conditions used in the tests and for the non-cancer conditions measured.

But they said it is ""unclear how the effects observed in treatment groups exposed to iQOS aerosols translate to a potential risk reduction for noncancer-related effects when chronically used by humans.""

(Reuters) - U.S. oilfield services company  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) reported a bigger-than-expected fourth-quarter profit after charges and gave an upbeat outlook for 2018, as higher oil prices continue to push U.S. production near record levels.
Halliburton delivered an optimistic view for its U.S. and international operations as rising oil prices spur demand for oilfield services. Its results, like those of larger rival Schlumberger (N:SLB) on Friday, point toward a broadening oil and gas recovery moving from U.S. onshore to international exploration and production markets. 
""I am very excited about the way 2018 is shaping up,"" said Chief Executive Jeff Miller during the firm's quarterly earnings call. ""North American unconventional activity should be very busy,"" he added, referring to growth in production from U.S. shale. 
Halliburton also reported a fourth-quarter charge of $385 million for its operations in Venezuela, which has been mired in political and economic turmoil. Halliburton said it would continue to ""vigorously pursue"" payments from its primary customer in Venezuela going forward, but also said it expected continuing delays in payments.
Schlumberger last week disclosed a $938 million write-down on its Venezuelan assets and receivables. Other oilfield services firms also have taken write-downs recently from receivables and promissory notes exchanged for debts from state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela . 
Halliburton's share price was up more than 3 percent at $54.64 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. The company posted a profit of 53 cents a share, beating the average analyst estimate of 46 cents per share, as per Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
The company was upbeat about the health of the U.S. oil industry given the rise in oil prices and increased drilling. The U.S. rig count is up almost 35 percent from last year to 936, according to data from General Electric's  Baker Hughes  (N:BHGE)
""Commodity prices are supportive of increasing activity in North America and I am encouraged by the increase in tender activity and the positive discussions we are having with our international customers,"" Miller said in a statement.
Halliburton, which makes more than half its revenue from North American operations, said total revenue rose to $5.9 billion for the quarter, from $4.02 billion a year earlier. Revenue in North America came in at $3.4 billion, up from $1.8 billion last year.
The uptick in drilling activity in the United States drove up cost for sand and trucking during the quarter, the company said on its call. Halliburton said it expected its sand costs to decline in 2018 as local mines come online. 
The company also reported $882 million in tax charges, largely the result of preliminary tax provisions related to the new U.S. tax law that was passed last month.
Schlumberger last week beat Wall Street forecasts and gave an upbeat outlook, predicting its international operations would grow in 2018 for the first time in four years.
A stronger outlook for the international market follows a nearly 24 percent climb in the global Brent futures contract (LCOc1) in the past three months.

""As for the international market, I'm encouraged for the first time in three years,"" said Miller.

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) is testing prototypes of the redesigned 2020 Focus compact car on U.S. roads 18 months ahead of the car's production launch in China.
The 2020 Focus will be the first Chinese-built Ford to be sold in the United States.
A heavily camouflaged prototype of the vehicle was parked on Sunday at a retail outlet in Ann Arbor, Michigan, about 40 miles (64 km) west of Ford's Dearborn headquarters and engineering center. Spy photographers have recently captured Focus prototypes undergoing pre-production testing in Europe as well. 
In an email, Ford spokesman Michael Levine said the new Focus will go into production in the second half of 2019 and feature ""more technology and more space"" and ""a number of new Focus models."" He said the redesigned Focus will be ""globally sourced, primarily from China."" 
Ford said last June that the next Focus for the U.S. market will come from China rather than from Mexico, as originally planned. At the time, Ford said the shift to China, the world's largest market for cars, would save the company $500 million in tooling costs.
By the time the next-generation model arrives next year, the current Focus will be more than eight years old. Last year's decision to shift U.S.-bound Focus production from Mexico to China signaled a change in strategy by Ford, in response to dwindling U.S. consumer demand for small cars in favor of more expensive and more profitable trucks and sport utility vehicles.

It is also an indication that China could play a much larger role in future vehicle production for North America, perhaps eclipsing Mexico as a low-cost manufacturing source.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a decision expected to test the Trump administration's approach to tobacco regulation, U.S. health advisers will vote this week on whether to allow Philip Morris International Inc (N:PM) to sell its novel iQOS tobacco device and claim it is less harmful than cigarettes.
The sleekly packaged little tube would not look out of place in an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) store. It is designed to heat tobacco but not burn it. Most of the harmful chemicals in tobacco are released when tobacco is burned.
The advisers to the Food and Drug Administration will discuss the product on Wednesday and Thursday and recommend whether it should be cleared. The FDA is not obliged to follow the recommendations of its outside advisers but typically does. 
If cleared, iQOS would become the first product to carry a modified-risk claim and could help advance the FDA's proposed new approach to reducing the dangers of smoking. 
For decades, U.S. health agencies have worked to help Americans quit cigarettes to avoid the risks of lung cancer and other disease. National smoking rates have declined to near historic lows of around 15 percent. 
But in July, newly appointed FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb proposed reducing nicotine levels in cigarettes to ""non-addictive"" levels while increasing development of lower-risk alternatives. The policy assumes that some percentage of the population will be unable or unwilling to give up nicotine. 
To make the new strategy succeed, the agency needs a stable of vetted, reduced-risk alternatives to cigarettes on the market. Philip Morris is one of the few companies that can finance such a long and expensive development process. It has spent close to $3 billion on reduced-risk products. 
""If this application fails, it will be clear that this is an expensive, wasteful, regulatory dead end,"" said Clive Bates, a tobacco expert who runs the consulting firm Counterfactual and advocates for alternative nicotine products. 
Bates and others argue that if Philip Morris cannot win FDA clearance for a modified-risk product, no one will be able to. 
Other companies have submitted modified-risk products for FDA review. 22nd Century Group Inc (A:XXII), which genetically engineers tobacco plants to have lower nicotine levels, seeks clearance for its ""Brand A"" very low nicotine cigarettes. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, owned by  British American Tobacco  Plc (L:BATS), is seeking clearance for six snus products - a moist smokeless tobacco pouch placed under the lip - under the Camel brand.

See the Reuters investigation on Philip Morris International, ""The secrets of the world's biggest tobacco company,"" http://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/pmi )
THE CLAIM
IQOS is used by nearly 4 million people in 30 markets outside the United States. It consists of a small pen-like holder containing a heated tobacco stick, and a charger. It looks similar to an e-cigarette, but uses real tobacco rather than nicotine-laced liquid. 
Philip Morris says that iQOS contains up to 95 percent fewer harmful or potentially harmful chemicals than the cigarette smoke produced from burning tobacco. If approved, the product would be marketed by U.S. partner  Altria Group  Inc (N:MO). 
The hurdles for success are high. 
To sell a new tobacco product, a company must demonstrate that it significantly reduces the risk of disease and does not encourage more smoking or delay quitting. 
To date, the FDA has determined that only eight products meet that standard, all of them snus smokeless tobacco pouches made by  Swedish Match  AB (ST:SWMA). The agency has granted no company the right to specifically claim that their product is less risky than cigarettes. 
Tobacco control activists say companies like Philip Morris cannot be trusted to make reduced-risk claims. They point to the industry's previous promotion of ""light"" and ""low-tar"" cigarettes as safer alternatives despite evidence showing they were not. 
Others argue that things have changed. Since 2009, the tobacco industry has had to answer to the FDA under federal law. New technology, including e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn products, may help smokers quit or shift those who cannot quit onto a less harmful substitute, they say. 
""Many of my friends in the tobacco control movement are still fighting the tobacco wars of the 1980s,"" said Scott Ballin, an independent health policy consultant and long-time anti-tobacco activist. ""We are beyond that now."" 
The FDA's Gottlieb favors an approach to treating addiction that makes available less harmful versions of addictive substances, including nicotine and opioids. These products, he argues, can help minimize damage to those unable to quit.
Mitch Zeller, head of the FDA's tobacco division, refers frequently to a ""continuum of risk"" for nicotine products, with nicotine gums and lozenges on one end and cigarettes on the other. The FDA would like to shift smokers unable to quit nicotine from high-risk to low-risk products. 

""What we have developed is an offering on the continuum of risk,"" said Ruth Dempsey, Philip Morris' director of scientific engagement. ""We believe it is better than cigarettes.""

289,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>",Mobile FX trading taking off even with banks' reticence: survey,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - Increasing numbers of traders are using their smartphones to conduct foreign exchange deals, a JP Morgan survey showed on Monday. 
In the second annual edition of an online survey among 400 institutional traders -- a ,majority of them focused on foreign exchange markets -- JP Morgan (N:JPM) found the proportion of investors now using a mobile trading app jumped by about 20 percentage points to about 37 percent.
Significant barriers remain, in particular, with relation to company policies preventing trading on mobile devices.
But Scott Wacker, global head of e-commerce sales and marketing at the U.S.-based bank, said electronic trading will continue to grow ""whether as a result of external regulatory push or an internal drive for efficiency.
""As the market becomes increasingly comfortable with the security protocols with mobile trading technology, we expect that electronic trading and interaction with the financial markets over mobile devices to increase,"" Wacker told Reuters.
The survey also found that the average proportion of notional trading volumes that will go through electronic channels rising to 74 percent in 2018 from 68 percent last year.
While currency markets are far further ahead than their fixed income counterparts in terms of proportion of trading that goes through e-channels, traders say there is a fair amount of volumes on currency swaps and options that have yet to migrate electronically.
The survey also found that market structure and regulatory changes were the biggest source of concern for currency traders with about 37 percent of those surveyed citing that as the major issue facing them followed by geopolitical events and global economic uncertainty at 27 percent and 25 percent respectively.
A Bank of International Settlements report in September 2016 showed global currency trading fell to a daily average of $5.1 trillion in April 2016, a 5.5 percent from the $5.4 trillion average three years ago and the first broad contraction of the market since 2001.
Increasingly, a larger chunk of the volumes in currency markets takes place in swaps and other derivatives rather than cash markets.
Trading via algorithms is expected to see a significant jump this year compared to click to trade, which is where investors respond to streaming prices from banks or the RFQ approach where investors request prices from various liquidity providers.
Keeping in line with a general pick up in currency and bond market volatility over the opening weeks of the year, large banks as well as multi-dealer platforms have reported a pick up in trading flow. 
In the first five days of trading under the second version of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), Tradeweb's multi-dealer platform said European credit market volumes surged 70 percent over the daily average in 2017. 
JP Morgan took the top spot among foreign exchange dealers, according to a survey published last year by Greenwich Associates followed by  Citigroup  (N:C), UBS (S:UBSG) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).

(Reuters) - Biotech deal activity exploded on Monday with French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) and U.S.-based Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) spending a combined total of more than $20 billion to add new products for hemophilia and cancer to their medicine cabinets.
The acquisitions will fuel expectations for a busy year of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as large drugmakers snap up promising assets from smaller rivals to help revive growth.
Sanofi agreed to buy U.S. hemophilia expert Bioverativ for $11.6 billion, its biggest deal for seven years, while Celgene is paying about $9 billion for the 90 percent of cancer specialist Juno Therapeutics it does not already own.
The two cash deals were agreed at a prices of $105 and $87 per share respectively. Shares in Bioverativ leaped 63 percent in early U.S. trading and Juno jumped 27 percent, reflecting the offers, while Sanofi fell 4 percent. Celgene was little changed.
Other biotech stocks were driven higher by the takeover news, with rivals to Juno including Bluebird Bio , Sangamo Therapeutics and Cellectis each gaining around 10 percent.
""The signs are good for biotech deal activity in 2018,"" said Chris Stirling, head of KPMG's global life sciences practice.
Big companies are under pressure from declining sales of older treatments and many are struggling to find sufficient high-value replacements from within their own laboratories, making buying in products and know-how an attractive option.
""It takes a long time to introduce technology that makes a significant difference, and in the interim CEOs are looking at any way to get their hands on product where they believe they can make a decent return,"" Stirling said. ""They've got to be seen to be doing things, otherwise they really struggle to convince investors.""
Both Sanofi and Celgene had been seen as likely multibillion-dollar acquirers.
BUSY START
The French group, which faces mounting competition in its key diabetes unit, lost out on buying U.S. cancer firm Medivation to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) in 2016, and also missed acquiring Swiss-based Actelion, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) last year.
Celgene, meanwhile, needs to dilute its reliance on cancer drug Revlimid. It had been widely tipped as a buyer for Juno, whose technology is at the cutting edge of cancer treatment.
Juno is one of several pioneers of a system to modify immune cells to fight tumors and its JCAR017 product is likely to reach the market in 2019, behind rival approval treatments from Novartis and Gilead.
Gilead only recently jumped into the space after acquiring Kite Pharma last year for $12 billion in one of the few standout deals during a relatively subdued year for biotech M&A.
Despite the late start, Celgene believes JCAR017 could have peak annual sales of $3 billion and it sees the acquisition being ""incrementally additive"" to net product sales in 2020. Following setbacks at Juno, Celgene is paying less than the $93 a share it stumped up for just under 10 percent of the company in 2015. 
Sanofi expects Bioverativ, which was spun off from Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) last year, can deliver commercial success despite rapid changes in the $10 billion hemophilia market posed by a novel drug from Roche and the potential of gene therapy to provide a one-time cure.
Those changes have spooked some investors but Sanofi is betting that the factor replacement therapies made by Bioverativ will remain the standard of care for many years and it expects the deal to boost earnings immediately.
Monday's two big acquisitions build on an already busy start for 2018 biotech M&A, with Celgene earlier agreeing to acquire privately-held Impact Biomedicines for as much as $7 billion, including $1.1 billion upfront, and  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) bidding $3.1 billion for Belgium's Ablynx.
Separate reports this month by consultancy EY and law firm Baker McKenzie both predicted a significant rise in life sciences M&A in 2018, helped by U.S. tax changes that may lift big companies' appetite for deals.

Lazard advised Sanofi on its deal, while Guggenheim Securities and J.P. Morgan worked for Bioverativ. J.P. Morgan also worked for Celgene and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) for Juno.

292,By Business Insider,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 10:54AM ET</span>",Forget tax cuts — there's another clear reason stocks look unstoppable," It's easy to look at the timing of the  stock market's blistering move to record highs and assume that  Republicans' tax law is to thank.
Credit Suisse is here to dispel that idea.
Sure, it's a convenient reason, and one that makes some sense — but Jonathan Golub, the firm's chief US equity strategist, says the torrid rally is being driven by good old-fashioned  earnings growth and  economic strength. And he has the charts to back it up.
The first chart shows year-to-date equity returns by region, with emerging markets leading the way. ""If taxes were the driver,"" Golub says, ""the US would be outpacing other regions.""
The next chart provides a breakdown of stock performance by industry, with non-interest-rate sensitive sectors like consumer discretionary, healthcare, and tech leading the way. Golub says that if the stock market's strength were being spurred by taxes, ""sectors benefitting more from tax changes (e.g. energy and discretionary) would be leading sectors with smaller tax burdens (e.g. healthcare and tech).""
With Golub's arguments in mind, it's important to note that one of the true drivers he cites — profit growth — has been the foremost contributor to equity strength during the 8 1/2-year bull market. It's a tried-and-true catalyst for further gains, and if Golub is correct, that's actually good news for the longevity of the streak of new highs.
Further, the stock market's latest batch of records has come as earnings season gets underway, and   Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) argued recently that upward profit revisions were also underpinning equity gains. No matter how you look at it, recent strength comes down to one core driver: corporate fundamentals.
""Fundamentally driven rallies are far more sustainable,"" Golub said."

The supermarket group, the UK's largest private sector employer with a staff of over 310,000, said the role of ""people manager"" and ""compliance manager"" will be removed from large UK stores and fulfillment centers, as will the role of ""customer experience manager"" from 226 stores.
These changes will affect 1,700 Tesco workers who will be offered alternative roles within the business where possible.
Tesco said it would, however, create 900 new roles - ""people partners"", ""learning partners"" and ""colleague relations partners"" - who will work across multiple sites, in distribution, stores and fulfillment.
A new ""colleague administration role"" will also be created to support management teams in each large store and fulfillment center.
Tesco set out a plan in October 2016 to reduce operating costs by 1.5 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) over three years through efficiencies in its distribution network and stores and from procurement savings.
It needs the savings to help achieve its target of a group operating margin of 3.5 percent to 4.0 percent by the 2019-20 financial year, up from 2.3 percent in 2016-17.
""We recognize these are difficult changes to make but they are necessary to ensure our business remains competitive and set up for the future,"" said Matt Davies, Tesco's UK and Ireland CEO.
Last June, Tesco cut 1,200 jobs at its head office and 1,100 jobs in Cardiff, with the closure of a customer service center. In February it cut 1,700 deputy managers at ""Express"" convenience stores and in January last year cut a net 500 jobs from its distribution network.
Shares in Tesco, which disappointed with a Christmas trading update earlier this month, were down 0.3 percent at 207.2 pence at 1511 GMT.

With faster earnings growth and lower price-to-earnings ratios than their more industrialized peers, developing nations are the best bet for equity investors, said Wien, the 84-year-old vice chairman in the private wealth solutions group at Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group.
“When the disparity is great -- as it is now -- I think emerging markets are attractive,” Wien said in an interview from New York, adding that inflows will also support the asset class. “The U.S. is getting expensive. Investors should be looking abroad, and I think they will.”
Jeff Gundlach, chief investment officer at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital LP, made a similar case earlier this month, citing the Shiller P/E Ratio, a measure of valuation based on cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, which shows investors paying a premium for U.S. stocks compared to emerging-market equities.
The former  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist’s emerging-market bullishness is heavily influenced by the global trends highlighted in his 33rd annual “Ten Surprises” list of market predictions, published earlier this year. For example, his forecast that oil prices will surge above $80 a barrel suggests a boost for major producers such as Nigeria, Iran, Iraq and Venezuela, while his expectation that the North American Free Trade Agreement will survive despite Donald Trump’s threats would make Mexican assets more appealing.
“It looks like Trump wants to trash Nafta and I don’t think that’s going to happen,” said Wien, who’s gradually handing off his duties at Blackstone to successor Joe Zidle, according to the Wall Street Journal. “Every day he says something negative, but he’ll be forced to face the reality that tearing it up would be devastating for U.S. jobs, so he will back down.”
Threats that could imperil emerging markets include weaker commodity prices (Wien actually sees them rising), war with North Korea (an unlikely but potentially horrific event) or a temporary 10 to 15 percent drop in U.S. stocks (which he sees as probable).
If U.S. markets briefly decline, emerging markets would probably follow suit, Wien said. But any such move is likely to be just a blip, not the start of a bear market. “The fundamentals of emerging markets are powerful enough to overcome many of these risks,” he said.

Jaguar Land Rover's sales in Britain and Europe were flat in 2017 and it expects tough conditions to continue, the company's sales director said earlier this month.
The Halewood plant, which builds Range Rover models, is one of the Indian-owned automaker's three production sites in Britain, which together build nearly one in three of the country's roughly 1.7 million cars.
""Ongoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit is being felt by customers at home and in Europe,"" the company said on Monday.
""Concern around the future of petrol and diesel engines – and general global economic and political uncertainty – and it's clear to see why the industry is seeing an impact on car sales.""
""Following a review of planned volumes, we are planning to make some temporary adjustments to the production schedule at Halewood in Q2.""
Britain will increase the amount of vehicle excise duty paid by almost everyone buying a new diesel car from April, which will likely hit Jaguar Land Rover, for whom diesel accounts for around 90 percent of sales.
British new car registrations last year across the sector recorded their biggest drop since 2009, with an industry body blaming the diesel levy and weakening consumer confidence in the wake of Britain's vote to leave the European Union.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds which have bet on a fall in the share price of Ocado (LON:OCDO) will have taken a hit after the online retailer unveiled a new international technology deal which sent its stock up by more than a fifth.
Canadian retailer Sobeys [SOBEF.UL] has agreed to use Ocado's e-commerce technology to expand its online business. It follows a similar deal in November between Ocado and French rival Casino that also helped to boost Ocado's shares..
Ocado was a favored as a ""short"" bet amongst hedge funds throughout 2017 partly because of divergent views among investors over whether the company is a food retailer or a technology provider able to command a high valuation.
Short selling occurs when a fund borrows shares and sells them, hoping to buy them back at a later date for a lower price, before returning them and booking a profit.
According to market data provider Astec Analytics, around 10 percent of the company's shares are held by short sellers.
The number of Ocado shares out on loan had fallen by around a quarter from a mid-November high of around 85 million, before the Casino deal was announced, to around 60 million heading into the weekend, data from Astec Analytics showed.
But a number of hedge funds were still heavily invested, with around 60 percent of the shares that had been put up for loan by pension funds and other long-term investors actually out on loan to hedge funds, the data showed.
Regulatory filings up to the close of business on Friday showed 10 funds had short positions in Ocado shares in excess of 0.5 percent of its issued share capital, the level at which British finance industry regulator the Financial Conduct Authority requires disclosure.
Funds also have to make a public announcement for every 0.1 percent increase or decrease above that level.
The biggest position heading into Monday was held by Discovery Capital Management, with 3.1 percent, the FCA said.
Other big holders included GMT Capital Corp, with a 2.3 percent short position; Marshall Wace, with 1.7 percent; and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, with a 1.1 percent position, the FCA data showed.
""The shares have surged from 2.38 pounds in November to close last week at 4.13 pounds, a rise of some 74 percent,"" David Lewis at Astec Analytics said.
""Short sellers, who had made substantial sums on the rollercoaster-like performance of the company's share price, have been hurriedly closing out of their positions as the shares recover.""
With so many shares out on loan, any positive news has the potential to spook funds into trying to buy back the shares, fuelling share price gains in what is known as a ""short squeeze"".
At 1445 GMT, shares in Ocado were up 20 percent.
If every fund with a short position in Ocado tried to exit the trade at the same time, it would take around 24.7 days, based on the average daily traded volume in the shares, the Astec Analytics data showed.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. government shutdowns, which hurt federal workers who go on furlough and taxpayers in need of federal services, have not caused major disruptions to financial markets in the past.
Investors expect nothing different from the shutdown that could begin on Saturday.
""It's more a political event than an economic one,"" said Alessio de Longis, portfolio manager with OppenheimerFunds' global multi-asset group in New York. ""We have been in this situation before.""
On Friday, Washington lawmakers and U.S. President Donald Trump were pushing against a midnight deadline to reach an agreement to keep the government open in the effort to avert a shutdown that last occurred more than four years ago.
Wall Street has brushed off the increasing likelihood of a shutdown. The three major U.S. indexes (SPX) (DJI) (IXIC) rose on Friday, marking their third straight week of gains.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) reached a three-year peak at 2.659 percent, meanwhile.
The dollar held steady against a basket of currencies (DXY) (=USD) but still ended lower for a fifth straight week, the longest such streak since April-May 2015.
Spot gold <XAU=> was up about 0.4 percent at $1,331.84 an ounce, retreating from Monday's four-month highs.
In the aftermath of the last shutdown in October 2013, which lasted for 16 days, the S&P 500 posted a modest 3 percent gain. Gold, the dollar and the 10-year yield barely changed.
Even if a shutdown begins this weekend, most analysts and investors suspect it will be short lived.

306,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",AIG to buy reinsurer Validus for $5.56 billion,"By Sweta Singh and Nikhil Subba
(Reuters) - American International Group (N:AIG) on Monday said it would buy Validus Holdings (N:VR) for $5.56 billion in cash to strengthen its reinsurance business, the company's first deal under Chief Executive Brian Duperreault.
The acquisition snaps a long period of retrenchment for AIG, which was brought to the brink of collapse during the 2008 financial crisis, and comes months after U.S. regulators said it was no longer ""too big to fail"".
The deal will also help AIG re-enter the Lloyd's of London insurance market and add new businesses, including crop insurance, at a time when insurers are facing stiff pricing pressure in their traditional businesses. 
""I particularly like the reinsurance business as additive to what we do. There are a lot pieces to this company that fit us like a glove,"" Duperreault said on a conference call with analysts.
Reinsurers play a little-known but important role in the financial industry by assuming risks that are either too large or too unpredictable for their insurance clients to take on their own.
AIG's $68 per share offer represents a 45.5 percent premium to Validus' Friday close. 
Shares of Bermuda-based Validus were trading close to the offer price in early trade. AIG shares were down 1 percent.
""We would be buyers (of AIG) as we focus on the accretion from this transaction, the strong underlying margins VR brings and the fact that AIG will still have excess capital after this deal is done,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities analyst Elyse Greenspan said in a note but added that the company's shares may initially trade down on the reinsurance exposure.
AIG has been struggling to grow its topline over the past few years. Revenue fell in three of the last four quarters and the company has been plagued by losses related to prior-year accident claims.
Duperreault, who replaced Peter Hancock last year, is seen as a turnaround expert and has promised to streamline AIG's operations and boost profitability. 
As his first major restructuring action since taking over, Duperreault reorganized AIG into three new units. The new structure is expected to reflect in the company's fourth-quarter results on Feb. 8.
The Validus deal is expected to close in mid 2018 and immediately add to AIG's earnings per share and return on equity, AIG said in a statement on Monday.

The hedge fund had bought most of its roughly 2.5 percent stake in Barclays in November, FT reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. http://on.ft.com/2G2ihqK
Tiger Global Management is also extending a vote of confidence in Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley's plans to strip back the bank to concentrate on its U.S.-led investment banking operations and its British-based consumer banking business, the report said. 
Barclays did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. Tiger Global Management said the hedge fund had no comment on the report.
Staley has championed investment banking amid calls from some analysts and investors to ditch a business which has in recent years struggled to match the profitability of Barclays' more mundane retail and credit card units.
Investment banks globally have struggled in recent years to make returns in excess of their cost of capital, as tighter regulations, pressure on fees from automation and low global interest rates combined to squeeze profits.
Barclays is cutting up to 100 senior jobs at its investment banks, Reuters reported on Wednesday.

In 2016, around 1,000 jobs were cut from Barclays' investment banking business worldwide in an attempt to reduce costs and boost revenues. Barclays cut a total of 10,000 employees that year alone.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sanofi (PA:SASY) is placing a big bet on the $10 billion-a-year hemophilia market at a testing time, as scientific advances overhaul traditional approaches to treating the rare uncontrolled bleeding disorder.
The French drugmaker's decision to buy U.S. hemophilia specialist Bioverativ for $11.6 billion exposes it to competition from Roche's new drug Hemlibra and looming threats from gene therapy. It also offers a potential launchpad for Sanofi's own experimental medicine fitusiran.
Patients with the genetic blood disorder have traditionally depended on receiving factor replacement therapies, sometimes as often as every other day.
Today that standard approach to therapy is changing with the development of long-acting treatments - of which Bioverativ's Eloctate and Alprolix are successful examples - and other non-factor approaches.
Roche's recently approved Hemlibra will shake up the market by providing a once-weekly antibody injection for patients with hemophilia A who have developed inhibitors, or resistance, to other treatments.
And several drug companies hope to take things to a whole new level with gene therapy, in which a harmless virus is used to introduce DNA to fix the faulty genes behind the disease, offering a possible one-off cure.
Excitement about the potential of gene therapy has been spurred by recent promising clinical trial data from the likes of Biomarin and Spark Therapeutics, prompting the New England Journal of Medicine to declare in an editorial last month that a cure was ""within reach"". 
The recasting of the hemophilia landscape poses a threat to players reliant on factor replacement therapies, notably market leader Shire, which has been out of favor since buying hemophilia specialist Baxalta two years ago.
Also being challenged by new hemophilia medicines are Bayer (DE:BAYGN), CSL and  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb), the last of which has responded by trying to buy Ablynx to shore up its own blood disease business.
Bioverativ's factor-dependent business is also at risk, although its longer-acting products, which are sold in Europe by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, give it a relative advantage.
Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt argues that factor replacement therapy will remain the standard of care for many years, given its established safety profile and the advances Bioverativ has made with long-acting products.
He is also banking on Bioverativ to leverage commercialization of fitusiran, a new kind of so-called RNA interference treatment for hemophilia A and B that Sanofi is developing with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.
However, despite a solid strategic rationale and a predicted boost to earnings,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said Brandicourt's decision to invest in an ""out-of-favor therapy area"" would detract from investor enthusiasm.

Sanofi shares fell more than 3 percent on Monday after the company announced its acquisition of Bioverativ, while Kepler Chevreux said the parallel with Shire's unpopular acquisition of Baxalta raised ""a host of questions"".

319,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Big banks' cut-price research puts the squeeze on small brokers,"By Tom Pfeiffer and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Big banks have been offering deep discounts on the research they offer fund managers since the start of new European market transparency rules this month, raising doubts over the future of smaller securities firms.
Companies providing such research must now give a transparent breakdown of their charges for their work under the MiFID II rules that went live on Jan. 3 so reports that were previously bundled in with other services can less easily be used as an inducement to sell other products.
The result, brokers and asset managers say, is that fund managers are reducing their budgets for external research by 20-40 percent, with some dropping about a quarter of their brokers and planning to do more of the analysis themselves.
In response, some of the big investment banks have offered massive discounts on bundles of research to maintain relationships that can be profitable in other ways.
Research priced a year ago at hundreds of thousands of pounds is now being offered for 5-10 percent of that, said Neil Robson, a partner at law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman, which advises funds and broker-dealers on regulatory compliance.
""Managers who agreed fees last year will be smarting that they are paying too much. In most cases it will be renegotiated,"" said Robson, pointing to discrepancies in what different brokers are charging for different kinds of research.
JP Morgan (N:JPM) has offered some clients online access to its written stock research for $10,000 a year but will charge considerably more for additional services, such as conversations with analysts, said a source familiar with the offering.
Other banks are asking for up to $50,000 for similar access, according to the head of research at a major European bank.
'SQUEEZED OUT'
""You're likely to end up with a bar-bell distribution of bulge-bracket banks and true specialists, with middle-sized brokers squeezed out because they can't afford to subsidize equity research,"" the head of research said.
Another big European bank views some of the deals on offer as price-dumping and plans to collect email evidence to send to Britain's FCA financial markets regulator, a source at that bank told Reuters.
A person familiar with the FCA's thinking told Reuters that the regulator could deem research priced substantially below cost as a breach of the rules, but it would be likely to depend on the details of each case.
More of a concern would be if banks were charging a below-cost price as an all-in fee, including personal time with analysts, rather than only for written research, the source said.
A JP Morgan spokesman declined to comment. Five of its investment bank rivals contacted by Reuters declined to specify a floor price for written research.
The FCA is expected to let some time pass before taking any action on the fallout from MiFID. However, Russell Napier, co-founder of independent research provider Electronic Research Interchange (ERIC), said that some research firms could go bust before that.
""It's dangerous for the regulator to stand back and let quite a lot of independents go bankrupt because there's a risk you form an oligopoly in the provision of research,"" he said.
CHANGING BUSINESS MODELS
In a sign of the strains on some firms -- such as falling research revenue, rising compliance costs and pressure to cut broking commission -- small stockbroker Arden said last week that it was willing to merge with a rival after turning around its business, saying the broking industry was ""in need of further consolidation"".
Some brokers have shifted to a model of free research, paid for entirely by their corporate clients as part of a broader advisory relationship. They also plan to write less detailed reports about non-corporate clients in the same sector, partly in an attempt to secure advisory work from them.
Whether that is viable will depend partly on how strictly regulators interpret the MiFID rule allowing free research for non-corporate clients provided that it brings only a ""minor non-monetary benefit"" to the issuer.
SP Angel, a UK-based brokerage with six analysts covering three sectors, said it moved to a free research model paid for by corporate clients three months ago.
""The big boys have been trying to undercut everyone else,"" said partner and head of research John Meyer. ""We didn't want fund managers switching us off.""
Meyer said that SP Angel's work risks being dumbed down now that MiFID bars brokers from issuing free research that contains investor recommendations on non-corporates.
Fund managers are also voicing fears of a hit to the quality of research and corporate access to financial markets.
If fund managers drop brokers that handle only a small number of their stocks to cut costs, then the brokers will come under pressure from corporate clients, said Nick Burchett, Cavendish Asset Management's head of UK equities.
Without that access, companies will look elsewhere to find someone who can put them in front of investors, he said.

The British sports car maker is recalling all 3,873 DB11 coupes built since late 2015, when production of the flagship model began, sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Aston Martin spokesman Kevin Watters confirmed the recall when contacted by Reuters and said repairs would be carried out to ""address an issue with the DB11 steering column upper"".
Daimler last year recalled more than 1 million Mercedes-Benz cars fitted with steering-column parts also supplied to Aston and Nissan (T:7201). The Japanese carmaker's Infiniti brand recalled 17,500 affected vehicles.
The issue is unrelated to a global recall of faulty Takata (PK:TKTDQ) airbag inflators that have been blamed for 20 deaths.
Inadequate grounding in the Daimler units leaves their circuitry vulnerable to electrostatic charges that can trigger unintended airbag deployments, according to earlier warnings.

Mercedes reported ""a handful of instances where drivers suffered minor abrasions or bruises"" as a result of the problem. No Aston Martin customers have reported any such incidents to date, the company said, adding the necessary repair work would be carried out free of charge in less than two hours.

323,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Global business group 'lit a flame' for long-term U.N. goals: chair,"By Alister Doyle
OSLO (Reuters) - Many companies are looking past quarterly results to discover long-term economic opportunities in U.N. goals to end poverty and protect the planet, the head of an international business commission has said.
Mark Malloch-Brown's Business and Sustainable Development Commission has contacted 1,500 CEOs over two years to persuade them that embracing development can boost their bottom line, and will wrap up its work at the Davos World Economic Forum on Tuesday.
""We feel we've lit a flame here,"" said Malloch-Brown, a British former U.N. deputy secretary-general who will now spearhead campaigning to keep Britain in the European Union.
His 37-strong group included leaders of firms such as  Unilever  (LON:ULVR), Merck (NYSE:MRK), Mars,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Safaricom and  Aviva  (LON:AV) as well as academics and civil society leaders, urging businesses to adopt U.N. goals for 2030 such as ending poverty and hunger and to slow climate change.
In a report last year, the commission said companies could unlock at least $12 trillion in market opportunities by 2030 and create up to 380 million jobs by focusing on transport, energy, cities, agriculture, food and health.
Malloch-Brown told Reuters the biggest barrier was CEOs' mindsets.
""CEOs are still terribly preoccupied by quarterly results,"" he said. ""The hardest argument is to persuade them to persuade their shareholders to let them think - at least in a portion of their business - in the long term.""
Companies such as Unilever and Mars found it was much better to pay African farmers fair, stable prices for cocoa and focus on quality chocolate rather than risk putting farmers out of business with low prices, he said.
And insurer Aviva is developing benchmarks so that investors ""can judge whether a company is having an impact"" in terms of the sustainable development goals, he said.
Another initiative was to develop more ""blended finance"" for the global development goals involving both public and private sources.
Malloch-Brown said construction firms could tap a vast market for low-cost houses in cities such as Mumbai or Lagos rather than building a ""few mansions in Weybridge"", a prosperous English town.
Commission member Amy Jadesimi, managing director of Nigeria's Lagos Deep Offshore Logistics Base, said the opportunities in emerging economies were huge.
A 330-metre (1080 ft) long Floating Production, Storage and Offshore vessel built for Total will arrive in Nigeria this week from South Korea for completion work before deployment at Nigeria's 200,000 barrel per day Egina field.
""We're sending a signal to the world that you can do the most expensive industrial projects in the world here in Africa,"" Jadesimi said.

326,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 05:36AM ET</span>",Russia's VTB bank head Kostin shrugs off U.S. sanctions risk,"By Katya Golubkova and Dmitry Antonov
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Andrey Kostin, the head of Russian state bank VTB and an ally of President Vladimir Putin, said there was a high risk his name would be added to a new U.S. list of people close to Vladimir Putin, but that he was unfazed by the prospect.
The United States is drawing up a list of Russians with close connections to Putin after U.S. President Donald Trump signed a new sanctions package into law designed to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russia denies the charge. 
While inclusion on the new list would not automatically lead to sanctions, it could make foreign politicians, banks and officials reluctant to have any dealings with named individuals. Such a risk has already prompted some of Russia's wealthiest people to distance themselves from Putin. 
VTB, which is a cornerstone of Russia's financial sector and has helped facilitate many large, politically important deals, is already under Western sanctions imposed over Russia's role in the Ukraine crisis, but Kostin is not under personal sanctions. 
""To be honest, I am not very afraid of this (the risk of personal inclusion on the list). My generation grew up when they didn't let you go anywhere abroad,"" Kostin, 61, told Reuters in an interview authorized for publication on Monday.
Personal sanctions, if applied, could potentially prevent travel abroad or access to foreign bank accounts and freeze foreign assets, but Kostin played down their significance. 
""(Not being able to use foreign) bank accounts? Thank God there is VTB where we can keep our money,"" he said.
Describing the risk of his name being on any new list as being ""quite high"", Kostin added: ""What can I do? Apologize for who I am or am not? I am who I am, and my role is what it is in this country.""
RUSSIAN BUSINESS ""CALM""
Kostin said the existing Western sanctions had proved ineffective, though he added that they had delayed plans for VTB's privatization. He did not want to speculate on the possible impact of any new sanctions.
The Kremlin has said the new sanctions are designed to try to drive a wedge between the ruling elite and Putin, who will seek another six-year mandate in a March 18 presidential election. 
Asked whether he saw signs of nervousness among the elite, most of whom Kostin knows in person, he said: ""Of course not.""
""I have been in business for quite a long time and can compare. Under Putin, support for business, including business abroad, has become a part of our national policy... I don't think that everyone will now start to run away like cockroaches that disappear through the floorboards. The business community is generally calm.""
Kostin is a regular visitor to the World Economic Forum in Davos, which Trump is expected to attend this year.
Asked whether he expected Trump to be impeached because of a scandal about his alleged collusion with Moscow ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Kostin said: ""I am not aware of a single deal where Trump did anything with Russia."" 
""From my sources, I don't feel as if there's a threat of impeachment.""

French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) fell 3.4 percent after the company announced a $11.6 billion takeover of U.S. haemophilia treatment specialist Bioverativ, with some traders saying the deal looked expensive.
Kepler Cheuvreux analysts said the deal raised a ""host of questions"" and wondered whether Bioverativ’s pipeline could offset pressure from a rival Roche treatment.
Italian online luxury retailer Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net-a-Porter's shares surged 25 percent, hitting a record after shareholder Richemont moved to buy out the company.
Still in Italy, Mediaset was up about 5 percent with traders citing an upgrade to ""Buy"" from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
Ocado (LON:OCDO) jumped 13 percent after it signed an agreement with Sobeys to develop the online grocery business at Canada's second-largest food retailer. 
UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank, saw its shares fall 2.5 percent after reporting a quarterly loss, driven by a large writedown on the U.S. tax reforms. UBS still boosted its dividends and announced a new share buyback program. 
UK betting groups were the worst performers on the STOXX 600, with William Hill and  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) down 14 percent and 13 percent respectively, on a report that the government is set to cap maximum stakes on fixed-odds betting machines at 2 pounds ($2.8). 
South African retailer Steinhoff rose over 11 percent after it said it planned to sell about 7.5 billion rand ($620 million) of shares in investment firm PSG Group as it scrambles to plug a liquidity gap. 
British drugmaker Indivior jumped 6.3 percent after a competitor for its Sublocade drug suffered a setback in the United States. 
""It bodes well for Indivior and improves its positioning with the upcoming launch of Sublocade,"" broker Jefferies said in a note. 
The energy sector was the main contributor to the STOXX 600, with Total and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) rising 1 percent and 0.8 percent respectively. 
Telcos were also up slightly, spurred by Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) which gained 1.3 percent after its CFO flagged rising dividends.

329,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 04:27AM ET</span>",Sanofi digs deep to buy U.S. haemophilia group Bioverativ for $11.6 billion,"By Sudip Kar-Gupta
PARIS (Reuters) - French healthcare group Sanofi (PA:SASY) has agreed to buy U.S. haemophilia specialist Bioverativ for $11.6 billion, its biggest deal for seven years, which it said would strengthen its presence in treatments for rare diseases.
Sanofi shares fell 3.4 percent by 0920 GMT, making the stock the worst performer on France's benchmark CAC-40 index and several analysts deemed the deal expensive.
The move comes at a time of renewed interest by large drugmakers in smaller biotech firms and predictions by some experts that 2018 will see a substantial pick-up in mergers and acquisitions. 
Sanofi has agreed to buy all of the outstanding shares of Bioverativ for $105 per share in cash, marking a premium of 64 percent to Bioverativ's closing price on January 19.
Bioverativ, a maker of haemophilia drugs, was separated from Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) Inc early last year.
The agreed transaction marks Sanofi's successful return to deal-making after its failure to land major takeovers in recent years. It is its biggest acquisition since the 2011 takeover of U.S. biotech company Genzyme for around $20 billion.
Sanofi lost out on buying California-based cancer specialist Medivation to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) in 2016, and also missed acquiring Swiss biotech company Actelion, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) last year.
""With Bioverativ, we welcome a leader in the growing haemophilia market,"" Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt said.
The market dealing with treatments for haemophilia is an important one that is evolving rapidly as new drugs change the landscape. Further ahead, gene therapy promises to disrupt traditional approaches to tackling the inherited condition.
Sanofi said the sector had around $10 billion in annual sales, dealing with 181,000 people affected worldwide. It added that haemophilia represented the largest market for rare diseases and was set to grow by more than 7 percent per year through to 2022. 
MORE DEALS?
Sanofi expects the acquisition to be immediately accretive to its business earnings per share in the full 2018 financial year and up to 5 percent accretive for the following year.
However, some analysts questioned the cost.
""Bioverativ looks a relatively expensive acquisition. It is logical in terms of building around Sanofi's presence and pipeline in rare diseases and haemophilia, though management may have to argue against concerns on competition,"" analysts with Jefferies wrote in a note to clients.
""The obvious parallel is Shire's highly unpopular acquisition of Baxalta; but Sanofi's 2011 acquisition of rare disease specialist Genzyme was also unpopular at the time, yet has it turned into a major success story,"" analysts with Kepler said.
Sanofi added it would fund the takeover with a mixture of existing cash resources and a debt issue.
""We have the means to make further takeovers,"" added Brandicourt on a conference call, without going into further details.
Brandicourt has said in the past he was ready to do deals of a similar size to the $20 billion purchase of Genzyme to help accelerate growth at France's biggest drugmaker. One asset analysts and bankers believe could be of interest is Pfizer's consumer health unit, although competition for this business is likely to be fierce. 
Sanofi said it expected to achieve a return on its invested capital (ROIC) in excess of the cost of capital within three years. The French group also expects to preserve its strong credit rating.
This month Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) agreed to pay up to $7 billion to take over Impact Biomedicines and the U.S. company is also said to be circling Juno Therapeutics.
In Europe,  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) has offered $3.1 billion for Ablynx and Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical plans to buy TiGenix for $630 million.
The spate of deal-making follows a relatively subdued 2017 for biotech M&A.

Lazard advised Sanofi on the deal, while Guggenheim Securities and J.P. Morgan advised Bioverativ.

334,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 03:30AM ET</span>",Russian lender VTB says made extra provisions for risky loans,"By Katya Golubkova and Dmitry Antonov
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian lender VTB has set aside 50 billion rubles ($882 million) in additional provisions against losses and agreed with the central bank to monitor a number of riskier loans, VTB's chief executive told Reuters.
Andrey Kostin's comments show that major Russian banks are under tighter scrutiny from the central bank, which is on a heightened state of alert following the rescue of three big private lenders last year. 
His remarks come just days before Washington is scheduled to draw up a list of Russian businesspeople close to the Kremlin, on which Kostin himself said he may figure. Inclusion on the list could make it harder for the bank to finance itself.
In an interview cleared for publication on Monday, Kostin said the central bank had been conducting checks on VTB's financial health for 10 months.
""We set aside around 50 billion rubles at the end of last year, of which around a half was recommended by our risk department and around the same amount was set aside based on the central bank's recommendation,"" Kostin told Reuters.
""The central bank has finished checking us, there were a number of issues where we agreed that for half a year we would study how certain loans perform and would afterwards decide whether any other provisions would be needed,"" he said. 
""I am an advocate of having a well-covered portfolio and feeling relaxed."" Kostin did not specify the type of loans which were covered by the additional provisions. 
He said despite the provisions the bank would earn a net profit of slightly over 100 billion rubles for 2017, in line with forecasts. The bank would be ready to pay 50 percent of its net profit in dividends on last year results, Kostin said. 
TOUGH SUPERVISION
VTB already set aside 118.2 billion rubles in provisions in the first 9 months of 2017, which was 19 percent down on the same period of 2016. The non-performing loan ratio was at 6.4 percent at the end of September, unchanged from the start of 2017.
Kostin said that in some cases the central bank acted ""a little too harshly"" in applying its powers over the banking sector. However, he said VTB had no problems in its dealings with the central bank.
The central bank's tough approach to banking regulation is ""better than the weak-willed and spineless supervision that took place under Elvira Nabiullina's predecessors,"" Kostin said.
Kostin said that VTB, which had a Tier 1 capital level of 13.1 percent at the end of November, planned to support its capital through its profits, and was not planning to raise capital from external sources over the next two years.
On sanctions, Kostin said those already in place constrained VTB's privatization plans and curbed its activities on international markets, but that otherwise they did not affect the operations of the bank.
He declined to speculate about the possibility of the United States imposing tougher sanctions. 
The U.S. government is preparing to draw up a list of Russian oligarchs with close connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin by the end of this month.
Kostin said the risk of him being on the new list was ""quite high"". But he said: ""What can I do? Apologize for who I am or aren't? I am who I am, and my role is what it is in this country,"" Kostin said. ""To be honest, I am not very afraid of this.""
While inclusion on the new list would not automatically lead to sanctions, it could make foreign politicians, banks, and officials reluctant to have any dealings with individuals named on the list.

340,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2018 11:34PM ET</span>","Wal-Mart shops Brazil unit stake to Advent, other funds: sources","By Tatiana Bautzer and carolina mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) is in talks with buyout firm Advent International Corp and other funds to sell a major stake in its Brazilian operations, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Sunday.
Wal-Mart is being advised by Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS), according to one of the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. Other private equity firms that are looking into the investment in the Brazilian unit are GP Investments Ltd and Acon Investments LLC, the source added.
Wal-Mart officials in Brazil declined to comment. Advent and GP declined to comment. Goldman and Acon did not immediately reply to requests for comment. 
Wal-Mart's overseas business is not the growth driver it once was as it has continued to grapple with an economic slowdown in Brazil and competition from discount retailers in the UK. 
In 2016, Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon flagged to investors that he was planning to review its global operations. His comments had sparked speculation that Wal-Mart would look to restructure or even pull out of markets where it has struggled. Brazil was among the countries most often cited by analysts as a potential target.
During the same year, Wal-Mart shuttered at least 10 percent of its stores in Brazil and shed non-core businesses across Latin America. It also sold its e-commerce business in China to Chinese e-commerce company JD.com and picked up a stake in JD.com instead of trying to crack the market on its own.
A partial exit by Wal-Mart from Brazil comes as Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna takes over the international unit of the world's biggest retailer. The move would give a new partner the chance to turn around a sprawling operation that has struggled to turn a profit.
Wal-Mart entered Brazil in 1995 and had grown into the country's third-largest retailer following two major acquisitions in 2004 and 2005 and a period of rapid store expansion that came to a halt in 2013. 
It currently operates 471 stores in Brazil, according to the company's local website. The retailer's Brazilian unit reported revenues of almost 30 billion reais ($9.4 billion) in 2016. 
Wal-Mart has posted operating losses in Brazil for seven years in a row after an aggressive, decade-long expansion left it with poor locations, inefficient operations, labor troubles and uncompetitive prices, Reuters reported early in 2016.(http://reut.rs/2DWNOtp)
One of the people with knowledge of the deal said Wal-Mart's operations in Brazil had not improved over the last two years, which coincided with the country's harshest recession in decades. 
Wal-Mart began sounding out possible investors in the unit several months ago but got no interest from rival retailers, which led the company to seek out buyout firms, the source said.
The retailer intends to keep a stake in the Brazilian unit to be able to recoup part of its losses in the country later if an economic recovery and restructured operations boost results, according to the source.
Retail sales in Brazil are starting to recover from the recession. Christmas sales were 5.6 percent higher than a year ago, according to credit data supplier Serasa Experian. 
Earlier on Sunday, newspaper O Globo said private equity Advent was in talks to acquire 50 percent of the Wal-Mart unit. The paper did not say how it got the information or any details on the state of the talks.

In Japan. the Nikkei 225 fell 0.14%. Automakers were mixed: Toyota declined 0.53% while Mitsubishi Motors tacked on 1.62%. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 edged up 0.04%. Shares of Commonwealth Bank fell 1.44%.
In Greater China, the Shanghai Composite rose 0.22% and the Hang Seng index fell 0.06%.
The US government shutdown on Saturday extends into the new week with all but essential services curbed and many of the regularly schedule data releases possibly delayed if the failure to provide stopgap funding continues.
The Bank of Japan starts a two-day monetary policy meeting with the decision on Tuesday expected to be closely watched for any signs the aggressive easing stance could be dialed back this year. A tweak by the Bank of Japan to its bond buying program earlier this month sparked speculation about a pullback in its monetary stimulus scheme later this year.
Investors will be focused on the outcome of monetary policy meetings by the ECB and fourth quarter growth from both the U.S., if it is released during the shutdown, and the UK. Canadian inflation data will also be in focus after last week's rate hike by the country’s central bank.
The World Economic Forum in Davos and talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement will also be closely watched for developments.
Last week, the S&P 500 rose 0.4% to close at 2,810.30, a record high, with consumer staples as the best-performing sector. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6% to finish at 7,336.38, also a record.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese retail investors are pulling out of a popular bear market fund as a rally in the benchmark Nikkei index to 26-year highs prompts many market participants to ditch their contrarian strategies.
The fund is designed to pay investors two times the opposite of the Nikkei benchmark index's daily return, by making short positions in Nikkei futures. So if the Nikkei falls 1 percent, the inverse ETF rises 2 percent and if the Nikkei rises 2 percent, the inverse ETF falls 4 percent.
The net asset value of Nomura's Next Funds Nikkei 225 Double Inverse Index ETF, dropped almost 24 percent to 150.1 billion yen ($1.37 billion) last week from a record peak of 196.3 billion yen set on Oct. 31.
That drop was a major shift from the pattern until late last year. Whenever the Nikkei had risen, investors had increased buying in the inverse ETF, whose value rises when the Nikkei falls.
The bear fund was very popular with individual Japanese speculators.
That trend appears to have changed on Nov. 9, when foreign investors poured in money to buy Japanese stocks on the back of strong earnings out of Japan Inc. firms, pushing the Nikkei average above 23,000 for the first time since 1992.
""Those retail investors who had bought the double inverse ETF since September made a lot of losses in November, when stocks rose even higher,"" said Tomoichiro Kubota, senior market analyst at Matsui Securities.
Since then, they have become very cautious about taking short positions, Kubota said, noting that margin selling of individual shares, another way to bet on a decline in stock prices, has not increased either.
According to data compiled by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the outstanding margin sell position for the Tokyo and Nagoya bourses in total dropped to 978.1 billion yen as of Jan. 12, compared to about 1.1 trillion yen hit in late October.
But the swing away from contrarian bets has not necessarily translated into an increase in bullish positions on the Nikkei by Japanese investors.
The bull version of Nomura's leveraged ETF, Next Funds Nikkei 225 Leveraged Index ETF, saw its net asset value falling 2.7 percent so far this year despite rise in the Nikkei.
The ETF is designed to give investors twice the return of the daily moves in the Nikkei average and is by far the most traded ETF in the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Matsui Securities' Kubota said investors have found it difficult to find a good chance to buy because the market is supported by the central bank's ETF buying, offering limited opportunities for bargain-hunting.

The IPO is one of various contingency plans being looked at by Toshiba's top executives, the FT said, citing people familiar with the plans. It added that some analysts and Toshiba shareholders favor it over the existing deal.
Toshiba agreed last September to sell Toshiba Memory, the world's second-biggest producer of NAND chips, to a consortium led by Bain to cover billions of dollars in liabilities arising from now bankrupt U.S. nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric Co LLC.
But the Japanese conglomerate no longer faces the pressure it once did to complete a sale, after raising 600 billion yen ($5.4 billion) with a new share issue to overseas funds late last year, which with tax write-offs gives it sufficient funds to cover its liabilities.
If the deal fails to win regulatory approval by March 31, Toshiba is free to walk away, sources familiar with the situation have told Reuters. 
A Toshiba spokeswoman said there had been no change in its efforts to complete the sale of the chip unit. A representative for Bain was not immediately available for comment.
Hong Kong-based activist investor, Argyle Street Management Ltd, a hedge fund with $1.2 billion under management, has voiced opposition to the sale, saying it was no longer necessary and that the board should consider an IPO instead.
Toshiba shares hit a three-month high in morning trade, at one point rising as much as 4.7 percent.

The potential deal, which could be announced as soon as Monday, would value Bioverativ at about $105 a share, the Journal reported. (http://on.wsj.com/2mYJulp)
The price represents a 64 percent premium to Bioverativ stock's close on Friday on the Nasdaq.
Bioverativ, a hemophilia drug maker, was separated from Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) Inc early last year. 
Sanofi has failed to land major deals after losing California-based cancer specialist Medivation to  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) in 2016 and Swiss biotech company Actelion to Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department has sent President Donald Trump the results of its national security probe into aluminum imports, Trump administration officials said on Sunday, while declining to disclose details.
White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters confirmed that the findings in the ""Section 232"" probe were delivered on Friday, just before many government agencies shut down due to the lack of a government funding deal in Congress.
Another administration official said an announcement regarding the submission was expected on Sunday, but that it would look similar to the one that accompanied a Jan. 11 submission on a parallel probe into steel imports.
That announcement did not divulge whether the Commerce Department found that steel imports pose a threat to national security, nor whether it recommended Trump impose broad new tariffs or quotas on imports to protect domestic producers. 
Trump has promised he would take action to protect steel and aluminum workers from imports, especially in the face of Chinese overcapacity in both metals.
But the question of whether to order broad tariffs or quotas on steel and aluminum has been the subject of intense debate in the White House, pitting officials who favor more aggressive restrictions against pro-business factions who favor a more cautious approach to avoid a run-up in prices of the metals or disruptions to U.S. allies that produce them.
""We look forward to swift and decisive action by the President on this issue in order to save the American aluminum industry,"" Century Aluminum (O:CENX) said in a statement on Sunday night. ""American producers need comprehensive relief against excess capacity from all state supported enterprises -- not just China -- to create a fair playing field."" 
Critics say using national security to erect steel and aluminum tariffs could trigger a trade war with China, undermine the global rules-based trading system and hurt America's friends more than China, as well as damage global growth prospects.

Democrats and Republicans, locked in a bitter dispute over immigration, failed to agree on a last-minute deal to fund government operations, causing a shutdown at midnight on Friday. Moderate senators from both parties held talks on Sunday to try to broker a deal.
Wall Street, which had been resilient to the threat of a shutdown, rose on Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq notching record closing highs. Investors shrugged off the threat last week, saying they were not worried about a major pullback in shares if U.S. lawmakers failed to strike a deal.
""These things have no near-term or midterm economic impact whatsoever,"" said Michael Purves, chief global strategist and head of derivatives strategy for Weeden & Co in New York. 
""They are kind of embarrassing for the United States, but it's not really going to alter business or consumer confidence,"" he said.
Purves said investors should continue to favor stocks given the relative resilience of the U.S. and global economy, and avoid buying U.S. bonds as Treasury yields are likely to climb.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge funds managers who bet on stocks scored some of the industry's biggest gains in 2017, when equity markets galloped past a series of critical milestones, according to a new list of the top 20 all-time performers. 
The annual list, released on Sunday, shows Steve Mandel's Lone Pine Capital, John Armitage's Egerton Capital, Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Investors and Chris Hohn's TCI Fund Management as last year's best performers. 
Each of the four stock-focused funds earned between $3.5 billion and $5.0 billion, according to list compiler LCH Investments, the world’s oldest fund of hedge funds.
Two of 2017's strongest funds were newcomers to the list. Egerton ranked 18th, having earned $14.7 billion since its inception in 1995, while TCI came in at No. 20 with $14.2 billion in gains since 2004.
""The greatest investment opportunities in 2017 were in the rising equity markets, and the best managers seized on that,"" said LCH Chairman Rick Sopher.
Two Sigma Investments dropped off after making the list for the first time in 2016, when funds using computer programs to trade posted strong returns. Paul Tudor Jones' Tudor Investment Corp, which recently announced a reorganization and focuses mostly on macro investments, including bets on currencies, bonds and commodities, also fell from the chart.
There was little change at the very top of the list. Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates, the world's biggest hedge fund, retained its No. 1 spot, and George Soros' Soros Fund Management stayed in second place. Both firms bet on stocks, bonds and currencies.
Bridgewater posted only small gains last year, raising the total to $49.7 billion since its 1975 introduction. Soros gained $43.9 billion since it began in 1973, with $2.1 billion generated in 2017.
Ken Griffin's Citadel, which joined the list in 2016, rose to No. 3 from No. 5, having earned $28.6 billion since it began in 1990.
The biggest loss came at Caxton, founded by Bruce Kovner and now run by Andrew Law. The macro-oriented firm lost $1.1 billion in 2017 and dropped to No. 19 from 17.

After years of sluggish returns and high fees put many investors off hedge funds, some came back in 2017, adding a total of $9.8 billion in new money after taking out $70 billion in 2016, data from Hedge Fund Research shows.

350,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2018 04:08PM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: Where Netflix goes, Big Tech may follow","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Netflix Inc's (O:NFLX) quarterly results on Monday may offer an advanced preview of whether  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and other heavyweights behind much of the U.S. stock market's record-breaking rally can keep delivering.
Wall Street on Friday shrugged off a looming U.S. government shutdown and propelled the S&P 500 to a record high as investors focused on upcoming quarterly reports.
Republicans and Democrats appeared to harden their positions on Sunday as both sides hunkered down for what could be a prolonged fight, with the shutdown in its second day. There appeared to be no clear path for a quick end to the crisis.
Many of the largest companies -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and Amazon.com - have outperformed the broader market in the first 13 trading days of 2018, with investors betting strong earnings growth will justify tech valuations at their highest levels in a decade.
Netflix, which is due to report its quarterly results on Monday after the stock market closes, has jumped nearly 15 percent this year, outpacing the S&P 500's 5 percent increase.
Netflix's 53 percent surge in 2017, along with rallies by Amazon.com and Silicon Valley's largest tech companies, helped propel the stock market to new highs.
""Netflix is going to be a great early indicator of risk appetite for these high-volatility growth names,"" said Wedbush trader Joel Kulina. ""Netflix's drivers are very company-specific, but if this stock can deliver, there's no reason this whole market can't keep going higher.""
The Los Gatos, California-based company faces increasing competition from streaming services including Amazon.com's Prime Video and moves by traditional media companies. But investors remain optimistic about its ability to beat expectations. 
Its stock recently traded at 95 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, versus AMC Entertainment (N:AMC) at 44 times earnings and  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX) at 14 times earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
Underscoring investors' willingness to pay premium prices for fast-growing stocks, Phil Blancato, head of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York, recently helped a client buy $1.5 million worth of shares in Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple, Netflix and Google parent company Alphabet as investments for his grandchildren.
""I said, 'You're crazy,' but he was very direct, he wanted the FAANG stocks,"" Blancato said, using a widely used Wall Street acronym for those companies. 
Analysts on average expect S&P 500 technology companies to deliver a 15.9 percent increase in earnings for the December quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Earnings for the entire S&P 500 are seen rising 12.2 percent, bolstered by lower unemployment and fatter wages. 
Technology investors during the reporting season just under way are also eager to hear company executives explain how their bottom lines will be affected by corporate tax cuts passed by Congress in December, and whether they plan to repatriate overseas profits.
Apple said on Wednesday it would make about $38 billion in one-time tax payments on its overseas cash, and investors want to know how much of the $252 billion held abroad Apple will bring home and potentially spend on dividends, share buybacks or acquisitions.
In its third-quarter earnings released on Oct. 16, Netflix reported it had added more global subscribers than analysts expected. In response, its stock hit a record high in after-hours trade before dipping the following day.
In October, Netflix hiked U.S. prices for the first time since 2015, potentially providing more cash to produce original content but also increasing the risk of losing customers.
Netflix has forecast adding 6.3 million subscribers worldwide in the December quarter, which would bring its global customer base to nearly 115.6 million.
Analysts on average expect a 32.5 percent jump in revenue to $3.28 billion, and net income of $186.3 million, up 179 percent. Analysts expect earnings per share of 41 cents.
After the market closed on Friday, the U.S. Senate was racing to avert a government shutdown ahead of a midnight deadline on a stopgap spending measure amid lingering disagreements between Democrats and Republicans. Investors have said they are not worried about a major pullback in shares, even if lawmakers fail to strike a deal. 
Up 42 percent in the past 12 months, the S&P 500 information technology index is trading more than 19 times expected earnings, its highest since 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Facebook will post quarterly results on Jan. 31, followed by Amazon.com, Apple and Alphabet on Feb 1. Nvidia (O:NVDA), which surged 81 percent in 2017 and replaced Qualcomm (O:QCOM) as the most valuable U.S. chipmaker after  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), reports on Feb 7.

In addition to the request for proposals (RFP) on the loan refinancing, the government has issued RFPs covering further U.S. dollar debt capital market issuance and financing supported by other countries' export credit agencies, the office said.
The refinancing of the loan, which was raised in 2016, will include a repricing of the facility and the extension of its maturity to 2023 from 2021. An Islamic finance tranche using a murabaha structure will be added to the loan.
The plans are a step toward Saudi Arabia's ambition of establishing a prominent position in international debt markets as part of its economic reforms, said Fahad al-Saif, president of the debt management office.
""We look forward to a satisfactory conclusion of the process over the coming months,” he said.
The Saudi government started issuing debt in the international markets through loans and bonds two years ago in order to refill state coffers hit by a slump in oil prices.

Its $10 billion syndicated loan in early 2016 was followed later that year by a $17.5 billion debut bond issue, the largest bond ever sold by an emerging market issuer.

Audi, a unit of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), said in a statement that the models had been included in a voluntary recall of 850,000 diesel vehicles with V6 and V8 TDI engines announced in July.
""The engine control software for the vehicles in question will be completely revised, tested and submitted to the KBA for approval"", Audi said in its statement.
It did not confirm more details of KBA's request.
Bild am Sonntag said road transport authority KBA had told Audi to respond by Feb. 2 on how it plans to update vehicle software controlling emissions, making sure the cars are unable to illegally manipulate emission controls.
Audi said it has been examining its diesel-fuelled cars for potential irregularities for months in close cooperation with the KBA. 
""As part of this systematic and detailed assessment, the KBA has now also issued a notice regarding Audi models with V6 TDI engines,"" the carmaker added.
In November, Audi announced a recall of 5,000 cars in Europe for a software fix after discovering they emitted too much nitrogen oxide, the polluting gas that parent Volkswagen concealed from U.S. regulators in its devastating 2015 ""dieselgate"" scandal.
Volkswagen was found in 2015 to have illegally manipulated engine software so that vehicles would meet nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions standards in laboratory testing but not in real-world conditions, where they could emit up to 40 times the permitted levels.

Several Audi models were affected and Audi has been accused in media reports of having devised the so-called defeat devices years earlier but not to have installed them in its vehicles at that time. Audi and Volkswagen have never commented on the matter.

358,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2018 12:35PM ET</span>",ADM pursues big ag merger with grain trader Bunge: source,"By Tom Polansek and Rod Nickel
CHICAGO/CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Top U.S. grain merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM) has proposed a takeover of  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG), according to a person familiar with the approach, which could set up a bidding war with Swiss-based rival  Glencore  Plc (L:GLEN).
Large grain traders that make money by buying, selling, storing and shipping crops have struggled in recent years with global oversupplies. Thin margins have squeezed core commodity trading operations, including those of ADM, Bunge, Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) and Louis Dreyfus Co [AKIRAU.UL], which together are known as the ""ABCDs"" and dominate the industry.
Consolidation is seen as one remedy. Glencore last year sought a tie-up with Bunge in what was viewed as a start of a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the industry.
Bunge, which rebuffed an acquisition offer from Glencore last year, might not follow up on ADM's proposal, the source said, requesting anonymity because the approach is confidential. A standstill agreement prevents Glencore from making a new offer until next month, and Bunge is keeping its options open for now, the source added.
White Plains, New York-based Bunge operates in more than 40 countries and is Brazil's largest exporter of agricultural products, while Chicago-based ADM says it has customers in 160 countries.
Bunge, which has a market capitalization of $9.79 billion, closed up 11.4 percent at $77.56 on Friday. ADM has a market cap of $22.64 billion.
ADM said it does not comment on ""rumors or speculation,"" while Bunge did not respond to requests for comment. Glencore was not immediately available for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported on ADM's interest in Bunge.
STRATEGY SHIFT?
Grain companies in recent years have expanded into higher-margin sectors, such as food ingredients and aquaculture, to offset weak results and wild swings in their traditional business of handling crops.
In 2014, ADM bought natural ingredient company Wild Flavors for about $3 billion in its biggest deal ever. The company has also expanded into handling healthy ingredients such as fruits, nuts and ""ancient grains.""
""News of the ADM bid is a bit surprising given that ADM had been indicating the company's strategic direction was more towards value-added rather the traditional commodities,"" said Stephens Inc analyst Farha Aslam. 
ADM is the most U.S.-focused of the major grain companies and a takeover would help it grow in South America, where Bunge is a major agricultural force.
ADM, which dates back to 1902, has tried to expand its international operations, in part to take advantage of growing demand from China. In 2013, Australia rejected its attempted $2.55 billion takeover of Sydney-based grain handler GrainCorp Ltd (AX:GNC) on concerns it could reduce competition.
Bunge was founded in Amsterdam 200 years ago. It moved its headquarters to South America as its operations grew in the region and relocated to New York ahead of an initial public offering in 2001.
HURDLES LOOM
Aslam estimated that fair value for Bunge in a takeover would be $90 to $95 per share, but Morningstar said the price could exceed $100. 
Any tie-up would probably face stiff scrutiny from regulators and opposition from farmers who fear handing more market control to ADM could hurt wheat, corn and soybean prices.
The biggest overlap between ADM and Bunge in the United States is in grain origination and oilseeds processing, Aslam said. The companies would probably need to divest facilities in North America and also possibly in Europe, she added.
Aslam raised the possibility that ADM and Glencore could partner in a bid for Bunge to split up its operations.
""ADM would take the more value-added downstream businesses, and Glencore would own the more ag commodity businesses,"" she said.
FARMERS' WORRIES
An ADM-Bunge merger would also face opposition from farmer groups in key agricultural markets, including the United States, European Union, China, India and Brazil, said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.
The companies' relatively late move into the big-agriculture merger game, behind DowDuPont (N:DWDP), Nutrien Ltd (TO:NTR) and others, would make gaining regulators' approval even tougher, Gordon said.
""When you're the first one, there's still more competition,"" he said. ""Once they've let a few through, they may have second thoughts."" 
Grain farmers need five or six active buyers to get fair prices for their goods, but there are already only a handful, said Peter Carstensen, who teaches law at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. 
""This is the kind of transaction that will screw farmers,"" he said. 
Illinois farmer Dan Henebry, who delivers corn and soybeans to ADM's North American headquarters in Decatur, Illinois, said he was worried a takeover of Bunge could lead grain handlers to pay farmers less for their crops.

""We've had so many mergers,"" Henebry said. ""Less competition is not good.""

""I am very confident that we will be able to stick to our promises, in particular with respect to the planned increase of our free cash flow by about 10 percent and the according dividend policy"", he was quoted as saying on Saturday.
""I see no reason to deviate from (our planning) in 2018"", he said, adding that investors should expect continuous growth of capital expenditure, sales, earnings and dividends.
Deutsche Telekom has said in the past that it expects a 12 percent increase in 2017 free cash flow - the money available for dividend payments - with a corresponding dividend hike.
While Germany's largest telecoms provider is benefiting from a strong U.S. business and a rebound of its European operations it will also get a boost from U.S. tax cuts.
""Our earnings after minorities will rise by a relevant three-digit million euro amount annually"", Dannenfeldt said.
The company scrapped plans to merge T-Mobile U.S. (O:TMUS) with Sprint (N:S) in November, but Deutsche Telekom was ""not dogmatic about the subject"", he added.
""If someone were to come now and offered, say, $120 a share, all cash, then we would have to think about it,"" he said. 
T-Mobile's shares closed at $63.71 on Friday, compared to an all-time high of $68.40 reached in May. 
With respect to its operations in the Netherlands, where Deutsche Telekom acquired a business from Sweden's  Tele2  (ST:TEL2b) in December, a stock market flotation of the combined business is possible, Dannenfeldt told the paper.
""But first, we need a nod for our deal from Brussels (...) Then we need to integrate the business, and that will take 1-1.5 years.""
Separately, on its struggling T-Systems business, Dannenfeldt said a partial sale of the German IT services and consulting unit could not be ruled out.

Last week, Deutsche Telekom announced plans to split T-Sytems into two separate units in a bid to halt a slide in earnings.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group said on Saturday its revenue dropped for a second consecutive year, by 10.8 percent in 2017, as the group sold off property assets and faced increasing scrutiny from regulators and lenders. 
The property-to-entertainment group, owned by tycoon Wang Jianlin, reported 227.4 billion yuan ($35.54 billion) in revenue, while net profit remained flat compared with 2016, according to a statement posted on the company's website. It did not reveal the profit figure. 
Total assets, of which 93 percent are domestic, declined 11.5 percent to 700 billion yuan. 
The group came under pressure last year from a government crackdown on perceived risky spending overseas and high levels of corporate debt. Banks heightened their scrutiny and ratings agencies downgraded its property unit to junk status.
The Chinese conglomerate is expected to announce the sale of two Australian property projects in the coming days, sources have told Reuters, the latest in a string of asset sales as the firm looks to reduce its portfolio after a major acquisition spree.
Wanda said earlier this week it had agreed to sell its interests in the London luxury development project, One Nine Elms, for $81 million.
Wanda's commercial real estate arm, which sold a portfolio of hotels and 13 tourism assets in China for $9 billion in July, saw income fall 21 percent last year to 112.5 billion yuan.
Revenue at its sports division increased by 12.3 percent to 7.2 billion yuan, while that of the cultural division rose 32.6 percent to 63.8 billion yuan.
Wanda is considering a listing for its sports assets as part of efforts to rationalize its portfolio, according to people familiar with the situation.

362,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2018 02:15AM ET</span>",McDonald's 'joint employment' trial delayed amid settlement talks,"By Daniel Wiessner and Robert Iafolla
(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp and a U.S. labor board are in talks to settle a case claiming the fast food company is liable for purported labor law violations by its franchisees, leading a judge on Friday to pause a trial that began in 2015.
Administrative Law Judge Lauren Esposito in Manhattan said that even though the trial is expected to wrap up as soon as next week, McDonald's, its franchisees, and the National Labor Relations Board's general counsel should have a chance to pursue a settlement.
The office of General Counsel Peter Robb, appointed by President Donald Trump and took office in November, requested the stay on Wednesday. The general counsel said a board decision released last month in a separate case that narrowed the definition of ""joint employment"" may have wiped out some of the claims against McDonald's. 
The McDonald's case had been seen as a test of when franchisors may be considered joint employers and required to bargain with unions or be held accountable for franchisees' labor practices. Business groups have said that treating franchisors as employers could upend the franchise model. 
McDonald's spokeswoman Terri Hickey on Friday said ""McDonald's USA is simply not a joint employer with its franchisees, and we are hopeful that this development will lead to a long overdue and successful resolution of the pending cases.
The NLRB declined to comment. 
Robert Brody, a lawyer for McDonald's franchisees in New York, said the decision made sense after the recent NLRB ruling revising the definition of joint employment.
The Service Employees International Union had urged Esposito not to pause the trial. SEIU said settlement talks could proceed after the trial ended.
Adriana Alvarez, a McDonald's employee in Chicago and an organizer with SEIU affiliate Fight for $15, said in a statement that McDonald's had illegally harassed and fired workers who pushed for higher wages. She said pausing the trial amounted to ""a get-out-of-jail-free card"" for the company.
The union and some McDonald's workers filed a series of complaints with the NLRB beginning in 2012. In 2014, the general counsel issued a complaint that said McDonald's controlled working conditions at franchises, including through corporate policies and scheduling software.

McDonald's also helped franchise owners respond to nationwide protests calling for fast food companies to pay higher wages, the general counsel said.

363,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 08:37PM ET</span>","Judge overseeing AT&T, Time Warner merger trial hears document dispute","By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T (NYSE:T), owner of DirecTV, is asking for documents from a long list of companies as part of preparation for a trial to determine if they will be allowed to buy movie and TV show maker Time Warner, their lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said in a pre-trial hearing on Friday.
The Justice Department sued in November to stop AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. wireless company, from buying Time Warner for $85 billion because of concerns that it could raise prices for rivals and pay-TV subscribers as well as hamper the development of online video. Trial is set for March 19.
Daniel Petrocelli, who represents AT&T and Time Warner, said that his team had been unable to get data requested from third parties, who had said they no longer had some of it. He asked the government, which did have the data, to return it so it could be subpoenaed.
An attorney for  DISH Network  Corp (NASDAQ:DISH) at the hearing identified himself to Judge Richard Leon and offered to discuss the dispute but Leon declined.
The third parties included  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Cox, DISH, Charter, Disney and Viacom, among others, a source close to the trial said after the hearing. 
Leon expressed surprise at the problem.
""So, the only copy they had, they turned over to the government?"" he said, calling the situation ""rather extraordinary.""
Leon said that if no solution was found by noon on Monday, he would order the government to return the data to the companies so that they could then either comply with the subpoenas or fight them in court.
""I think that's a sensible approach,"" Petrocelli told the judge.
Fights over data are common during antitrust trials since companies that are subpoenaed frequently fear that their rivals' executives will gain access to sensitive internal data.
For its part, a lawyer for the Justice Department, Peter Schwingler, said the government was barred from giving the data to AT&T under the terms of the subpoena that they used to collect it.
Leon had given access to confidential information to the court, Justice Department lawyers and staff, service providers and AT&T and Time Warner's outside counsel.
A second government lawyer, Craig Conrath, said that he would request a stay if the U.S. Congress failed to fund the government and it shut down. 
Leon said the trial would likely continue. ""My natural inclination will be not to grant a stay,"" he said.

The fate of the deal has been widely followed because U.S. President Donald Trump criticized it on the campaign trail in 2016 and has repeatedly attacked the reporting of Time Warner's CNN news network. In November, Trump reiterated his opposition to the deal.

Abel, who along with Ajit Jain was named a Berkshire vice chairman and director last week, disclosed his stake a day after Jain reported a $109 million ownership stake.
The stakes were disclosed in regulatory filings.
Abel, 55, who has run the Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit, was appointed vice chairman to oversee non-insurance operations such as the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear and NetJets planes.
Jain, 66, Berkshire's top reinsurance executive and the other strong contender to succeed Buffett, was appointed vice chairman to oversee insurance operations such as Geico auto insurance and General Re reinsurance.
Abel reported holding his Berkshire stake indirectly for the benefit of his family. Berkshire Hathaway Energy said about a year ago that Abel owned a stake in that unit that could be converted into Berkshire stock worth more than $400 million at the time. 
Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire said last week that relevant factors in its succession planning were that both possess ""integrity, business savvy, an owner-oriented attitude and a deep genuine interest in Berkshire.""

Buffett, 87, has run Berkshire since 1965 and has not signaled any plans to leave soon. He owns roughly one-sixth of the company, comprising most of what Forbes magazine said on Friday is his $91.6 billion fortune.

365,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 06:52PM ET</span>",Parent company of 7-Eleven agrees to divest some U.S. stores in Sunoco deal,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Seven & i Holdings Co Ltd (T:3382), the Tokyo-based parent company of the 7-Eleven network of stores, agreed to sell and divest some of its stores in its proposed $3.3 billion acquisition of 1,100 Sunoco LP (N:SUN) outlets, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said Friday.
Under the terms of the consent agreement, 7-Eleven will sell 26 retail fuel outlets that it owns to Sunoco, and Sunoco will retain 33 fuel outlets that 7-Eleven otherwise would have acquired. The FTC said without the sales the acquisition would harm competition in 76 local markets across 20 metropolitan areas and potentially result in higher prices. The deal was announced in April 2017.
The FTC said without the conditions, 7-Eleven would have a monopoly in some markets. The deal will preserve competition as Sunoco will convert the stations retained and acquired from 7-Eleven from company-owned sites to stations run by independent operators.
The remedy will ""preserve competition as it is today, ensure that the divestiture assets go to a viable, large-scale competitor, and reduce the risks and costs associated with asset integration,"" the FTC said.
The U.S. network of 7-Elevens consists of approximately 8,500 stores located in 35 states and more than 1,000 locations are company-operated.
The FTC said without the required divestitures a number of places would have uncompetitive markets include areas around Boston; Buffalo, New York; Fort Myers, Florida, Miami, Florida; Richmond, Virginia and the metropolitan Washington, DC area.
Under the agreement, 7-Eleven must provide notice for 10 years of plans to acquire additional outlets in the 76 local areas.

Sunoco announced the deal to sell the 1,000 convenience stores to 7-Eleven’s U.S. unit to focus on its fuel supply business. Sunoco said in November on an earnings call it hoped to close the transaction before the end of the year but said it could slip into the first quarter depending on regulatory reviews.

The proposed sale would include 34 conventional takeoff F-35s as well as 38 Pratt & Whitney F-135 engines and other equipment for the radar-evading high-tech fighter, the Pentagon said.
""This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of an ally and partner nation which has been, and continues to be, an important force for political and economic stability in Western Europe,"" the State Department said in a statement.
The governments of Finland, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and others have also been eyeing a purchase of the stealthy jet as potential new customers.
Belgium is still in the midst of an ongoing competition for a new jet fighter. The announcement clears the potential purchase of the jets by the Belgian government. If Belgium elects to buy the F-35, it would become the fourth foreign military sales customer for the F-35 following South Korea in 2014.
The F-35 is a vital product for Lockheed, accounting for about a quarter of its total revenue. During the third quarter, sales at Lockheed's aeronautics business increased 14 percent to $4.7 billion, pulled higher by F-35 sales.

Earnings Season Kicked into Full Gear 
US stocks shrugged off a possible US government shutdown to close at record highs as ongoing optimism over earnings spurred investor appetite for risker assets.
Financials got the week off to a good start amid quarterly earnings report from US Bancorp (NYSE:USB),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) that beat Wall Street estimates, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) bucked the trend, reporting its first quarterly loss since 2011.
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) quarterly report Thursday also garnered attention after the tech company reported quarterly revenue growth for the first time in twenty-three quarters as its move into cloud, artificial intelligence and block chain technology offset declines from its traditional software business.
The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Friday.
WTI Crude Oil Snapped 4-Week Winning Streak 
The weekly streak of gains in crude oil prices came to an abrupt end this week as investors weighed the impact of rising US production on OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies amid comments from the IEA.
The International Energy Agency (IEA), in its monthly report, warned that rising non-OPEC production would offset a raft of positive factors supporting oil prices including ongoing OPEC-led output cuts.
Crude oil futures settled at $61.44, down 58 cents.
Pound, Sterling Downed the Dollar
It was another miserable week for the dollar as it struggled to find its footing amid a surge in both the pound and sterling.
EUR/USD notched its fifth-straight weekly win, rising above four-year highs despite European Central Bank (ECB) officials’ attempts to quash investor expectations that the central bank would announce plans to unwind its massive stimulus programme at next week’s meeting.
GBP/USD rose to its highest since the June 2016 Brexit vote amid growing expectations that the Bank of England would soon have to raise rates to prevent the economy from overheating.
Gold Fought Off Pressure From Soaring US Government Bond Yields 
Gold prices held above four-month highs this week despite coming under pressure from a surge in government bond yields to multi-year highs.
Yields on United States 10-Year this week rose to their highest since 2014 amid strong China economic growth data and rising expectations for faster inflation growth.
Macquarie said that risks of a reversal in gold prices are rising, as it is “harder for gold to ignore the impressive snapback in real yields” since the turn of the year.
Crypto-Market Crashed. Attempted Recovery. But Remains Under Pressure. 
A sea of red swept over crypto-markets this week after a crypto-crash Tuesday through Wednesday unfolded in markets, wiping billions of dollars from the market as investors fled positions amid fears that China and Korea were planning a ban on cryptocurrency-related activity.
The total cryptocurrency market cap slumped to a low of about $478 billion at the depths of the crash on Wednesday before rebounding to about $562 billion Friday. That is markedly lower than the $829 billion total market cap peak set less than two weeks ago on Jan. 7.
As the sell-off deepened, Ripple XRP fell to a low of $0.87 on the poloniex exchange, Ethereum fell to a low of $770, Bitcoin fell to a low $9,231. The ‘big 3’ cryptocurrencies by market cap, however, have since recovered some of their losses but remain under pressure."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  (N:GE) shares tumbled for a fifth straight session on Friday, sending the stock to its biggest weekly percentage drop since the financial crisis, after the company flagged a possible breakup and more than $11 billion in charges earlier in the week.
Shares in the U.S. industrial conglomerate fell 3 percent to $16.26 on Friday. That resulted in a 13.3 percent drop for the week, the largest such weekly decline since March 2009.
The stock fell as low as $16.02 on Friday, threatening to fall below $16 only a day after the stock breached $17 for the first time since December 2011.
The latest bout of selling for the struggling stock stemmed from GE's announcement on Tuesday of more than $11 billion in tax, impairment and insurance charges. New GE Chief Executive John Flannery also indicated the company was looking closely at breaking itself up.
""The company has a more complicated issue than just making some changes to its business portfolio,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. ""These issues are going to probably take a long time to resolve.""
Potentially adding to the pressure on the shares,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst John Inch said on Friday that GE may ultimately be forced to raise equity capital, given the company's ""cash squeeze"" and apparent debt pressures.
Inch, who rates the stock ""sell"" with a $15 price target, said in a research note the prospects have increased that GE cuts its dividend further. GE in November cut its dividend in half as it also slashed its 2018 profit forecast.
A GE spokeswoman said the company has no plans to raise equity. GE earlier this week said its industrial cash flow will come in above its prior full-year estimate.
GE's shares have been sliding for more than a year, falling nearly 45 percent in 2017 and frustrating shareholders at a time when the broader stock market has been rising to record levels. 
The stock rebounded as much as 11 percent to start 2018, but is now down 6.8 percent for the year. This year, GE is the worst-performing component of the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), which has climbed 5.5 percent.

GE is due to report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday.

(Reuters) - Delaware on Friday became the latest state to file a lawsuit accusing corporations of helping fuel the national opioid epidemic, suing a wide range of companies involved in making, distributing and selling prescription painkillers.
The lawsuit, filed by Delaware Attorney General Matt Denn in a state court, targeted drugmakers Purdue Pharma LP and Endo International Plc (O:ENDP) along with several wholesale drug distributors and the retailers CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (O:WBA).
The lawsuit accused Purdue and Endo of engaging in a massive marketing campaign aimed at concealing the risks of using opioids to treat chronic pain in order to overcome a medical consensus that using the drugs for that purpose was unsafe.
Distributors including McKesson Corp (N:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC) along with the two retailers ignored red flags indicating that opioids were being diverted for illicit uses, according to the lawsuit.
""The failure of these corporate defendants to meet their legal obligations has had a devastating impact on Delawareans,"" Denn said in a statement.
Purdue, which produces OxyContin, and Endo, which last year withdrew Opana ER from the market, in separate statements said they denied the allegations but are concerned about opioid abuse.
AmerisourceBergen said it was dedicated to doing its part to mitigate the diversion of drugs. Cardinal Health said it would defend itself in court.
Other defendants in the lawsuit included Anda, a distributor owned by Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA). Representatives for Anda and the other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Opioids were involved in over 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
A wave of lawsuits by states, counties and cities have accused drugmakers of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing and wholesale distributors of failing to report suspicious drug orders. 
A group of state attorneys general have been conducting a multistate investigation into whether companies that manufacture and distribute prescription opioids engaged in unlawful practices. 
Increasingly, some attorneys general have decided to file lawsuits outside of the probe alone against the companies under scrutiny. At least 14 other states are pursuing opioid-related lawsuits against one or more the companies Delaware sued.

A federal judge in Ohio overseeing more than 200 lawsuits by cities, counties and others over the opioid epidemic recently reached out to some state attorneys general about meeting as he pushes for a quick settlement of the litigation.

382,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>",Weaker dollar adds to optimism over U.S. earnings,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar's drop to three-year lows this week after prolonged weakness in 2017 is expected to further boost profits at big U.S. companies when investor optimism is already high over corporate tax cuts.
Investors are keeping an eye out for signs of the dollar's impact on company earnings as fourth quarter reporting ramps up next week. (GRAPHIC-World FX rates in 2018: http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh)
U.S. multinationals, especially energy and technology companies that have a significant portion of their sales overseas, could benefit the most from the currency effect, while other sectors like telecommunications benefit less. 
(GRAPHIC-Overseas sales by sector: http://reut.rs/2DhadR2)
The greenback was headed for its fifth week of losses on Friday. The U.S. dollar index's (=USD) average in the fourth quarter fell about 6 percent from its average in the year-ago quarter. 
Its nearly 10 percent fall in 2017 was its worst annual performance since 2003. 
The dollar has fallen on expectations central banks besides the Federal Reserve are seeking to end their policy of ultra-low, even negative, rates adopted to combat the 2008 global financial crisis. Analysts said that if U.S. inflation remains below the Fed's target, while overseas central banks raise rates and reduce bond purchases, the dollar could fall further.
Though it is still early days in the fourth-quarter earnings season, there are examples of how the weak dollar is affecting companies' bottom lines.
International Business Machines (N:IBM) late Thursday cited a currency boost in its results. IBM's sales rise of 3.5 percent last quarter would have been only 1 percent if currency impact were excluded. The effects may not be as headline grabbing as those from the changes to the U.S. tax law that were enacted last month by U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump. 
Changes to the law, which are prompting many companies to take one-time charges in fourth-quarter reports, include a cut in the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. The expected boon to earnings has helped stocks rally so far this year, while the weak dollar has added to the enthusiasm.
""You look at the big-cap stocks and with that weakening dollar, that just makes everything so much better for them as far as overseas,"" said Peter Costa, president at Empire Executions Inc in New York.
A weaker dollar likely added about 50 basis points to fourth-quarter earnings growth,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) strategists wrote in a note. Analysts are forecasting earnings for all S&P 500 companies of 12.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
(GRAPHIC-Dollar Stuck on Worst Losing Streak since 2015 - http://reut.rs/2DP4e71)
The dollar's weakness had also helped third-quarter results. Among companies that have cited currency benefits in reports since the start of December are John Wiley & Sons (N:JWa),  Progress Software  (O:PRGS) and Actuant (N:ATU).
""If you couple global demand with a weaker U.S. dollar, it's a positive underpinning for the industrials in particular,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. 
U.S.-based multinationals can benefit the most from declines in the dollar, which makes overseas sales more valuable when translated back into U.S. currency. Global economic demand continues to pick up and was one of the biggest boosts to earnings in 2017, strategists said.

S&P 500 companies with 50 percent or more of sales coming from outside the United States have estimated profit growth of 15.2 percent for the fourth quarter, compared with 12.3 percent for companies with less than 50 percent of non-U.S. sales, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Nike's shares jumped nearly 5 percent, set for their best day since June 30, 2017, when the company said it would sell more products directly through retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and its own stores, rather than through wholesalers.
Bernstein Research and Wedbush Securities said this direct-to-consumer (DTC) model would boost Nike's margins once the plans were fully implemented and the business accounted for a larger chunk of total sales from the current 28 percent.
In fact, Wedbush estimated Nike's overall gross margins would expand for the first time in 10 quarters in the March-May quarter. It upgraded Nike's stock to ""outperform.""
Analyst Christopher Svezia said the company's results next fiscal would also get a boost from the launch of new shoe styles and easier comparison with last year, when it took a bit of a beating from weak demand in North America.
Bernstein estimated said Nike's realized retail price was double its wholesale price, suggesting the gross profit contribution of each product it sold directly was more than three times higher than if sold through a wholesaler.
""As Nike moves from a wholesale business to a more direct business, we believe there is clear margin upside from this shift,"" analyst Jamie Merriman wrote in a note.
Merriman estimated gross margins in Nike's DTC business are 62 percent, compared with 38 percent in its wholesale business.
Nike's overall gross margins could grow by as much as 3.3 percentage points by 2022, Merriman estimated, if the DTC business increased to about 42 percent of total revenue.
That growth would be even more if margins in its e-commerce business scale to those in its store business, Merriman said, who rates Nike's stock ""outperform.""

The company's shares were up 4.5 percent at $66.98, easily the top gainer on the bluechip Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI). The stock rose to as much as $67.14, its highest since December 2015.

(IFR) - This is shaping up as a banner year for equity capital markets in Argentina, where five companies going public in the first quarter are looking to raise a combined US$2.2bn.
That is a lot of supply for a small market - the combined market cap of the benchmark Merval Index is only US$137bn, even after a gain of more than 13% in the first two weeks of 2018.
But foreign capital has been piling in on hopes that the country will be included in the MSCI Emerging Market Index.
After Argentina failed to shed frontier status last June, hopes are that the US index provider will classify it as an emerging market nation this year.
The administration of President Mauricio Macri is ticking all the right boxes as it pushes through capital market reforms. 
Not only did last year's midterm elections suggest long-term support for market-friendly policies, but the elimination of capital gains taxes this year will further spur foreign investment. 
Corporacion America Airports, the global airport concessionaire, is seizing on the momentum with a roughly US$650m IPO to fuel expansion.
Its decision to focus on a NYSE listing through more liquid ADRs heightens the chances of MSCI inclusion if an upgrade does occur.
""If the airport is interested in being included in the upgraded MSCI index, it is essential for them to list in the ADR market,"" said Simon Mandel, senior vice president of CEEMEA and LatAm equities at Auerbach Grayson.
""But I believe liquidity will return to the local market - and there is a strong argument that a dual listing should be made for the airport."" 
Oppenheimer, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) launched bookbuilding on Tuesday, marketing 28.6m shares at US$19–$23.
They will conduct a roadshow across Latin America, North America and Europe, with pricing planned for January 31.
HIGH FLYER
Corporacion America, which operates 51 airports but only four outside Latin America, is not selling itself cheaply.
Its marketing range targets a valuation of roughly 9.5 to 12 times EV/Ebitda for 2018, according to the estimates of the underwriting banks.
That compares with 13.7 and 13.1 times respectively for Mexican airport operators Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico and Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste, and 13.2 for Spanish peer Aena.
""Obviously we would like it to come at the low end for a bigger cushion,"" one hedge fund manager told IFR. ""But in reality it is a seller's market in Argentina - not a buyer's market like it is perhaps in Brazil.""
With low-cost airlines and other foreign carriers winning new routes in Argentina following Macri's market reforms, growth potential may justify some stretched valuations. 
""There is a lot of underutilized capacity,"" said the hedge fund manager. ""More airlines are coming into the market, and the use of proceeds is to expand and modernize smaller airports from which low-cost airlines fly.""
Corporacion America is selling 11.9m shares, while an investment vehicle controlled by Eduardo Eurnekian, the company's 85-year-old founder, is selling the remaining 16.67m.
Eurnekian is moving away from direct operations after appointing his 39-year-old nephew Martin Eurnekian as chairman last year.
""This is going to be the first deal of a very robust pipeline in the first quarter,"" said the hedge fund manager.
Power producer Central Puerto launched an up to US$760m, all-secondary dual-listed IPO that would allow its owners to cash out. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are marketing the offering through February 1.
Agriculture companies Bioceres and Molino Canuelas have revived IPO plans after failing to go public last year.

Renewable power producer Genneia informed regulators of its intent to go public, while real-estate developer TGLT could dust off its ageing registration statement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico's federally appointed financial oversight board on Friday questioned island officials about how they planned to centralize financial control after the bankrupt U.S. territory discovered nearly $7 billion in previously unreported money.
During a two-hour hearing that shed light on decades of disorganized and inconsistent accounting, the board asked about the government's plans to consolidate a public sector that has more than 100 agencies.
""You all came in facing a blank slate and had to invent new processes,"" board member Andrew Biggs said. ""But building institutional strength ... so that when you pass on to a new administration, they will inherit that strength, is important""
Puerto Rico is navigating at once the largest government bankruptcy in U.S. history, with $120 billion of combined bond and pension debt, and its worst natural disaster in 90 years in September's Hurricane Maria, which killed dozens and decimated local infrastructure.
The board, put in place by the U.S. Congress to manage the commonwealth's finances, is investigating some $6.9 billion scattered across 800 bank accounts, which Puerto Rico revealed for the first time in December.
Natalie Jaresko, the board's executive director, said at Friday's hearing the board would be making an announcement ""very soon"" about the as-yet-unnamed forensic team that will lead the probe. The hearing was called to question current and former officials about the island's accounting practices.
644 ACCOUNTS
Panelist Gerardo Portela, director of the Puerto Rican financial authority known as AAFAF, stressed the severity of Puerto Rico's liquidity crisis, noting that $4.3 billion of the found money is tied up at government agencies and unavailable to pay the island's debt.
Portela's comment illustrates ongoing tension between authorities concerned that Puerto Rico is overstating its financial plight, and locals who feel ignored by those authorities.
Board member Jose Gonzalez questioned Portela on whether, during a financial crisis, it was fair to deem certain accounts off-limits to creditors, particularly those whose revenues are generated through government actions like tax streams.
A panel of ex-officials, which included former Puerto Rico Treasury Secretary Juan Zaragoza Gomez, revealed a history of inefficient accounting in an unwieldy, decentralized government.
Agencies do not communicate well, he said, because of constant political turnover, and also because they use different computing software. ""We'd be using Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) 2.0 at Treasury, and Oracle 2.3 at the Department of Health, and Oracle 1.7 at Education,"" he said.
In April of 2016, Zaragoza said, when he was closing accounts at the island's then-liquidating Government Development Bank (GDB), ""I honestly thought we had like 30 or 40 bank accounts.""
In fact, ""we had 644 accounts at GDB,"" Zaragoza said.

408,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Executive resigns from U.S. firm accused of $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme,"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - A turnaround specialist has resigned as chief restructuring officer of the Woodbridge Group of Companies, a property development firm the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged is a $1.2 billion Ponzi fraud, a company attorney said on Friday.
Lawrence Perkins of SierraConstellation Partners LLC was hired by Woodbridge in October, replacing the company's founder, after the SEC began investigating Woodbridge's fund raising.
Woodbridge filed for bankruptcy in December and was subsequently sued by the SEC to freeze its assets, accusing it of selling unregistered securities to raise funds to repay earlier investors.
The regulator accused the company of defrauding 8,400 investors, many of whom invested their retirement savings in the company's unregistered securities that were meant to raise funds for luxury real estate and to extend loans to commercial property developers. 
The SEC alleges the commercial property developers were actually entities controlled by Woodbridge's founder, Robert Shapiro.
Perkins' resignation will be effective once a replacement is hired, Sean Beach, an attorney for Young Conaway Stargatt & Taylor, which represents Woodbridge, said after a hearing in Wilmington.
Beach declined to comment on the timing of a replacement.
Perkins declined to comment in an email to Reuters.
Beach spoke at the conclusion of three days of testimony over a request by the SEC and the official committee of unsecured creditors for an independent, court-approved trustee to replace Woodbridge's management.
Perkins had testified last week that he was investigating the fraud allegations.
Attorneys for the SEC and the creditors' committee had pressed Perkins about agreements he struck potentially worth millions of dollars for Shapiro.
The SEC has said Shapiro misappropriated at least $21 million in company funds for luxury goods. He was also accused of improperly comingling investor funds and using $328 million to repay earlier investors, spending more than $100 million on commissions and payroll and $172 million on operating expenses.
Shapiro has denied the fraud allegations.
Perkins testified last week that, as part of the agreements, Shapiro contributed properties to the company's bankruptcy estate and promised to cooperate with unfinished real estate developments.
Woodbridge and several groups of purported victims of the alleged fraud argued against appointing a trustee, which they said would delay resolution of the case and drive up costs by bringing in another team of professionals.
The court scheduled closing arguments over the request for an independent trustee for Tuesday.

426,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",Lowe's nominates directors after 'constructive' talks with D.E. Shaw,"By Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) - Home improvement chain Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW) said it has nominated two independent board members and plans to add a third following ""constructive"" talks with hedge fund D.E. Shaw Group, which has taken an activist stake, sending shares up 3 percent on Friday.
D.E. Shaw has built a stake worth roughly $1 billion in the $84 billion company, according to a source familiar with the matter. Shaw has been concerned about Lowe's operational performance in comparison with peers, the source added.
Lowe's same-store sales growth has lagged Home Depot's (N:HD) for several years as it focuses more on do-it-yourself customers compared to its bigger rival's focus on professional contractors who bill more.
While Lowe's stock jumped 30 percent last year, it underperformed Home Depot's 41 percent rise. Lowe's shares added $3.25 to $104.56 on Friday. 
Chief Executive Officer Robert Niblock said Lowe's valued the ""constructive discussions"" with Shaw. Shaw portfolio manager Quentin Koffey said the two new directors will be ""significant assets to the board.""
David Batchelder, co-founder of Relational Investors, and Lisa Wardell, CEO of Adtalem Global Education (N:ATGE), will join the board, Lowe's said on Friday.
The retailer will also nominate Brian Rogers, chairman of T. Rowe Price Group (O:TROW) and its former chief investment officer, for election to the board.
Batchelder was recommended by D.E. Shaw, while Wardell and Rogers were the company's candidates, a source close to the matter said. Batchelder had served on the board of  Home Depot  following a proxy fight in 2007 and helped push for a turnaround at the company. 
The appointments of Batchelder, who will serve on the board's compensation committee, and Wardell, who will sit on the audit committee, will be effective March 22.

D.E. Shaw, best known as a quantitative hedge fund, started carving out an activist practice last year. Koffey joined the firm from Elliott Management about six months ago and was part of a campaign pushing for changes in EQT Corp's (N:EQT) $6.7 billion to deal to buy Rice Energy Inc .

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron will host dozens of the world's most powerful business executives at the gilded Palace of Versailles to pitch France Inc before the global elite's annual gathering at Davos. 
Goldman Sachs's Lloyd Blankfein, JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon and Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg will be among the chief executives at the summit that the presidency is dubbing ""Choose France"". 
Elysee sources said ""concrete"" investment decisions would be announced. 
""Monday, in the global business world, France will be the place to be,"" one presidential adviser quipped.
""Many investors will be in Europe for the Davos summit, so we've suggested a stopover in Paris,"" another Macron aide said.
Macron, a former investment banker, and his government are pushing through social and economic reforms to re-shape the French economy and restore France's image among investors.
Investors frequently complain of the country's high labor costs and rigid labor regulations, and remember his socialist predecessor's now-defunct 75 percent tax on millionaires.
French officials have also seized on Britain's decision to exit the European Union, Germany's complex coalition talks and Spain's Catalonia crisis to promote France as a haven of stability at the heart of the European single market. 
Half of the companies represented at the grand palace of Versailles will be European, a quarter American, and another quarter from Asia and the Middle East, Elysee officials said.
The list of attendees reads like a Who's Who of international business and is a sign of the 40-year-old French leader's continued pulling power eight months into his presidency.
The include top executives from HSBC, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Rolls Royce (LON:RR), SAP, UPS, Bosch,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), JD.com, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Cisco. 
One of the aides said executives would ""speed date"" with French ministers in the afternoon before Macron joins them. 
Dozens of investment projects will be discussed, and Elysee insiders expect four to five ""significant and emblematic"" announcements to be made, including one for a job-creating bricks-and-mortar factory in the industrial sector.
Two announcements in the digital sector and artificial intelligence will also be made, they said.

Macron, 40, then travels to Davos where in a speech on Wednesday he will set out his vision for the future of globalization, the Elysee officials said. Widening inequalities, global warming and the rise of nationalism will feature in the 45-minute speech.

LONDON/BALMEDIE, Scotland (Reuters) - In Balmedie, a village on the northeast coast of Scotland, an unfinished 12 km stretch of dual carriageway is a stark illustration of why British construction company  Carillion  went bust this week.
The road project fell behind schedule and rose above budget, helping tip the contractor over the edge. Britain's biggest corporate failure in almost a decade threatens thousands of jobs and has forced the government to step in to guarantee a slew of public services that the firm had provided. 
A handful of workers in high-visibility jackets could be seen still on the building site this week, on a bitterly cold day, nine months after that section of the route was expected to open. 
Carillion's (L:CLLN) collapse has ignited a row over Britain's system of outsourcing public services - everything from school meals and prison security to the maintenance of nuclear warheads - to competing private companies who rely on government work for a large part of their income. 
Critics including opposition politicians say it encouraged a risk-taking culture that saw Carillion bid aggressively for contracts and accept slender margins, leaving it little room for maneuver and leading to it racking up more and more debt when projects hit snags.
The company, working with two partners, took on the Scottish project - the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route that bypasses the port city - about three years ago with a fixed-price contract of about 550 million pounds ($760 million) under which it would only be paid as it completed sections of the road. 
However one stretch of the project, from Balmedie to Tipperty, fell behind schedule due to the harsh Scottish winter. To compound matters, Carillion was not only struggling in Aberdeen but also in the delivery of two major hospitals in England and on sites in the Middle East and Canada.
With the group failing to bring in cash and its costs rising, debts ballooned. Worth 1 billion pounds a year ago, its value fell to 61 million pounds before the directors filed for liquidation at London's High Court at 0600 GMT on Monday. 
Court documents show it owed almost 1.3 billion pounds to lenders and had only 29 million pounds in cash reserves.
""They have been too quick to book revenues upfront and they have slotted the costs in further down the line,"" said Matthew Earl, founder of ShadowFall Capital & Research. ""You can only do that for so long before it comes back to haunt you.""
POLITICAL FIREFIGHT
Outsourcing was pioneered in Britain by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. The country has since been the leader in Europe, and second only to the United States globally, in its use of companies such as Carillion,  G4S  (CO:G4S), Serco and Capita to provide essential services. 
Successive governments of different parties have argued that private companies are more efficient at running services and that the outsourcing system allowed infrastructure investments to be made without adding considerably to the state's debts. 
""What we want is to provide good-quality public services delivered at best value to the taxpayer,"" Prime Minister Theresa May said after Carillion's collapse. She also said the government was ""a customer of Carillion, not the manager of Carillion"". 
Yet the government was left carrying the can, in some respects. 
The Aberdeen road was just one of 450 state projects Carillion was working on when it collapsed, including the building and maintenance of hospitals and schools, defense sites and a high-speed rail line. Its liquidation forced the government to step in to guarantee services. 
And Carillion is part of a wider outsourcing system.
In the 2015-16 financial year, Britain spent 251.5 billion pounds, or a third of total government spend, through external suppliers, according to National Audit Office estimates. 
""This isn't one isolated case,"" opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a left-winger who favors nationalizing certain public services like railways, said this week about the contractor's collapse. ""As the ruins of Carillion lie around her will the prime minister act to end this costly racket?""
ABERDEEN: 'AMBITIOUS TIMETABLE'
Employing 43,000 people around the world, Carillion helped to build major projects such as the Channel Tunnel, while also cleaning and providing meals for prisons, schools and hospitals. 
It first signaled it was in trouble in July when a profit warning forced its CEO out. The company, which was burning through its cash reserves, wrote down the value of soured contracts by 845 million pounds. 
The construction of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route was one of the contracts taking its toll. The work had been won by Carillion and two joint venture partners,  Balfour Beatty  (L:BALF) and  Galliford Try  (L:GFRD) in December 2014. 
Larry Irwin, a lawyer representing rural landowners affected by the build, said the project had been dogged by drainage and design issues which came to light once construction had started.
""When we met with agents of the consortium, before they had been given the formal decision on the tender, they were suggesting it was an ambitious timetable to do it in three years,"" he told Reuters. 
More than three years on, most payments are yet to be made. ""As is the case with most contracts of this nature, (the joint venture) receive payments once agreed sections of the road have opened to traffic,"" said government agency Transport Scotland. 
Stephen Rawlinson, director at industry consultants Applied Value, said delays meant that more of the project had to be carried out in the winter than originally intended. 
He estimates costs rose at least 350 million pounds above budget.
Galliford and Balfour declined to comment on details about cost and timetable problems. 
Galliford said earlier this week that Carillion owed up to 80 million pounds on the project when it collapsed, a sum picked up by the other two partners, who had stronger balance sheets. 
One of the few groups to benefit from Carillion's demise was the hedge funds that bet against it, alerted by the fact the company was struggling to collect the money it was owed and taking longer to pay its suppliers. 
UNDER-CAPITALIZED COMPANIES
Carillion is not the first contractor to go bust and not the first outsourcer to grab the headlines. Rail maintenance firm Jarvis and property services group Connaught collapsed in 2010. 
In 2012 G4S failed at the last minute to provide enough security guards for the London Olympics, forcing the organizers to call in the army, and both it and Serco have admitted charging to monitor criminals who were either dead or in prison. 
The revelations prompted the government to take a much tougher line when awarding contracts. Coupled with a slowdown in new work due to the uncertainty of Brexit, many of Britain's outsourcers have issued profit warnings in recent years. 
Some of the big groups such as G4S and Serco have already sought to restructure, taking on less low-margin British work.
Rudi Klein, head of Britain's Specialist Engineering Contractors' Group, met Business Minister Greg Clark this week to discuss the fallout from Carillion and said the government appeared sympathetic to calls for a rethink. 
""The traditional approach of appointing large under-capitalized companies to do this work has got to end,"" he said. 
Vince Cable, the leader of the smaller Liberal Democrats party and a former business minister, said that as a customer the government could demand better standards of contractors, in terms of staff training and management of supply chains and finances. It could also work directly with smaller providers. 
""We need smarter procurement. This has ultimately been expensive,"" he told Reuters. 
Back in Aberdeen, Transport Scotland expects the Western Peripheral Route to open early this year. The bypass is vital for a city that is regularly gridlocked, but it will also serve as a footnote in the tale of Carillion's demise. 
""There are many salutary lessons for government, suppliers, shareholders and lenders from the collapse of Carillion,"" Serco Chief Executive Rupert Soames told Reuters. 
""As Warren Buffett said, it is only when the tide goes out that you discover who's been swimming naked.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) is tightening the requirements for passengers traveling with onboard service and emotional support animals, the carrier said on Friday, following a sharp uptick in animal-related safety issues over the last several years.
Effective March 1, Delta, the second largest U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said it will require passengers seeking to fly with pets to present additional documents outlining passenger's need for the animal and proof of the animal's training and vaccinations, 48 hours prior to the scheduled flight. 
This comes in response to what the carrier said was a 150 percent increase in the number of service and support animals carried onboard since 2015.
Alongside that increase has been an 84 percent spike in the number of reported animal incidents since 2016, including urination and/or defecation, biting, and a high-profile 2017 mauling of a passenger by a 70-pound emotional support dog. 
""The rise in serious incidents involving animals in flight leads us to believe that the lack of regulation in both health and training screening for these animals is creating unsafe conditions across U.S. air travel,"" John Laughter - senior vice president of corporate safety, security and compliance - said in a statement. 

Under federal law, service animals are permitted to fly in-cabin with their owners, provided they do not pose a threat to the health and safety of others.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some traders at the largest Wall Street banks are about to get big, fat zeroes for bonuses while they watch markets thrive.
Trading revenue was down significantly across the industry during the fourth quarter, wrapping up a year in which clients around the globe sat idle as market volatility hovered near historic lows.
The big five Wall Street banks – JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) – reported an average revenue decline of 32 percent for the fourth quarter, and 12 percent for the full year. Even though stock markets hit new highs and bond markets moved little, executives said it was hard to generate income from inactive customers.
As a result, bonuses could be 10 percent to 20 percent lower than the prior year, and traders who sit on desks that posted losses could get nothing at all, consultants and recruiters said in interviews.
""Getting zero bonuses was unheard of a couple years ago, but it happens today,"" said Alan Johnson, head of compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates.
""I expect that there are people who will get no bonus"" this season, he added.
Traders have been feeling the crunch for several years, as trading revenue has been on a near-steady march downward and banks have embarked on aggressive cost-cutting campaigns. It has also become harder for traders to leave banks for attractive opportunities on the buy-side because active managers have been facing their own difficulties with performance and fund-raising.
Commodities traders may have it the worst. Muted client activity and wild fluctuations in power and natural gas markets resulted in one of the worst years on record for many trading firms. Big names in energy trading, including hedge fund manager Andy Hall and Texas tycoon T. Boone Pickens, simply closed up shop.
After posting one of the worst years on record, managers in Goldman Sachs' commodities trading unit have told some staff to expect little to no bonus for 2017 performance, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
They were not authorized to speak on the record. Spokeswoman Tiffany Galvin declined to comment.
While $0 bonus checks are still relatively rare, Wall Street banks are trying hard to keep a lid on compensation costs more broadly.
Goldman cut its compensation costs 12 percent last year, even as it hired 2,200 more workers. Its average employee received $323,852 in compensation during 2017. That represented 37 cents for every dollar in revenue they produced, down from 38 cents the year before.
Compensation costs in Morgan Stanley's institutional business declined only slightly more than its revenue declined. The investment bankers and traders in that unit received 34 cents in compensation for every dollar in revenue they brought into the bank, down from 35 cents-per-dollar in 2016.
""We pay for performance,"" Chief Financial Officer Jon Pruzan said in an interview.
Historically during bonus season, traders have expected to take home some percent of either the revenue they generated during the year, or the value of their book of assets. That structure offered enormous upside for strong performance, but because it also encouraged risk-taking, banks have shifted to a model that adjusts for risk and is more discretionary, recruiters and consultants said.
Ross Gregory, a director at the talent firm Proco Commodities, said he expects bonuses to be much lower this year because of those factors, as well as weak performance.

""We foresee a softening in the bonuses at the Wall Street banks,"" he said.

470,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 07:25AM ET</span>","U.S. shutdown fears hurt dollar, Treasury yields at highest since 2014","By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar wallowed near three-year lows on Friday as heightened fears of a U.S. government shutdown unnerved investors, while U.S. Treasury yields continued an upward march to hit their highest levels since September 2014.
Legislation to stave off an imminent federal government shutdown encountered obstacles in the Senate on Thursday night, despite the passage of a month-long funding bill by the House of Representatives hours earlier.
Without the injection of new money, no matter how temporary, scores of federal agencies will be forced to shut starting at midnight on Friday, when existing funds expire.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against other major currencies, was down 0.3 percent (DXY) and close to this week's three-year lows. 
It was heading for a fifth week of falls and has lost 2 percent in the early days of 2018. 
""Odds of a U.S. government shutdown have risen sharply in the past 24 hours,"" said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel.
""While we would expect such noise to keep the dollar on the back foot, any fundamental fallout at this stage would seem premature – not least as history tends to show that some sort of conciliatory approach to keep the government functioning in the long-run will ultimately prevail within Congress."" 
Market players said worries of a shutdown may have also weighed on sentiment in bond markets, which remain under pressure from expectations that strong economic data globally will encourage the U.S. Federal Reserve to press ahead with monetary tightening.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hit their highest level in more than three years at 2.642 percent (US10YT=RR) on Friday.
Marie Owens Thomsen, chief economist at Indosuez, said the firm attributed a 30 percent probability of a shutdown -- an event that could push yields higher. 
STOCKS ON SOLID GROUND
U.S. stock futures traded broadly higher (ESc1) (1YMc1), pointing to a firm open for Wall Street and suggesting equity investors were shrugging off the wrangling in Washington.
Stock markets in London (FTSE), Paris (FCHI) and Frankfurt (DAX) were 0.3 to 1 percent higher, while the pan-regional STOXX 600 (STOXX) hit a new 2-1/2 year peak as confidence over economic and earnings growth helped consolidate a strong start to the year. (EU)
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, also touched record highs with Asian stock markets continuing to benefit from data on Thursday that showed China's growth in 2017 accelerated for the first time in seven years.
China stocks closed at two-year highs, with the Shanghai index (SSEC) posting its fifth straight week of gains. Japan's Nikkei (N225) ended the day 0.2 percent higher. 
EURO SHINES 
The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.2260  after hitting a three-year peak above $1.2300 earlier this week on expectations that the European Central Bank would take steps towards winding back on stimulus measures to normalize monetary policy. 
The euro's rally was tempered later as some ECB officials voiced worries about the currency's strength.
China's yuan  meanwhile breached the psychologically important 6.4 dollar level for the first time in more than two years the day after Beijing said annual growth was 6.8 percent in October-December, slightly above forecasts.
Oil prices slid and were on course for the biggest weekly falls since October, as a bounce-back in U.S. production outweighed ongoing declines in crude inventories.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $68.67 a barrel, down 0.9 percent on the day, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) fell a similar amount to $63.40 a barrel.

Gold prices  were up 0.5 percent, supported by a weaker dollar, but the metal was still on track for its first weekly drop in six weeks.

471,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",Largest ever flows into stocks greet 'super-frothy' start to 2018: BAML,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - The relentless rise in global stocks should extend in the short-term as investors pump record amounts of cash into equities after a ""super-frothy"" start to 2018, strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said on Friday.
Investors ploughed $23.9 billion into stocks this week, bringing cumulative four-week inflows to their strongest ever level, BAML strategists said, citing EPFR data.
The record inflow to stocks reflected investors' overwhelmingly optimistic view on equities as global indices continued to crank out new records, driving them to add risk and wary of being left out of the final leg of the bull run.
""Happy new 'Fear of Missing Out'"", BAML strategists quipped.
This week's equity inflows were the seventh largest on record, with $20.4 billion going into ETFs and $3.5 billion into mutual funds.
Actively managed funds enjoyed their best cumulative four-week inflows in four years, a sign the active method was beginning to claw back some ground from passive funds.
Europe's equities continued their recovery from outflows suffered in December, drawing in $2.2 billion of investors' cash, while the U.S. remained the clear leader with $6.4 billion flowing in.
Cyclical sectors continued to rule the roost with financials, tech and energy stocks drawing the greatest inflows.
GOING ON A BEAR HUNT
Amid the new year exuberance, there were hints the market couldn't keep going at its blistering pace.
On the S&P 500's current momentum -- 133 percent annualized return -- it would reach 6220 points by the end of the year, BAML strategists noted. It closed at 2798 on Thursday.
Investors still fretted about bond yields and inflation.
The most frequently asked question by institutions was ""what level of bond yields will cause an equity correction"", while private clients were most concerned about how to position for inflation.
While bonds also drew strong inflows of $5.1 billion this week, TIPS (inflation-protected U.S. Treasury bonds) funds drew record inflows of $1.5 billion in a sign investors were growing more cautious about inflationary pressures.
Strong flows into financials stocks and big redemptions from real estate investment trusts were also incipient signs of inflation positioning.
BAML strategists pointed to slowing flows and hesitant price action in credit markets as signs of strain. ""Credit is 'glue' keeping cross-asset bull market together,"" they wrote, labeling the market a ""clear bear catalyst"".
Issues including a potential U.S. government shutdown, NAFTA negotiations, and oil prices were noise to worry about, strategists said, but they wouldn't affect bullish positioning unless they dented earnings or translated into higher rates.
Having pushed back their prediction for a big market correction for month after month last year, BAML's strategists didn't put a new date on the long-awaited sell-off.
Feedback from clients pointed to a correction occurring only when real GDP forecasts, wage inflation and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields all rise above 3 percent and the S&P 500 reaches 3,000 points, they said.
In the meantime ""frothy price action could continue,"" strategists concluded, adding that their bull and bear indicator of market sentiment had risen to 7.4, near a sell signal.

473,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 06:45AM ET</span>",ECB Seen Closer to Signaling End to QE as Hawks Gain Sway,"(Bloomberg) -- Economists brought forward their estimate of when the European Central Bank will set an end-date for its bond-buying program, amid signs that more optimistic views on inflation might be gaining sway among policy makers.
While no action is expected at the Governing Council meeting on Jan. 25, almost half of respondents in a Bloomberg survey predicted the ECB will announce a definite end-date for asset purchases by June. Just 38 percent held that view in the previous survey last month. The first change in forward guidance is foreseen for March.
Asked when interest rates will rise, the economists said the deposit rate will be lifted to minus 0.25 percent in the second quarter of 2019 from a record-low minus 0.4 percent. The main refinancing rate will be increased over the following three months.
The outlook reflects a renewed push by some ECB officials to recognize that the strongest economic expansion in a decade will soon boost inflation and that they need to avoid falling behind the curve. On the flipside, others raised concern this week over the euro’s strength and the risk that it will undercut price pressures.
“The main topic for the next months will be communication,” said Kristian Toedtmann, an economist at DekaBank in Frankfurt. “Changes in forward guidance are likely, but they will probably not be uniform across instruments.”
Hawkish comments from policy makers who prefer to move ahead with plans to unwind the ECB’s unprecedented stimulus have dominated the public debate around the turn of the year, with Executive Board member Yves Mersch and Governing Council members Jens Weidmann and Ardo Hansson all calling for determined action. Even Executive Board member Benoit Coeure, one of the key architects of quantitative easing, said he saw a “reasonable chance” the latest extension to September would be the last.
In a sign of shifting consensus within the 25-person council, the account of the December meeting revealed that it could review its policy language early this year. The publication of that document last week helped pushed the euro to its highest level since late 2014.
Those gains alarmed some ECB officials. Vice President Vitor Constancio and Governors Francois Villeroy de Galhau and Ewald Nowotny argued in recent days that a stronger exchange rate may harm their efforts to return inflation to the goal of just below 2 percent.
The euro advanced for a second day on Friday and traded at $1.2280 at 11:35 a.m. Frankfurt time. While concerns over a potential U.S. government shutdown have weighed on the dollar this week, that trend may soon reverse. The European currency is vulnerable to a vote on Sunday that could determine whether Germany gets a stable government or will face new elections.
Wage growth in the euro area may no longer hold back an increase in price levels, but it won’t make much of a positive contribution either. More than two thirds of the economists surveyed predicted pay rises in the region will remain below the general rule of thumb of inflation plus gains in labor productivity, averaging 2.1 percent in 2018, according to the estimates provided.
The ECB currently predicts consumer-price growth will accelerate to 1.8 percent in the second half of 2020.
With opinions on the path of policy forward diverging among the region’s central bankers, Draghi may choose to buy some time and defer any decisions to the Governing Council’s March 8 meeting.
For next week, that would mean the ECB head reiterating his commitment to buy 30 billion euros ($37 billion) of assets until at least September, keep interest rates unchanged well past the end of purchases, and reinvest the proceeds of maturing debt for an extended period.
“We expect Draghi to convey a rather dovish message, pointing to still weak inflationary pressure and also emphasizing the disinflationary impact from a stronger euro,” said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING-Diba AG in Frankfurt. “It would also show Draghi’s magic of how to guide financial markets with very few words and without any action.”

487,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 11:53PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Blackstone's Hill hands hedge fund reins to McCormick,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - After nearly two decades of growing Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group into the world's biggest hedge fund investor with some $74 billion in assets, J. Tomilson Hill is passing the baton.
Blackstone has promoted John McCormick (NYSE:MKC) to president and chief executive of hedge fund unit Blackstone Alternative Asset Management (BAAM) and Hill will become its chairman, the company told Reuters on Thursday. The change is effective immediately.
Hill, the face of hedge fund investing at the private equity giant since he was tapped to help put the partners' money to work in 2000, plans to stay at Blackstone for now. He will remain on Blackstone's board and its 11-person management committee.
By installing a younger chief at the hedge fund unit, which makes up roughly one-fifth of the company's assets, Blackstone is laying the groundwork for a generational shift in an industry where many firms have struggled to move beyond their founders.
""There will be a lot of continuity but that doesn't mean it will be boring,"" McCormick, 50, told Reuters. He added that Hill, who turn 70 this year and has mentored him during his 13 years at the firm, urged him to continue shaking things up.
For a quarter of a century, Hill, who came to Blackstone after being ousted as co-chief executive at Lehman Brothers, has added foreign governments, sovereign wealth funds and pensions to the firm's growing client roster.
When his clients complained about hedge funds' hefty fees, he pushed for cuts, and when they worried about being lumped into investment pools he pushed managers to create separately managed accounts. When big data crept into investing, he was among the first to make big bets on so-called quant funds like Two Sigma and Peter Muller's PDT.
He has established strong ties with some of the industry's best talents, including Paul Singer's Elliott Management and Paul Tudor Jones' Tudor Investment Corp.
There have been some setbacks, including the shuttering of Senfina, Blackstone's ""big bet"" hedge fund, amid mounting double-digit losses in 2016.
TRANSITION IN FOCUS 
While the hedge fund industry has suffered record outflows in recent years due to high fees and sub-par performance, BAAM has pulled in billions in fresh money and manages more than twice as much as its nearest rival, UBS Hedge Fund Solutions.
In the 17 years since its launch, BAAM’s Principal Solutions Business has delivered an annualized net return of 6 percent, beating the S&P 500 Total Return and MSCI World Total Return Indices. It has done so with approximately 30 percent of the volatility, the firm said in a filing.
But Hill has watched fund managers big and small struggle with leadership transition and vowed to do better. It is a key topic in an industry where investors often lock up money for years. 
""Succession planning has been on my mind for years,"" he said.
Hill has worked closely with McCormick, who has been instrumental in creating and selling many of BAAM's new products, including taking stakes in established hedge funds, which helped boost revenue.
As head of global strategy for the group, McCormick was instrumental in creating hedge fund products aimed at retail clients.
A plan to make these ""liquid alts"" widely available in employer sponsored, tax-deferred 401(k) retirement plans, however, has yet to pan out.
HILL'S NEXT CHAPTER 
A trained lawyer who worked at U.S. Treasury and management consultancy McKinsey & Co before joining what he calls a ""a rocket ship poised for great things"", McCormick cuts a different figure from Hill, a billionaire art collector often seen on the Manhattan social circuit.
Befitting the secretive hedge fund industry, McCormick keeps a relatively low profile. He gets to the office by 7:30 a.m. and often stays to 8:00 p.m. or later. He recently learned Spanish and accompanies his in-laws to Cuba, he said, which has meant a lot of foreign language radio for his three children as he ferries them to soccer games.
""He is very orderly, thoughtful and very, very smart,"" Blackstone Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said. 
While Hill is stepping back from the day-to-day business, he will remain integrally involved. 
""Tom has been at the table for all the major developments and he has done a fantastic job of developing BAAM,"" said Schwarzman, who met Hill in the Army Reserves decades ago.
Hill, who is working on plans to build a museum to exhibit some of his Warhols, Lichtensteins and Bacons, has been captivated by using data to make investment decisions. 

""I am looking down the road, I am not a looking in the rear-view mirror kind of guy.""

489,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 10:40PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. puts HNA deals on ice until it gets ownership info - source,"By Koh Gui Qing and Greg Roumeliotis
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government will not approve any investment by HNA Group  until the Chinese conglomerate, which has been scrutinized around the world over its ownership structure, provides adequate information on who its shareholders are, a source familiar with the situation said. 
Failure to get U.S. regulatory support means that HNA's high-profile bids to invest in U.S. hedge fund SkyBridge Capital LLC and Swiss trader and miner Glencore's (L:GLEN) petroleum products storage and logistics business are in limbo. Both investments are currently awaiting approval from the U.S. government.
SkyBridge and  Glencore  declined to comment. HNA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Faced with questions around its ultimate owners, HNA overhauled its shareholding structure last year to give majority control to two charities. However, regulators, including authorities in Switzerland and New Zealand, are still querying the airline-to-property company about the identity of its owners.
The Chinese conglomerate first announced in January 2017 that it was buying a majority stake in SkyBridge, a hedge fund investment firm founded by Anthony Scaramucci, a former aide to U.S. President Donald Trump. HNA and SkyBridge have never disclosed the terms of the investment.
Scaramucci declined to comment.
But a year on, HNA and SkyBridge have faced repeated delays in getting the green light for their deal from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an intra-government agency that scrutinizes foreign groups' purchases of U.S. assets to protect national security interests.
A source close to the SkyBridge transaction was downbeat about the prospect of the investment being completed.
Glencore, which agreed last March to sell HNA a stake in its petroleum products storage and logistics business for $775 million, said in December it had closed parts of the deal worth $579 million. It said three assets in the United States still required clearance from CFIUS, and sources familiar with the matter said they expected the deal would be approved by the end of June.
HNA's inability to get CFIUS approval for its deals is the latest setback for the Chinese company. 
HNA had little trouble closing big investments in the United States in 2016 when it bought U.S electronics distributor Ingram Micro (N:IM) for $6 billion and a near 25 percent stake in hotel operator  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc (N:HLT).
But after a two-year, $50 billion investment spree, HNA is facing financial, legal and regulatory problems.
CFIUS' deliberations are usually shrouded in secrecy but a recent lawsuit showed some of the back and forth between the committee and companies involved in the process.
U.S. software engineering company Ness Technologies S.A.R.L., which had agreed to be bought by HNA for $325 million, sued HNA in December for allegedly failing to answer questions about its ownership in a CFIUS review. The deal fell apart when HNA did not get U.S. approval.
Ness said in the lawsuit that HNA and its unit had ""covertly worked to evade and frustrate"" CFIUS's review of the investment by ""discussing, planning, orchestrating and implementing various schemes to disguise the true nature of their organizations, corporate structures and ownership."" 
The U.S. technology firm said CFIUS could not even begin its formal review of the deal because it had ""material questions about the completeness and accuracy of the information provided by HNA.""
HNA has said the lawsuit is baseless. 
U.S. lawyers who specialize in CFIUS issues said the regulator has the power to reassess previously approved transactions that have closed if it judged that material information was not submitted the first time, or that information sent earlier was misleading. 
A CFIUS spokesman declined to comment.
CFIUS’s stance has toughened under Trump as Washington seeks to put pressure on China to help tackle North Korea's nuclear ambitions, though the lawsuit filed by Ness noted that HNA's case was unique partly because it repeatedly changed the story about its ownership.

Beijing-based Naura Microelectronics Equipment Co Ltd did win CFIUS approval to buy U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment company Akrion Systems LLC, attorneys for Naura said this week.

490,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 10:36PM ET</span>","Tax overhaul leads AmEx to first loss in 26 years, buyback suspension","By Pallavi Dewan
(Reuters) - Credit card issuer  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) posted its first quarterly loss in 26 years and said it would not buy back shares for the next six months, both due to the impact of the recently enacted U.S. tax reform.
AmEx's shares dropped 2.5 percent to $97.20 in trading after the bell on Thursday.
The company took a $2.6 billion charge to cover a new one-time repatriation tax on undistributed income of certain non-U.S. units and to adjust the value of its deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The charge lowered AmEx's capital ratios and to rebuild that, the company said it would suspend share buybacks for the first half of 2018, but continue paying dividends, though only at current levels.
""Buybacks are a meaningful contribution to earnings per share growth at AmEx, and the temporary restriction will require some analysts to revise their 2018 EPS forecasts lower,"" Kyle Sanders, an analyst at Edward Jones, wrote in a note.
The $2.6 billion charge includes about $2 billion tax recognized on deemed repatriations of certain overseas earnings and roughly $600 million related to the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets.
The credit card issuer said it expects 2018 tax rate of about 22 percent before discrete items.
Net loss attributable to common shareholders was $1.20 billion, or $1.41 per share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $825 million, or 88 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding the charge, AmEx earned $1.58 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $1.54 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Total revenue, net of interest expense, rose to $8.84 billion from $8.02 billion last year as the company's customers spent more in the holiday season in the United States, its core market.
That also topped analysts' estimate of $8.72 billion.
""I wouldn't characterize Q4 as a high quality beat ... but the guidance is quite solid, despite the share buyback reduction,"" KBW analyst Sanjay Sakhrani said.
The company said it expects full-year 2018 earnings to be between $6.90-$7.30 per share, while analysts on average were expecting 2018 earnings of $7.04 per share.

The company said it also expects to deliver 2018 revenue growth in the 7-8 percent range.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government and MetLife Inc (N:MET) announced on Thursday they would jointly seek to dismiss an appeal over whether the insurance company should face stricter oversight as a key part of the financial system.
MetLife and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a top federal panel of financial regulators, filed a joint motion to dismiss an earlier FSOC appeal, the company announced in a statement.
The move marks another significant shift for the administration of President Donald Trump in its efforts to ease back stricter rules established under former President Barack Obama.
""I am pleased that the Justice Department has settled the MetLife case, consistent with the recommendation by a majority of FSOC voting members,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who chairs the FSOC, in a statement. ""I will be working with the Council to clarify and revise the non-bank designation rule and guidance.""
Backers of tougher rules established after the 2007-2009 financial crisis insist allowing regulators to identify specific firms for stricter scrutiny as key cogs of the financial system is a critical tool. But conservative critics argued the FSOC applied the power in an inconsistent and opaque fashion.
In November, the Treasury Department recommended the FSOC shift away from singling out specific companies, and instead focus on broader risks facing the financial system.
After a handful of non-bank financial companies were designed as ""systemically important financial institutions"" meriting stricter rules under Obama, MetLife mounted a legal fight against the regulatory decision. The insurance company originally won a case at a U.S. district court, but the Obama administration appealed the ruling in 2016.
Thursday's agreement ensures MetLife will not face those stricter rules. The FSOC voted in September to remove a similar designation for American International Group Inc (N:AIG), and GE Capital was able to escape the label in 2016 after overhauling its business.

Prudential Financial Inc (N:PRU) now is the only non-bank SIFI still under stricter government oversight. That company is expected to argue for similar regulatory relief from the regulators in the months ahead.

Jain directly owns $21.7 million of Berkshire stock, and indirectly owns $87.5 million of Berkshire stock held by his wife, a family non-profit foundation and two family trusts, according to a regulatory filing.
Berkshire last week appointed Jain, 66, its top reinsurance executive, as vice chairman for insurance operations such as the Geico auto insurer and General Re reinsurer.
It also appointed Gregory Abel, 55, the longtime chief of its Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit, as vice chairman for non-insurance operations such as the BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream.
Both were also named Berkshire directors.
Many investors and analysts said the appointments confirmed that Abel and Jain are the top contenders to replace Buffett, 87, as Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire's chief executive officer.
It has been easier, through filings by Berkshire Hathaway Energy, to track Abel's financial stake in Berkshire than Jain's.
Abel's compensation totaled $58.3 million in 2015 and 2016 combined, mainly from incentive pay and bonuses.
He also owned a Berkshire Hathaway Energy stake last February that could be converted at the time into more than $400 million of Berkshire stock.

Buffett, who has run Berkshire since 1965, has not signaled any plans to leave, and has long said he loves his job. He owns roughly one-sixth of Berkshire, and is worth $91.5 billion according to Forbes magazine.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A group of investors led by SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) closed a deal with Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] on Thursday, making SoftBank the largest stakeholder in the ride-services firm and providing a much-needed boost to controversy-ridden Uber.
The deal includes a large purchase of shares from existing Uber investors and employees at a discounted valuation for the company of $48 billion, a 30 percent drop from Uber's most recent valuation of $68 billion. These secondary stock sales will be completed by the end of the day Thursday on the Nasdaq Private Market, an Uber spokesman said. 
The investor group, which is co-led by SoftBank and Dragoneer Investment Group and includes Sequoia Capital, has also completed a $1.25 billion investment of fresh cash at the other, higher valuation, the spokesman said.
In all, the investors will take a stake of about a 17.5 percent in Uber, with SoftBank keeping 15 percent, becoming the company's largest shareholder. The investment triggers a number of governance changes at Uber, including the addition of new board members, which take effect immediately.
""This is a great outcome for our shareholders, employees and customers, strengthening Uber's governance as we double down on our technology investments and continue to bring our services to more people in more places around the world,"" said the Uber spokesman.
The official closing of the deal marks the end of a months-long process fraught with infighting among board members.
Power struggles have been fierce - an early and large investor, Benchmark Capital, sued in August to force co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick off the board. Meanwhile, Uber has been struggling with controversies including federal criminal probes, a massive data breach and a lawsuit claiming trade-secrets theft. 
The board first voted to move forward with the SoftBank investment in October, and the deal at times seemed close to falling apart, until Uber said last month that the investor group had enough willing stock sellers to go through with the transaction.
As part of the terms of the deal, Uber will expand its board from 11 to 17 members including four independent directors, limit some early shareholders' voting power and slash the control wielded Kalanick, who remains on the board.
Benchmark had also agreed to drop its lawsuit against Kalanick upon completion of the deal.
SoftBank has added two representatives to Uber's board of directors: Rajeev Misra, who is chief executive of SoftBank's Vision Fund, a $98 billion tech investment vehicle; and Marcelo Claure, Sprint Corp (N:S) president and CEO and a member of SoftBank's board of directors, according to a person familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to speak publicly because the plans are still private.
Uber declined to confirm any new board members.
""Uber has a very bright future under its new leadership,"" Misra said in a written statement, referring to new Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who helped broker the deal and benefits from the new governance changes.
Misra wants Uber to focus on growing in the United States, Europe, Latin America and Australia - not Asia, which has been among the most costly and competitive regions for the ride-services firm, according to the source. Such a change could help Uber achieve profitability more quickly, but could also signal a retreat from some of the biggest transportation markets.
SoftBank also has stakes in China ride-hailing app Didi, India's Ola and Southeast Asia's Grab, all of which compete with Uber in the region.
The Financial Times first reported Misra's comments earlier Thursday.
SoftBank had no trouble drumming up interest among shareholders, as many investors and employees were unable to sell as many shares as they would have liked because SoftBank had put limits on how much it would buy.

Kalanick sold nearly a third of his 10 percent stake in the ride-services company for about $1.4 billion, according to another person familiar with the matter. He had offered to sell half of his shares.

(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp's (N:IBM) revenue rose for the first time in 23 quarters, beating analysts' estimates, but the company warned that a higher tax rate this year would eat into its profit.
IBM's shares, which have rallied 10 percent so far this year on hopes of a strong turnaround in the company's fortunes, fell more than 3 percent in extended trading on Thursday.
The company forecast stable margins and revenue for 2018, buoyed by growth in its newer businesses such as cloud computing and security services.
However,  IBM  forecast an operating profit of at least $13.80 per share for 2018, compared with $13.80 in 2017 and market expectations of $13.92, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""According to Street expectations, we're already very low for earnings, ... but still, you would have liked to have seen, with the little better revenue trajectory and some positive comments, that would have played in to a nicer number,"" Pivotal Research analyst Lou Miscioscia said.
IBM forecast a 2018 operating tax rate of 16 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points, compared with a rate of 12 percent in 2017.
""Tax will be a headwind in 2018,"" IBM veteran and new Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh said on a conference call.
Kavanaugh said IBM would continue to ""maintain a high level of investment"" in 2018 as it boosts its capabilities on its high-margin ""strategic imperatives"" such as cloud, mobile, cybersecurity and data analytics.
That focus, started by Chief Executive Ginni Rometty, has helped IBM counter its faltering legacy hardware and software businesses and slow its revenue declines in recent quarters.
The company's revenue finally rose in the latest fourth quarter, the first year-over-year increase since the first quarter of 2012, just after Rometty became CEO.
Revenue from IBM's cloud business jumped 30 percent in the latest quarter. Revenue from all ""strategic imperatives"" rose 17 percent.
Total revenue increased 3.6 percent to $22.54 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $22.06 billion.
IBM swung to a loss of $1.05 billion from a year-ago profit of $4.50 billion, due to a $5.5 billion tax reform-related charge. Its adjusted profit of $5.18 per share beat estimates by a penny.
The company's adjusted gross margins of 49.5 percent fell short of market expectations of 50.8 percent.

IBM shares were down 3.4 percent at $163.40 in extended trading.

495,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 07:46PM ET</span>","Morgan Stanley raises targets, but Wall Street wants more","By Catherine Ngai and Aparajita Saxena
(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised key profitability and efficiency targets on Thursday, but those loftier goals failed to impress Wall Street analysts, who repeatedly asked Chief Executive Officer James Gorman why the bank could not do even better.
The new targets came after Morgan Stanley reported fourth-quarter results that beat analyst estimates and exceeded Gorman's previously stated ambitions for wealth management, bond trading, expenses and returns on shareholder equity.
During his eight years as CEO, Gorman, 59, has been working to transform Morgan Stanley from a Wall Street firm whose risk-taking nearly capsized it during the 2007-2009 financial crisis into a bank that relies more on businesses that generate steady fees, like wealth management.
The strategic update he laid out on Thursday included annual pretax profit margins of 26 percent to 28 percent for wealth management, returns on equity (ROE) of 10 percent to 13 percent and a cost-to-revenue ratio of 73 percent or less in the coming years. 
But analysts grilled Gorman about the targets during a conference call to discuss results, arguing that the bank is already at or near those goals and should be able to do much better.
The back and forth took a cheeky turn when Gorman addressed an analyst with an exasperated ""Oh my God,"" before again going through his rationale, including the possibility of a recession hurting profits.
""We are all in on delivering better results than what we've publicly said,"" Gorman added. ""On the other hand, we don't have credibility as a management team if we put out things which are artificially designed to boost confidence.""
It was not the first time Wall Street has pushed Gorman to aim higher.
When he took over as CEO, the wealth management business was generating single-digit pretax profit margins. He has gradually lifted the target from mid-teens to 20 percent to a range of 23 percent to 25 percent before outlining the current goal, and each time analysts have asked for more.
Last quarter, Gorman was also quizzed about his view that bond traders needed to generate at least $1 billion in average quarterly revenue to sustain the business. Some analysts have said that while the figure represents a minimum rather than a goal, the business can do a lot better.
In an analyst note, Devin Ryan at JMP Securities wrote that they have had conversations with investors for years who were hesitant to believe that ROEs could move back into the double-digit range.
""Therefore, we do view these new targets as an important moment for the firm in its current form"", adding that he does not perceive the targets to be end points, particularly as wealth management earnings should continue to expand.
Despite the sometimes exasperated discussion, Morgan Stanley's stock price hit its highest level in a decade on Thursday before closing up nearly 1 percent at $55.84. 
With a market capitalization of $101 billion, the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets is now more valuable than its closest competitor,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), whose shares are worth $95 billion.
Morgan Stanley's adjusted fourth-quarter profit of $1.68 billion, or 84 cents per share, beat analysts' average estimate of 77 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Those figures exclude a $1.2 billion charge resulting from a U.S. tax overhaul signed into law in December that also caused one-time hits at other major lenders. Analysts have been looking past those charges to focus on the long-term benefits of lower tax rates.
Morgan Stanley expects its tax rate to fall to a range of 22 percent to 25 percent this year, down from 31 percent last year.
Total revenue rose 5 percent to $9.5 billion from $9.02 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts were expecting $9.2 billion.
Excluding the tax charge, its return on equity was 9.4 percent last year, within Gorman's 9 percent to 11 percent target.
WEALTH HELPS DRIVE RESULTS
Wealth management was a bright spot, with revenue rising 10 percent from the year-ago quarter to a record $4.4 billion. Its pretax profit margin of 26 percent topped Gorman's previous target for the business, and the bank gathered a record $20.9 billion worth of fee-based client assets, the type it is trying to grow.
Morgan Stanley's underwriting business also posted strong results, particularly in equities, helped by the bank's leading position in initial public offerings. Underwriting revenue rose 42 percent to $915 million.
And while bond trading revenue plunged 45 percent in the fourth quarter, the business still delivered more than $1 billion in average quarterly revenue for the full year. 

All Wall Street banks, particularly Goldman Sachs, have faced big declines in bond trading due to historically low market volatility.

496,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 07:35PM ET</span>","At AstraZeneca, fewer drug projects bring big productivity jump","By Ben Hirschler
LONDON (Reuters) - A focus on fewer diseases, together with cuts in laboratories and staff, has delivered a more than fourfold increase in research productivity at drugmaker AstraZeneca (L:AZN), based on one key measure of success. The analysis published on Friday comes at a time of soul-searching among large pharmaceutical companies as they compete with smaller biotech firms, which are getting new drugs to market more efficiently. The turnaround evident this decade at AstraZeneca follows a shrinking of its global research and development organization and a revision of R&D strategy in 2011, a year before the arrival of current chief executive Pascal Soriot. Soriot has since continued the shift to a deeper and narrower focus on priority therapeutic areas, notably cancer. ""All these improvements have happened with less people, less sites and less money,"" Mene Pangalos, who leads AstraZeneca's Innovative Medicines and Early Development unit, told Reuters. Previously, AstraZeneca was a laggard in the pharmaceutical industry with a dismal track record in launching new medicines and a rapidly eroding base business, due to expiring patents on its older medicines. Its average success for getting a drug from the discovery phase through to successful completion of final-stage Phase III clinical trials was at an all-time low of 4 percent in 2005-10, below the industry average of 6 percent. But in the five years from 2012 to 2016, this jumped to 19 percent, while the industry average, according to consultancy CMR International, was little changed. AstraZeneca scientists published the latest findings in the journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. Significantly, there was a marked drop in the number of projects started at the discovery stage, with the total falling to just 76 in 2012-16 from 287 in 2005-10. ""We're working on far fewer programs and the probability of success on those programs is going up,"" Pangalos said. ""Going from 4 percent to nearly 20 percent is something we are all very happy with but I still want us to do better ... we're still failing 80 percent of the time.""
INVESTOR SENTIMENT The productivity boost coincides with an improvement in shareholder sentiment as investors have started to bet on AstraZeneca's ability to replace older medicines with new products, particularly in oncology. A failed bid from  Pfizer  (N:PFE) in 2014 has also helped the investment story.
Today, two-thirds of analysts recommend buying the shares, up from one in five in 2012.

The decision by Pangalos and his colleagues to detail the company's successes and failures in two academic papers, the first of which appeared in 2014, is unusual. Rivals such as GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) and Pfizer have published some details of R&D productivity in the past but the AstraZeneca review is more comprehensive. Still, the data does not track the profitability of AstraZeneca's research activities, since even when a new drug succeeds in final clinical tests and wins regulatory approval, commercial success is not guaranteed. A report last month by consultancy Deloitte found projected returns at 12 of the world's top drugmakers had fallen in recent years, even though the overall of number of new drugs had increased. AstraZeneca itself has had some notable successes, such as its new cancer pills Tagrisso and Lynparza, but prospects for other approved products, including its high-profile immunotherapy drug Imfinzi, have been more mixed. Imfinzi suffered a major lung cancer trial setback in July 2017, although it then went on to show impressive results in another lung cancer setting.

(Reuters) - A recruitment drive by Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) after a seven-year hiatus is exacerbating shortages of pilots at regional air services that provide a lifeline to remote communities in the country's sparsely populated Outback.
As airlines from Asia, Europe and North America vie for pilots amid a global shortage, there is growing concern among people in Australia's vast interior who rely on flights to major cities for medical treatment.
Ewen McPhee, a doctor in the remote mining town of Emerald, said that when he referred patients for specialist care they often needed to travel nearly 1,000 km (621 miles) to the nearest big city, Brisbane.
""Then they have to fly,"" he said. ""It is an 11-hour drive otherwise for an ill patient with quite a significant problem.""
Over the last four months the 80-minute flights have not been as reliable as usual, McPhee said, with last-minute cancellations for lack of pilots.
Regional Australia's predicament illustrates the broader risks the aviation industry faces from a lack of pilots as the number of annual air passengers globally is expected to nearly double to 7.8 billion over the next 20 years.
Around the world, airlines will be forced to review the wages, training and conditions they offer younger pilots as they open new routes and pursue ambitious expansion plans.
Australia's pilot shortage closely parallels one in the United States, where major airlines are on a hiring spree and regional carriers like Seattle-based Horizon Air have canceled hundreds of flights because of a lack of aviators.
Both countries have a culture of pilots paying up to $100,000 of their own money for training and flying for years at regional carriers on low pay to gain experience to be hired by major airlines.
To help fill in the gaps, the Australian government has reopened two-year visas for foreign pilots. Regional airlines however say longer visas are required to attract pilots from overseas.
Qantas began hiring again in 2016 after years of financial strife, during which it offered pilots leave without pay to work for other airlines. By mid-2018, it says it will have employed 300 new pilots, many from regional airlines. 
 Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd (AX:VAH) hired roughly another 120 pilots over the past year to fly major domestic and international routes.
HIGH COSTS, LOW PAY
While the Australian government offers loans of up to A$75,000 for students at select flying schools, trainee flyers still need tens of thousands of dollars from other sources to get their stripes.
Such costs are a major reason the number of student pilot licenses issued annually has fallen 23 percent since 2006, according to official figures.
Once out of flight school, young first officers at relatively large regional carriers only earn about A$60,000 ($48,000) a year, while being based in high-cost cities like Sydney where the average house price is about $1 million. 
""There is not a lot of incentive for smart young men and women to get into aviation,"" said Shane Loney, a Qantas pilot and vice president of the Australian and International Pilot Association.
""They have got a significant up-front cost to get qualified and then there isn't good pay unless they're fortunate enough to land a career with a big airline like Qantas or Virgin."" 
Unlike major Asian and European carriers such as Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) and easyJet plc (L:EZJ), Qantas does not offer a cadet program, although it partners with universities for its regional arm. Virgin, meanwhile, had 2,500 applications for 12 cadet spots last year.
Australia does not have a formal requirement for airline pilots to have 1,500 hours of flying experience like in the United States, but informally airlines want pilots with at least that number of hours for jets.
Even junior turboprop pilots in Australia usually have hundreds of hours, said Kirsty Ferguson, the founder of Sydney-based airline interview coaching firm Pinstripe Solutions. 
""Australia is having the same gaps in regional flying as in the U.S.,"" she said. 
GLOBAL CHURN
U.S. regional carriers like Mesa Airlines Inc and Skywest Inc (O:SKYW) are so short of pilots they are raising salaries, offering sign-on bonuses worth up to $50,000 and aggressively recruiting Australians and other foreigners eligible for visas. The U.S. Airline Pilots Association has said regional salaries are moving in the right direction.
In Australia, airlines with tight profit margins have not raised pay significantly despite pressure from unions, even as profits have recovered due to heavy cost-cutting.
At Regional Express Holdings Ltd (Rex) (AX:REX), which operates 33-seat turboprops, former cadets are paying agreed penalties of more than A$25,000 to escape a seven-year contract to advance to better-paid jobs at bigger airlines.
Rex has seen a spike in turnover as bigger airlines recruit. It wants the government to open up four-year visas for pilots with a path to permanent residency, said Chris Hine, a senior Rex executive and chairman of its flying school. 
High turnover is not limited to Rex. Qantas's regional arm QantasLink, which employs 400 pilots, hired more than 80 last year and expects to hire another 100 this year as pilots leave for bigger airlines, including Qantas. 
Others are heading overseas to carriers such as Dubai's Emirates and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) while the opportunities are available.
""It just follows the trend of cycles in aviation,"" Australian Federation of Air Pilots President David Booth, a Virgin pilot, said of the hiring rush. 
""This one is a little bit worse than normal, but I don't think it is going to last forever.""

500,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 06:08PM ET</span>",HSBC to pay $100 million to settle U.S. probe into currency rigging,"By Jonathan Stempel and Sangameswaran S
(Reuters) -  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA) on Thursday agreed to pay $101.5 million to settle a U.S. criminal probe into the rigging of currency transactions, which has already led the conviction of one of its former bankers.
The payment includes a $63.1 million fine plus $38.4 million in restitution to a corporate client, according to a deferred prosecution agreement filed on Thursday with the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York.
In the settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, HSBC also agreed to bolster its internal controls, and admitted and accepted responsibility for wrongdoing underlying two criminal wire fraud charges filed on Thursday against the bank, according to the agreement.
Deferred prosecution agreements let companies avoid criminal charges so long as they comply with the terms.
Thursday's sanctions came a month after HSBC was freed from a five-year deferred prosecution agreement over its alleged dealings with Mexican drug cartels and other money launderers, and conducting of transactions for customers in countries barred by U.S. sanctions. It was fined $1.92 billion in that case.
In October, a federal jury in Brooklyn convicted Mark Johnson, the former head of HSBC's global foreign exchange cash trading desk, of trading ahead of a $3.5 billion currency transaction by his client  Cairn Energy  Plc (L:CNE).
Johnson has yet to be sentenced. Stuart Scott, HSBC's former head of cash trading for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, was also charged in that case and has fought extradition.
HSBC agreed to pay Cairn $8.08 million under a settlement reached in July, which the Justice Department said it credited as ""full restitution"" to that company.
In a statement on Thursday, HSBC said the $63.1 million fine reflected a 15 percent reduction that took into account the bank's cooperation and ""extensive remediation"" efforts.

The case is U.S. v. HSBC Holdings Plc, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 18-cr-00030.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - China invested $20.9 billion in Brazil in 2017, the most since 2010 as a recession helped push down asset prices and attracted investors, according to Brazil's planning ministry.
The energy, logistics and agriculture sectors drew the most Chinese capital, including investments in Brazil's rich pre-salt oil fields and China's State Power Investment Corp $2.25 billion deal to operate the São Simão hydropower plant.
The 2017 investment figure considers confirmed and announced investments, but does not include marquee deals like Chinese ride-hailing heavyweight Didi Chuxing's purchase of a controlling stake in Brazilian competitor 99, as the private companies did not disclose the size of the deal.
Chinese investment has poured into Brazil in recent years as the world's most populous country looks to secure food for its citizens and other natural resources.
The Brazilian government expects Chinese investment to continue increasing this year as asset prices remain low after the recession that ended last year but economic growth picks up.
""Brazil has much less investment than we need ... we need foreign investors,"" Jorge Arbache, vice planning minister for international affairs, said in an interview.
This year's most wide open elections in decades are unlikely to slow Chinese investment, he said.
""When we talk to the Chinese about it being an election year, a year with a strong political component, the Chinese show each time that they have a longer-term vision for Brazil,"" Arbache said. ""It's unlikely they'll reduce their presence.""
A bilateral fund launched in 2017 to direct $20 billion in financing from state-owned Chinese and Brazilian banks will consider backing for the first batch of project applications at the end of January, an initiative aimed at pushing up Chinese investment in Brazil.
The fund focuses on railways and infrastructure to help bring grains to port as China is the dominant buyer of Brazilian soy, but also considers manufacturing, technology and agricultural pitches.
The first batch of four pitches will be considered at a meeting at the end of January, with the fund having already received 29 proposals, said Arbache, who is executive secretary of the fund. Those approved will be fast-tracked for evaluation by the banks. 
""If at the end of 2018, five projects have been approved, I think it will be very good for the first year,"" Arbache said. ""With the learning process, it's possible that next year there will be even more approvals.

Businesses that see risks from the bills testified at a hearing by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. The bills before the House of Representatives and the Senate would allow the inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, to review minority investments and some intellectual property arrangements.
International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) is worried that it would be forced to ask permission to sell computers or license software overseas, company Vice President Christopher Padilla said.
""This bill would impose a very onerous - and entirely unilateral - set of restrictions on outbound transactions of U.S. companies,"" Padilla said in written testimony.
Scott Kupor, chair of the National Venture Capital Association, said Chinese investments in U.S. funds could make those funds vulnerable to CFIUS reviews if they tried to invest in high-tech companies, even though those investors were given no sensitive information beyond valuation and accounting data.
Republican Senator John Cornyn, the driving force behind the bill, told the committee that he was an ardent supporter of foreign investment but that investment from China needed new, tougher scrutiny because of the threat it poses.
""China uses both legal and illegal means to turn our own technology and know-how against us and erase our national security advantage. One of these tools is investment,"" Cornyn told the committee. 
Former Democratic President Barack Obama had increased scrutiny of Chinese investment, but Republican President Donald Trump's administration has taken a harder line on issues ranging from Beijing's role in restraining North Korea to Chinese efforts to acquire U.S. strategic industries.
The hearing came a day after CFIUS approved a $15 million deal for Beijing-based Naura Microelectronics Equipment Co Ltd to buy Akrion System LLC, a U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment company. [nL1N1PD008]
The approval is one of only a handful granted to Chinese transactions by CFIUS under the Trump administration. The agency has killed a series of high-profile deals since Trump took office.
CFIUS has been particularly tough on deals that involve high tech, such as the top end chip business, or deals that involve sensitive information about Americans. CFIUS recently scuttled Chinese takeovers of the money transfer company MoneyGram and Lattice Semiconductor Corp.

The Senate version of the CFIUS bill has 10 co-sponsors. The House version, which recently picked up Representatives Pete Sessions as a co-sponsor, has 23, according to a congressional aide who spoke privately.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two senators asked the U.S. Transportation Department on Thursday to explain why a ""do not drive"" directive issued last week by  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) is limited to about 2,900 older pickup trucks and if other vehicles are potentially at risk from defective airbag inflators.
The second-largest U.S. automaker said it had confirmed a second death in a 2006 Ford Ranger caused by a faulty  Takata Corp  (PK:TKTDQ) airbag inflator and urged some owners to stop driving immediately until they can get replacement parts. [nL1N1P61GI]
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration should ""swiftly and proactively address the deadly defect in Takata airbags and provide consumers with appropriate notice regarding the defect’s serious potential risk to life,"" wrote Senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey, both Democrats, to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.
Ford said both deaths in 2006 Ranger pickups occurred with inflators built on the same day. In a recall notice filed with NHTSA, Ford said data from the two incidents and an anomalous test all occurred with inflators from the same propellant production lot. The recall applies to Ford Rangers with inflators built on two days in September 2005, the company said. 
A NHTSA spokeswoman declined to immediately comment on the letter. Ford spokeswoman Elizabeth Weigandt said the automaker is ""still investigating the issue with these inflators.""
At least 21 deaths worldwide are linked to the Takata inflators that can rupture and send deadly metal fragments into the driver’s body. The faulty inflators have led to the largest automotive recall in history. The other 19 deaths have occurred in Honda Motor Co (T:7267) vehicles, most of which were in the United States.
Ford issued a separate recall for trucks previously recalled in 2016. Of those 391,000 2004-2006 Ranger vehicles, last week's recall affects 2,900 vehicles in North America, most in the United States. The company is paying to tow vehicles to dealerships for repairs and providing free loaners.
The senators want NHTSA to require the same ""Do Not Drive"" warning for all previously recalled Rangers unless Ford can explain why they do not pose the same heightened risk.
Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261) issued a similar recall and stop drive warning for 160 2006 Mazda B-Series trucks, which were built by Ford.
Takata said in a statement it ""strongly urges vehicle owners to check"" to see if vehicles have been recalled. NHTSA also urged owners to heed Ford's warning.

Takata said it would recall, or expects to recall, about 125 million vehicles from 19 automakers worldwide by 2019, including more than 60 million in the United States.

US macro data
Market participants look ahead to the release of economic data on Friday which could offer the dollar direction after the greenback come under pressure against its rivals amid growing expectations of a US government shutdown.
The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, is expected to show consumer confidence in the economy remained bullish, as economist forecast the index to show a reading of 97 for November compared to 95.9 in the previous month.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.29% to 90.29.
UK Retail Sales 
The sluggish pace of wage growth is expected to have weighed on UK retail sales as economists forecast UK retail sales fell 0.6% in December compared to 1.1% rise in the previous month.
A weaker retail sales print, however, could have a limited impact on sterling amid expectations that the Bank of England may soon raise interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating.
GBP/USD rose 0.38% to $1.3882.
Baker Hughes rig count
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand after data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the US rose by 10 to 752.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street fell on Thursday as losses in industrials and interest-rate sensitive sectors offset marginal gains in tech stocks.
Utilities (SPLRCU) and real estate <.SPLRCR> dipped 0.6 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively. The two sectors, which are considered bond proxies, fell as yields on 10-year Treasury notes hit a 10-month high.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA), a high-flying stock of late, fell 3.1 percent, alongside  General Electric  Co (N:GE), which dropped 3.3 percent. Those two stocks weighed most heavily on the Dow, which sagged just a day after closing above 26,000 for the first time. They also contributed to the 0.6 percent decline in the industrials sector (SPLRCI).
""We'll continue to see a tug-of-war between how fast the economy grows and how fast interest rates rise,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. ""It's likely to lead to more volatility in 2018 than we saw in 2017.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 97.84 points, or 0.37 percent, to 26,017.81, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 4.53 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,798.03 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 2.23 points, or 0.03 percent, to 7,296.05.
Investors are keeping a close eye on corporate earnings reports, given the rise in stock valuations.
""There's a lot of enthusiasm about what tax reform will do, what repatriation will do,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""Today, there's just a bit of consolidation after a strong run-up.""
 Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) wrapped up earnings season for the big U.S. banks with a better-than-expected quarterly profit, driving modest gains in its shares.
Bank of New York Mellon Corp (N:BK) fell 4.4 percent after the custodian bank said it expected to book more in severance costs in 2018. It was the second-biggest decliner on the S&P.
 Alcoa  Corp (N:AA) tumbled 7.0 percent after the aluminum producer's earnings missed analysts' estimates.
 IBM  (NYSE:IBM) and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) shares were lower after the market close on Thursday following their quarterly earnings reports.
The possibility of a government shutdown also loomed, though Warne said she believed it would have more impact on Wall Street's performance if an agreement was not reached by the end of Friday.
The House of Representatives voted on Thursday to advance a bill for debate that would temporarily extend funding. The government is operating on its third temporary funding extension since the 2018 fiscal year began on Oct. 1.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.64-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.74-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 84 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 127 new highs and 25 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.93 billion shares, compared to the 6.3 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday said a settlement agreement that would require General Motors Co (N:GM) to pay $1 billion in stock to car owners suing the company over faulty ignition switches was not enforceable.
Judge Martin Glenn of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York said the agreement that car owners had reached with a trust that holds many GM liabilities from before its 2009 bankruptcy was not valid without signatures.
The claims stem from GM's 2014 recall of 2.6 million vehicles with defective ignition switches, including one linked to 124 deaths.
Lawyers for the car owners and the trust had agreed to a deal in August, but never signed the agreement. The trust walked away several days later, instead accepting GM's offer to help pay for the trust's defense against the car owners' claims.
Glenn blasted the lawyers of the trust in his Thursday order, saying their ""dishonesty, or bad faith, was not lost"" on him. But he said that despite the trust's last-minute turnabout, applicable law did not allow the enforcement of an unexecuted agreement.
Steve Berman, one of the lawyers representing the car owners, in a statement said his side was disappointed but saw a victory in the ruling nevertheless.
""Judge Glenn clearly thought the trustee and (law firm) Gibson Dunn acted in bad faith and we see therefore they both must be removed as trustee,"" Berman said, adding that plaintiffs would take up settlement talks with a new trustee.
GM declined to comment. A lawyer for the trust did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Under the deal the plaintiffs lawyers worked out, GM would have been required to contribute $1 billion in stock to compensate car owners.
The settlement called for the trust to accept $10 billion in claims to resolve about 11.9 million allegations over economic loss and between 400 and 500 personal injury and wrongful death claims.
About 2.4 million claims, involving vehicles sold after GM's bankruptcy, would have remained pending in another court.

GM has already paid roughly $2.5 billion to settle ignition switch-related claims, including $900 million to settle a criminal probe by the U.S. Justice Department.

Prosecutors said the Brazilian unit of BNY Mellon, which managed part of the assets held by the pension fund Postalis, caused losses to the fund.
According to prosecutors, BNY has failed to monitor the risks Postalis was subject to as a result of investments and did not comply with local rules for asset allocation.
A Sao Paulo court now will decide if the bank will face charges. In a statement, Bank of New York Mellon said has not yet received formal communication about the federal prosecutors' action involving the bank.
Postalis is suing the bank. 
""We believe the federal prosecutors' accusations repeat unfounded accusations in those lawsuits,"" the Brazilian unit of BNY Mellon said in a statement. 

""Federal prosecutors suggest fiduciary managers are responsible for investment decisions, which is not true,"" the statement added.

The kingdom will decide where the stock will be traded, not the company, Nasser said Thursday at Aramco headquarters in Dhahran, in eastern Saudi Arabia. One option being considered is selling the shares locally and then overseas, he said. There is no short list of possible exchanges and talks are ongoing to decide on bank roles, he said.
“We are ready and prepared for the IPO in the second half of the year,” Nasser said. “We can list at home and abroad at the same time but it’s not our decision. We are waiting for the government to tell us where to list so that we prepare for the venue.”
Saudi Arabia is seeking to sell as much as 5 percent of Aramco as part of a plan by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to set up the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund and reduce the economy’s reliance on hydrocarbons. The sale could be the largest ever, based on the government’s $2 trillion valuation of the company.
The share sale has drawn interest from international stock exchanges in London, New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Toronto, and even spurred U.S. President Donald Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May to lobby for the listing.
The listing has seen intense competition by banks from New York to Tokyo for a role on the deal. Aramco is set to appoint lenders including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to help manage the sale, people familiar said this month.

515,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 04:31PM ET</span>","BOJ Watchers Don't See Policy Change Soon, Despite Jumpy Market","(Bloomberg) -- Economists who follow the Bank of Japan aren’t buying the idea that the central bank is near the point where it will begin to normalize its ultra-loose monetary policy.
Slightly more than half of those surveyed by Bloomberg this week said they saw no chance of any change to BOJ policy this year. With the vast majority saying Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will be reappointed to another term, continuity is expected, at least through the first half of 2018.
If the BOJ does tighten policy this year, it’s most likely to do it in September or October, according to economists. None envisage any adjustment at the next policy gathering Jan. 22-23.
The survey results indicate BOJ watchers were unmoved by the central bank’s cut to purchases of long-dated bonds last week, a tweak that was seen by many in the currency and debt markets as signaling a first step toward winding down stimulus.
Daiju Aoki of UBS Group AG expects the bank will dispel those expectations next week, maybe in remarks by Kuroda after the policy decision. However, he thinks the bank will raise the 10-year yield target in October, as core inflation should be stable above 1 percent this year.
Reporting by Bloomberg indicates a minority of BOJ policy makers has flagged the need in internal discussions to eventually start discussing policy normalization, but they agree the current stimulus program must continue unchanged for some time, according to people familiar with talks at the central bank.

The economy’s longest stretch of growth in years and a slow but steady rise in inflation has spurred the shift inside the BOJ, and the heightened expectations among investors.
Yet the sticking point to changing policy any time soon is that inflation is still less than half way to the BOJ’s target of ""rising above 2 percent in a stable manner."" And added to that, wage rises and inflation expectations are still well below a level that could be called strong.
Any adjustment to the yield-curve framework will come after the inflation rate is stable above 1 percent, according to  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA economist Ryutaro Kono, a onetime candidate for the BOJ’s board. He doesn’t forecast tightening until next year.

The yield on 10-year Treasuries climbed above 2.6 percent for the first time since March, while the dollar failed to hold the previous day’s gain.
Most major equity gauges were lower, led by weakness in real estate, energy producers and household products makers. The move in Treasuries came as the possibility of a government shutdown after temporary funding runs out on Jan. 19 appeared to increase. In addition, investors speculated that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). may sell some securities to pay the tax bill it will incur from it’s planned cash repatriation. 
“We looked at (the government shutdown) backwards and forwards, and after a while it’s just exhausting,” Chris Harvey, head of equity strategy at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., said on Bloomberg TV. “At the end of the day, I don’t think it really affects the capital markets all that much. We’ve seen it before, not a big deal.”
European stocks advanced but struggled to stay in the green as the euro shrugged off ECB attempts to talk down the currency earlier this week. West Texas oil slipped amid signs that U.S. crude stockpiles continued to shrink. And base metals advanced following strong Chinese growth data.
China’s better-than-expected figures only added to the narrative of synchronized expansion, which -- alongside upbeat profit expectations -- could mean the bull run in stocks will keep going until 2019 or beyond, according to a Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) survey of fund managers.
Elsewhere, gold rose after two days of declines, and bitcoin steadied above $11,000. Emerging-market stocks gained for a fifth straight day.

518,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 04:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boeing willing to preserve Brazil's 'golden share' in Embraer deal,"By Brad Haynes and Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is working to overcome the Brazilian military's objections to its proposed tie-up with  Embraer SA  (SA:EMBR3) with alternatives that would preserve the government's strategic veto rights and ensure safeguards for its defense programs, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The U.S. planemaker was forced back to the drawing board after Brazilian officials balked last week at the idea of turning Embraer into a subsidiary such as those that Boeing operates in Australia and Britain, according to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the negotiations freely.
""Boeing came to buy Embraer, not for a partnership or a joint venture that we are open to, but to take control of the company. This was rejected,"" said one of the sources, a government official. ""It is up to Boeing to come back with a new proposal."" 
Boeing's proposed tie-up with Embraer, the world's third largest planemaker, would give it a leading share of the 70- to 130-seat market and create stiffer competition for the CSeries program designed by Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and run by European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) since last year.
Since the news broke last month that it was in talks with Boeing, Embraer's shares are up 22 percent in New York, where 51 percent of its stock is listed, bringing its market capitalization to $4.6 billion.
Boeing's proposal would value the company at $5 billion to $6 billion, a person familiar with the negotiations said. 
New York-listed shares in Embraer (N:ERJ), which were down 1.6 percent in afternoon trading, erased losses after the Reuters report to gain as much as 0.5 percent.
Boeing's plan has snagged on concerns in Brasilia that Washington would get final say over Brazilian defense programs and use of technology developed in the country, including satellite and air-traffic control systems.
The Brazilian government holds a 'golden share' in Embraer giving it veto power over strategic decisions involving military programs and any change in its controlling interest.
Boeing would be willing to preserve the government's golden share in Embraer, the people familiar with the matter said, but that may not be enough to win support.
Embraer and Boeing declined to comment on the matter.
Representatives for the Defense Ministry, which is coordinating talks with the government, did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
AIR FORCE RESISTANCE
Officials at the Finance Ministry and development bank BNDES, which owns 5 percent of the planemaker, have been supportive of the deal, but military officials are far more skeptical, according to the sources. The BNDES declined comment and the ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
""The Air Force is the main source of resistance,"" said an aide to President Michel Temer. ""The military oppose any split up of Embraer."" The aide said Jungmann has not yet made a recommendation on the Boeing deal to the president.
In an emailed comment, the Air Force said it ""considers Embraer a strategic company that is fundamental for our national sovereignty, so a possible partnership with Boeing should also be studied from this point of view."" 
Air Force commander Lt Brig Nivaldo Luiz Rossato joined Defense Minister Raul Jungmann last week in Brasilia at a meeting with senior Boeing executives including Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith, which failed to sway the Brazilians.
Embraer's special relationship with Brazil's Air Force dates back to its creation in the 1960s as part of a government push to create a domestic aviation industry. The planemaker was opened to private capital in 1994 and fully privatized in 2006, but it still works closely with the Air Force, which is now financing development of the KC-390 military airlifter.
Boeing, which struck a joint sales and services agreement on the KC-390, has underscored to officials that a tie-up would help to market Embraer's defense products globally and bolster Brazil's nascent space program, one person said.
Yet government officials are steering Boeing toward a more narrow joint venture with Embraer focused on commercial aviation — an idea Boeing has dismissed because it would limit long-term flexibility, according to two people familiar with the talks.
Neither the government nor the companies want to entirely split off Embraer's commercial or defense operations, given the integration of their technology and engineering resources, the sources said.
With a presidential election looming in Brazil this year and airlines delaying orders until the shape of the industry is clear, all sides of the negotiations are eager for a resolution. Still, government officials are keen on pressing their hand.

""We think Boeing will end up agreeing to a partnership or a joint venture because they have been weakened by the Airbus-Bombardier deal,"" said the official familiar with the talks. ""They have no other possible partner and need a quick fix.""

Investor uncertainty on whether the government secured enough votes needed to pass a spending bill to avert a government shutdown spooked investors, triggering a retreat in US stocks.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell was preparing contingency plans for the growing possibility of a government shutdown, Politico reported, citing two Republican sources.
Other reports suggested that US lawmakers were preparing a stopgap bill that would keep the government running for a few days.
On the economic data front, investors mulled over mixed bag of economic data showing weakness in the housing market while jobless claims fell to their lowest total since 1973.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims fell 41,000 to a seasonally adjusted 220,000 for the week ended Jan. 12.
The Philadelphia Fed’s manufacturing index fell to a reading of 22.2 from the previous month’s 27.9, while U.S. homebuilding fell 8.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.192 million units in December.
In corporate news, Wal-Mart closed sharply higher after Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating on retailer to a buy from neutral, with a price target of $117, citing the retailer's strong strategic position selling consumables to middle-income consumers.
On the corporate earnings front,  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) reported fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings of $5.18 per share, a penny ahead of the analyst consensus while revenue was $22.5 billion, better than Wall Street expectations of $22.0 billion.

Thadaney's role as president and CEO of capital equity markets is being eliminated, Eccleston said in a statement. Luc Fortin, who heads TMX's derivatives-focused Montreal Exchange, will take on the additional role of global head of trading.
Fortin will lead the derivative, fixed income, private markets and equity trading businesses at TMX, which also owns the Toronto Stock Exchange, the TSX Venture Exchange and TSX Alpha Exchange.
The management changes coincide with a broader restructuring at TMX, according to the Globe and Mail, which first reported Thadaney's departure.
Thadaney said in an email that he agreed to stay on for six weeks at TMX as a special advisor to ensure a smooth transition and that after that, he was looking forward to taking his first break in 25 years to spend more time with his family.
Thadaney declined further comment.
Thadaney joined TMX in 2015 after spending 15 years at Investment Technology Group Inc (N:ITG), where he was CEO of the brokerage's Canadian operations.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (TO:CM) is targeting a valuation of 10 times earnings for the potential listing of its FirstCaribbean business in New York, which would give it a market value of around $1.4 billion, five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters over the past week.
That would represent a 30 percent discount to FirstCaribbean's current market capitalization, based on the value of its thinly traded shares on the Barbados Stock Exchange.
Reuters reported in December that  CIBC , which holds a 91.5 percent stake in FirstCaribbean, was considering listing 20 percent of the business early in 2018, and, subsequently, selling more shares.
CIBC executives are willing to sell at a discount because they are conscious that perceived regulatory risks associated with the Caribbean may turn off some investors while tough economic conditions in Barbados are hampering the bank's potential for growth, two of the sources said. 
The listing is expected to take place in the first half of 2018 and possibly as early as the first quarter, one of the sources said. While CIBC is pushing ahead with the listing plan, it could decide not to proceed if it fails to achieve its targeted valuation, three of the sources said. 
CIBC is working with  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and UBS to advise it on the potential listing, three of the sources said. 
The bank declined to comment on Thursday. Sources declined to be identified as the information is not public.
The bank said in December it was considering a listing of FirstCaribbean in the United States but had yet to make a decision.
FirstCaribbean reported net income of $142 million last year and would be worth just over $1.4 billion if it achieved a valuation of 10 times earnings. That compares with its current market value of $2 billion, according to FirstCaribbean's 2017 annual report, meaning the bank would be selling its 20 percent stake at a $120 million or 30 percent discount.
Two of the sources said CIBC executives first began to consider listing FirstCaribbean in New York after seeing the success of a listing by Bermuda's largest independent lender, Butterfield Bank, in September 2016. 
Butterfield, which is also listed on the Bermuda Stock Exchange, raised $287.5 million through its listing, giving it a market value of $1.3 billion, roughly 10.4 times its earnings that year. 
Shares in Butterfield have since risen by more than 70 percent and the business is now worth more than $2.2 billion, trading at 22 times earnings, with investors attracted by the bank's improving profitability and strong market positions in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.
However, Butterfield does most of its business in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, which have thriving economies, built on providing financial services for international business and luxury facilities for tourists. 

FirstCaribbean also has operations in the Bahamas and Cayman Islands but its biggest market is Barbados, which has experienced an ongoing decline in its credit profile due to a mounting debt problem.

Citing robust German economic growth and record low joblessness, IG Metall union is demanding 6 percent more pay for 3.9 million metals and engineering workers across Germany.
It has also embarked on its first major campaign for shorter working hours in more than three decades, demanding that workers gain the right to reduce their weekly hours to 28 from 35 to care for children or elderly or sick relatives, and then return to full-time employment after two years.
Employers have so far offered a 2 percent pay rise plus a one-off 200-euro ($239) payment in the first quarter. They have rejected demands for a shorter working week unless hours could be increased temporarily so as not to put output at risk.
Three rounds of regional talks have failed to result in agreement.
""A further escalation of the conflict with 24-hour warning strikes can therefore no longer be ruled out,"" said Knut Giesler, head of IG Metall in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state.
He said that employers had not presented an improved pay offer and even refused to talk about working-hour reductions as outlined by the union.
""However, IG Metall will not come out of these talks without presenting solutions for the whole set of demands.""
A fourth round of talks begins in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, home to Daimler and sports car maker Porsche, on Jan. 24. Any deal in Baden-Wuerttemberg would typically be applied in other states as well.
If the two sides remain at loggerheads, IG Metall's leadership may decide at a meeting on Jan. 26 to call for 24-hour walkouts or ballot the union's members for extended strikes.
More than half a million workers at hundreds of metals and engineering companies have taken part in industrial action this month to support IG Metall's wage claim.
On Thursday, as talks were held in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's industrial heartland, some 4,000 workers at Daimler near Stuttgart downed their tools, and over 1,000 employees of Bosch in the Bavarian town of Ansbach took action.
Forklift truck maker Jungheinrich (DE:JUNG_p), Thyssenkrupp's System Engineering and elevator businesses and premium carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG) were also among the nearly 200 companies affected.
Such industrial action is common in Germany during sector-wide pay negotiations, and similar walkouts took place in 2016 and 2015.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares notched up modest gains on Thursday, led higher by a fresh rise for so-called cyclical stocks while company updates and ratings changes from brokers spurred moves among individual names.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 0.2 percent at its close, while the UK's FTSE (FTSE) declined 0.3 percent. 
Switzerland's  Geberit  (S:GEBN) posted the best performance among European stocks, with a 6.5 percent rise after reporting a 3.5 percent increase in 2017 sales.
In France,  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) was among the top performers on the CAC 40 (FCHI) with a 3 percent rise, with traders saying stronger-than-expected fourth quarter sales from the supermarket chain had offset the negative impact of a new profit forecast cut.
In Frankfurt, German chipmaker Infineon (DE:IFXGn) led the DAX (GDAXI) higher, adding 5.6 percent after getting a rating upgrade from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), while SocGen began its coverage of the stock with a ""buy"" rating. 
The tech sector (SX8P) was the best performer throughout Europe, up 1 percent with STMicro (MI:STM) leading Milan's bourse with a 3.8 percent rise. Strong results by ASML (AS:ASML) had lifted investors' spirits on the industry during the previous session. 
Tech, along with financials and materials, added the most points to the STOXX, as investors continued to rotate into stocks which are more dependent on economic growth.
""We see sustained above-trend economic expansion and a steady earnings outlook supporting cyclicals,"" Richard Turnill, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, said in a note.
In the UK,  Whitbread  (L:WTB) rose 3.5 percent despite reporting tough consumer market conditions after sources told Reuters that activist investor Sachem Head was asking Britain's biggest hotel and coffee shop operator to consider splitting off the Costa Coffee chain. 
""The pressure on the UK high street may indeed make this the time for Whitbread to at least look at its options. Break up rumors could support the share price even in the face of weaker LFL (like-for-like) sales growth,"" said ETX Capital senior market analyst Neil Wilson.
Primark owner Associated British Foods (L:ABF) was down 3.6 percent after saying that revenues and profits at its sugar business would fall by more than previously expected due to lower European Union sugar prices. 

In Belgium,  Ablynx  (BR:ABLX) rose 1.7 percent after its largest shareholder said Denmark's  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) would need to raise its offer if it wanted to buy the Belgian biotech group.

John Cryan, speaking at a reception in Berlin, also warned the political vacuum that had developed in Germany was one of several ""major risks"" that the economy is currently facing.
Germany's largest bank recently said it would report its third annual loss in as many years, raising questions about the bank's direction and Cryan's leadership. [L8N1P31QP]
""Now we are again being asked whether our business model can actually work,"" Cryan said. ""I can assure you we're convinced that we are on the right track. We shall remain resolute.""
Cryan said that the bank had always maintained that the reorganization, set out in 2015, would take several years, adding the bank was now embarking on a third phase of its restructuring - a focus on its clients.
That follows an effort last year to integrate its Postbank retail bank with its in-house consumer bank in an effort to cut costs. And in 2015, Cryan began working on internal controls and reduced legal risks. 
Turning to politics, Cryan said that Germany was coping relatively well after its September election but said he hoped a stable government would be formed soon.

""Sooner or later, however, too many political question marks will prompt companies to postpone their long-term investments,"" he said. ""That's why the success of the exploratory talks between the prospective coalition partners last week constitutes a good and important signal.""

578,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",Families can pool resources for disabled in ABLE accounts,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - TJ Rodriguez is 36 and cannot walk without a walker, but horse riding helps him build his strength. 
So when his birthdays come around, family members help fund his riding lessons, along with other enormous disability-related costs that are a part of the daily routine.
The lessons “are expensive and not covered by Medicaid,” said his brother, Chris Rodriguez, director of public policy for the National Disability Institute. The family pools its money in what is known as an ABLE Account, which is a tax-advantaged investment account designed for individuals with disabilities. 
Although seriously disabled people get government benefits through Medicaid and Social Security disability programs, they often incur thousands of dollars in expenses that the programs do not cover. Families might be funding the travel to and from doctor appointments. People with autism or Down syndrome may need special training so they can work. 
“Just by living with a disability, people have expenses others don’t have,” said Chris Rodriguez.  “They may have to modify their home so they can live there, or they may need to replace a broken wheelchair or a hearing aid.”
Coming up with the out-of-pocket cash is difficult, in part, because the government programs have strict limits on how many assets beneficiaries can have. An individual is not allowed to have more than $2,000 in a checking or saving account at any one time. 
ABLE accounts, allowed since 2014, act like Roth IRAs or 529 college savings plans, in that people contribute after-tax money and do not pay taxes on growth if they withdraw it to cover disability-related expenses. There is no age-limit on using the funds, so they can be a valuable tool for long-term planning. But to qualify for an account, an individual has to experience a disability prior to their 26th birthday.
And now families who saved money in a 529 college savings plan can convert that fund into an ABLE. That can be a relief for parents who started saving for a baby and then later discovered autism or another disability that loaded the family with expenses.
Parents, or family members together, can put a total of $15,000 into an ABLE each year. To make sure that SSI and Medicaid coverage is not cut back, families must observe limits on the accounts. Only up to $100,000 in assets held in plans are specifically excluded from the income and asset tests used to determine eligibility.  
These accounts help alleviate some worries for parents who fret about how their adult children will handle huge costs after parents die, said Rob Wrubel, a Colorado Springs, Colorado financial planner and author of “Financial Freedom for Special Needs Families.”
“When parents come into my office, they are extremely nervous about the future,” said Wrubel. “Will my child have a roof over their head, will they have friends, who will be there to replace the feeding tube?  The concerns never go away.”
Wrubel often advises parents to set up a special needs trust to provide for children after parents die, and he is starting to suggest ABLE accounts too that can give disabled adults control over some money. 
With ABLE Accounts so new, only about 15,000 have been opened and the average contains less than $3,400, said Rodriguez. Yet, he estimates about 7 million people may be eligible to have an account.
The ABLE National Resource Center provides a tool (http://ablenrc.org/state_compare/) to search states and compare plans. Although all states have 529 plans, not all offer ABLE Accounts and those that do differ on fees, investment choices and state tax rules. Yet, if your state does not offer the accounts you can use another state’s.
Still, be aware, notes attorney James Canup, of Richmond, Virginia, that if there is money left in an ABLE account after a disabled person dies, governments can take it to cover some of the individual’s Medicaid costs.

“Some states do not claw back the funds, but the federal government says they can,” said Canup.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Messaging application WhatsApp said on Thursday that it would begin allowing business accounts for the first time, a step that brings the free service closer to a plan that would make money for its corporate parent,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB). 
Some businesses already use WhatsApp, with 1.3 billion users, to answer inquires from customers. Business accounts will allow them to set up automatic greetings, see statistics about their messaging and set up a profile page with hours of operation and other information, WhatsApp said. 
The accounts are aimed at businesses that receive a high volume of WhatsApp messages and need help keeping up, WhatsApp Chief Operating Officer Matt Idema said. 
""What we saw was a need for businesses to have more efficient tools,"" Idema said in an interview. 
Idema, who was a Facebook executive before he joined WhatsApp last year, said WhatsApp intends to charge businesses in some form in the future, but he said it was too soon to discuss when that would happen or what the future business services would look like. 
Facebook bought WhatsApp, a pun on the phrase ""What's up?"", in 2014 for $19 billion, attracted by the size of its user base. WhatsApp used to charge a $1 annual subscription fee but dropped it in 2016, leaving the service without a source of revenue. 
Options for future revenue are narrow because WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg have ruled out advertising on WhatsApp, a factor that adds to the service's popularity. 
WhatsApp competes in a crowded market that also includes Facebook's Messenger application, Tencent Holdings Ltd's (HK:0700) WeChat and numerous other messaging services. 
WhatsApp said its business accounts would be available beginning on Thursday through a WhatsApp Business application in the Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Play store in Britain, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico and the United States. 
The company said it plans to roll out the accounts to other countries in the coming weeks, and eventually to have a version for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple's (O:AAPL) announcement that it will pay $38 billion in U.S. tax on its overseas cash will not reduce the $16 billion tax bill the company owes Ireland following a European Union ruling, the EU's executive said on Thursday.
""Nothing has changed,"" a spokesman for the European Commission said, with regards to its 2016 ruling that Apple received illegal state aid in Ireland through sweetheart tax deals with the government.
At the time of the ruling, the Commission said the amount Apple would have to pay to Ireland could be reduced if other countries found the company should have recorded its sales there instead of Ireland, or if its European subsidiaries were to pay more tax to the U.S. parent company.
However, Apple's announcement on Wednesday that it would pay about $38 billion in one-time U.S. tax payments on its overseas cash do not fit either of these criteria.
""The Commission's 2016 state aid decision found that, over many years, tax rulings issued by Ireland had allowed Apple to pay less tax on profits recorded in Ireland than other companies subject to (the) same national taxation laws. This gave Apple an illegal advantage in breach of EU state aid rules, which must now be recovered by Ireland - nothing has changed in that regard,"" said the Commission spokesman.
The Commission ordered Apple to pay Ireland up to 13 billion euros ($16 billion) in August 2016 and has since taken Dublin to court over its delays in recovering the money.
A spokesman for the Irish finance ministry also said it had no indication the U.S. tax payment would affect its recovery of the money.
""Ireland has an obligation to recover (money) that is binding under EU law. Changes to U.S. legislation do not alter such an obligation,"" the spokesman said.
Apple on Wednesday unveiled a $30 billion U.S. investment plan and said it would pay about $38 billion in foreign cash taxes.

It is unclear whether Apple will be able to offset the Irish tax bill against the 15.5 percent U.S. tax on offshore tax piles.

Qualcomm said the European Union clearance, along with approval earlier on Thursday from the Korea Fair Trade Commission, meant it now had eight of nine approvals, with just China remaining. It said it was optimistic that would come soon.
Qualcomm, which supplies chips to Android smartphone makers and Apple (O:AAPL), is set to become the leading supplier to the fast-growing automotive chip market following the deal, the largest-ever in the semiconductor industry
The European Commission, which oversees competition policy in the 28-nation EU, said in a statement on Thursday it had identified a number of competition concerns that had led to an in-depth investigation, but was now satisfied with the deal.
""We use our smartphones for many different things and now also more and more as mobile wallets, to pay for public transport or make other secure payments,"" said European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager
""With this decision, we ensure that Qualcomm's takeover of NXP will not prevent consumers from continuing to enjoy the benefits of these innovative technologies at competitive prices.""
The EU's concerns had included the interoperability of the merged group's chips with rivals' products and significant intellectual property related to NFC (near-field communication) technology.
Qualcomm has committed to offer licenses to NXP's MIFARE technology and trademarks for an eight-year period on terms at least as advantageous as today. MIFARE is a technology used as a ticketing/fare collection platform.
Qualcomm will ensure that for eight years it will provide the same level of interoperability between its chip sets and corresponding products of other companies.
Qualcomm will also not acquire NXP's standard essential NFC patents as well as some of NXP's non-standard essential NFC patents. These would be transferred to a third party that would be bound to grant worldwide royalty-free licenses to them for three years.
Of NXP's non-standard essential NFC patents that Qualcomm did acquire, it would not enforce its rights against other companies and grant royalty-free licenses to these patents.

""The Commission concluded that the proposed transaction, as modified by the commitments, would no longer raise competition concerns. The Commission's decision is conditional upon full compliance with the commitments,"" the Commission said in a statement.

600,By Business Insider,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 09:48AM ET</span>","These 14 stocks will see sales skyrocket in 2018, Goldman Sachs says"," With the broader stock market expected to rise this year, it can be difficult to identify the companies set to leave their peers in the dust. But there are ways to sift through the noise to find the winners — assuming you know where to look.
One way to do this is to identify the companies most likely to see revenue expansion. And lucky for you, Goldman Sachs is here to help.
The firm ranked stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 index by expected 2018 sales growth, providing a handy guide to the companies the bank sees as most likely to enjoy revenue-driven gains.
It's important to note, however, that revenue is just one piece of the puzzle. Further down the income statement, earnings growth is another crucial piece. In fact, Goldman has a separate analysis ranking stocks by profit expansion, which you can learn more about here. Used in tandem, the two studies are intended to make it easier for investors to make good trading decisions. 
Without further ado, here are the 14 stocks Goldman says will offer the biggest sales growth this year (note: the firm's analysis excludes stocks from the financial, utilities, and real estate sectors):
Ticker: PCLN
Industry: Consumer discretionary
Goldman Sachs rating: Neutral
2018 expected sales growth: 14%

NANTES, France (Reuters) - Emirates announced a deal for up to 36 Airbus (PA:AIR) A380 aircraft on Thursday worth as much as $16 billion at list prices, saving the world's biggest passenger jet from death row and securing its future for at least another decade.
The European planemaker said Emirates [EMIRA.UL] had placed a provisional order for 20 of the double-decker superjumbos, with an option for 16 more. Deliveries are due to start in 2020.
The agreement hands a lifeline to the slow-selling aircraft, in service for just 10 years, and rescues one of Europe's most visible industrial symbols overseas.
""The A380 is good to go,"" Emirates President Tim Clark told Reuters. 
Airbus shares rose more than 3 percent after the announcement to touch a record high of 92.56 euros. 
The deal ends months of tough-fought negotiations. Talks between Airbus and Emirates about a fresh A380 order broke down at the last minute at the Dubai Airshow in November, when the Gulf carrier placed an order for 40 smaller Boeing (N:BA) 787s.
Earlier this week, Airbus confirmed a Reuters report that the A380's survival lay with Emirates, saying it would have ""no choice"" but to close production if the Emirates deal fell through despite interest in smaller orders from others.
Emirates and Airbus both said the deal would bring stability to the A380 production line.
The deal marks a final flourish for veteran Airbus sales chief John Leahy, one week before he retires after more than 20 years as the driving force of European aircraft exports.
""Emirates is committing to the program for the long term and plans to take six airplanes a year for 9-10 years,"" the 67-year-old New Yorker told Reuters from onboard an A380 on his way back to France from Dubai.
Calling time on the A380 would not have caused major financial damage to Airbus, but would have been ""emotionally expensive,"" a company source said.
SUPERJUMBO VS TWIN-ENGINES
Leahy said he was now convinced the A380 would be built well into the 2030s.
Sales of the A380 have fallen short of expectation and rival Boeing says the future lies with smaller, twin-engine models like its 777 and Dreamliner that offer more flexibility and are at least as efficient. 
But Airbus believes its 544-seat superjumbo still has a role as air traffic rises and airports become ever more congested. 
The Emirates deal also means a potential revival for one of the world’s largest aircraft engines, co-produced by  General Electric  (N:GE) and Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX). Their Engine Alliance venture powers most Emirates A380s, but it has lost out to competitor Rolls-Royce (L:RR) on the latest deliveries.
Emirates has, however, appeared unhappy with the performance of the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines. It has invited the two engine makers to compete for the new A380 order, two industry sources said.
Rolls-Royce had no immediate comment. Emirates said it had yet to make a decision on engine supplier.
Emirates' commitment to take six A380s a year for a decade fills a gap in planned production as Airbus touts business from other airlines. 
""That provides a base allowing the program to continue so that Airbus can sell two or three planes here, four there,"" Leahy said.
Analysts say Airbus is unlikely to break even on the A380 at such production levels, but that the losses will not make a big impact on the company's accounts, which are dominated by sales of smaller jets worth tens of billions of dollars a year.

Emirates is by far the largest operator of the A380 with 101 in service today and a backlog of 41 superjumbos on order before Thursday's announcement. The last order by another airline for the A380 was in 2015 when Japan's ANA booked three.

621,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Oil specialist Westbeck to launch electric vehicle hedge fund,"By Maiya Keidan and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil-focused hedge fund firm Westbeck Capital will enter new territory next month with an equities fund designed to tap into growing excitement over electric vehicles, according to a draft investor presentation seen by Reuters.
Westbeck's Electric Metals Fund will aim ""to capitalize on the electric revolution"", the presentation said, investing in 30-50 stocks, many in metals hotspots Australia and Canada.
The fund will bet on both rising and falling share prices of companies focused on the raw materials needed for the development of electric vehicles, such as batteries and supporting infrastructure.
London-based Westbeck will launch the fund next month with the aim of raising $100 million this year before capping the fund at $200 million, a source close to the firm said.
The fund is believed to be one of the first -- if not the first -- to focus solely on electric vehicles, two lawyers and a hedge fund banker told Reuters.
Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) have said they expect electric vehicles to capture about 12 percent of the global light vehicles market by 2025.
While a push by global automakers to develop more electric vehicles is generating increasing investment interest in battery minerals, much uncertainty remains. Battery raw material lithium, for example, is not rare and there could be surplus supply after a rash of new mining projects come on stream.
Technology is also changing rapidly as car manufacturers look for the cheapest solutions, which could mean different resources are required.
Of the major miners,  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) provides the biggest exposure to battery minerals and its share price outperformed last year. BHP, meanwhile, has said it will steer clear of minerals needed only for batteries and focus on those with more certain demand.
London-based Westbeck's new fund, which will invest in smaller and less-liquid companies, will run alongside its Westbeck Energy Opportunity Fund.
The oil-focused Energy Opportunity Fund is up 20 percent in the first two weeks of January after losing 14 percent in 2017, before fees, the source said.
Westbeck was set up in 2016 by former CQS Asset Management portfolio manager Will Smith, Jean-Louis Le Mee, who was previously at oil hedge fund firm BlueGold Capital, and Jon Mellberg, former head of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.
Smith and Le Mee will run the new fund with trained physicist Jon Hykawy, who recently joined as head of research and partner.
The fund will charge a 1.5 percent performance fee and 15 percent management fee, the presentation showed.

623,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>","Lexus, Infiniti luxury car brands test ways to fight Tesla, German rivals","By Naomi Tajitsu
DETROIT (Reuters) - Japanese luxury auto brands Lexus and Infiniti are using the Detroit auto show to test new ways to regain momentum against Germany's prestige automakers and Silicon Valley's Tesla Inc (O:TSLA).
Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) Lexus brand unveiled at Detroit its ""LF-1 Limitless"" concept SUV model, signaling that Lexus may start to focus more on SUVs than its traditional large sedans. 
The LF-1 proposed a blend of an aggressive, sleek profile with a system called ""Chauffeur mode"" which allows the driver to take hands off the wheel and let the SUV handle most of the driving. 
The LF-1's also previews a futuristic navigation technology that anticipates where the driver is going based on driving habits and history, and provides hotel recommendations or other concierge services.
“We don’t want to be the ‘race car’ brand; we don’t want to be the ‘quiet ride’ brand. We want to be the brand which is emotionally connected with the customer,"" said Cooper Ericksen, vice president of U.S. marketing for Lexus.
The Japanese luxury brands are fighting to gain ground in the U.S. luxury market as Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) Audi brand and Mercedes-Benz have expanded sales, and Tesla has provided a fresh alternative to the established brands.
Last year the Lexus brand suffered a 7.6 percent slide in U.S. sales last year. At Honda Motor Co Ltd's (T:7267) Acura luxury brand, 2017 sales fell 3.9 percent from 2016. Nissan Motor Co Ltd's (T:7201) Infiniti pushed up sales by 11.3 percent, mainly by selling almost twice as many sport utility vehicles as cars. However, Infiniti's total 2017 sales of 153,415 vehicles put it behind the leading Germany luxury car brands, as well as Acura, Lexus and General Motors Co's (N:GM) Cadillac brand. 
Lexus, Infiniti and Acura launched in the U.S. market in the late 1980s and took advantage of quality problems at Audi and a lack of innovation at the then-leading luxury brands in the market, General Motors Co's (N:GM) Cadillac and Ford Motor Co's (N:F) Lincoln brand.
Now, the structure of the U.S. luxury vehicle market has changed. Four brands -  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz, BMW AG (DE:BMWG), Volkswagen's Audi brand and Lexus dominate sales in the U.S. luxury market. 
Tesla, meanwhile, has gathered more than 400,000 orders for its Model 3 sedan, which is just starting to reach customers as the automaker tries to iron out production problems.
In Detroit, Infiniti showed a future sedan powered by a high efficiency gasoline engine. While the prototype is not electric, its exterior might appeal to customers of the Tesla Model S.

""We don't look at Tesla and try to do the same idea of luxury, but there has been a natural evolution of luxury,"" Infiniti's executive design director Karim Habib said at the North American International Auto Show earlier this week.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) was 0.2 percent higher after rising as much as 0.4 percent to a fresh record peak.
South Korea's KOSPI (KS11) was effectively flat. Japan's Nikkei (N225) reached its highest level since late 1991 earlier before ending down 0.4 percent.
Shanghai shares (SSEC) rose 0.9 percent, buoyed by data showing China's economy grew 6.8 percent in the October-December quarter from a year earlier, the same rate as the previous quarter and slightly better than most economists had expected.
U.S. stocks jumped on Wednesday and the Dow (DJI) closed above 26,000 for the first time as investors' expectations for higher earnings lifted stocks across sectors. (N)
Optimism over prospects for sustained strong global growth and improved corporate earnings have helped share markets rally at the start of 2018.
""Events related to North Korea pose potential risks, but there are very few factors holding equities back at the moment,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""And bullish U.S. stocks, higher Treasury yields and signs of the euro's recent surge running its course are all dollar-supportive factors,"" Ishikawa said.

The euro was traded at $1.2203 , slipping from a three-year peak above $1.2300 after some ECB officials voiced worries about the currency's strength.

The dollar was flat at 111.270 yen  after surging 0.75 percent overnight, when it bounced from a four-month low of 110.190.
The two-year Treasury yield (US2YT=RR) hovered near a nine-year high of 2.051 percent reached on Wednesday on expectations the Federal Reserve will continue to tighten monetary policy this year.

646,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 10:35PM ET</span>","Peugeot CEO outlines ambitious plan to re-enter U.S., go electric","By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said on Wednesday the French automaker is using the know-how of former Opel engineers acquired from General Motors Co (N:GM) to develop vehicles to re-enter the U.S. market, and said Peugeot will offer electrification as an option on all its vehicles by 2025.
Tavares used a speech at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit, an event packed with auto industry executives, to outline an ambitious agenda for pushing his company into the front row of the industry's technology race. He plans to use the 2017 acquisition of GM's European Opel and Vauxhall operations as the springboard for global expansion.
Tavares said in his speech that by 2025 ""the PSA Group will be 100 percent electrified,"" which can mean all electric or hybrid. Tavares and a company spokesman clarified that electrification will be an option on all the automaker's vehicles by that time. Global automakers have announced $90 billion in investments to electrify future vehicles to comply with regulations to curb carbon dioxide emissions.
By 2030, Tavares said, 80 percent of the automaker's vehicles will offer the ability to pilot themselves under limited conditions, and 10 percent will be capable of autonomous driving.
Peugeot exited the U.S. market more than 20 years ago, run out by Japanese competition and shifting customer tastes. Tavares, the former Renault-Nissan executive who took over the company in 2014, has previously outlined plans to slowly re-enter the U.S. market, starting with ride services.
Last year, Tavares acquired GM's European Opel operation after GM decided to divest the money-losing operation.
Tavares on Wednesday outlined a three-step process for re-establishing Peugeot in the U.S. market, the world's second largest, and compete on GM's home turf.
Peugeot already is beginning to offer ride services in the United States through its Free2Move brand, using other companies' cars. 
""Mobility…is at the heart of our strategic plan,"" Tavares said.
Next, Tavares said, will come ride services using Peugeot cars. The third step will be to sell Peugeot vehicles in the United States designed by Opel engineers who worked for GM.
Opel engineers can ""ensure the future products for this market will be fully U.S. compliant"" not just from a regulatory standpoint, but also with consumer tastes, Tavares said.
Peugeot has ""people working on cars now"" for the U.S. market, Tavares said.
In addition, Tavares said Peugeot will announce soon a deal to establish additional manufacturing capacity in Southeast Asia. He did not elaborate during a question and answer session.
Tavares also sidestepped a question from Crain Communications group publisher KC Crain about whether he would be interested in acquiring brands from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. Tavares joked that Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne should call him, but then said that he has enough on his plate ""for the time being.""

647,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 09:18PM ET</span>","Apple plans new U.S. campus, to pay $38 billion in foreign cash taxes","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) will open a new campus as part of a five-year, $30 billion U.S. investment plan and will make about $38 billion in one-time tax payments on its overseas cash, one of the largest corporate spending plans announced since the passage of a tax cut signed by U.S. President Donald Trump.
The company has been under increasing pressure to make U.S. investments since the 2016 presidential campaign, when Trump targeted the iPhone maker for making products in Asian factories. 
While Apple has announced no plans to change that practice and experts say it would be economically impractical to make iPhones in the United States, the company has begun to emphasize its U.S. economic impact, from developers who sell software on its App Store to the tens of billions of dollars per year it spends with U.S. suppliers.
Between the spending plan, hiring 20,000 people, tax payments and business with U.S.-based suppliers, Apple on Wednesday estimated it would spend $350 billion in the United States over the next five years.
It did not, however, say how much of the plan was new or how much of its $252.3 billion in cash abroad - the largest of any U.S. corporation - it would bring home. In addition to the $38 billion in taxes it must pay, Apple has run up $97 billion in U.S.-issued debt to pay for previous share buybacks and dividends. 
Some investors said the U.S. investments would give the company room to make more stock buybacks or pay dividends without criticism. Apple shares on Wednesday closed up 1.7 percent to $179.10.
Walter Piecyk, managing director for TMT Research at BTIG Research, said he could not yet tell whether the U.S. expansion was an increase from a previous plan or meant investment abroad was being refocused in the United States. Reuters Breakingviews estimated that Apple could have increased U.S. headcount by 24,000 in the last five years.
Trump described the move by Apple as a victory for his efforts.
""I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States. Great to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
Asked in an interview with ABC News whether the job creation announcements were directly related to the Republican tax plan, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook gave a measured response.
""Let me be clear: There are large parts of this that are a result of the tax reform, and there's large parts of this we would have done in any situation,"" Cook said in the interview.
APPLE SERVICES PUSH
About a third of Apple's new spending will be on data centers to house its iCloud, App Store and Apple Music services, a sign of the rising importance of subscription services to a company known for its computers and gadgets. Apple has data centers in seven states.
The announced U.S spending would be a significant part of Apple's overall capital expenditures. Globally, the company spent $14.9 billion in 2017 and expects to spend $16 billion in 2018, figures that include both U.S.-based investments in data centers and other projects and Asian investments in tooling for its contract manufacturers.
If Apple's overall capital expenditures continue to expand at the same rate expected this year, the $30 billion investment in the United States could represent about a third of its capital expenditures over the next five years.
The announced tax payment was roughly in line with expectations, said Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross. The tax bill requires companies to pay a one-time 15.5 percent tax on foreign-held earnings whether they intend to bring them back to the United States or not.
Apple had set aside $36.3 billion in anticipation of tax payments on its foreign cash, meaning the payment would not represent a major impact on its cash flow this quarter. 
James Cordwell of Atlantic Equities said Apple's U.S. investment plan could make it easier for the company to give more cash to shareholders. 
""Being seen to just hand the cash back to shareholders could spark some political sensitivities,"" and the spending announcement could be part of Apple's efforts to manage this issue, Cordwell said.
Apple also said it would boost its advanced manufacturing fund, used to provide capital and support to suppliers such as  Finisar Corp  (O:FNSR) and  Corning Inc  (N:GLW), from $1 billion to $5 billion. Apple said it planned to spend $55 billion with U.S.-based suppliers in 2018, up from $50 billion last year.
AMAZON VS APPLE
Apple joins Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) in scouting for a location for a new campus. Amazon finished taking applications from cities in October for its second headquarters.
Amazon set off a scramble between cities across the nation to host the headquarters, and Apple's announcement stirred broad interest. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told reporters on Wednesday, ""We're going to go compete and we're going to put our best foot forward"" to compete for an Apple campus. A Philadelphia Department of Commerce spokeswoman said the city would submit a proposal if Apple opened the process for bids.
Apple has not said whether it had settled on a new campus location yet, and it did not make any commitments on the size of new spending or hiring specific to the campus. It did say it would initially house technical support for customers and would announce the location later this year.
The facility would be in addition to its ""spaceship"" Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, California; a campus in Austin, Texas, that houses customer service agents and some manufacturing; and an Elk Grove, California, unit with several thousand customer service agents and iPhones refurbishing technicians.

Apple also has built its own data centers in North Carolina, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona and a recently announced project in Iowa, and leases data center space in other states.

(Reuters) - Data center computers with Intel Corp's (O:INTC) newer chips might reboot more often than normal because of problems with the patches issued to fix the so-called Spectre and Meltdown security flaws, the company said on Wednesday.
Intel confirmed that patches for the security flaws can cause higher-than-expected reboot rates in Ivy Bridge, Sandy Bridge, Skylake and Kaby Lake processors, said Navin Shenoy, general manager of the data center group, in a statement on Intel’s website.
The Kaby Lake chips are the company's most recent offering.
Last week, Intel said it had received reports that its security patches were causing problems in systems with its older Broadwell and Haswell chips.
Shenoy said that Intel had issued patches for 90 percent of Intel chips released in the past five years but that the company had ""more work to do."" He also said the company would send out initial versions of fixes for the buggy patches to customers by next week.
""We have reproduced these issues internally and are making progress toward identifying the root cause,"" Shenoy wrote. 
On Jan. 3 Intel confirmed that the Spectre and Meltdown flaws affected its chips, potentially letting hackers steal information believed to be very secure.
The Spectre flaw affected nearly every modern computing device, including those with chips from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD) and ARM Holdings (LON:ARM). 
Intel on Wednesday also quantified how much of a performance hit the patches cause for data center customers. For common tasks such as running website servers, the patches caused a 2 percent slowdown, Intel said. Another test that simulated online transactions at a stock brokerage showed a 4 percent slowdown, the company said.

For some types for work involving servers that store large amounts of data and try to retrieve it quickly, the company said the slowdown could be as severe as 18 percent to 25 percent. However, it wasn't immediately clear how common those situations were.

649,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 09:00PM ET</span>",U.S. clears Chinese acquisition in rare move,"By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Beijing-based Naura Microelectronics Equipment Co Ltd has completed a deal to buy U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment company Akrion Systems LLC, in a rare instance of the U.S. government approving such an acquisition, attorneys for Naura said on Wednesday. 
The deal, worth just $15 million, is small by dealmaking standards, yet it comes as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews deals for potential national security risks, has made it more difficult for Chinese companies to buy U.S. assets. 
CFIUS’ stance has toughened as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to put pressure on China to help tackle North Korea's nuclear ambitions and be more accommodative on trade and foreignexchange issues. Unfilled political vacancies at several government departments and agencies have also made it more difficult for CFIUS to approve deals. “As far as we are aware, this is the first Chinese acquisition of a U.S. company to be approved by CFIUS under the Trump administration,"" said Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP partner Fang Xue, one of the deal lawyers representing Naura. 
CFIUS has been traditionally wary of semiconductor deals with Chinese entities, because it is concerned about the transfer of potentially sensitive technology. 
Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC, a U.S.-based private equity firm funded by the Chinese government, saw its $1.3 billion acquisition of U.S. chip maker Lattice Semiconductor Corp (O:LSCC) collapse last year after it was blocked by CFIUS, a rejection subsequently upheld by the White House. 
But Akrion, based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is a supplier of equipment to manufacturers of semiconductors and technology companies. It provides machinery that prepares the chips for use. CFIUS’ approval of the Akrion deal bodes well for Xcerra Corp (O:XCRA), a U.S. semiconductor testing company whose deal to be acquired for $580 million by Unic Capital Management, a subsidiary of China's Sino IC Capital and the Hubei Xinyan Equity Investment Partnership, is also under CFIUS review. Like Akrion, Xcerra does not manufacture any chips itself. 
The most high-profile Chinese acquisition of a U.S. company to be shot down by CFIUS since Trump’s inauguration a year ago was Ant Financial's acquisition of U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc (O:MGI), which was terminated earlier this month. 
Xue said the Akrion deal was approved by CFIUS during the standard 75-day review period, even as other deals have had to refile their applications to secure extensions. 
Akrion faces financial difficulties because it lacked scale, and the deal with Naura will boost its ability to compete, Xue added. 
Naura, a semiconductor manufacturing equipment company, is a subsidiary of Naura Technology Group Co (SZ:002371), a Chinese state-backed company.

650,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 08:43PM ET</span>","Trump says solar tariff decision coming soon, stakes huge for industry","By Nichola Groom and Steve Holland
LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would announce a decision soon on whether to slap tariffs on imported solar panels, and quipped that when countries dump subsidized panels in the United States, “Everybody goes out of business.”
The solar industry is anxiously awaiting the decision, which will have wide-reaching implications for the sector. Domestic panel producers opposed to cheap imports would benefit from a tariff. But installers that have relied on the lower-cost hardware for their recent breakneck growth would suffer.
In an interview with Reuters, Trump declined to say how he would land on the case - which was triggered last year by a domestic manufacturer's trade grievance - but complained about the effect of imports on U.S. panel makers.
""You know, they dump ‘em - government-subsidized, lots of things happening - they dump the panels, then everybody goes out of business,"" he said. 
Asked when the decision would be announced, he said: ""Pretty soon. Honestly, pretty soon.""
According to a process governed by the International Trade Commission, Trump has until Jan. 26 to make his decision.
Bankrupt domestic panel producer Suniva triggered Trump's consideration of tariffs last year when it filed a trade case arguing it could not compete with cheap imports. About 95 percent of the solar cells and panels sold in the United States are made abroad, with most coming from China, Malaysia and the Philippines, according to SPV Market Research.
Suniva was later joined in the case by the U.S. arm of German manufacturer SolarWorld AG (F:SWVKk).
In October, Trump received a range of options from members of the U.S. International Trade Commission to protect domestic producers, but he has broad leeway to come up with his own alternative or do nothing at all. 
Suniva is seeking strong measures.
""A robust tariff will allow Suniva to restart its factories and rehire employees,"" Suniva spokesman Mark Paustenbach said.
JOBS AT STAKE
Only about 14 percent of the solar industry's 260,000 jobs are in manufacturing. The trade case has fueled anxiety among installers that make up most of the rest of the industry and rely on low-priced imports.
The installation sector's trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, has campaigned against tariffs, saying they would drive up the price of solar and cripple demand, eliminating tens of thousands of jobs and ultimately hurting the manufacturers that sought them in the first place.
""I'm staying optimistic that the business aspect of this will come through in the end,"" said George Hershman, president of Swinerton Renewable Energy, a privately held firm that constructs large-scale solar projects.
Hershman said Swinerton employed 2,000 full-time employees and up to 8,000 temporary workers, but added several of its projects had been placed on hold pending Trump's decision.
""If you add 50 percent to the cost of the job, it may not be economic,"" Hershman said. 
Solaria Corp, a U.S. company that produces panels in both California and South Korea, also opposes tariffs, according to Chief Executive Suvi Sharma. The company said a recent $23 million financing round took months longer than it should have partly because of investor jitters about the case.

""The best thing would be to have this whole thing go away,"" Sharma said.

651,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 08:30PM ET</span>","Puerto Rico, FEMA still at odds on terms of government loan","By Nick Brown
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Puerto Rico official on Wednesday said the U.S. federal government was dragging its feet in letting the beleaguered U.S. territory draw on an emergency loan in the aftermath of September's Hurricane Maria, threatening essential services. 
Gerardo Portela, director of Puerto Rico's financial authority AAFAF, said in a statement that U.S. officials should hasten to complete ongoing talks with Puerto Rico's government on the terms and conditions for access to billions of dollars in federal disaster relief.
Public agencies in Puerto Rico, like power utility PREPA and sewer authority PRASA, ""face severe liquidity problems that threaten essential services ... if immediate action is not taken,"" Portela said in the statement in Spanish.
The comments highlight mounting tension between locals who feel Puerto Rico is not getting the attention it needs from federal authorities, and authorities concerned that the island may have more financial resources than it is letting on.
Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico's worst disaster in 90 years, hit the island on Sept. 20 last year, killing dozens and knocking out power to all of its 3.4 million U.S. citizens. The storm occurred in the wake of the island government's bankruptcy which left it facing $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt.
In October, U.S. lawmakers approved a $4.9 billion loan to hurricane-ravaged governments in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Texas and Florida, money meant to help maintain basic services, but Puerto Rico has yet to see its share. 
Portela's comments followed a January 9th letter from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which said Puerto Rico could not begin drawing on the loan because its cash balances are too high. 
FEMA's letter noted Puerto Rico has about $1.7 billion in liquidity, despite island leaders having forecast it to run out of cash by October 31, and that FEMA was negotiating with Puerto Rico on the timing and terms of the loan. 
""Funds will be provided ... when the commonwealth's central cash balance decreases to a certain level,"" FEMA said.
Meanwhile, a federally-appointed board overseeing Puerto Rico's finances announced Wednesday it would meet on Friday to discuss an ongoing probe into reports that Puerto Rico's government has some $6.9 billion in cash at hundreds of bank accounts.
Such reports are fueling a perception among some authorities and financial stakeholders that Puerto Rico is overstating its economic plight.
For many in Puerto Rico, where the poverty rate hovers near 50 percent and public pensions are nearly insolvent, FEMA's letter adds to a perception that the island is not getting fair treatment.
The Service Employees International Union, which represents thousands of Puerto Rican workers, called FEMA's reasoning ""unconscionable,"" saying in a statement on Wednesday that ""Puerto Rican working families continue to be treated as second-class citizens by [U.S. President Donald Trump's] Administration and Congress."" 

The US Virgin Islands, also a deeply-indebted U.S. territory, has begun drawing on its nearly $300 million share of the emergency loan, but has faced strict repayment terms not traditionally imposed on municipalities on the mainland, namely a requirement to pledge senior liens as collateral. Puerto Rico could face similar terms.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 08:22PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Japan in driver's seat for Indian bullet train deals,"By Neha Dasgupta, Rupam Jain and Yuka Obayashi
NEW DELHI/TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese steel and engineering companies are in the driver's seat to bag major supply contracts for a $17 billion Indian bullet train, several sources said, undermining a key component of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's economic policy - a push to 'Make in India'.
Japan is funding most of the project, and Japanese companies are likely to supply at least 70 percent of the core components of the rail line, said five sources in New Delhi with direct knowledge of the matter.
A spokesman for Modi's office declined comment. 
A Japanese transport ministry official involved in the project said the two countries were still working out a strategy for the supply of key components, and would unveil a plan for procurements around July. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. 
The September 2017 agreement between Japan and India for the bullet train project included two clauses - the promotion of 'Make in India' and 'Transfer of Technology' - through which New Delhi had hoped to set up manufacturing facilities in the country, generate jobs and get a toehold in Japanese technology. 
Modi faces a general election in 2019 and is under pressure to provide more jobs to millions of unemployed in India. Critics also say the bullet train is wasteful and that the money could be better used elsewhere.
""The Japanese have reservations on certain issues because they have a concern that there is a difference in the culture and systems of Japan from the culture and systems in India,"" said Achal Khare, the managing director of National High Speed Rail Corp Ltd (NHSRCL), the agency tasked to execute the bullet train project.
""The work culture is very different,"" he told Reuters. 
Khare did not elaborate but two Indian railways officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said their Japanese counterparts had raised questions about efficiency in Indian companies and their ability to meet timelines.
The World Bank currently ranks India 100th out of 190 nations on the ease of doing business, giving it relatively low marks for starting a business, enforcing contracts and dealing with construction permits.
Tomoyuki Nakano, director for international engineering affairs in the railway bureau at Japan's transport ministry, said the issue was that Indian companies had no experience or technologies specializing in high-speed railway systems at present.
""I don't think Japanese are concerned about a difference in the work culture,"" Nakano said. He and other Japanese officials said efforts were continuing to fulfill the 'Make in India' component of the agreement by promoting collaborations between companies from the two countries.
Still, several Indian officials said it was by and large accepted that Indian companies would not have a major part to play in the bullet train project. 
Japan will get major leeway because the bullet train is largely funded by a 50-year loan provided by its government, said a close aide of Modi, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""At this stage to expect Indian companies to have a bigger share in manufacturing appears to be a little difficult,"" said a senior official at the Indian government's policy think-tank, NITI Aayog, who is involved in the negotiations. 
Modi's flagship 'Make in India' initiative aims to lift the share of manufacturing in India's $2 trillion economy to 25 percent and create 100 million jobs by 2022. However, midway through Modi's five-year term, manufacturing was still at 17 percent of India's GDP in the 2016/17 financial year from 15 percent previously.
ONLY ONE JOINT VENTURE
Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe laid the foundation stone for India's first bullet train in September last year. It will link Mumbai with Ahmedabad, the largest commercial city in Modi's home state Gujarat.
Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp (T:5401), Japan's biggest steelmaker, and other companies like JFE Holdings Inc (T:5411), Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd (T:7012), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (T:7011), Toshiba Corp (T:6502) and Hitachi Ltd (T:6501) are likely to bid for various contracts, said three senior Indian government officials directly involved in the project. 
Nippon Steel said it would not comment on specific projects.
JFE, Hitachi and Toshiba said they were interested in the project but had not finalised plans, including any possibilities of joint ventures with Indian firms.
Mitsubishi Heavy said it had not decided if it wanted to be involved.
The sole collaboration aimed at the bullet train project is between Kawasaki Heavy Industries and India's  Bharat Heavy Electricals  Ltd (NS:BHEL), which aims to win carriage orders.
Japanese government officials have asked for more bullet train corridors in India before transferring technology, three senior Indian officials said. 
But New Delhi is unlikely to announce any new projects until the final cost and commercial feasibility of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad link is clear, the officials said. 
""It's like a chicken and egg situation on technology. The Japanese want an economy of scale and business but the Indian view is that India is a big market that once this market is explored the business will automatically be generated,"" said Khare from NHSRCL.
MISSED OPPORTUNITY 
New Delhi has tried to help Indian steel companies grab a slice of the pie. 
The Indian government last year mediated negotiations between Nippon Steel and India's Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (NS:JNSP) to set up a joint venture to manufacture rails, but the talks fell through after the Japanese major raised quality concerns, three sources in New Delhi said.
State-owned  Steel Authority of India  (NS:SAIL) (SAIL), which for decades has been the main supplier of rails to Indian Railways, was also overlooked by Japanese companies due to quality concerns, the sources said.
Nippon Steel declined comment and while Jindal and SAIL did not reply to e-mails seeking comment. 
Left with little choice, Indian firms will now largely provide raw materials like cement and supply manpower for the assembly of rails, the sources said. 
India's  UltraTech Cement  Ltd (NS:ULTC), Larsen & Toubro Ltd (NS:LART), Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (NS:BHEL) and  Ambuja Cements  Ltd (NS:ABUJ) are among those in the race for the supply of construction materials and power, the two Indian railways officials said. 

These companies did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

653,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 07:50PM ET</span>",Big portion of future GM electric vehicles for China market: executive,"By Paul Lienert and Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's China unit will sell a ""substantial portion"" of the automaker's future electric vehicles, GM China President Matt Tsien said on Wednesday.
In a briefing at GM headquarters, Tsien said, ""China is at the heart of our electrification strategy.""
Tsien did not say which GM brands would sell electric vehicles in China. 
But Cadillac President Johan de Nysschen told Reuters at the Detroit auto show the luxury brand ""will play a central role"" in GM's electrification strategy, including China.
Cadillac will be ""the technology spearhead for General Motors,"" de Nysschen said, adding the brand will be ""at the forefront"" of rolling out new electric vehicles in the United States and China. 
The broader electrification strategy, detailed in mid-November by Chief Executive Mary Barra, includes the introduction in 2021 of a new dedicated electric vehicle architecture and an advanced battery system, which will support the development of at least 20 new models in the United States and China. 
The automaker has promised investors it will produce profitable electric vehicles by 2021 and that the 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles will join its global lineup by 2023.
Barra said GM aims to sell 1 million pure electric vehicles worldwide by 2026. 
Cadillac's de Nysschen said the new electric vehicle architecture ""will feature prominently"" in U.S. and Chinese plans.
GM has a long way to go to reach Barra's lofty target. 
Last year, GM China and local partners sold 4 million vehicles - about 40 percent of the automaker's global tally - but only 11,000 were pure electric vehicles, sold under GM's local Baojun brand.
The automaker sold about 50,000 pure electric vehicles worldwide in 2017, most of them the Chevrolet Bolt EV, or roughly 0.5 percent of its global sales.
Tsien said plug-in electric vehicles, including hybrids, are expected to account for about 20 percent of the industry's projected 35 million vehicle sales in China in 2025.
Next year, a new Chinese quota system will require that 8 percent of an automaker's sales be plug-in electrics. 
Tsien said GM expected to meet that quota, which would require selling more than 300,000 battery electrics and plug-in hybrids in 2019 or purchasing offsetting credits from other manufacturers.

The automaker's new electric vehicle will support models for ""multiple brands in multiple segments,"" Tsien said, and the flexible battery system will enable GM to offer a variety of driving ranges in those models.

(Reuters) - Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Corp's quarterly profit was nearly chopped in half by tax-related charges but the lender's management promised the new U.S. tax system would eventually benefit shareholders. 
The tax overhaul, signed by U.S. President Donald Trump late in December, is taking a chunk out of Wall Street profits this quarter as lenders swallow one-time charges on overseas earnings and account for tax benefits that are now less valuable because of the lower corporate rate.
Leaving aside the tax hit, which Bank of America announced late last year, profit topped analyst expectations. 
The bank's shares closed 0.2 percent lower at $31.18. They had run up nearly 16 percent in the past three months, leading gains in a sector that rose broadly in anticipation of the tax bill. 
Investors expect the eventual windfall from lower tax rates to be passed on through higher dividends and more share buybacks. They are also watching for knock-on effects of the overhaul like higher borrowing, trading and deal activity that would boost the bank's bottom line.
Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said some tax savings would be funneled into technology investments but the bulk of the windfall would be returned to investors. 
""Most of the benefits will fall to the bottom line and be used to return to shareholders,"" he said. 
The lender expects its effective tax rate this year to be around 20 percent, 9 percentage points lower than 2017. 
The second-largest U.S. bank by assets booked a $2.9 billion charge related to the tax overhaul, which dragged its net income down to $2.37 billion. 
Excluding that charge, it earned $5.3 billion, or 47 cents per share. According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, excluding the tax charge and another item, the company earned 48 cents per share, topping analysts' estimate of 44 cents.
The bank trades at a lower valuation than some rivals and its quarterly return on equity was 7.8 percent, down from 8.1 percent at the end of the third quarter and below a 10 percent theoretical cost of capital. 
THE DEFINITION OF RISK
Dogged for years by litigation and penalties stemming from the financial crisis, Bank of America has been put on a more stable footing by Moynihan’s years-long effort to cut costs and focus the bank’s sprawling operations.
The lender's large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities make it especially well placed to benefit from interest rate rises. Its net interest income rose more than 11 percent to $11.46 billion, helped by the three Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2017.
Revenue rose at three of its four businesses, pushing total revenue up about 2 percent to $20.69 billion. Non-interest expenses fell 1 percent. 
Bank of America's trading revenue was down compared with a year earlier when investors actively changed positions around the U.S. elections, but the 13 percent drop in bond trading was shallower than falls at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which is heavily reliant on trading, reported a 50 percent slide in trading fixed income, commodities and currencies on Wednesday.
Bank of America's quarterly results were also hit by a $292 million charge for single-name loss, which a source familiar with the situation said was related to troubled South African furniture retailer Steinhoff International.
The company's woes have rippled through Wall Street with Citigroup and JPMorgan booking losses of $130 million and $143 million, respectively, and more pain is expected when European banks start reporting results in the coming weeks.

""We are very comfortable with the risk we take. Once in a while something doesn't turn out the way you want because that's what the definition of risk is,"" said Moynihan.

656,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>","Cboe gets nod to challenge NYSE, Nasdaq for closing stock orders","By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday approved a proposal from No. 2 U.S. stock exchange operator Cboe Global Markets Inc to compete for end-of-day orders for stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Inc.
The approval breaks what has effectively been a duopoly on the stock market close, one of the busiest and most lucrative trading periods of the day, by the Intercontinental Exchange Inc-owned NYSE and Nasdaq.
""We are encouraged that the SEC staff approved the proposal,"" Bryan Harkins, Cboe's head of U.S. equities and global FX, said in a statement. ""We look forward to bringing more competition to the market as a result."" 
Cboe announced in May it planned to offer brokers an order type that would give them the same official closing auction prices from Nasdaq and the NYSE for stocks listed on those exchanges, but with lower execution fees. The exchange operator said the move was in response to frustration voiced by industry participants over rising closing auction prices.
Closing auctions attract trillions of dollars' worth of trades as fund managers generally price their assets to the closing prices of listing exchanges and execute most of their orders at that time. 
The average daily volume in closing auctions has risen more than 70 percent, to almost 350 million shares, in the past five years, while fees have increased from 16 percent to 60 percent at the NYSE and Nasdaq respectively, Cboe has said.
Cboe lists its parent company's stock, but otherwise does not have a corporate listings program. 
NYSE and Nasdaq have said diverting trades away from closing auctions would fragment the process, creating volatility and resulting in less accurate pricing for securities. 
Cboe said the price discovery process would be unaffected because the exchange would only offer ""market on close"" (MOC) orders, which are instructions to execute trades at the final closing auction price, and not ""limit on close"" orders, which specify price limits. 
On Jan. 8 NYSE lowered its fees for MOC orders. The move will ""encourage higher volumes of MOC orders at the close, which should result in a higher level of orders matched and greater liquidity for all exchange auction participants,"" NYSE said in a SEC filing. 
The Cboe Market Close could be in place within a year, Cboe President Chris Concannon told reporters in New York earlier on Wednesday.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Overall U.S. new vehicle sales could fall for the second year in a row in 2018, but Detroit's automakers are betting they can sell more high-margin pickup trucks and sport utilities to prop up profits.
At this week's Detroit auto show, auto industry executives and economists predicted that overall car and light truck sales will fall to about 16.8 million vehicles this year from about 17.2 million vehicles in 2017. Rising interest rates, reduced access to easy credit and an influx of millions of nearly new vehicles that are cheaper than new models and are expected to undercut new sales. 
Standing against those forces are a wall of trucks and SUVs, including several new models unveiled at the Detroit auto show, that automakers said offer the hope of strong profits even if total vehicle sales decline.
Investors on Wednesday bid down shares of  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) by 7 percent after it forecast lower profits for 2018. General Motors Co (N:GM) shares slipped less than 1 percent after it forecast flat core earnings, excluding investments in autonomous vehicles.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (N:FCAU) shares, however, rose nearly 2 percent. Fiat Chrysler's North American product lineup represents an almost pure bet on demand for big pickups, Jeep brand SUVs and retro muscle cars like the Dodge Challenger that are enjoying a renaissance thanks to cheap gas. 
""We shifted most of our resources to the production of SUVs and pickup trucks,"" FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne said this week. ""It's a recognition of the fact that it's become the fast-growing segment in the United States."" 
GM shares are up 18 percent over the past year, and on Tuesday the company stressed to analysts the profit potential of its new pickup truck lineup.
Last year 63.2 percent of U.S. sales were light trucks, up from 48.8 percent in 2012. Overall new car sales fell around 2 percent in 2017 as passenger car sales fell 10.9 percent but light truck sales rose 4.3 percent. 
""Americans love their trucks,"" Mike Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation Inc (N:AN), the largest U.S. auto retailing chain, said at an Automotive News conference in Detroit on Tuesday. ""Gasoline will have to get to $6 a gallon to get them back out of their trucks."" 
To capitalize on that, General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler all rolled out revamped pickup truck models at the show while taking shots at their rivals' products and talking up their trucks' profitability.

Federal tax cuts could help Detroit's pickup truck franchises, analysts at Cox Automotive said.

Those counties also will fare well from the recent U.S. tax overhaul, chief economist Jonathan Smoke said.

660,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 07:00PM ET</span>",Major U.S. railroads warn Trump against derailing NAFTA,"By Eric M. Johnson
LOMBARD, Ill. (Reuters) - Major U.S. railroads on Wednesday warned President Donald Trump of the potential financial and political consequences of scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement and urged U.S., Mexican, and Canadian officials to find ways to modernize the accord.
Trump has threatened to withdraw from the agreement, which is heavily utilized by U.S. and Canadian railroads hauling freight such as cars, beer, and grain across the three countries.
Some 35 percent of annual U.S. rail industry revenue is directly linked to international trade, according to the Association of American Railroads lobby group.
Kansas City Southern (N:KSU) Chief Executive Officer Pat Ottensmeyer told Reuters at a rail shippers' conference that scrapping NAFTA would put supply chains, jobs and consumers at risk and could come back to haunt Trump politically.
Cross-border rail trade between the United States and Mexico is dominated by Kansas City Southern. More than a quarter of its revenue comes from U.S.-Mexico shipments, and grain from American farms forms an important portion of cross-border carloads.
Ottensmeyer said many farmers who supported Trump in the 2016 election support NAFTA and are becoming critical of Trump's threats to scrap the accord. 
""You won't talk to a single farmer who is against NAFTA,"" Ottensmeyer said. ""They did not vote for Donald Trump because of NAFTA, they decided to set that aside. I think (Trump) is beginning to understand that, the more time he spends in rural America.""
""Be careful what you do here,"" he said.
Washington has taken a hard line in talks, saying that concessions are the only way for Canada and Mexico to keep the deal. Talks appear to be stalled heading into the penultimate round of negotiations scheduled to begin next week in Montreal.
""It's certainly out of date; it's old, so fix the things that need to be fixed but to wholesale walk away from it doesn't make a lot of sense to us,""  Union Pacific  Corp (N:UNP) Chief Marketing Officer Beth Whited told Reuters.
No. 1 U.S. railroad Union Pacific serves all the main U.S.-Mexico rail gateways. 
For example, Union Pacific hauls ""a ton of Corona"" beer and bottles and recycled glass to and from a Constellation Brands Inc (N:STZ) brewery in Mexico and made ""a huge investment in Texas to support that, creating American jobs.""
""NAFTA is a job creator,"" Whited said. ""Union Pacific jobs are American jobs.""

No. 3 railroad  Norfolk Southern  Corp (N:NSC) declined to comment.

The reduction will increase earnings for the fourth quarter and year ending Dec. 31, 2017, but will not have any impact on the 2017 statement of cash flows, Verizon said in a filing. 
Verizon estimates that the impact of the law to earnings per share for the year ended Dec. 31 is about $4.10.
Analysts and investors had expected that the law, which slashes the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, to boost corporate earnings. Telecom companies stand to benefit because they are primarily domestic businesses.
Verizon also said it expects a separate accounting change implemented on Jan. 1, 2018 to increase pre-tax retained earnings by $4 billion to $4.6 billion.

The Fed said its most recent 2016 inspection of the Taiwanese bank revealed ""significant deficiencies"" at its U.S. banking operations risk management and compliance controls relating to anti-money laundering and bank secrecy laws. The bank operates branches in New York, Illinois and California. 

New York state authorities in 2016 slapped Mega International Commercial Bank with a $180 million fine for violations that included lax attention to risk exposure in Panama, the first time in a decade that a Taiwan-based financial institution had been penalized by U.S. authorities.

663,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 06:39PM ET</span>",Alcoa misses estimate as Brazil drought hits production,"(Reuters) - Aluminum producer  Alcoa  Corp's (N:AA) profit and revenue both missed market estimates for the fourth quarter as a drought in Brazil hit bauxite production and higher power prices in Spain boosted expenses, the company said on Wednesday.
Alcoa's shares, which closed up 1.3 percent in the regular session, fell nearly 6 percent in after-hours trading.
The company said the drought in Brazil led to an acute water shortage that not only hit its bauxite business, but also affected profits from its hydropower system in the country.
Bauxite is usually covered by an several layers of rock and clay, which must be removed in crushing or washing plants before being processed.
""We have lower-than-expected global alumina segments due to weather delays and difficulties with shipload,"" Chief Executive Roy Harvey said on a call with analysts, noting the results were about $50 million lower than the company's expectations.
So, while Alcoa's alumina shipments increased in the quarter, the production issues meant it could not take full advantage of improved alumina and aluminum prices.
The company's revenue rose 25.1 percent to $3.17 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31.
Its net loss widened to $196 million from $125 million a year earlier, including due to a $22 million charge related to the newly enacted U.S tax reforms.
On an adjusted basis, Alcoa earned $1.04 per share.
Analysts on average were expecting the New-York-based company to post a profit of $1.22 per share and revenue of $3.29 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Alcoa said it does not expect the U.S tax reforms to have a material impact on 2018 results and forecast a non-operating income charge of about $20 million in the current quarter due to a new plan to lower its pension obligations by $35 million.
The company said it would freeze salaried defined benefit pension plans of U.S. and Canadian employees, effective Jan, 1, 2021, with about 800 affected employees transitioned to country-specific defined contribution plans.

""... to reduce our liabilities, change is necessary,"" Harvey said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on Wednesday and the Dow closed above 26,000 for the first time as investors' expectations for higher earnings lifted stocks across sectors.
The Dow also hit an all-time high in intraday trading. It had briefly reached the 26,000 milestone on Tuesday, in its fastest 1,000-point rise to date, before dropping back below that threshold.
The S&P 500 posted a record closing high. It has gained 4.8 percent this year, posting only two sessions of losses. More than three-quarters of the 36 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have topped earnings estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Outlooks for future earnings are rosy as well, due to the lower corporate tax rates passed in December.

Several companies, however, saw their shares trade lower after underwhelming earnings reports and forecasts.
Banks seesawed as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) reported disappointing results. The S&P 500 banks subsector fell in earlier intraday trading but ended Wednesday up 0.6 percent.
Bank of America was down 0.2 percent after a $2.9 billion one-time tax charge nearly halved its reported profit.
Goldman Sachs fell 1.9 percent after posting its first quarterly loss in six years on tax-related charges and a sharp drop in trading revenue.
Ford tumbled 7.0 percent after the automaker reported full-year profit below estimates and provided a downbeat forecast.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) slipped 4.7 percent, extending losses from Tuesday, when it announced more than $11 billion in charges.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.85-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.83-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

672,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",ECB's Nouy 'inflexible' in meeting with Italian banks: sources,"MILAN (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's Chief Supervisor Daniele Nouy was ""inflexible"" at a meeting with Italian lenders on Wednesday where topics such as bad loans were discussed, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Italian banks piled up soured loans in a deep recession and are struggling to get rid of them as a clogged judicial system hampers recoveries and sales can only be carried out at a loss. 
The Bank of Italy spoke of a ""very constructive and useful exchange of views"" in a statement issued after the meetings that Nouy held with domestic supervisors, top executives from Italy's bigger banks and the national banking association.
New rules the ECB proposed late last year on new loans turning sour and the supervisory approach to banks' handling of existing bad debts were discussed, the Bank of Italy said.
One of the sources said Nouy did not indicate when the new rules - whose introduction has been delayed due to a backlash led by Italy - would become effective. 
She also refrained from providing targets for reducing bad loans. But the sources said she reiterated the ECB's position in a way that left banks with very little room for maneuver.
It was not possible to reach the ECB for comment.
At around 16 percent of total lending, Italy's impaired loan burden is around three times the European average of 5.5 percent.
Bankers have said the ECB wants larger lenders to cut soured loans below 10 percent of total lending. Despite the delay in introducing the new rules, the regulator has kept the pressure on individual lenders, they say.
 Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), a top Italian bank, last week announced a shift in strategy over bad debts, in a move that sources have said was driven by the ECB's proposed new rules and the regulator's stance.
After betting in recent years on recovering bad loans internally to avoid costly large-scale sales, Intesa said it was now considering selling a chunk of its bad loans and spinning off part of its debt collection business. 
CEO Carlo Messina said on Wednesday the bank agreed with the need to speed up the reduction of bad debts.
Other banks are also considering selling their debt collection units together with some of their bad debts, industry and financial sources have said.

Analysts expect lenders to book more writedowns of bad debts, taking advantage of the introduction in January of a new accounting rule which temporarily allows them to avoid booking the loss - though it would still have an impact on capital.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - World shares advanced on Wednesday to touch a record as Wall Street rallied on a rebound in technology shares while economic reports supported the dollar and optimism over global growth.
In the U.S. equity market, tech shares, up 1.58 percent led the advance after a modest pullback on Tuesday.  IBM  Corp (N:IBM), which gained 2.9 percent to $168.65, helped pace gains after  Barclays  (LON:BARC) upgraded the stock two notches to ""overweight"" ahead of its quarterly results on Thursday.
Notable laggards were  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), down 1.86 percent and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), off 0.19 percent, after their quarterly results included charges related to the new federal tax law.
U.S. corporate earnings are expected to be solid, with growth for the quarter forecast at 12.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data through Wednesday morning. Of the 36 companies that have reported earnings, 77.8 percent have topped expectations. 
""There is a virtuous cycle here. If these companies are doing better and we have this cohort of millennials getting ready to become adults, have kids and buy houses, we have some growth here,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. 
""Industrial production was very strong and the Beige Book reinforced everything we have been hearing.""

The dollar was higher against a basket of major currencies in a choppy session, buoyed by the stronger-than-forecast data on domestic industrial output in December that supported the notion of a steady U.S. economic expansion.
The dollar briefly moved lower after a tweet by a Politico reporter that U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he would not vote for a Republican ""continuing resolution"" stopgap bill to fund the government temporarily.
But the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report on the economy, which said the U.S. economy and inflation expanded at a modest-to-moderate pace from late November through the end of 2017, while wages continued to push higher, helped the dollar regain its footing. 
Equities in Europe closed lower, as declines in luxury fashion brand  Burberry  Group Plc (L:BRBY) and educational publishing company  Pearson  Plc (L:PSON) weighed, following sales and earnings updates.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index (FTEU3) lost 0.07 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.46 percent.
The dollar index (DXY) rose 0.37 percent, with the euro  down 0.42 percent to $1.2208.
Oil prices were higher ahead of the release of U.S. petroleum data that was expected to show a ninth straight weekly drawdown in crude inventories.
U.S. crude  settled up 0.38 percent at $63.97 per barrel and Brent  closed at $69.38, up 0.33 percent.
World shares have rallied at the start of 2018 on optimism for continued strong global growth and improving corporate earnings, with many analysts expecting the bull run in equities to lengthen.
Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) last fell 8/32 in price to yield 2.572 percent, from 2.544 percent late on Tuesday.

683,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 04:12PM ET</span>","Wall Street Resumes Rally, Dow Closes Above 26,000 For First Time Ever","Investing.com – Wall Street rebounded on Wednesday, reversing losses sustained a day earlier, closing at all-time record highs as investors cheered bullish earnings from corporates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher at 26,115.65. The S&P 500 closed 0.94% higher, while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 7298.28, down 1.03%.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) reported earnings that topped expectations on both the top and bottom lines, while Goldman Sachs posted its first quarterly loss since 2011.
Bullish earnings offset investor concerns over the prospect of a government shutdown amid reports that Democrats and Republicans may not be able to reach a deal on a crucial immigration bill by Friday. The immigration bill has been the main sticking point preventing progress on a spending bill, which needs to be passed by end of Friday to avoid a government shutdown.
A mixed bag of economic reports on industrial production and manufacturing, meanwhile, did little to dampen investor expectations for solid economic growth amid the release of the Fed’s beige book showing that the outlook on economic growth for 2018 remained “optimistic.”
Industrial output surged 0.9% in December last month, beating expectations for a 0.4% rise, while manufacturing output rose just 0.1% in December, falling short of expectations for a 0.3% rise.
In corporate news, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it would ramp up capital expenditure and vowed to create 20,000 new jobs as it seeks to take advantage of recent tax reform measures, one of which requires companies to pay a one-time tax on foreign-held earnings whether they intend to bring them back to the United States or not.

684,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 04:05PM ET</span>",Shorts on top as January CBOE bitcoin futures near settlement,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The slide in bitcoin's price in recent weeks has favored bearish bets on the cryptocurrency, and with January futures expiring on Wednesday, speculators who had loaded up on bearish positions in front-month contracts will reap big gains.
Bitcoin futures started trading on Cboe Global Markets' (O:CBOE) Cboe Futures Exchange on Dec. 10, and since then the cryptocurrency has lost about 27 percent of its value on the Gemini Exchange.
January contracts , which started trading at $15,000, have fallen about 36 percent since then to $9,650. The futures are based on the auction price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars on the Gemini Exchange, which is owned and operated by virtual currency entrepreneurs and brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.
So far, speculative positioning on the Cboe bitcoin contracts has leaned to the short side. To be short a futures contract means traders believe the underlying security will fall in value.
Speculators' net short position on bitcoin Cboe futures rose to 1,907 contracts in the week to Jan. 9, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday. 
The bulk of volume and open interest had been centered in the front month, suggesting much of that short position is likewise concentrated in January.
To be sure, some front-month positions may have since been closed out or rolled forward into future months. 
""Someone who shorted bitcoin futures last week would potentially be very happy this week,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief options strategist at Interactive Brokers Group Inc in Greenwich, Connecticut.
The approaching settlement could add an extra dose of volatility to the cryptocurrency's already wild gyrations. 
""Large equity indices can often show volatility around expirations and those are highly liquid instruments traded on highly regulated exchanges,"" said Sosnick.

""While bitcoin futures are traded on highly regulated exchanges the underlying product is not. Considering the volatility we have seen over the past couple of days it makes me wonder what we are going to see going into the settlement,"" he said.

685,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 03:32PM ET</span>",Japanese Go Bond-Shopping in Europe as Treasuries Get Costlier,"(Bloomberg) -- Rising currency hedging costs and a surge in short-term U.S. bond yields are driving Japan’s money managers away from Treasuries and making them more inclined to buy debt in Europe.
Japanese investors’ appetite for debt offered by countries such as France and Germany is expected to increase, with a booming European economy -- the region’s central bank estimates the fastest expansion in 10 years in 2017 -- adding to the allure. At the same time, dollar-yen hedging costs, calculated using currency forwards, are near the highest level since the 2008 global financial crisis.
“There is no doubt the attractiveness of U.S. bonds is fading,” said Kensuke Niihara, Tokyo-based head of investment solutions group and currency at State Street Global Advisors, which oversaw $2.6 trillion globally as of end-Sept. ""Considering the short- and long-term bond yield differentials, which is very important for Japanese investors, countries like the U.K. and France would look attractive, especially France.""
The U.S. curve has been flattening, with the two-year yield having surged about 70 basis points since the end of August. The 10-year yield is up 43 basis points in the period. The U.S. dollar has had a shaky start to 2018, and fell to a four-month low against the yen this week.
It currently costs 2.05 percent to hedge three-month positions for the dollar-yen, compared with last year’s low of 1.41 percent in February. In comparison, the cost to hedge similar euro-yen positions has fallen below zero, indicating Japanese investors can pick up extra returns on top of yields.
Europe bonds will be attractive for investors who hedge their currency exposures as hedging costs have risen in the U.S., said Eiichiro Miura, general manager of the fixed income investment department in Tokyo at Nissay Asset Management Corp.
‘Very Convincing’
While the Federal Reserve plans to raise interest rates three times this year, investors are finding that it may be more profitable to hold other currencies than the dollar. The European Central Bank is sounding more hawkish than expected, and some money managers are betting that the Bank of Japan may be near to adjusting its policy in the months to come.
""The economic outlook of Europe looks very convincing,"" said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro strategist of Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co.’s economic research department. ""Some political risks remain but low hedge costs and solid economic conditions will prompt Japanese investors to direct their funds into countries that offer higher yields.""
Some of that is happening already. Japanese investors were net buyers of French sovereign bonds for a third straight month in November, data from the Ministry of Finance showed last week. They also purchased German debt for a second straight month, while selling U.S. securities.
Some investors from Japan have also been buying Swedish krona-denominated bonds since last year, said Hideaki Kuriki, chief fund manager at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management Co. Investors, including financial institutions, are interested in putting money into bonds of countries carrying high credit ratings such as the U.K., France and Sweden, he said.
They are reluctant to invest in Spain and Italy despite relatively higher yields, because of the credit risks involved, he said.
Japanese investors could continue to seek “more opportunity” in European countries that “offer a premium when they hedge their currency exposures,” Kuriki said."

Deason also asked the company's board in a letter dated Jan. 17 to hire new and independent advisers to evaluate the photocopier company's strategic options with Fuji.

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Xerox, under pressure to find new growth sources amid shrinking demand for its printer and copier business, was in talks on a deal with the Japanese camera maker that could include a change in control of Xerox.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Financial crime fighters at the U.S. Treasury are ""aggressively"" pursuing virtual currency platforms that lack strong internal safeguards against money laundering, a top official told a Senate panel on Wednesday.
With more criminals using the emerging asset class to store and transmit their ill-gotten gains, Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) will pursue malfeasant virtual currency platforms even if they are located overseas, Sigal Mandelker, the U.S. Treasury Department's under secretary for terrorism and financial crimes, told the Senate Banking Committee. 
U.S.-based platforms for bitcoin and other virtual currencies are required to comply with antimoney laundering (AML) rules including filing suspicious activity reports, with around 100 such platforms registered with FinCEN. But many other countries have no such requirements. 
""The real vulnerability that we all have to address is that while we have regulatory authorities in place here in the United States and we do enforce those ... we need other countries to do the same,"" Mandelker told the committee's hearing on U.S. antimoney laundering laws.
Mandelker said the U.S. government would also encourage other countries to introduce stricter regulation of virtual currencies, which law enforcement officials say are attractive to criminals making illegal transactions because they can be used anonymously. 
In July, the Treasury moved to shut down the website of Russia's BTC-e exchange, one of the world’s largest bitcoin platforms, and ordered it to pay a $110 million fine for allegedly facilitating transactions involving ransomware, computer hacking, and drug trafficking, among other crimes. 
A U.S. jury also indicted a Russian man in July in connection with the alleged crimes perpetrated by the platform. 
Regulators and governments around the world are still debating how to address risks posed by cryptocurrencies. In recent weeks, South Korea, Japan and China have all made noises about a regulatory crackdown while officials in France vowed to investigate the emerging asset class.
Senators on Wednesday expressed concerns over the risks posed by cryptocurrencies to the global financial system with Democratic Senator Mark Warner saying the U.S. had ""a lot of work to do"" to get a grip on the issue.
U.S. markets regulators said this month they plan to take more aggressive enforcement action against exchanges that may be defrauding investors or allowing market manipulation.

The price of bitcoin slumped to $10,000 on Wednesday, halving in value from its peak price of almost $20,000 hit just in December, with investors gripped by fears regulators could clamp down on the volatile currency.

The release of the 2008 document by the British Parliament's Treasury Select Committee (TSC) comes ahead of a debate by lawmakers on Thursday on the treatment of small business customers by the bank's Global Restructuring Group (GRG).
State-owned RBS has acknowledged some bad practice at the unit and set aside 400 million pounds ($555 million) to cover the bill for claims against it.
Among pointers to staff from a junior manager, who RBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan told the TSC had since left the company, was one telling them: ""Rope: Sometimes you just have to let customers hang themselves. You have then gained their trust and they know what's coming when they fail to deliver.""
The memo's release comes just days after British outsourcer  Carillion  (L:CLLN), was forced into bankruptcy after failing to agree a debt deal with lenders including RBS, which court documents showed had demanded even tougher terms before the collapse.
McEwan, in a written response to TSC Chairman Nicky Morgan, said the memo was never part of RBS's policy and had only ever been circulated within one regional office, as well as two GRG offices.
""For the avoidance of doubt, the language used in the document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,"" McEwan wrote.

In October, Britain's financial watchdog told RBS to speed up its handling of compensation claims related to GRG, which has been accused by customers of driving them to bankruptcy in order to pick up their assets on the cheap.

699,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 02:01PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Activist investor Sachem Head pushes Whitbread to consider break-up - sources,"By Ben Martin
LONDON (Reuters) - Activist investor Sachem Head has asked  Whitbread  (L:WTB) to consider a break up of its Costa Coffee chain from its hotels and restaurant businesses, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The U.S. hedge fund disclosed a 3.4 percent stake in FTSE 100-listed Whitbread last month, sending the Premier Inn-owner's shares up more than 7 percent on the day amid speculation the activist would push to split up the company.
Sachem Head wants Whitbread's management team, led by chief executive Alison Brittain, to examine a break-up as a way to boost the value of its individual businesses, the people said. The company's current market capitalization is about 7.2 billion pounds.
Spokesmen for Whitbread and Sachem Head declined to comment. 
The hedge fund is reviving an idea long mooted by investors and analysts that Whitbread should spin off its popular Costa chain.
Founded 276 years ago as a brewery by Samuel Whitbread and Godfrey and Thomas Shewell, Whitbread is one of Britain's oldest companies that grew into a sprawling business with a pub estate and restaurants, as well as its Costa chain and beer operations.
It has become more streamlined in the past few years, however, selling off its brewing business and some pubs to focus mainly on Premier Inn, Costa, the Beefeater restaurant brand and the Brewers Fayre pub restaurant chain.
Activist investors often buy stakes in companies to push them to consider break-ups or asset sales to increase value for investors. 
RBR Capital Advisors last year called on Swiss bank  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to spin off its asset management operations and investment bank. Mining group BHP Billiton (AX:BHP) (L:BLT) is exiting its U.S. shale oil and gas unit following calls from hedge fund Elliott for an overhaul.
Sachem Head has around $4 billion in assets under management and was set up in 2013 by Scott Ferguson, who previously worked with billionaire activist Bill Ackman at his Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management hedge fund.
Unlike more aggressive activists like Elliott, Sachem Head only occasionally pushes for change at the companies where it invests. One of its most notable activist campaigns to date has been at U.S. design software maker Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), where Ferguson had a board seat until last year.
Analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note dated Jan. 3 that the ""most 'obvious' step"" for Whitbread would be to sell Costa, should its boss Brittain, who took the helm in December 2015, decide to restructure the company. Whitbread said last October that it had more than 2,300 Costa stores in the UK, and it also has almost 7,000 Costa Express machines. 
Sachem Head's investment comes at a difficult time for Whitbread.
Shares in the business, which is due to issue a quarterly trading update on Thursday, have fallen 8 percent since the Brexit vote in June 2016, amid worries Britain's impending exit will dent consumer confidence.
On Oct. 24, Whitbread posted a sharp slowdown in revenue growth at Premier Inn, disappointing expectations that it might have benefited from sterling's weakness following the Brexit vote.
Investors had hoped that the fall in the pound would have encouraged more Britons to take domestic holidays and foreign tourists to visit the UK, where Premier Inn had about more than 70,100 rooms last year.
However, Whitbread reported a 1.8 percent increase in UK revenue per available room in the six months to the end of August 2017, which was lower than investors had expected. Costa's UK revenue climbed 8.3 percent to 542 million pounds in the same period. 
Whitbread shares closed down 2.3 percent.

The Panama Papers detailing how the rich and powerful used offshore corporations to hide money and potentially evade taxes, were leaked to the media in 2016.
""So far, it appears that none of the 11 banks which were involved in such dealings have substantially breached money laundering rules,"" Bafin president Felix Hufeld said at an event in Frankfurt on Wednesday.
""Due to lack of a mandate, we could not verify if taxes were evaded,"" he said. ""What you make of the fact that banks let themselves be used to avoid taxes - even though in a legal way - that is a completely different matter."" 
Bafin is tasked with making sure German banks are not involved in activities such as money laundering or are involved in funding illegal organizations, while fiscal authorities are in charge of making sure they adhere to tax laws. 
While tax evasion refers to illegal ways to avoid paying taxes, tax avoidance refers to often legal methods of paying the least amount of tax possible. 
Hufeld said he remained skeptical about how the 11 banks with ties to Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca - which was at the heart of the global scandal - were able to monitor whether anti-money-laundering standards were applied in the offshore businesses.
The banks include  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), Berenberg and BayernLB [BAYLB.UL], which have all said that they adhered to the rules.
Some 11.5 million documents from Mossack Fonseca were leaked to a German newspaper in 2016 and Germany's Federal Crime Office(BKA) said last year that it had obtained a copy of the Panama Papers.
In the wake of this and multiple other reports about tax avoidance by the rich and the powerful, European Union finance ministers in December adopted a blacklist of 17 jurisdictions, including Panama, deemed as tax havens.
European tax commissioner Pierre Moscovici late last year likened tax professionals that help evasion to ""vampires that fear the light,"" and against which only transparency can work as a deterrent.
However, in a potential blow to the campaign against tax avoidance, this week European Union officials proposed removing Panama from the blacklist of tax havens.

The cuts will be split evenly between Europe and the United States and be weighted more towards roles at the director and managing director level, the source added, although Reuters' sister publication IFR reported last week that Europe would bear the brunt of the reductions.
Chief Executive Jes Staley has championed the investment bank, even amid calls from some analysts and investors to ditch a business that has in recent years struggled to match the profitability of Barclays' retail and credit card units.
He said at the bank's third-quarter results in October that Barclays would push ahead with reinvesting in the business, which he wants to be able to compete with Wall Street heavyweights, and add more products and derivatives without returning to the aggressive practices of the past.
In 2016, around 1,000 jobs were cut from Barclays' investment banking business worldwide, as it strove to reduce costs and boost revenues. Barclays cut a total of 10,000 staff that year alone. 

The story was first reported by Bloomberg.

PARIS (Reuters) - Renault-Nissan (PA:RENA) (T:7201) is to pursue plans to create separate strategy and operations leadership roles,  Renault  CEO Carlos Ghosn said on Wednesday in a sign he may pull back as boss of the French carmaker. 
Ghosn, who heads of the Renault-Nissan alliance that also includes Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211), had already stepped back from his CEO role at Nissan last year and sources have said he could do the same at Renault, where his term at the helm runs out in June.
He still serves as chairman of both Renault and Nissan as well as Mitsubishi, controlled by Nissan through a 34 percent stake.
""Regarding corporate governance, you will see changes in terms of separating the responsibilities of those dealing with Renault, with Nissan, with Mitsubishi and with the overall alliance,"" Ghosn told a French parliamentary finance commission on Wednesday.
The idea is to avoid having one person managing the three partner companies' operations and the overall alliance's strategy at the same time, he added.
""In the past, we had to do that to create the alliance, but I don't think it's something that can last,"" Ghosn said.
Reuters reported in June that Ghosn was recruiting a new operational second-in-command for the Renault-Nissan carmaking alliance to prepare his own succession and advance the companies' integration.
French newspaper Les Echos also reported in December that Renault had started interviewing candidates to replace CEO Ghosn when his term expires.
ROADMAP
The alliance became the world's top carmaking group last year, surpassing German giant Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) for the first time, Ghosn said.
He said the alliance's more than 10.6 million vehicle sales last year bested Volkswagen's tally because the German group's 10.7 million included 200,000 heavy trucks, which Renault-Nissan excludes.
The 63-year-old told the French parliamentary commission that the future for his role at the alliance remains to be defined with the boards of Renault and Nissan.
""Is there a roadmap to which I can contribute or not and with which I agree? If we agree on the roadmap and agree that I have a major contribution, we keep going. If there is no agreement ... then we stop,"" he said.
Renault's main shareholders are the French state and Nissan, which itself is 43.4 percent owned by Renault.
Ghosn said that questions over the French state's role in Renault was one for the state to answer, but he added that the French government played a key role in the health of the country's car industry.
Last November the French government began the sale of 4.73 percent of Renault, paring back its holding to the 15 percent level that preceded a 2015 power struggle with Ghosn and removing a residual irritant in their relationship.

MILAN (Reuters) - For almost 70 years, family-owned chocolate group Ferrero shunned acquisitions, relying completely on its ability to grow on its own and dream up new products. Those days are gone.
With Giovanni Ferrero at the helm of the Nutella maker, the traditionally Europe-focused business has swallowed up six companies in the last three years - half of them in the United States. 
The latest acquisition, of Nestle's (S:NESN) U.S. confectionery business, was announced on Tuesday. It was by far his biggest bet, sinking $2.8 billion into a tough market where Nestle was losing ground, and swimming against the tide as many rivals move towards healthier products. 
Such was the risk, that the 53-year-old decided to conduct part of the acquisition in his own name, via his own investment company, to shield the rest of the business, according to three sources close to the matter. They did not disclose the size of his investment. 
The sources said his willingness to use his own company and financing also flagged his commitment to a strategy that broke with decades of business history for Italy's richest family.
More acquisitions could come outside Europe in the next few years, said one of the sources, with the United States and China among countries being considered by the group, founded by Pietro Ferrero in the Italian town of Alba in 1946.
The company was not available for comment.
In another major departure, many of Giovanni Ferrero's acquisitions have propelled the company into candy - or sweets - and away from its traditional chocolate roots, notably the purchase last year of Illinois-based candy company Ferrara, whose brands include Jujyfruits and Lemonhead. 
""The Ferrara deal was sugar confectionery. Giovanni's father would never have approved of this,"" said a person with knowledge of the family's thinking, referring to family patriarch and company boss Michele Ferrero who died in 2015. 
Another source said Ferrero would merge the chocolate assets from Nestle's confectionery business with the group's traditional business while the candy assets would be rolled into Ferrara, to create a candy hub in North America. 
This would keep non-chocolate operations separate from the traditional business to diversify risk and avoid spillover in case of difficulty, the source said, adding the strategy had been approved by the wider family. 
CRIME NOVELS     
Giovanni Ferrero, who writes crime and romance novels in his spare time, took the helm in tragic circumstances. His older brother Pietro died from a suspected heart attack aged 47 while cycling, leaving him to take over the leadership of the company when their father Michele passed away in 2015.
    Almost immediately he set about overhauling a business that was still trading largely on its signature product created by his father in the 1960s, Nutella chocolate-hazelnut spread.
    Michele Ferrero had always shied away from making acquisitions, preferring to rely on Ferrero's own ability to innovate. He also spurned takeover offers for Ferrero, including a bid by Nestle, according to a separate financial source. 
    ""Michele was totally convinced his products were superior to rivals. That's why tie-ups ... fell through. He simply wasn't interested,"" the source said.
Giovanni Ferrero first bought Britain's Thorntons chocolate retail chain, in 2015, sending out a sign that his company was not for sale. Since then he has snapped up five more companies and expanded the business beyond chocolate into other confectionery, such as biscuits, gums and candies.
The Ferrero boss, who lives in Brussels with his wife and two children, has also brought in foreign managers and last year hired the company's first non-family CEO.

Privately-held Lidl, known in Europe for its focus on competitive prices, opened its first stores in the United States last summer and was planning to expand to 100 outlets within a year.
Projects in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia into which Lidl has sunk money have been halted or abandoned, Handelsblatt said in a story released ahead of publication in its Thursday edition.
Lidl, in a response to the newspaper, declined to confirm or deny the report, saying only that it was ""constantly examining and working on our property portfolio"".
Since launching in June 2017, Lidl has opened 49 U.S. stores but it remains unclear whether the number targeted will now be built, Handelsblatt said. 
Lidl runs more than 10,000 stores in 27 countries in Europe and is owned by Dieter Schwarz, who is Germany's richest man according to several international rich lists and is the son of Lidl's founder Josef Schwarz.

(Reuters) - Shares of  General Electric  Co (N:GE) continued its slide on Wednesday and wiped out all its gains in 2018, a day after the U.S. industrial conglomerate announced more than $11 billion in charges and hinted about a potential breakup. 
GE dropped as much as 5.1 percent to $17.28, adding to the about 42 percent decline in the past 12 months. 
Analysts said the surprise charges announced by GE had hurt the company's credibility with investors as it comes just two months after Chief Executive John Flannery issued a detailed plan to reset the company's financial targets. 
""With the collapsing nature of almost everything in question around quality of earnings and free cash flow, we now scratch our heads as to how much of the 'system' is enabling a mitigation of what we think should be more of a hard landing,"" JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa said in a note.
GE's decision to keep aside $15 billion in reserves to cover potential payouts on policies dating back decades represents about 7 percent of the company's ""incremental standing equity value,"" Tusa said. 
The charges were several times larger than the amount GE had forewarned investors. Analysts said GE's move to suspend dividends paid by GE Capital to the parent company would reduce the value of the business in the conglomerate's portfolio. 
GE said the dividend from its financial arm, which totaled $20 billion in 2016, is suspended ""for the foreseeable future"". 
""If that cash stream is zero, then it has pretty dire consequences on a sum-of-the-parts basis,"" said Deane Dray, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
On Tuesday, Flannery hinted that GE could be looking closely at breaking itself to maximize the value of GE's power, aviation and healthcare units.
But analysts wondered about the feasibility of such a plan for the 125-year-old conglomerate.

""In the end, it all adds up to one EBITDA, a third of which is severely challenged, with an increasingly higher debt load and cash calls - facts that don't change in whatever form the company takes going forward,"" Tusa said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VW) (DE:VOWG_p) reported a 4.3 percent rise in 2017 sales to 10.7 million vehicles, staying ahead of Toyota (T:7203) in the race to keep the title of world's biggest carmaker although Renault-Nissan (PA:RENA) has forecast it would go top.
Last year's sales by the German firm, which is still dealing with fallout from a scandal over rigged diesel emissions tests, were its highest ever, helped by strong gains in China, Europe and South America. Monthly sales in December rose 8.5 percent.
Japan's Toyota Motor Corp said last month it expected 2017 sales to grow 2 percent to 10.35 million units worldwide across its Toyota, Lexus, Daihatsu and Hino brands. It said it would hit 10.50 million vehicles in 2018.
The Renault-Nissan alliance (PA:RENA), which includes Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211), has yet to release combined sales volume figures but  Renault  boss Carlos Ghosn said in July it was headed for the top spot.
In 2016, VW was No. 1 with 10.3 million vehicle sales, Toyota was second with 10.2 million and Renault-Nissan was third with 9.96 million.
VW said December 2017 China sales jumped 17.8 percent to 460,100 vehicles, while monthly sales in Europe rose 3.1 percent, driven by Germany. U.S. sales were down 5.2 percent.
Overall, carmakers saw European sales fall 4.8 percent in December from the same month a year ago due in part to one less working day, industry data showed on Wednesday. 

VW has set aside about 25 billion euros ($30 billion) to cover fines, lawsuits and vehicle repairs related to the diesel scandal.

LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce (L:RR) is considering the sale of its loss-making commercial marine business in another shake-up by Chief Executive Warren East that will streamline its activities into civil aerospace, defense and power system units.
East had resisted selling the marine business, which has been hit by weak offshore oil and gas markets, saying its technology was relevant to other parts of Rolls.
The business, which is largely based in the Nordics, had ""responded admirably"" to the downturn by cutting its cost base, he said, but the case for new investment was ""challenging"".
""It is only right that we consider whether its future may be better served under new ownership,"" he said.
Shares in the company jumped to a 10-week high after it said the loss-making business could be sold. They were trading up almost 6 percent at 902.6 pence at 1420 GMT, topping the FTSE 100 index.
East said he had previously had to deal with urgent priorities at Rolls-Royce, including introducing new engines and doubling production rates of its engines for wide-body jets, before ordering a review of marine.
""We needed to stabilize the business and deliver on the initial simplification to restore trust,"" he told reporters.
The marine business generated a loss of 27 million pounds on sales of 1.1 billion pounds in 2016, with the bulk of the business supplying equipment and vessel design across the oil and gas, merchant and other commercial markets. 
The loss widened in Rolls-Royce's first half to 17 million pounds, when it said the market outlook remained challenging.
SECOND OVERHAUL
East said the review was consistent with his previous comments that not everything in the unit was core. 
""Some of the activities are very useful to us from a future technology point of view,"" he said, such as automation.
But activities like vessel design could be sold off.
Bankers said GE (N:GE), Wartsila (HE:WRT1V) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) were possible buyers.
Finance Chief Stephen Daintith said there was interest in the business, but it was too early to talk about the value of a deal before the review, which is being done by Lazard, concludes.
""[Marine] has gone through a lot of restructuring,"" East said. ""It is well placed for a turnaround in its markets, it's just that the visibility around that is uncertain.""
East said the naval shipping business would move into an expanded defense unit. 
The major overhaul, East's second since he became CEO in 2015, will also see the elimination of its nuclear division, with nuclear submarine systems moving into defense and civil nuclear activities moving into power systems.
East said the changes would enable the company to respond more quickly to the needs of its customers and reduce costs.
""It will create a Defence operation with greater scale in the market, enabling us to offer our customers a more integrated range of products and services,"" he said. 
""It will also strengthen our ability to innovate in core technologies and enable us to take advantage of future opportunities in areas such as electrification and digitalization.""
East, who has already stripped out layers of management at Rolls, said the restructuring would remove some duplication, but it was too early to quantify job losses.

Cost savings, beyond the 200 million pounds a year it targeted in 2015, and other details about the restructuring will be given in its full-year results in February.

712,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Sovereign investor 2017 deal values down 24 percent at $72 billion,"By Claire Milhench
LONDON (Reuters) - Sovereign investor deal-making fell 24 percent in 2017 to $72.5 billion as megadeals such as China Investment Corp's (CIC) bumper $13.8 billion buy of warehouse firm Logicor, which led the pack, were thin on the ground. 
In previous years, multi-decade port infrastructure leases and pipeline purchases have swollen the pot. In 2017, it was consortium deals and venture capital funding rounds that boosted values, with tech start-ups and energy the popular plays. 
For example, the second largest deal in the fourth quarter was a mega-funding round for on-demand services provider China Internet Plus. This raised $4 billion, with GIC among the participants. 
But the number of deals by sovereign investors, which include sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) and state pension funds, fell to 183 in 2017 from 198 in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.
""Increasingly (SWFs) are having difficulties finding the right deals and some of the private equity transactions are quite expensive, so late stage venture capital and pre-IPO engagements are a way to do quasi-direct investment deals,"" said Markus Massi, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group.
""It allows them to deploy a couple of billion compared to doing 10 smaller deals ... that keeps the dealflow manageable.""
Javier Capape, a director at the Sovereign Wealth Lab research center in Madrid, added that massive start-ups were delaying listing to avoid valuation erosion, sucking in more private capital: ""We don't know if they will survive the scrutiny of public markets. So they are doing bigger and bigger rounds."" 
GREEN ENERGY
After CIC's Logicor acquisition, 2017's next biggest deal was a $6.4 billion offer for Danish payments processor Nets by a consortium that included Singapore's GIC. In third place was another consortium deal - the $5.6 billion purchase of Australian power grid Endeavour Energy.
The fourth quarter continued these trends with CIC once again participating in the biggest deal. 
It partnered with U.S. fund Global Infrastructure Partners and others on a $5 billion consortium acquisition of Equis Energy, Asia's largest independent renewable energy firm. This was said to be the largest renewables generation deal ever.
Capape noted the Chinese government's support of renewables, saying this deal could help them import expertise to build green energy capacity at home.
In total, fourth quarter deals with SWF participation were worth $16.2 billion, up 2.6 percent from the previous quarter, although the number of deals fell to 48 from 54. 
Other notable final quarter deals included Norway's first Asian real estate investment, the purchase of a 70 percent stake in five properties in Tokyo. Property remains popular with SWFs for its steady income stream.
Funding database PitchBook valued full-year SWF direct investment activity at $135.2 billion, including SWF participation in IPOs. SWF dealflow values can vary depending on how the investor is categorized and when the deal is booked. 
Activity was particularly strong in Asian IPOs, where SWFs were keen to tap the long-term growth opportunities offered by the burgeoning middle classes. 
Notably, insurer SBI Life attracted ADIA, GIC, CPPIB and Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) as anchor investors in India's first billion dollar IPO in seven years. It was swiftly followed by HDFC Life, which pulled in ADIA, Temasek and KIA, among others.
""It's an alternative way to deploy money in a chunky way, and they are often offered preferred conditions because the company wants a stable investor,"" said Massi, adding that the interest in India had really woken up.

729,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Banks expected to share tiny proportion of mammoth Saudi Aramco IPO,"By Dasha Afanasieva and Clara Denina 
LONDON (Reuters) - The banks that will advise and execute Saudi Aramco's stock market listing are expected to share a tiny proportion of the $100 billion Riyadh hopes to raise in its initial public offering, according to banking sources and industry insiders.
Investment banks involved in the listing  are expected to share a fifth of a percent of the money raised, they said, but noted that could still amount to about $200 million.
The listing of 5 percent of the state oil company's shares could be the largest IPO in history, almost five times the size of current record holder  Alibaba  (N:BABA), the Chinese e-commerce company which went public in New York in 2014.
Banks are competing fiercely for mandates in the IPO because it is viewed as a gateway to other deals expected to emerge from Saudi Arabia's plan to revamp its economy via privatization.
Saudi Aramco is known for having paid relatively low banking fees in the past, banking industry sources said. The company declined to comment when asked how much it would offer for this IPO.
The estimate of the fee pot is based on forecasts by industry insiders that have been cross-checked with bankers who are working to grab a share of the pie. They asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Freeman Consulting estimates the pot compares to an average of 2-2.5 percent for IPOs by companies in the region. 
International banks JP Morgan (N:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and HSBC (L:HSBA) have been appointed global coordinators with more banks expected to be named, in addition to a team of book-runners.
The 35 banks who worked on Alibaba's $21.8 billion float, led by six main underwriters, pocketed an estimated $300 million among them, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
Those jostling for a role in Aramco's listing are doing it for the status and league table ranking as well as the hope that it will put them in pole position for more Saudi business. Some - such as JP Morgan and HSBC - have been informally working on this since at least 2016.
""This is the IPO of Saudi Arabia, not just Saudi Aramco. Saudi Aramco is very tight and for something of this size in basis points terms it will be the lowest ever,"" said one London investment banker with knowledge of the process. ""This will set a new precedent.""
An investment banking industry source said it was very unlikely that the fees would reflect the size of the issuance. 
""Aramco is known for paying very little fees – for a transaction of this magnitude in the ECM (equity capital market) you are looking at 100 to 150 basis points, but Aramco will pay just 10 basis points,"" he told Reuters.
LEAGUE TABLES
Advisers to Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank IPO, the world's second-largest after Alibaba at $6 billion in 2104, received just $4.8 million in fees, Thomson Reuters data shows. 
According to the data, Aramco, which produces 10.5 million barrels of crude oil per day, has paid out $180 million to advisers globally since 2002. By comparison the biggest corporate fee payer of last year,  Japan Post Holdings Co Ltd  (T:6178), paid $382 million for investment banking advice, including on its IPO, in 2017 alone.
One of the attractions for banks is a much-coveted top spot on the equity capital market league tables, which are calculated on the basis of deal value as opposed to fees and are included in every client presentation if they make a bank look good. 
Being a regional leader will be important for banks such as Citi (N:C) and HSBC, which are expanding their operations in the kingdom, to take advantage of opportunities created by Vision 2030, the reforms launched by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to end the economy's reliance on oil exports.
""It's about prestige,"" said another banking industry source. He said all the league table places will be taken up by banks involved in the listing because of its size.

""The chief executive and senior management are going to ask questions if you're not on it.""

731,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",Verizon renews NBA deal as it seeks to be go-to screen for sports,"By Jessica Toonkel
(Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) has renewed its deal with the National Basketball Association for two years, allowing users to live-stream games on its Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) platform and mobile devices and access out-of market live games.
Verizon will partner with the NBA to create original content as well as establish a technology innovation fund to experiment with new formats, such as virtual reality, executives at Verizon and the NBA told Reuters.
The new deal opens up Yahoo's pro-basketball fantasy sports to Verizon users globally. The companies declined to comment on the terms of the agreement.
Verizon is seeking to make live sports a focus in the wake of last year's acquisition of Yahoo, said Brian Angiolet, global chief media and content officer at Verizon.
Live sports is valuable for advertisers because viewers are willing to pay for it and watch it for long periods of time in real-time. There is increasing competition between broadcasters, tech companies and cable operators for live sports rights as it remains one of the few areas where viewers watch in real-time.
Last month, Verizon paid around $2.25 billion for a five-year partnership with the National Football League for non-exclusive rights that include games on its Yahoo and Oath sites.
It has spent the past several months renewing deals for its FIOs TV service that enable it to also include more live sports and other league-related content on its digital Oath and Yahoo platforms.
For example, Verizon recently signed TV distribution deals with Spanish language broadcaster Univision Communications and A&E that include Mexican soccer league Liga MX and National Women's Soccer League games respectively on Yahoo.
""We want to be the first screen consumers go to find live sports,"" Angiolet said.
The NBA is looking to tap Verizon's data and technology to help it continue to reformat its game telecasts to appeal to younger fans, said Bill Koenig, NBA president, global content and media distribution.
Another attractive element for the NBA about the deal is the marriage of Verizon's data with fantasy sports presence, he said.
Yahoo has tens of millions of fantasy players and its users spend 30 billion minutes playing fantasy sports every year, according to Verizon.
""Fantasy is a good business on its own, but we think fantasy can be an important driver to becoming deeper fans and watching more telecasts,"" Koenig said.

732,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 11:35AM ET</span>",Goldman investors rattled by latest plunge in bond trading,"By Catherine Ngai and Aparajita Saxena
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday reported a sharp drop in trading revenue that renewed questions about its ability to revive a moribund profit driver or find business to replace it, sending shares down 3 percent.
The Wall Street bank posted its first quarterly loss in six years due to huge but anticipated one-time tax charges. While its adjusted profit beat analyst expectations, Goldman struggled more than rivals during a widespread trading slowdown.
Low volatility has crimped trading revenue across Wall Street for years, but Goldman has borne the brunt of that slump due to the type of customers it caters to, and because it had been more reliant on trading than other banks. 
Goldman's bond trading unit posted its worst quarter since 2008, with a 50 percent revenue plunge. The declines were widespread across currencies, credit products, interest rate products, commodities and mortgages, Goldman said.
Equities trading fell 14 percent, even as global stock markets soared. Goldman's customers, mostly active investors like hedge funds, did not transact very much as volatility hovered near historic lows.
Goldman executives laid out a goal last year to generate $5 billion in revenue from fresh sources, including consumer banking, but some investors and analysts remain skeptical about the plan.
Seven of 11 analysts on a conference call with Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez asked him why bond trading was so weak and when it will recover. Strong performance in other businesses may not be enough to ease investors' concerns, since Goldman's drop in bond trading revenue was so sharp and so much worse than rivals, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note to clients.
""Usually investors would be happy to see trading a smaller piece of the pie and investment banking growing to the sky, but (bond trading) was so soft,"" he wrote. ""People don't have confidence about if and when it'll turn.""
Shares of Goldman, the fifth-largest U.S. bank, fell 3.3 percent to $249.90 in morning trading.
Overall, the bank posted a net fourth-quarter loss of $2.1 billion, or $5.51 per share, and took a $4.4 billion charge related to sweeping U.S. tax law changes.
All other U.S. banks had to make big one-time adjustments to account for the new tax code, but lower corporate tax rates should provide a boon for future bank profits.
Excluding that charge and other one-time items, Goldman recorded earnings per share of $5.68. Analysts expected $4.91 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimate.
Revenue fell 4.1 percent to $7.83 billion, but beat the average estimate of $7.61 billion. Total operating expenses fell 1 percent to $4.73 billion.
Earnings per share were boosted by Goldman accelerating stock buybacks, sending its outstanding share count to a record low.
The bank returned $8 billion to shareholders in 2017, but will not continue buybacks at that pace, Chavez said.
Instead, Goldman will use its tax savings to invest more capital in technology and talent to grow its businesses. The plan comes in contrast to rivals including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), whose executives said they expect tax savings to support capital returns.
""We are working intensely to achieve our $5 billion in strategic growth initiatives with an emphasis on growing earnings and returns,"" Chavez said.
In bond trading, Goldman is trying to woo new types of customers, win more business from existing customers and trade different types of products, he said. Last quarter that business only managed to generate $1 billion in revenue, roughly a quarter of what Goldman posted at the peak of the bond trading boom.
Other businesses did better, with investment banking revenue rising 44 percent from the year-ago quarter to $2.1 billion, helped by strong debt and equity underwriting.
Investing and lending, which uses Goldman's own capital to generate income, reported $1.7 billion in revenue, up 12 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. The unit was hurt by a $130 million loss on a loan to South African furniture retailer Steinhoff International, whose financial woes have caused losses at other banks too.

Investment management revenue rose 4 percent to $1.7 billion.

733,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>",Apple Gets Downgrade and New Street-High Target on Same Day,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). stock analysts headed in opposite directions, with the tech giant picking up a rare downgrade on the same day it got a new target price that exceeded all others on Wall Street.
While Longbow Research analyst Shawn Harrison cut the stock to neutral on Wednesday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analyst Wamsi Mohan raised his target price to $220 from $180. That’s the highest among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The shares fell 0.3 percent to $175.74 at 10:50 a.m. in New York.
In a note, Harrison cited relatively tame demand for the iPhone, predicting shipments would grow less than 10 percent this year versus a consensus forecast of 11 percent.
“A declining iPhone unit environment versus consensus expectations should be a greater overarching theme near-term” than positives touted by Bank of America, such as services growth and tax repatriation, Harrison said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. The analyst added in his note that this tempered iPhone growth outlook should limit stock appreciation.
Mohan, meanwhile, sees more gains for the stock after a 46 percent jump last year.
“In 2018, we remain bullish on potential for cash repatriation, lower tax rates, and the potential for positive estimate revisions heading into 2019,” the analyst wrote in a note.
Apple downgrades have been fairly rare recently. Before Longbow’s cut Wednesday, a downgrade by Nomura Instinet -- which lowered its rating to neutral in December -- marked the first such move since June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts are still overwhelmingly positive, with 34 firms rating it a buy, 10 advising hold and no sell recommendations.
Apple’s fiscal first-quarter results, scheduled for Feb. 1, may provide clues as to the health of iPhone demand, particularly in the crucial Chinese market.

742,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 11:07AM ET</span>","Big U.S. lenders reap benefits of higher rates, but savers not so much","By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve began steadily raising interest rates one year ago, offering a long-awaited tailwind for bank earnings because lenders can charge borrowers more for loans. 
But ask bankers when they will start paying more for the money that savers have in their deposit accounts, and the answer is: not any time soon. 
Depositors now have $11.95 trillion at U.S. commercial banks, close to the $11.99 trillion record set in November, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Yet even as the Fed has boosted its target for short-term rates four times, to a current range of 1.25 to 1.5 percent, savers are only earning pennies on every $100 they hold in deposit accounts. 
Even rates on one-year certificates do not appear to have moved at the three biggest U.S. consumer banks – JPMorgan Chase & Co, (N:JPM) Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) – according to financial analyst Greg McBride of Bankrate.com, who did spot checks in two competitive urban markets, Los Angeles and Houston. 
When rates rose in prior economic cycles, a 1 percentage point rise in overnight rates typically led depositors to start moving money to higher-yielding accounts, whether at other financial institutions or fund managers, said Jefferies bank analyst Ken Usdin. However, because rates moved to essentially zero in 2008 and took an historically long time to rise even a smidgeon, it is taking longer for consumers to take their money and run. 
“I do keep wondering what the magic number is going to be,” he said. “There may be more eye-opening at 1.5 percent.” 
When reporting earnings in recent days, bank executives at JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Wells Fargo & Co (N:WFC) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) said they have no reason to pay more because ordinary depositors are not yet demanding more. It is hard to know when that will change, they said, but there is no competitive pressure yet. 
Although online banks offer more competitive rates, they lack the full suite of products and services that customers have come to appreciate from big banks, said Wells Fargo’s John Shrewsberry. 
High net-worth individuals, companies and other financial institutions have been threatening to move sizeable deposits unless they get paid more. For them, even a tiny fraction of a percentage point of added interest can be worthwhile, he noted. But that is not true for most individuals who would reap scant rewards and face hassles like having to change direct deposit enrollment or automatic payments. 
""That is part of the bargain,"" he said. “There’s the question of, how much am I getting paid for my deposit, and how much value am I getting for that deposit relationship with the bank?” 
Low deposit rates at Citigroup are ""a reflection of the state of competition,"" said the bank’s finance chief, John Gerspach. The widening gap between loan rates and deposit rates helped drive Citi’s U.S. retail banking revenue up 7 percent, he said.
Asked when banks would start paying more, JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said she expected banks to “remain quite disciplined” on rates through the remainder of 2018. 
After Bank of America reported results on Wednesday, CFO Paul Donofrio told analysts the bank will eventually have to raise rates on smaller accounts.
""My guess is we are getting close to that point, given the expected fed funds rate hikes,"" Donofrio said.
Analysts and bankers pointed to recent tax reform as one potential force of change.
TAX CHANGES COULD SPUR HIGHER RATES 
Now that corporate tax rates have dropped to 21 percent from 35 percent, there may be stronger demand for loans, which in turn could spark higher rates for deposits to fund them, they said.
And, if the Fed keeps lifting rates in the months ahead, as Wall Street predicts, consumers may start drawing down on deposits, leading banks to use some of their own tax savings to pay more competitive rates. 
It is a question of when, not if, said Jefferies’ Usdin. 

""We are all waiting for that moment when the retail depositor does have that wake-up moment,” he said, “but I don't feel like it is happening this quarter.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss trader and miner  Glencore  (L:GLEN) expects to secure U.S. approval by the end of June on the U.S. portion of a deal to sell a 51 percent stake in its storage and logistics business to China's HNA Group, sources familiar with the matter said. 
Glencore agreed in March to sell the stake in its petroleum products storage and logistics business for $775 million to HNA Group subsidiary HNA Innovation Finance Group Co, which specializes in commodities, logistics and investment services.
The Swiss firm said on Dec. 29 it had closed parts of the deal worth $579 million but three assets in the United States still required clearance for sale by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).
The filing process with CFIUS began in January.
Approval should take about four months but could stretch to the end of the second quarter because of increased U.S. scrutiny of Chinese companies and their ownership after a rise in Chinese acquisitions in the United States, one of the sources said.
Spokesmen for Glencore, HNA and CFIUS declined to comment.
CFIUS, which scrutinizes deals for potential threats to U.S. national security, has toughened its stance on the sale of U.S. companies to Chinese buyers, blocking deals in sensitive industries and putting others through a prolonged review.
A senior HNA Innovation executive told Reuters on Tuesday that the firm would not chase U.S. deals in 2018 partly due to Washington's increased scrutiny.
HNA, which began in the aviation industry, has been on a two-year buying spree snapping up assets worldwide from logistics to hotels to banking.

749,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",SandRidge to meet with investor Icahn to quell rising tensions,"By Ernest Scheyder
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  SandRidge Energy  Inc (N:SD) plans to meet with activist investor Carl Icahn on Wednesday over his demands for a board shake-up and other governance changes, part of a bid by the U.S. shale oil producer to quell tensions with its largest shareholder and most outspoken critic. 
Icahn said in December he was considering a proxy contest to remove some or all of SandRidge's directors. A week ago, in a letter referencing the Wednesday meeting, Icahn called on the Oklahoma City-based company to replace two directors with one designated by him and the second by other large shareholders. 
The call for board seats came after SandRidge terminated a $746 million deal to acquire rival  Bonanza Creek Energy Inc  (N:BCEI) that Icahn and other investors said was too expensive and would burden the company with too much debt. 
""I'm not necessarily against the idea of them buying some assets at a good price, but I was adamantly against diluting the shareholders, especially in order to overpay for Bonanza,"" Icahn said in an interview. 
The billionaire investor will likely continue his harsh criticism of SandRidge Chief Executive James Bennett, who he blasted earlier this month for overseeing ""a period of massive value destruction"" at the company, including a bankruptcy filing.
""I don't mind a CEO making a lot of money if the shareholders have also prospered. But this is certainly not the case here,"" Icahn said in the interview. 
SandRidge declined to provide details of its executives' goals for Wednesday's meeting, but spokesman David Kimmel said in a statement that its board and management ""value constructive shareholder dialogue."" 
The company has not set a date for its 2018 shareholder meeting nor a deadline for shareholders to submit resolutions for the proxy. The 2017 meeting was held in June.
Icahn, who owns 13.5 percent of the oil company, also has called on directors to remove a so-called poison pill barring individual shareholders from accumulating more than 10 percent of shares.
SandRidge will meet with other top shareholders in additional to Icahn. Guggenheim Partners Investment Management and Fir Tree Partners, both of which opposed the Bonanza Creek deal, did not respond to requests for comment.
SandRidge executives have been selling their shares. John Suter, chief operating officer; Philip Warman, SandRidge's top lawyer; and CEO Bennett sold in aggregate more than 400,000 shares since the beginning of the year, according to regulatory filings.

Shares of SandRidge fell 1 percent to $20.03 in Wednesday morning trading.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain needs to allow more time for firms to take on 8,500 workers whose jobs are threatened by the demise of  Carillion , unions said on Wednesday, as Prime Minister Theresa May faced criticism for the way the government outsources public services.
Infrastructure company Carillion (L:CLLN) collapsed on Monday when its banks pulled the plug, forcing the government to step in to guarantee services ranging from school meals to roadworks that the company had previously provided. 
Britain has said it will only pay Carillion workers on private sector contracts for 48 hours after the infrastructure firm’s fall and not offer them the same protection as those in the public sector. 
The head of Britain's GMB union, who met business minister Greg Clark on Tuesday, said the government needed to allow more time for the 8,500 workers it estimates are now vulnerable.
""We want those other private sector companies to take on those workers ... That takes time,"" GMB General Secretary Tim Roache told BBC radio.
Over 90 percent of Carillion's private sector service customers have said they will provide funding for now to allow the company's official receiver to retain employees on those contracts, Britain's Insolvency Service said on Wednesday.
The demise of Carillion, the biggest British corporate failure in a decade, has left its 43,000 employees in limbo, banks with losses of over $1.3 billion and hundreds of suppliers likely to receive almost none of the money owed to them.
Just as May grapples with Brexit, Carillion's fate has pulled her into a debate about whether the legacy of late former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, of the state paying private companies to provide essential public services, is right.
May, whose government had employed Carillion to work on 450 projects including the building and maintenance of hospitals and high-speed rail, came under fire from the opposition Labour leader.
""This isn't one isolated case of government negligence and corporate failure. It's a broken system,"" Jeremy Corbyn said during a weekly question session with the prime minister. 
""These corporations ... need to be shown the door. We need our public services provided by public employees with a public service ethos and a strong public oversight,"" Corbyn, a socialist who has long opposed outsourcing, said.
May said the government had discussed the issue of credit lines to small and medium businesses and was liaising with those affected by Carillion's demise ""to make sure that we're on top of the potential effects on the wider supply chain"".

""We were a customer of Carillion, not the manager of Carillion and that's a very important difference and it is also important that we've protected taxpayers from an unacceptable bailout of a private company,"" she said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has charged a  Barclays  (LON:BARC) foreign exchange trader over his alleged role in a scheme to defraud a client of the bank, the DoJ said.
Robert Bogucki, the former head of foreign exchange trading in New York for the British bank, is alleged to have manipulated forex options before a large trade by computer and software maker Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) (HP) in 2011, using a practice known as ""front-running"".
Bogucki could not immediately be reached outside U.S. business hours. He is still employed by Barclays but has been on leave since November 2016, according to a source familiar with the matter.
""Barclays has been cooperating fully with the DoJ. This incident involved a single transaction from 2011 and pre-dates the extensive improvements to the Conduct and Controls procedures we have made since 2012,"" a spokesman for the bank said. 
According to the DoJ indictment, Bogucki, a U.S. citizen, is alleged to have misused information provided to him by HP before the company's planned acquisition of a British-based company.
HP hired Barclays to execute 6 billion pounds ($8.3 billion) worth of foreign exchange options as part of that deal. Bogucki is alleged to have made trades ahead of the deal that benefited Barclays at HP's expense.
""Robert Bogucki and others allegedly not only betrayed his client's confidences, but also risked undermining public trust in the foreign exchange options market,"" acting Assistant Attorney General John Cronan said in a statement published on the Department of Justice's web site on Tuesday.
Bogucki, who is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and six counts of wire fraud, is due to make his first appearance in court in Brooklyn, New York on Wednesday, the DoJ said.
The indictment alleges that Bogucki and other unnamed Barclays bankers' goal was to enrich the bank and themselves. It says that over 80 percent of Bogucki's 2011 compensation resulted from bonuses for performance. 
The indictment is the second brought against the head of a foreign exchange desk at a major international bank, as the U.S. continues to investigate fraud in global foreign exchange markets.

A jury in October found former HSBC executive Mark Johnson executive guilty of defrauding Cairn Energy Plc in a $3.5 billion currency trade in 2011.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro's sizzling January rally is undermining one of the most profitable bond market trades of recent years by potentially raising hedging costs and thereby eroding profits of overseas investors.
Japanese and U.S. investors have long bought European sovereign bonds despite many offering a negative yield. They are attracted by the juicy return obtained from hedging the purchases via foreign exchange derivatives known as cross currency basis swaps.
But as the European Central Bank shifts closer to policy ""normalization"", these holdings could come under pressure from a stronger euro and force investors to look elsewhere. European bond yields would then shoot higher, posing a challenge for policymakers who want to keep borrowing costs low to boost the ongoing recovery. 
""The whole idea of these trades via the currency derivatives markets is that a big interest rate differential exists in them but that argument of buying European bonds may diminish sharply if we see a precipitous fall in the U.S. dollar,"" said Shaniel Ramjee, a multi-asset portfolio manager at Pictet Asset Management in London. 
Such flows are large. By last year, Japanese investors had amassed an $845 billion position in European bond markets, according to data from Japan's Ministry of Finance. Analysts estimate they own more than 12 percent of the French government bond market, for example. 
A rapid unwind of these positions would impose fresh uncertainty on global bond market, which are already battling with the withdrawal of global central bank stimulus, high oil prices and waves of new bond supply.
SIMPLE
At its heart, the trade looks relatively simple. 
There is a greater demand for U.S. dollars in the currency swaps markets where investors exchange foreign exchange exposure among different currencies. So there exists a premium for obtaining the dollar in them, helping U.S.-based investors extract a small but sizeable return when investing overseas.
In short, U.S.-based investors can buy European bonds and swap their currency exposure into dollars, locking in a profit despite deeply negative bond yields in Europe. 
For example, three-month euro/dollar cross currency basis swaps yield 30 basis points which translates into a 1.2 percent yield on an annualized basis. Even accounting for an outright loss on a minus 0.10 percent yield on German five-year government bonds, the trade offers investors a currency-hedged yield of 0.7 percent.
Small wonder then that investors have piled in. Net inflows into developed European debt from U.S. domiciled bond funds jumped to $15 billion last year, its highest annual rate in four years, according to data from funds tracker EPFR. 
Furthermore, that yield rises if investors venture into other parts of the European debt market such as investment grade corporate bonds or riskier sovereign debt, where yields are also near record lows.
Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard estimates, that Japanese investors can get a yield pick up of 25 basis points for German bunds, 52 basis points for French debt and 165 basis points for Italian bonds respectively.
""That is far more than what investing in Japanese bonds can give them,"" Cicione said. Ten-year yields in Japan were trading around 9 basis points on Wednesday.
STEEPER CURVES
But the underlying assumptions behind this trade are being called into question.
The selloff in the dollar that began in early December has gathered pace, pushing the dollar index, which measures the currency's value against a basket of its rivals, to a three-year low.
Driving down the dollar has been a growing view that central banks such as the ECB and the Band of Japan may start unwinding easy monetary policy quicker than expected.
That means that interest rate differentials available through the currency swaps markets so central to this trade may start to fade and cause these flows to reverse.
Stephen Jefferies, a managing director at JP Morgan, notes that even though U.S. yields have gone up substantially in the last week - the two-year yield is above 2 percent for the first time in nearly a decade - the yen has also strengthened which indicates that these kinds of investment flows are coming under some pressure.
Moreover, yields available to investors via these swaps have also shrunk dramatically in recent years, indicating any slight shift in policy stance from any of the major central banks could erase any gains. 
For example, the hedged yield available for a Japanese investor buying a 10-year German government bond has now shrunk to 0.25 basis points from more than 120 basis points three years ago.
And among the major global central banks, none is more keenly watched for any signs of unwinding its easy policy stance than the Bank of Japan, whose huge bond buying plan has flattened domestic yield curves and sent domestic investors to look to global bond markets in search for yield. 
Japan's central bank caused a flutter in global bond markets last week as yields on benchmark Japanese ten-year bonds hit six-month highs above 0.80 percent after it made a small cut to its regular bond purchases.
Investors say a further rise in Japanese yields would prompt domestic investors to unwind their overseas investments, particularly in European bonds, pushing up yields sharply.
""Watching the BOJ is quite important because if they start to move on that, that's the last major central bank liquidity provider disappearing. That would have an impact on Europe,"" said David Zahn, head of European fixed income at Franklin Templeton.

798,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: J&J attracts Chinese interest for diabetes business in potential $3-4 billion deal - sources,"By Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese bidders are circling a diabetes care business owned by the world's largest healthcare company Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in a deal that could fetch up to $4 billion, five people with direct knowledge told Reuters.
New Brunswick, N.J.-based J&J said in January last year it was evaluating options for its diabetes care companies, specifically LifeScan Inc, Animas Corp, and Calibra Medical Inc. One option was a sale of the business, it said.
Chinese interest in the J&J unit comes as the market for diabetes care in China is expected to grow rapidly. Almost one in three of the world's diabetes sufferers lives in China, according to World Health Organization estimates.
Among the potential bidders is a consortium being formed by Shenzhen-listed Sinocare Inc, which develops and manufactures blood sugar monitoring systems, and China Jianyin Investment Ltd (JIC), a unit of sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp. The group has hired an advisor to work on a bid, according to two sources.
""The evaluation of potential strategic options for LifeScan Inc. and Calibra Medical Inc. is ongoing and we do not have an announcement regarding these businesses at this time,"" J&J said in a statement in response to Reuters request for comment.
The company has hired Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to work on the sale, according to three of the people. The bank declined to comment.
Sinocare's investors relations office said it could not confirm the information when contacted by Reuters. JIC and CIC did not respond to requests for comment. The sources declined to be identified.
Asia accounts for more than 60 percent of global diabetes cases, with increasing levels of wealth, unhealthy diets and more sedentary lifestyles sparking ""diabetes epidemics"" in the region, according to BMI Research.
George Lin, chief financial officer of Hua Medicine, a diabetes-focused drug developer, told Reuters on Wednesday that according to the most recent market research there were more than 110 million diabetes patients in China alone.
""The market right now in the world is already close to $50 billion,"" he said, referring to diabetes drugs. ""In China, it is expected to grow from $6.6 billion in 2016 to $20 billion by 2025. This is a very large, fast-growing market.""
Lin left a senior role at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) to join Hua in December.
It is not yet clear if potential Chinese buyers are interested in the whole of J&J's diabetes care business or one or more of the member companies.
Sinocare, which has a market capitalization of about $1.8 billion, in 2015 teamed up with Citic Securities to bid for Bayer (DE:BAYGN)'s diabetes devices business that was eventually sold to Japan's Panasonic Healthcare Holdings, majority-owned by U.S. investment firm KKR.
JIC, wholly owned by CIC, mainly invests in the industrial manufacturing, consumption and information technology sectors, according to its website.
CIC's vice-chairman and president, Tu Guangshao, said at a panel discussion during the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong this week that it would look for more investment opportunities in the healthcare industry.
The sale of the diabetes business has also attracted interest from global private equity players, according to the people with knowledge of the process. But analysts said China could offer a tonic to J&J's struggling diabetes care unit and a turnaround opportunity for regional investors.
Revenues at J&J's diabetes care unit have been falling since 2012, a Reuters study of the company's financial results found. In the first nine months of 2017, sales slid 7.7 percent year-on-year. In 2016, it suffered a similar decline.
In October, Animas Corp, the diabetes care unit that makes insulin pumps, said it would shut its business in the United States and Canada amid increased competition and after failing to find a buyer.
Any sale by J&J of its diabetes device units would fit with a drive to exit from lower-margin, commoditized categories such as glucose meters and strips, but analysts said Asian buyers may be able to squeeze more out of the assets.
""Could a Chinese company extract more value from this than a multinational? It's possible because they have different expectations of profitability than multinationals so they can be happy with lower margins,"" said Franck Le Deu, Hong Kong-based senior partner at consultancy McKinsey.
""One complication of being in diabetes for a Chinese company is that you need a broad portfolio to be able to compete, and a broad footprint because it's a very dispersed market,"" he added. ""So the investment levels needed to be competitive in diabetes are quite high, it's not an easy game to play.""

801,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 05:31AM ET</span>","South African regulator pursuing criminal complaints against SAP, KPMG, McKinsey","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's companies registry office is pursuing criminal complaints against SAP (DE:SAPG), KPMG and McKinsey on suspicion that business they conducted with friends of President Jacob Zuma broke the companies act, it said on Wednesday.
The Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC)submitted the complaints to South African police in November and December last year and the matter is ongoing, the CIPC said in an emailed response to questions.
German software maker SAP, auditor KPMG and management consultants McKinsey have all been accused of unduly influencing government contracts in collusion with companies controlled by the Gupta family, who have been accused of using political connections to win work with the state.
The Guptas deny wrongdoing and say they are victims of a politically-motivated witchhunt.
SAP said it has been cooperating with South African authorities investigating the deals for several months, including the police priority crime unit.
KPMG declined to comment. McKinsey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A police spokesman was not immediately available to comment.
The CIPC has in the past helped bring about changes at South African firms by pursuing complaints under the companies act.
Separately, South Africa's state prosecutor said it would on Wednesday serve a court order on McKinsey relating to a 1.6 billion rand ($130 million) contract with state utility Eskom that the global consultancy worked on with Trillian, a local firm that was then controlled by Gupta family associates.
Trillian will also be served with a court order, a spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority said. Trillian declined to comment.
McKinsey has offered to pay back the 1 billion rand ($81 million) it earned for its share of the work done at Eskom in 2016, but denies doing anything illegal.
KPMG cleared out its South African leadership in September last year after an internal investigation found work done for Gupta family firms ""fell considerably short of KPMG's standards"". KPMG denied it had done anything illegal.
SAP (DE:SAPG), Europe's biggest technology company, said last year it had ""let down South Africa"" by paying $7.7 million in commissions to Gupta-related companies between December 2014 and November 2016.
Zuma, who has faced and denied numerous corruption allegations since taking office in 2009, said last week he will set up a commission of inquiry into allegations of influence-peddling in the government.

Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, who was elected leader of the ruling African National Congress last month, has vowed to fight rampant corruption and revitalize the economy.

806,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 03:57AM ET</span>","Exclusive: GM, DHL use a Chinese plant to lead manufacturing change","By Norihiko Shirouzu
LIUZHOU, China,  (Reuters) - Inside General Motors Co's vehicle assembly plant in this southern China city, many workers wear the red-and-yellow uniforms of DHL, the logistics company.
The DHL employees work side-by-side with GM workers handling the flow of parts within the plant, which builds about 400,000 Baojun brand vehicles a year and is owned jointly by GM (N:GM), Chinese partner SAIC Motor Corp (SS:600104) and Guangxi Automobile Group.
DHL assembles thousands of kits of parts daily in a strategy to avoid assembly errors, and reduce costs. At some GM-run final assembly plants in China, seats are unloaded from delivery trucks, put on a conveyer system that runs underneath an assembly line, and are delivered to the assembly line operator untouched by human hands.
Some parts are delivered by small self-guided robots that would be at home on the set of a ""Star Wars"" movie.
GM is now deploying third-party logistics contractors inside all 17 of its joint-venture general assembly plants in China to transport materials, and manage parts warehousing outside the plant and delivery to the plant, a senior GM executive told Reuters.
Outsourcing in-plant material handling jobs, traditionally done by GM workers, allows the automaker's workforce to focus on the more critical work of improving quality and efficiency, GM China's manufacturing chief Paul Buetow said.
GM has not previously shared details of its strategy for using DHL and other contractors in its Chinese joint-venture factories. Early on in developing its Chinese manufacturing, GM used relatively simple manufacturing systems, relying more on cheap labor than advanced technology.
CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING
Now, GM's Chinese operations are deploying advanced manufacturing systems ahead of many factories in mature markets, and leading the way in many aspects of factory floor innovation.
GM's increasing use of contractors in China points toward a future where much more of the work involved in producing vehicles, or even all of it, could be handed over to third-party specialists, as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) does by outsourcing production of its devices.
Established automakers have used contract assemblers, such as  Magna International Inc  (TO:MG), to build small numbers of niche models. 
But union agreements have limited the use of outside contractors within many plants run by global automakers in Europe and the United States. Some electric-car startups, including NIO, formally known as NextEV, are already experimenting with handing over the bulk of production work to third parties.
NIO's founder and chief executive William Li, who has his entrepreneurial roots in e-commerce, has been lobbying China's industrial policymakers to allow existing automakers to subcontract for electric car ventures such as his, so that startups could channel limited resources into technology and product development.
Under current policy, EV startups in China are required to have their own manufacturing capacity. Buetow said he has ""thought about"" the possibility of fully outsourcing production, but has concluded the automaker should still control manufacturing.
""The building and assembling of vehicles is still a core competency for General Motors,"" Buetow told Reuters in an interview in Liuzhou. ""I am not sure we would ever contract that out.""
It is critical, he said, to have the ""technical control"" necessary to build vehicle bodies with precision in order to assure crashworthiness.
EFFICIENCY GAIN
GM and SAIC, and Guangxi Automobile have roughly 6,000 employees at the Liuzhou manufacturing complex. 
To support them, DHL has deployed 1,500 of its own workers according to DHL.
Cars have 20,000 to 30,000 parts, and modern auto factories often produce multiple models on the same assembly line. The parts kits, delivered in the proper order according to computerized schedules, help reduce errors. 
Assembly line workers, for example, do not have to decide what color sun visor to use in a car. That choice is made by the people assembling the kit.
Parts kits put together by DHL are delivered by DHL workers just-in-time for a given vehicle coming down the assembly line. DHL uses a system for creating kits of parts that was pioneered by Toyota and later shared with GM.
According to GM, most of these DHL workers are doing warehousing and parts delivery to the plants. DHL workers who handle parts-kitting and just-in-time delivery to the assembly line are much fewer in number than those working outside the assembly plants and they do not engage in vehicle assembly work, the company said.
Similar outsourcing arrangements are being carried out on a small scale in GM's North American manufacturing facilities and elsewhere, but ""what we have done in China is more (evolved),"" Buetow told Reuters, without elaborating.
GM declined to provide detailed information on the presence of third-party logistics service providers inside its Chinese plants, saying that is competitive information.
GM China manufacturing facilities also have adopted technologies such as ""zero-downtime"" welding and other robots, as well as collaborative robots which work side-by-side with human operators on the assembly line, Buetow said.
As a result, GM's Chinese production facilities have enjoyed a big jump in efficiency, Buetow said. Buetow and GM declined to give specific data, but Buetow said the number of vehicles assembled with the wrong components has fallen to a quarter of the level seen a decade or two ago.

""You rarely see any vehicles that are mis-built at the end of the line these days,"" Buetow said.

813,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 02:12AM ET</span>","U.S. indoor farming startup Plenty eyes rollout in China, Japan: CEO","By Dominique Patton
BEIJING (Reuters) - Ambitious U.S. indoor farming startup Plenty Inc is seeking urban sites for new farms in Chinese cities as part of a global drive to set up high-tech facilities growing organic vegetables in warehouses under banks of LED lights.
Matt Barnard, chief executive of the San Francisco-based firm which counts Amazon Inc. (O:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Japanese tech player SoftBank Corp (T:9984) among its backers, told Reuters on Wednesday that China could potentially host at least 300 of Plenty's farms.
Plenty is currently hiring in China and scouting for locations and distributors in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, Barnard said in an interview in Beijing. The company has already hired a team in Japan and has ""locked down"" a few farm sites there, according to Barnard, also a co-founder.
He did not disclose financial or investment targets for the expansion of the firm which currently operates just one farm, in San Francisco, with another due to open in Seattle in the first-half of 2018. 
""We see a massive opportunity to get people product that tastes better and also has health and safety that far surpasses anything on the market today,"" Barnard said.
Plenty's farming model means growing vegetables and herbs on vertical towers indoors, with hydroponic systems delivering nutrients to plants and LED lighting designed to stimulate rapid growth all-year round. Enclosed farms reduce pests and allow the firm to optimise growing conditions.
That could be a big draw in China, which has less than a third of the arable land per person compared with the United States, and in many places, soil contaminated by heavy metals and pesticides.
A Plenty farm is designed to be 3 to 10 acres (1.2 to 4 hectares), and can produce between 150 and 350 times the output of a field farm, said Barnard.
Concerns among Chinese consumers over food safety are also a major opportunity. Chinese farms will be accompanied by 'experience centres' where people can taste the product and see how it is produced.
""It's super important that people can trust it,"" added Barnard, who expects the China market to contribute 25 to 50 percent of the firm's business in the future.
The company is talking to restaurants, online grocers and some supermarkets to distribute the product, which will be priced higher than much of the produce available in Chinese markets.
Indoor farms can be located close to cities, cutting out the transport from field to supermarket that impacts the freshness of produce. That allows Plenty to grow varieties for their flavour and not for their ability to withstand transport.
One potential concern for Barnard is the cost of operating the lighting systems.
""China power prices are more expensive than in California,"" he said, adding that as long as farms are located in places with the best rates farms can still be successful.

Besides electric and self-driving cars, the planned 23 trillion won will also include investments into fields such as batteries and hydrogen energy, as well as start-ups, the ministry said. 
A Hyundai Motor Co spokeswoman confirmed the hiring plan but did not comment on the investment sum. She said the statement was discussed with the company beforehand.
""Global trends are changing fast,"" Hyundai Motor Vice Chairman Chung Eui-sun said, according to the statement. ""We will recruit better, top-level talent in these new businesses and develop them going forward."" 
Hyundai Motor said earlier this month it had invested in Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab, as it seeks to expand into the region to reduce its reliance on China following a damaging diplomatic row between Seoul and Beijing.
Finance Minister Kim also said on Wednesday authorities will leave foreign exchange rates to market participants but take action if needed. 
The won was trading down 0.3 percent at 1,065.8 per dollar as of 0442 GMT. Currency dealers have suspected foreign exchange authorities of engaging in intervention to slow the won's rise.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>","China luxury sales rebound as millennials snap up cosmetics, handbags: report","By Adam Jourdan
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's luxury goods market is back in fashion.
Domestic sales of Gucci handbags to Chanel cosmetics, sluggish in China for years, rose at the fastest pace in over half a decade last year and are poised to consolidate the gains in 2018, according to consultancy Bain & Co.
That could provide a major fillip for brands targeting the world's top luxury spenders, though who benefits most will depend on which brands are able to lure in China's big-spending youth - now the driving force in the market.
Sales of luxury goods in China hit 142 billion yuan ($22.07 billion) last year, up around 20 percent from the year before, Bain & Co said in a report on Wednesday. That's the sharpest growth since 2011, when luxury sales started to be hit by slower economic growth and a fierce crackdown on corruption.
China's shoppers are the biggest spenders worldwide on luxury products, making up 32 percent of the 262 billion euros ($308 bln) global market last year and propelling France's LVMH (PA:LVMH),  Burberry  (L:BRBY) and Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP).
""It's essentially been a flattish market for the last five years; now 2017 is plus 20 percent, that's an amazing rebound,"" said Bruno Lannes, Shanghai-based partner at Bain, adding lower pricing and government support were key drivers.
The sharp rise - which saw particularly strong growth for women's clothing, jewelry, cosmetics, shoes and handbags - follows tepid growth in 2016 and dips in both 2015 and 2014.
Beijing has been pushing for greater domestic spending, cracking down on shopping agents known as ""daigou"" bringing products into China from overseas, and cutting high tax rates on imported luxury goods sold in the country.
China's domestic market makes up 8 percent of global luxury sales, according to Bain, and despite fast growth at home Chinese shoppers still make three-quarters of their luxury purchases overseas.
MILLENNIAL DRIVERS
Bain said China's luxury market should also see robust growth this year ""fueled by millennials and ready to wear"" attire, though the growth rate would likely slow down to ""low-mid teen"" levels given the fast growth in 2017.
The revival is being driven by China's tech-savvy millennial generation aged between 20 to 34, who generally prefer ready-to-wear and fast fashion over more traditional design, helping propel new areas like luxury casual wear and sports wear.
""This is a new China coming in as opposed to the old China coming back,"" said Lannes.
That shift creates a challenge for more traditional brands like Prada (HK:1913), which is having to play catch up with newer rivals like Coach.
Others like Hermes (PA:HRMS), France's LVMH and Kering are seeing revived appetite from China, helping boost their global sales last year.
Luxury spirits makers, including China's own Kweichow  Moutai  (SS:600519) and France's  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP), saw a pick up in China sales too.
Lannes added the fast growth would see winners and losers emerge, depending on who could crack the code of China's youth.
""A new China is emerging with new consumers that were not there five years ago that have different profiles, different expectations and different tastes,"" he said.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 08:36PM ET</span>","Ford gives disappointing outlook, says turnaround to take years","By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Tuesday estimated financial results for 2017 and 2018 that fell short of investor expectations, in a downbeat forecast that contrasted with a more positive outlook from rival automaker General Motors Co (N:GM).
Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told analysts at an investor conference in Detroit that higher costs for steel, aluminum and other metals, as well as currency volatility, could cost the company $1.6 billion in 2018. Cost-cutting actions are under way and will have the biggest impact ""in 2020 and later,"" Shanks said. 
""We are not satisfied by our performance,"" he said. ""We are excited about our future.""
Ford's president of global markets, Jim Farley, said the company's business structure was ""out of sync with our revenue,"" and vowed to cut costs by sharply reducing the variants of high-volume Ford models and slashing marketing costs by $200 million a year.
Farley hinted at possible significant changes in the structure of Ford's money-losing South American business.
""We are exploring every option you can imagine,” Farley told analysts and investors at a conference on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show.
To boost revenue, Farley said Ford would decrease its passenger-car models and develop more trucks and sport utility vehicles aiming at profitable niches such as rugged off-road models.
Ford shares dropped more than 2 percent in extended trading after the release of the forecast, but later recovered most of the losses. Ford said it would pay shareholders an extra dividend of $500 million, or 13 cents a share, for the first quarter.
Differing outlooks for 2018 from GM and Ford highlighted how the two largest U.S. automakers have been on diverging roads for the past year. 
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has led a dramatic overhaul of the No. 1 U.S. automaker, selling its unprofitable European operations, exiting troubled Asian markets and giving the green light to investments in self-driving vehicles and an expanded portfolio of electric vehicles.
GM projected 2018 results in line with the $6.00 to $6.50 a share adjusted earnings forecast for 2017, and promised higher profit in 2019. GM shares closed up slightly on Tuesday, after rising about 2 percent earlier in the day. GM shares are up 18 percent from a year ago.
Ford shares are up only about 4 percent from a year ago. In May, Ford's board ousted Chief Executive Mark Fields and named Jim Hackett, who was known as a turnaround expert and had been leading Ford's unit developing self-driving vehicles, to replace him. Hackett has promised to slash Ford's product development costs by $14 billion and has launched reviews of the vehicle lineup. 
Ford's forecast reinforces Hackett's warning to investors last fall that the cost-cutting and product strategy changes could take time.
For full-year 2017, Ford said adjusted earnings would be $1.78 per share, below analysts' estimate of $1.83, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For 2018, Ford expects adjusted earnings of $1.45 to $1.70 per share. Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.62.
In a nod to the importance investors are placing on alternatives to traditional auto manufacturing, Ford said it would start reporting separately the results of its investments in ""mobility"" businesses, such as self-driving delivery vehicles and ride services, and previewed a loss for those operations of $300 million for 2017.
Shanks said Ford's mobility services business is a separate legal entity and reporting results gives the automaker ""options down the road."" Some analysts have advocated that Ford create a separate class of shares to allow investors to put money into a technology-focused growth business.
Ford's highly profitable F-series large pickup franchise will face aggressive challenges from GM and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), as those rivals crank up their own respective production of new generations of large pickups. GM's new Chevrolet Silverado and Fiat Chrysler's 2019 Ram are both designed to chop at the F-series' lead as the best-selling vehicle line in the United States.

In November, Contreras-Sweet put together a consortium of investors who offered $275 million for The Weinstein Co.
But Harvey and Bob Weinstein, who co-founded Weinstein Co. in 2005 and own about 46 percent of the business, have been trying to steer the company toward a deal with Miramax, the Los Angeles Times said. (http://lat.ms/2rfbVAU)
The Weinstein Company has been looking for a buyer or rescue financing since last fall as the studio continues to grapple with the fallout of sexual harassment allegations against former co-chairman, Harvey Weinstein, who left the company three months ago.
The company's investment bankers at Moelis & Co have been focused on an outright sale, rather than a debt restructuring or bankruptcy.
On Monday, Killer Content Inc, the movie producer that has partnered with philanthropist Abigail Disney in a consortium vying to acquire the Weinstein Company, said a bankruptcy may be the best way forward for the embattled U.S. film and TV studio.

Both Miramax and Weinstein Co could not be immediately reached for a comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors looking to profit from excitement surrounding bitcoin technology will get a new opportunity this week.
Funds coming to market on Wednesday will purchase shares of companies, such as Hitachi Ltd, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) and  Overstock.com  (NASDAQ:OSTK) Inc, that may benefit from the digital asset's underlying technology.
Rather than buying wild-trading ""cryptocurrencies"" themselves, the funds' tactic has mollified uneasy regulators who have denied or tabled more than a dozen proposals for funds that would own bitcoin or futures based on them.
Amplify Investments LLC and Reality Shares Inc are each launching exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in companies betting on blockchain, the decentralized technology bitcoin uses to keep a running record of transactions.
Companies from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) to  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) said blockchain can help them streamline processes, such as settling financial transactions.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) insisted the ETFs not include the word blockchain in their names if the stocks they hold do not directly collect a significant portion of their revenue from the technology, according to people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg News first reported the SEC's discussions with companies over their funds' proposed names.
But the funds - Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF and Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF - will nonetheless trade with the tickers BLOK and BLCN.
Bitcoin's 1,500 percent surge last year stoked investor demand for any product with exposure to the asset.
Bitcoin last fell 15.5 percent to $11,500 on the Bitstamp exchange following reports suggesting South Korea could ban trading in cryptocurrencies.
The Reality Shares fund's backers have said that buying companies that use blockchain to cut costs or start new business lines is a more conservative approach to investing than buying bitcoin directly because those companies are dependent on more factors than just that technology succeeding.
Eastman Kodak Co shares more than doubled last week after the one-time photography leader said it would launch a cryptocurrency called KODAKCoin.
Soft drinks maker Long Island Iced Tea's shares have doubled since that company shifted its focus to blockchain and changed its name to Long Blockchain Corp.

Three other companies have filed proposals for funds that invest primarily in stocks with blockchain exposure.

Adding an extra exchange could help NYSE earn more revenue from trading and market data sales, as well as help the exchange operator maintain its No. 1 position in U.S. stock trading volumes, ahead of Cboe Global Markets and Nasdaq Inc. NYSE also competes against IEX Group and the Chicago Stock Exchange.
NYSE closed its deal to buy the National Stock Exchange Inc on Jan. 31, 2017 and then shuttered the exchange on Feb. 1. Since then NYSE has shifted the exchange over its trading technology platform Pillar.

NYSE has said it would seek input from the trading industry before finalizing operational plans for NYSE National's launch.

The IPA Bellwether report, conducted by IHS Markit, showed that 23.9 percent of marketing executives raised their budgets during the quarter but pressure to cut costs and protect profitability led to 15.2 percent of those surveyed cutting their marketing budgets.
The resulting net rise of 8.6 percent was lower than an increase 9.9 percent in the previous quarter and the lowest since the start of 2016, the report said.
Rising inflation - driven largely by the pound's fall since Britain's vote in 2016 to leave the European Union - has squeezed household incomes, causing broader economic growth to slow.
""The current trend in growth ... is nonetheless consistent with an economy undermined by ongoing Brexit uncertainty and an increasingly common ""wait-and-see"" attitude amongst businesses and consumers alike,"" Paul Smith, Director at IHS Markit, said.
Smith said that companies had adopted a similar attitude towards their marketing budgets and were willing to spend on ""perceived cost-value areas such as digital"", but not on traditionally bigger-ticket media campaigns. 
Around 300 UK marketing professionals, primarily from Britain's top 1,000 companies and across all key business sectors, were interviewed for the survey conducted by IHS Markit on behalf of the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising.
The report showed that Brexit remained a dominant theme for respondents, with a number concerned about the general uncertainty caused by the negotiations and how this may impact business and consumer confidence. 
Some of those surveyed saw growth opportunities brought on by the vote, such as the potential for a boost to tourism from a weaker pound and more trade opportunities with markets outside Europe.
The survey found that growth in advertising spending is expected to be just 0.3 percent in 2018, hurt by pressure on consumer spend from falling wages, despite a boost from the football world cup during the summer.
But it also showed advertising budgets picking up in 2019 with a 0.7 percent rise and a 1 percent increase in 2020.

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Swiss food group Nestle (S:NESN) has agreed to sell its U.S. confectionery business to Italy's Ferrero for $2.8 billion, it said on Tuesday, marking CEO Mark Schneider's first big sale and a small step on its path towards healthier products.
Nestle, the world's biggest packaged-food company, has cited the unit's weak position in the United States, where it trails Hershey (N:HSY), Mars Inc and Lindt, as the rationale for a sale.
For family-owned Ferrero, the cash deal offers a chance for the Italian company to build scale quickly in that key market, where it has done two other deals in the past year. 
The maker of Nutella spread and Ferrero Rocher pralines will become the third-largest chocolate company in the U.S. and globally, according to Euromonitor International. 
For Nestle, which first sold milk chocolate in the 1880s, a consumer shift away from junk and sugary foods has led the Swiss company to focus on ""nutrition, health and wellness"", although it says it is committed to its non-U.S. confectionery business.
However, bankers and analysts have speculated that it could dispose of other weak brands, or even step away from candy altogether by forming a joint venture as it recently did in ice cream. Hershey, which owns Nestle's KitKat brand in the United States, would be the obvious partner, one banker said.
Tuesday's deal only accounts for about 1 percent of Nestle's sales, but is part of a larger shake-up by chief executive Schneider, a healthcare industry veteran one year into the job.
Schneider has been tasked with accelerating Nestle's growth strategy in an increasingly tough environment for multinational food companies due to slowing growth and greater competition from niche, upstart brands. 
Nestle's mass-market chocolate bars, such as BabyRuth, Butterfinger and Crunch, have underperformed rivals for years as consumers have turned towards healthier snacks such as fruit bars and premium chocolate brands such as Lindt (S:LISN).
Nestle said last week it was selling Australian chocolate bar Violet Crumble. The company is expanding into consumer health, bidding for the vitamin and supplements business being sold by Germany's Merck (DE:MRCG) after agreeing last month to buy vitamin maker Atrium Innovations. 
""The switch of assets makes a lot of sense,"" Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said of the moves out of U.S. chocolate and into vitamins. ""You're going out of a weak business in terms of financials and ... entering a market with strong growth and higher margins. 
Nestle paid $2.3 billion for Atrium, which has about $700 million in annual sales. The chocolate business, which it is selling for $2.8 billion, has about $900 million in sales. 
Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt estimates the deal represents a multiple of roughly 20.7 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, which he said ""feels like quite a top multiple"". 
Waldschmidt pointed to the recent sale of Reckitt Benckiser's (L:RB) food business, which is higher margin, at 20.3 times EBITDA. 
Third Point, the U.S.-based hedge fund that has pushed Nestle to boost returns, was not immediately available to comment. 
CHOCOLATE WOES 
The United States accounts for nearly 19 percent of a global chocolate market worth $102.3 billion at retail, according to Euromonitor. The value of the market has been buoyed by people increasingly choosing more expensive treats, but volume has been weighed down by the popularity of other alternatives.
Nestle has lost market share in recent years, as start-up brands like Kind have grown quickly.
Even Lindt, whose Lindor chocolate balls command premium prices, has felt the pain, reporting on Tuesday that 2017 organic sales rose only 3.7 percent, below its long-term target of 6 to 8 percent. Sales in North America fell 1.6 percent.

Ferrero was advised by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Lazard while Davis Polk and Wardwell acted as its legal adviser.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A second winter storm in as many weeks is causing hundreds of flight cancellations across the United States, airlines reported on Tuesday, potentially dealing a further blow to carriers' first quarter outlooks. 
As the storm sweeps across southeast Texas and up the East Coast dumping snow, sleet and freezing rain, airlines have already canceled flights into Wednesday in anticipation of difficult conditions.
American Airlines (O:AAL), the world's largest airline by passenger traffic, had canceled some 270 flights between Tuesday and Wednesday as a result of the storm, it said. 
Rival Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), the No. 2 U.S. carrier by passenger traffic, said it had canceled about 275 Tuesday flights and expected additional cancellations in New York and Boston as the storm tracked north. 
The third-largest U.S. carrier, United Airlines (N:UAL), said it had canceled more than 700 flights on Tuesday. United was offering to waive fees for changes to flights to and from Boston, New York, Philadelphia and other affected airports for scheduled Tuesday and Wednesday flights. 
The storm itself is relatively minor compared to other winter weather events, and several hundred flights represent only a tiny percentage of airlines' overall operations. But such storms are still a nuisance to carriers and can cost them millions of dollars in lost revenue. 

A massive winter storm at the onset of the year caused thousands of cancellations, as several inches of snow and ice paralyzed the U.S. Northeast and forced the closure of some of the region's biggest airports.

Hunter Harrison, CSX's former chief executive and a veteran railroader cherished by investors for leading turnarounds of Canadian railroads, died in December, just eight months into his restructuring campaign at CSX.
Investors have been searching for clarity on how new CEO Jim Foote will handle Harrison's turnaround plan that includes deep job cuts and rail yard closures and triggered persistent service disruptions, customer complaints and federal scrutiny.
""CSX's performance continued to strengthen in the fourth quarter, building upon the scheduled railroading model that was instituted by Hunter Harrison,"" Foote said in a statement.
The company's stock, which hit a record high in regular trading, was down 0.64 percent after the bell.
CSX said its freight volumes dropped 8 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31, hurt by lower shipments of commodities it hauls, such as vehicles and chemicals.
The Jacksonville, Florida-based railroad said revenue fell 6 percent to $2.86 billion from a year earlier, which included an extra week.

However, the railroad's operating ratio, a closely watched measure of operating costs as a percentage of revenue, fell to 60.9 percent from 67 percent. A lower operating ratio shows improvement in profitability.

(Reuters) - A federal judge in Philadelphia on Tuesday rejected  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's bid to dismiss that city's lawsuit accusing the largest U.S. mortgage lender of predatory lending targeting black and Hispanic borrowers.
U.S. District Judge Anita Brody said Philadelphia may pursue claims that the bank's alleged ""reverse redlining"" violated the federal Fair Housing Act, though she had ""serious concerns"" about whether claims of economic harm could survive.
Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said in an email that the decision, ""while disappointing, in no way suggests that the claims ultimately will prevail. Wells Fargo has been a part of the Philadelphia community for more than 140 years and we are prepared to defend our record as a fair and responsible lender.""
Mike Dunn, a spokesman for Philadelphia, said the city ""looks forward to developing further evidence of Wells Fargo's alleged discriminatory practices.""
The lawsuit is one of several against big lenders by major U.S. cities claiming that mortgage lending discrimination causes more defaults by minority borrowers, lower property tax revenue, and higher costs to combat crime and blight.
It is separate from the scandal over the creation by San Francisco-based Wells Fargo of unauthorized customer accounts.
The third-largest U.S. bank by assets on Friday said it set aside $3.25 billion last quarter to cover litigation for those accounts and other issues.
Philadelphia accused Wells Fargo of having since 2004 steered minority borrowers into higher-cost, higher-risk loans than white borrowers, even if they qualified for safer loans.
It also said black and Hispanic borrowers were respectively 4.1 times and 2.6 times more likely to go into foreclosure on those costlier, riskier loans.
Wells Fargo countered that Philadelphia could not show that bank policies had a disparate impact on minority borrowers, and that the city's claims could not be substantiated, were too ""remote"" from any improper conduct, or were brought too late.
Brody found ""some direct relation between discriminatory lending and the harms to the city's goals of fair housing and an integrated community,"" such as reduced minority homeownership or greater impediments for minorities to buy homes.
The judge expressed ""serious concerns about the viability of the economic injury aspect of the city's claim with regard to proximate cause,"" but said Wells Fargo did not show why the entire FHA claim should be dismissed.
Philadelphia had 1.57 million residents in 2016, ranking sixth among U.S. cities. The 2010 census said roughly 43 percent of Philadelphians were black and 12 percent were Hispanic.

The case is City of Philadelphia v Wells Fargo & Co et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, No. 17-02203.

Eurozone Inflation
Economists forecast the final reading of Eurozone inflation for December to remain unchanged at 1.4% from an earlier reading.
Inflation has trailed the European Central Bank’s target, of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.
The inflation report comes amid a Reuters report, citing sources close to the ECB, suggesting that the central bank was unlikely to alter its policy message at next week’s meeting.
EUR/USD fell 0.08% to $1.2256.
Beige Book, Fed Speakers, Industrial Data 
Economists forecast industrial production rose 0.3% in December, a notch faster than the 0.9% growth in the previous month.
The Federal Reserve’s beige book, a report that includes anecdotal evidence on the health of the US economy from 12 regions is expected to be closely parsed by market participants for clues on the path of U.S. monetary policy and the progress of the economy.
Speeches by Fed members' Evans, Kaplan and Mester, will follow the Beige report and could offer additional insight into the Fed’s thinking on monetary policy. Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan said recently he expects three US rate hikes in 2018 as the “base case.”
The dollar traded higher against its rivals on Tuesday but remained close to three-year lows.
Bank of Canada Rate Decision
The Bank of Canada (BoC) is expected to add to its two rate hikes in 2017 and raise rates on Wednesday by 0.25% to 1.25% following a raft of positive economic data.
Investors will parse the accompanying statement from the BoC to gauge the mood of the central bank for further tightening at policy meetings later this year.
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) uncertainty has dominated Canadian dollar direction over the past week, Action Economics said, but added that it doesn’t expect the uncertainty to weigh on the Bank of Canada’s interest rate decision.

842,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 04:12PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer bureau to reconsider payday lending rule,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said on Tuesday that it intends to reconsider a recent rule that would significantly curb payday lending.
The rule, finalized in October under a President Barack Obama appointee and set to begin taking effect this year, would require lenders to determine if borrowers can repay debts and cap the number of loans that lenders could make to a borrower.
The decision to revisit the rule, which applies to small-dollar advances typically repaid on the borrower's next payday, could mark the beginning of the most significant policy shifts since the Trump administration took control of the agency at the end of November.
Mick Mulvaney, the agency's acting director and President Donald Trump's budget director, had previously said he supported efforts by the U.S. Congress to undo the rule and was exploring his options for revisiting the rule as it takes effect.
""The Bureau intends to engage in a rulemaking process so that the Bureau may reconsider the Payday Rule,"" the CFPB said in a statement, noting that while the rule officially took effect Tuesday, lenders have until August 2019 to comply with most of its provisions.
The bureau also said it would consider granting waivers to any company that is beginning to prepare for one of the rule's first requirements, which takes effect in April. That part of the rule requires companies that examine a borrower's financial background on behalf of lenders to register with the regulator.
The CFPB's payday rules marked one of the last major regulatory projects under the agency's original director, Richard Cordray, an Obama appointee who resigned in November. The agency had worked on the rules for five years.
It was one of the agency's more contentious projects. Consumer advocates and Democratic supporters of the CFPB argued strict rules policing payday lenders were necessary. The CFPB under Cordray found low-income borrowers ended up trapped in a cycle of high-interest loans, winding up with the equivalent of a 300 percent interest rate.
But critics said that the rule would devastate an industry serving 30 million customers, many of whom lack access to more traditional banking products. The CFPB estimated its rule would lower the industry's revenue by two-thirds.
Efforts are under way to repeal the rule in Congress, but it is unclear if a resolution to do so can garner sufficient support to pass. The payday lending rule was also expected to face legal challenges from companies impacted by it.

843,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>","Greenlight's Einhorn bets on Brighthouse, makes money on GM","BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager David Einhorn told investors on Tuesday that he made a ""large"" bet on insurer Brighthouse Financial late last year, and had made money on General Motors (NYSE:GM) but lost by shorting Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Einhorn's Greenlight Capital bought into Brighthouse, MetLife's former U.S. retail life-insurance business, at an average cost of $57.92, according to a letter sent to clients and seen by Reuters. The stock is now trading at $63.90.
The fund manager said General Motors, which was his firm's biggest winner last year, remains ""significantly under valued"" given the automaker's ""impressive fundamental performance.""
But Einhorn also said he again lost money by betting that a group of fast-growing technology stocks, including Amazon, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Tesla, would fall. ""The biggest losers for the year were our short positions on the 'bubble basket',"" Einhorn wrote.
Greenlight Capital, whose annualized 15.4 percent return over more than two decades make it one of the world's most closely watched hedge funds, posted only a modest return in 2017. The firm's 1.6 percent gain trailed the Standard & Poor's 500 21.8 percent gain and Einhorn said it was a tough year for so-called value investors like himself.
""While it feels like we have been running face first into the wind, we don't intend to capitulate and are sticking to our strategy of being long (on) misunderstood value and shorting 'not value',"" he wrote.
Greenlight made money on German energy company Uniper and performance chemicals business Chemours, and took new stakes in offshore rigs operator Ensco and social media company Twitter.
Time Warner was bought again because Greenlight thinks the planned merger with AT&T (NYSE:T) will go through. And if it doesn't, ""TWX has several strategic options to create value,"" said Einhorn.
Einhorn was candid about his losses, noting that his bet on pharmacy retailer Rite Aid, in which he invested at $7.45 a share, did not turn out the way he expected. He exited at $2.78 a share.
Greenlight is still betting that the price of gold will rise, but Einhorn said the firm lost money on the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and got out. ""We don't need additional exposure to mining equities to express that view,"" he wrote.

844,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 03:54PM ET</span>",Warning light: Mexican car sales slump ahead of election,"By Sharay Angulo and Anthony Esposito
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Car dealerships in Mexico City have kicked off the new year offering ""clearance sales"" and free insurance as 2017 models collect dust on their lots, a reminder that consumer nerves over high interest rates could slow the economy ahead of elections.
The first drop in auto sales in eight years is the most visible sign the great Mexican shopper, the heart and soul of Latin America's second largest economy, is feeling the pinch of inflation at a 16-1/2-year high and a battered peso. 
A government decision to scrap fuel subsidies last year has made running a car more expensive, while the central bank's battle with inflation has put car loans out of reach for many. 
""If I'm going to buy a new car and then not be able to fill it up with gasoline, then it's better to sit tight,"" said Jaime Asrael, as he window shopped outside a Chevrolet dealership in the central Guerrero neighborhood of the capital city.
Beyond cars, consumer confidence is slipping more broadly. The consumer confidence index declined to 88.4 in December from 88.8 the previous month, the statistics agency said last week.
This has worried government officials who are trying to convince voters to re-elect the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in July. Experts doubt increased public spending in the campaign will be enough to boost confidence much in Mexico, where private consumption accounts for a whopping two-thirds of gross domestic product.
Leftist opposition candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has enjoyed a double digit poll lead over his ruling party rival in recent surveys.
""It certainly helps his case. The fact that we've seen this jump in inflation squeezing real incomes, that all (goes) into the mix,"" said Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
A blow such as an eventual collapse of talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement could make more consumers snap their wallets shut.
""I wouldn't be surprised if we see a more significant deceleration of private consumption"" considering inflation's impact on wages, tighter credit conditions and NAFTA and election concerns, said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos.
""Instead of going on vacation for two weeks, they go one week, instead of buying the automobile this year they wait a little bit to see how things go ... That is serious in the sense that private consumption has been so far the main engine of growth,"" said Ramos.
Domestic car sales in 2017 fell 4.6 percent from a year earlier, according to data from the Mexican Auto Industry Association (AMIA). It was the first drop in annual auto sales since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.
""Inflation is what hit us the most. And most people want to buy with credit and financial institutions and banks weren't able to cover the market,"" said Jose Luis Salas, general manager at Grupo Surman, which runs 13 General Motors (N:GM) dealerships in the country.
""That's what caused the drop in new car sales,"" he added.
Wider retail sales slowed to growth of 7.7 percent through November, not far above the 2017 inflation rate of 6.77 percent and below the average growth of some 10 percent the prior two years.
For years, stable prices compensated for Mexico's sluggish economic growth, so accelerating inflation has caused outrage. Sporadic looting broke out earlier this month after reports that gasoline and food prices were about to be hiked, and angry posts filled social media, echoing unrest last year after the government liberalized fuel prices.
The central bank in November revised down its 2017 economic growth forecast, blaming the NAFTA talks, the impact of storms and two major earthquakes in September, and a drop in domestic oil production to the lowest in more than 20 years.
It forecast economic growth of 1.8 percent to 2.3 percent in 2017 and 2 to 3 percent in 2018.

The bank, which in December hiked its key rate to a consumption-sapping, nearly nine-year high of 7.25 percent, said it expected a ""nascent deceleration"" in consumer spending. It is widely expected to raise rates again in February, according to bets in the interest rate swap market .

850,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 02:55PM ET</span>","Global stocks retreat from early gains as oil, copper fall","By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets edged lower on Tuesday, giving back earlier gains as Wall Street retreated from initial highs as a decline in oil and metals weighed on the energy and materials sectors. 
Wall Street initially moved higher, as the Dow breached the 26,000 mark for the first time. The healthcare sector, up 0.52 percent, provided support to the upside, with Merck (N:MRK) up 6.9 percent and UnitedHealth (N:UNH) up 2.3 percent. 
UnitedHealth posted quarterly results that topped analyst estimates and raised its 2018 outlook, bolstering optimism for another solid quarter for corporate earnings.
Earnings growth for the quarter is forecast at 11.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data through Tuesday morning. 
But each of the major Wall Street indexes fell into negative territory as materials (SPLRCM), down 1.3 percent and energy (SPNY), off 1.2 percent, slumped.
Oil prices eased from three-year highs as traders booked profits from the rally but healthy demand underpinned prices near $70, a level not seen since 2014's market slump.
U.S. crude  fell 0.68 percent to $63.86 per barrel and Brent  was last at $69.28, down 1.39 percent on the day. 
Copper  lost 1.37 percent to $7,111.50 a tonne, touching a 3-1/2 week low following strong gains late last year and as worries lingered over fading demand in China.
""Copper has had a huge run and so has oil, frankly,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas.
""When you have big gains in anything and you have a lot of unrealized profits out there, whether it is equities or commodities that have gone straight up, there is reason to take some profits off the table, put on some hedges."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 8.82 points, or 0.03 percent, to 25,794.37, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 8.74 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,777.5 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 33.00 points, or 0.45 percent, to 7,228.07.
 Citigroup  (N:C) shares rose 0.4 percent to $77.15 after earnings topped expectations, the latest major U.S. bank to post results for the fourth quarter. The S&P financial index (SPSY) is up nearly 5 percent to start the year.
Shares in Europe closed little changed as commodity stocks also weighed.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index (FTEU3) percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) shed 0.04 percent after hitting a record for a third straight session. 
The euro  turned higher after briefly pulling back from a three-year high, up 0.11 percent to $1.2274 while the dollar gave up its earlier gains and remained near three-year lows.

U.S. long-dated Treasury yields rose as equities retreated. Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) last rose 3/32 in price to yield 2.5426 percent, from 2.552 percent late on Friday.

851,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 02:55PM ET</span>","GE renews break-up talk after $11 billion insurance, tax hit","By Alwyn Scott and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co again raised the prospect of breaking up the conglomerate on Tuesday as it announced more than $11 billion in charges from its long-term care insurance portfolio and new U.S. tax laws.
Chief Executive John Flannery has previously raised the idea of selling pieces of the largest U.S. industrial company, as he slashes thousands of jobs and moves to cut $3.5 billion in costs to counter a plunge in profits and cash flow. 
Flannery inherited a host of problems when he became CEO on Aug. 1, such as falling sales of power turbines, a build-up of inventory and declining profit margins in some businesses. 
His statements on Tuesday showed that the idea of a break-up remains part of GE's thinking, though not a certainty. 
""I would categorize it as an examination of options and it's (the) kind of thing that could result in many, many different permutations, including separately traded assets really in any one of our units, if that's what made sense,"" he said in response to an analyst question on a conference call, without giving any details.
GE said it will provide another update on its review in the spring. A decision could come then, CNBC reported, citing sources close to GE, adding that a break-up was ""likely.""
Earlier on Tuesday, GE said its finance arm, GE Capital, would take a $7.5 billion after-tax charge in the fourth quarter from a reevaluation of its insurance assets. It will also take a $1.8 billion charge for non-cash impairments at GE Capital.
""We've seen this movie before"" with GE, said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ""They say they're adequately reserved until they're not. And then you see a parade of incremental reserve charges.""
GE shares were down 3.9 percent at $18.03 in afternoon trading. At that level, the company has a market capitalization of about $156 billion. 
INSURANCE RETHINK
The insurance charge is the latest sign of problems with the modeling and funding of nursing home and other long-term care in the United States. 
GE said it reviewed policy assumptions with actuaries and accountants after seeing that payouts had begun to exceed premiums on a portfolio of about 300,000 policies that stem from businesses GE acquired in the 1980s and 1990s. GE sold most of those business last decade and has not written such policies since 2006. 
The review, concluded a week ago, showed GE needed to set aside $15 billion through 2024, including $3 billion in the current quarter, to cover potential payouts on the policies it retained. 
""Clearly, in hindsight, we under-appreciated the risk,"" Flannery said.
GE Capital last year temporarily suspended paying dividends to GE. Now, GE Capital will suspend its dividend for the ""foreseeable future"" to help fund the reserve, GE said.
The problem was flagged in July when GE said ""adverse claims"" were appearing in part of its long-term care portfolio and it was assessing how much policy-holders would likely pay. 
TAX CHANGE CHARGE
Tax changes recently passed by the U.S. Congress raised GE's fourth-quarter charge to $7.5 billion, more than twice an initial indication of more than $3 billion that GE had noted in November. GE also will record a $3.4-billion impact from tax reform and $1.8 billion in goodwill and other non-cash impairments, all in the fourth quarter.
The charges means GE's 2017 profit will be at the bottom end of its forecast, GE said. 
Flannery said in November that GE would pare its operations to three main businesses - power, healthcare and aviation - and seek to dispose of $20 billion in operations. He also said further major portfolio changes were being considered. Asked how his strategy had evolved since November, Flannery said: 
""We've been taking a comprehensive look at every aspect of the company and that everything was on the table. So that's been, I'd say, a hallmark of our approach from day one."" 
GE said the Kansas Insurance Department - the primary regulator for North American Life & Health, GE Capital's insurance portfolio - had approved the phased $15 billion reserve payments through 2024. 
The set-aside highlights long-running difficulties for long-term care insurers and re-insurers who are struggling to make good on policies dating back decades that underestimated projected health-care costs and life spans.
The cost of nursing home or home-based elderly care tends not to be covered by Medicare, the U.S. government insurance program, and can be extremely expensive out of pocket.
GE was the worst performer on the Dow in 2017 and it has already cut its planned annual dividend for 2018 in half, only the third cut in the company's 125-year history.

Even after the stock's declines, it trades at only a slight discount to industrial peers, trading at about 18 times this year's expected earnings.

LONDON/CAMBRIDGE, England (Reuters) - Britain ordered a fast-track inquiry into the role played by Carillion's directors in the failure of the construction and services group, as some of its thousands of small suppliers started to lay off workers on Tuesday.
The 200-year-old company, swamped by debt and pension liabilities and burning through cash, went into liquidation on Monday, threatening suppliers, merchants and big banks. 
The government, which relies on big outsourcing companies such as Carillion to provide services from school dinners to road building, stepped in to guarantee that key contracts would be unaffected. 
But it said other work would only be paid for 48 hours after the collapse, and thousands of small suppliers face unpaid bills totaling millions of pounds.
Business Secretary Greg Clark said a full picture of the events which caused Carillion to enter liquidation needed to be established by the Insolvency Service.
""I have asked that the investigation looks not only at the conduct of the directors at the point of its insolvency, but also of any individuals who were previously directors,"" he said. 
""Any evidence of misconduct will be taken very seriously.""
Carillion's auditors, KPMG, would also be examined, he added.
Carillion was responsible for providing millions of pounds of public services as well as major infrastructure projects in Britain, Canada and the Middle East. It was winning state contracts as recently as November.
HUNDREDS OF PROJECTS
Rudi Klein, head of Britain's Specialist Engineering Contractors' Group, estimated that Carillion had left a trail of 1.2 billion pounds in unpaid bills to thousands of small subcontractors.
Examples of private companies that could be hit included a small Northern Irish engineering contractor owed 150,000 pounds and a concrete frame manufacturer in northwest England owed 2 million pounds, Klein said.
Flora-tec, a corporate horticulture company based in Cambridgeshire, eastern England, said it is owed almost 1 million pounds for its work on Carillion contracts at local prisons, schools and hospitals, and had to lay off 10 of its 90 staff. 
""People were in tears, colleagues we worked with for a long time. But as soon as we knew what happened we had to cut our cost base,"" Managing Director Andy Bradley said.
He told Reuters he felt he had been misled.
""Government, even despite several profit warnings, continued to give Carillion large public sector contracts (...) and the message that sends to businesses like mine, the small guys in the supply chain, is that central government must have confidence in Carillion,"" he said.
""I want the government to think long and hard about the SME sector, because we are the people that will bear the brunt of this, not the shareholders and not the big multinational conglomerates.""
OUTSOURCING BRITAIN
Britain began outsourcing public services in the late 1980s under Margaret Thatcher and the model expanded under successive governments. It is now the world's second-largest outsourcing market behind the United States.
Spun out of Tarmac nearly 20 years ago and incorporating construction names such as Wimpey and Alfred McAlpine, Carillion operated in Britain and Ireland, Canada, the Middle East and North Africa.
It was working on 450 British government projects, including the building and maintenance of hospitals, schools, defense sites and a high-speed rail line.
The government has faced questions as to why it continued to award Carillion contracts after it first signaled it was in financial difficulty in July last year. 
Just a week after that first warning, Carillion was named as one of the contractors on Britain's new High Speed 2 rail line, a flagship project that will better connect London with the north of England. In November, it won a further two contracts with state-owned Network Rail.
Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said it was vital that Carillion's small business suppliers were paid, or some of those firms could themselves be put in jeopardy, putting even more jobs at risk.
""When the dust settles on this sorry saga, there is also a wider lesson to learn about the concentration of public contracts in the hands of a small number of very big businesses,"" he said.
Carillion former chief executive Richard Howson, who stepped down after the group warned on profit in July, was paid more than 1.51 million pounds ($2.08 million) in salary and bonuses in 2016, according to the company's annual report.

He will continue to be paid a 660,000-pound salary until Oct. 2018 under the terms of his notice when he left the group in November, after handing over to interim CEO Keith Cochrane, according to a statement on the company's website.

(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) posted an $18-billion quarterly loss on Tuesday because of charges related to a new U.S. tax law, but its adjusted earnings beat Wall Street expectations and management signaled that the bank may soon lift financial performance targets.
The law, signed by President Donald Trump last month, has made fourth-quarter earnings a messy ordeal for big banks. It forces them to take one-time hits on earnings held abroad and changes the treatment of deferred tax assets, both of which affect Citigroup in particular.
However, banks and other large U.S. corporations expect to benefit greatly from lower taxes and other provisions in the new law over the long term.
Citigroup, the fourth-largest U.S. lender, stands to gain less than peers because it already earns about half of its profits in lower-tax countries abroad. Even so, it expects its tax rate to fall to about 25 percent this year from 30 percent in 2017. That could save the bank billions of dollars over the next few years.
The changes will not only boost Citigroup's profits, but allow the bank to generate higher returns and generate more capital, Chief Executive Michael Corbat said. The new law might also stimulate economic growth because it incentivizes companies to invest in their businesses and has led to wage hikes that could help consumers, he said.
""Tax reform is a clear net positive for Citi and its shareholders,"" Corbat said on a conference call with analysts.
Management is now examining financial performance targets set before the tax law changes to see whether they should be lifted, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said on a separate call with journalists.
Based on the tax savings alone, Citigroup expects to generate a return on tangible common equity of 10.5 percent this year, 12 percent next year and 13 percent in 2020, higher than previous forecasts. That metric is closely watched by Wall Street as a gauge of how much profit a bank can generate from shareholder money.
Executives also expect inflation to boost Citigroup's net interest income as the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to lift rates this year. For every 25 basis points the Fed lifts rates, Citi should generate another $80 million of revenue, Gerspach said.
Citigroup shares rose 0.4 percent to $77.12 in morning trading.
Lagging competitors in growth and not earning its cost of capital, Citigroup's valuation has not kept up with rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). Investors and analysts have been pushing Citi to prove it can grow revenue and profits as a second act to shrinking and returning capital.
The bank already plans to return at least $60 billion worth of capital to investors through stock buybacks and dividends, a target executives reiterated on Tuesday.
Excluding the tax issues, which led to $22 billion in charges, its fourth-quarter earnings were boosted by growth in consumer banking, especially in Asia and Mexico.
Its adjusted net income rose 4 percent to $3.7 billion, or $1.28 per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.19 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Total revenue rose 1.4 percent to $17.26 billion and was slightly better than estimates of $17.22 billion.
Citigroup's institutional business, which includes investment banking and trading, fell 1 percent due to weakness in trading that has also affected Wall Street peers.
Bond trading revenue fell 18 percent due to ongoing weakness in volatility, while equity markets revenue was down 23 percent because of $130 million worth of losses on a derivatives trade with one client.
The client is troubled South African furniture retailer Steinhoff International, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Other lenders, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), also have exposure to Steinhoff, which has been embroiled in an accounting scandal.
In reports on Tuesday morning, several analysts said Citi's results were modestly ahead of Wall Street's best guess and that they were more focused on whether the bank would lift performance targets.
""Results could prove 'good enough' this quarter,"" Instinet analyst Steven Chubak wrote in a note to clients.

Citi's results follow JPMorgan and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) last week. Bank of America Corp and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) plan to report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) expected to report on Thursday.

Adobe, which collects its data by measuring 80 percent of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. web retailers, said the amount was 14.7 percent higher than last year's total.
Mobile platforms made up 52 percent of traffic to retail websites during the November-December period and were responsible for a third of all online spending.
With $6.6 billion spent, Cyber Monday — the Monday after the Thanksgiving holiday — was the largest U.S. shopping day ever.
Nintendo's Switch gaming console, Google's Chromecast, Roku, Hatchimals and Colleggtibles toys and Amazon's Echo speaker were Cyber Monday's top sellers, Adobe Analytics said.
Many brick-and-mortar retailers have spent heavily to move online and improve their delivery services, as people increasingly desert malls and shop online.
U.S. holiday spending across both online and physical stores rose 5.5 percent — the most in 12 years — to $691.9 billion, the National Retail Federation said on Friday.
The figures point to an improving job market and expectations of higher wages and bonuses after the recent tax bill.
 Target  Corp (N:TGT) and Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) last week reported strong holiday sales and raised their earnings forecasts as investments in e-commerce paid off.

However, department store chain Macy's Inc's (N:M) holiday sales rose only modestly and the company said it would close stores and slash thousands of jobs this year.

866,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Be a money superhero and cosplay on a budget,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - If you ever happen to run into Burbank’s Mark Chu-Lin, he might not respond if you call out to him by name.
This will be because he is in character as G.I. Joe - or War Machine from the ""Iron Man"" series, or one of the biker scouts from ""Return of the Jedi.""
The 44-year-old is one of the millions of Americans devoted to “cosplay” – those rabid fans of comics and superhero movies who dress up as their favorite characters, and populate massive events all over the country, with the crown jewel being San Diego’s annual Comic-Con convention.
Be forewarned: Cosplay is not cheap. If you are going to role play, it might help if your superhero power is ""Bottomless Bank Account.""
Chu-Lin, a project analyst, has sometimes spent over $10,000 a year on his hobby – even up to $15,000. “There are conventions, travel and hotels, attendance badges, souvenirs, and the costumes themselves. Suffice it to say, it all adds up,” he said. 
Cosplay lovers were estimated to spend $17.8 billion on costumes worldwide in 2017, according to Shanghai-based research firm CRI. And ticketing firm Eventbrite tabulated more than $600 million in annual fandom convention spending in North America, when it analyzed the data in 2013.
“It is a world that is growing like crazy,” said Robin Rosenberg, a New York City clinical psychologist and executive coach who has written papers on the costs and meaning of cosplay. “People do it for the fun, for the crafting, for the community.”
At events like Comic-Con, 59 percent of fans report sending between $100-$500 on merchandise – not even including basic costs like tickets, food and parking, according to Eventbrite. And 10 percent say they spend more than $500 per show.
Then there are the costumes themselves, which as any cosplay fan knows, can be extremely detailed and elaborate. Thirty percent of cosplay fans report spending between $100-$200 per costume, Rosenberg noted in her research paper “Expressions of Fandom.” Meanwhile 24 percent spent between $200-$400, and 13 percent said they spent $400 or more.
Among that last group: Caitlin Kagawa, a 29-year-old student from Los Angeles, who has been going out recently as Poe Dameron, the hunky X-Wing pilot in the recent ""Star Wars"" movies. 
Cosplay does not necessarily have to break the bank, but you do have to be strategic to prevent spending from getting out of control. 
Some advice from cosplay veterans:
* Volunteer
Many diehards get free access to the big shows by helping out. That will eat up some of your time, but the savings are significant: It costs San Diego Comic-Con currently costs over $250 to attend the whole show - if you can even get passes (they are already sold out for 2018).
* Get crafty
Break out the sewing machine and the BeDazzler. 
That is what Caitlin Kagawa did to transform herself into Poe Dameron - getting a specialty kit to make the helmet, doing some 3D printing, and ordering high-quality twill fabric. “It still cost me a fortune,” she lamented. “I’m trying to approximate the real fabrics in the film, but I’m working with personal money – and they have Disney and Lucasfilm money!”
* Choose your character wisely. 
If you have to stick to a tight budget, Chu-Lin advises something simple and classic like a Star Trek redshirt (those unfortunate staffers who tend to get killed in battle). A corollary of this character choice: If you are traveling to a show that is not local, a bulky, elaborate costume will have to be shipped ahead. And that costs money, too.
* Ask for help.
Cosplay fans are a tight-knit community, and very generous, said Rosenberg. So if your outfit is falling apart, someone from your fandom’s Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) groups or message boards will undoubtedly step in. (Super glue and duct tape help too, she added.)
In the same manner, buddying up with fellow fans to go to conventions will save a bundle. Kagawa usually splits a hotel room with others when she goes to San Diego, and so only has to pay around $350 for lodging for multiple days.

“Do it because you love it,” said Kagawa. ""Because it’s not cheap.”

885,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 12:05PM ET</span>","GM sees flat 2018 earnings, with pickups picking up in 2019","By Nick Carey and Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) shares rose on Tuesday after the company said 2018 earnings will be largely flat compared with 2017 and forecast higher profits in 2019 when its revamped line of high-margin pickup trucks hits the U.S. market.
The 2018 earnings outlook was above market expectations, sending GM shares up about 2 percent in midday trading.
GM forecast 2017 earnings per share at the high end of its previously forecast range of $6 to $6.50. The company expects earnings for 2018 to be roughly the same as in 2017. Analysts have predicted full-year 2017 earnings per share of $6.30, and $5.98 a share in 2018.
""If the guidance is as positive as we interpret it, this could be the positive catalyst that we expected, and sets up a solid ’18,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Brian Johnson wrote in a client note. 
The company and its Detroit rivals,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA), are bringing on new trucks at a time when overall U.S. new vehicle sales have been falling, but truck sales continue to grow as consumers abandon passenger cars in favor of pickups, SUVs and crossovers.
President Dan Ammann said GM's new line of pickups should generate improved profit from increased production of higher-priced, four-door crew cab trucks, and expanded sales of luxury truck models. 
GM said in a presentation on Tuesday its Denali line of luxury pickups has average transaction prices of about $55,600, higher than the average for  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz brand, or GM's own Cadillac luxury brand.
Chief Executive Mary Barra said during a meeting with reporters the automaker will boost investment in electric vehicles, but declined to say by how much. Rival automakers have used the Detroit auto show to tout multi-billion dollar investments in electrification.
GM said it expects capital expenditure in 2018 of around $8.5 billion, about $1 billion of which will go toward self-driving car technology. In future years, Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens said total capital spending should decrease.
Last week, the company said it was seeking U.S. government approval for a fully autonomous car - one without a steering wheel, brake pedal or accelerator pedal - to join GM's first commercial ride-sharing fleet in 2019.
Barra also said GM will not follow other companies that have given employees special bonuses tied to tax cuts by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, which slashed the top U.S. corporate tax rate. 
Instead, Barra said if GM has higher profits because of lower U.S. taxes, GM employees, including union-represented U.S. factory workers, should see larger bonuses or profit-sharing checks based on existing pay formulas. 
In a client note, Buckingham Research Group analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote that GM's 2018 earnings outlook includes a ""lower statutory corporate tax rate, so on an apples-to-apples basis, this appears to be an effective EPS guide down.""
""We believe the stock will fade after investors understand that the implied EPS guide is for a year-on-year decline, as we and consensus are forecasting,"" Amaturo wrote.
GM faces challenges in 2018 from the costs of launching the new large pickup trucks, rising interest rates in the United States and a likely decline in overall U.S. vehicle sales, Stevens said.
However, Stevens said wage growth could offset the impact of higher interest rates for consumers buying vehicles.
Barra, Ammann and Stevens declined to say when investments in self-driving vehicle services and electrification will return profits. They pointed to the potential for new trucks and SUVs, a new, low-cost car for international markets, and the Cadillac luxury brand, to improve future earnings.
Cadillac profits should double from current levels by 2021, GM said, riding growing sales in China and new products planned for the United States to replace a current crop of slow-selling sedans. Stevens did not disclose current profit figures for Cadillac.
GM said on Tuesday that while it retools a factory in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, to make the new pickup trucks, it will shift some production to an Oshawa, Ontario, plant in order to build up to 60,000 vehicles and avoid missing sales.
The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it will record a $7 billion non-cash charge for its fourth-quarter 2017 earnings related to deferred tax assets that will lose their value because of the lower U.S. corporate tax rate.

GM shares rose 2.2 percent to $45.04 in noon trading.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Inventory levels at multi-brand watch retailers are still too high, two top industry executives said on Tuesday, suggesting a robust recovery in luxury watch sales may be some way off. 
Swiss watchmakers are just emerging from a severe downturn, helped by a recovery in demand among their biggest customer group - Chinese shoppers - and echoing a broader pick-up in luxury goods industries from fine wines to designer clothes. 
But the problem of overproduction and resulting excess stock at watch retailers - which forced some labels into buybacks, in part to prevent their wares from being sold off at steep discounts - is still present, the executives said.
""Inventories at retailers are still huge, especially in Asia. Some brands bought back unsold watches, but the problem has not been solved,"" Richard Mille, head of the eponymous independent label told Reuters in an interview at the SIHH watch fair in Geneva. 
""It seems that some people in the watch industry just don't learn the lessons of the past. As soon as demand picks up, they flood the market,"" he said. 
Laurent Dordet, head of Hermes' watch business, said the brand's own stock levels were healthy. But ""many of our competitors still have overcapacity and produce too many watches that jam the retail network,"" he said. 
The mood in the aisles of the Geneva show, as well as on luxury group LVMH's boat moored in the city, was brighter than in previous years, with brands such as Audemars Piguet and LVMH's Hublot forecasting further growth in 2018.
But the sales recovery so far has been largely limited to watchmakers' own stores, while multi-brand retailers are struggling as many have cash tied up in outdated models that no longer sell. 
Cartier-owner Richemont, which made large inventory buybacks during the downturn, reported a 13 percent rise in constant currency sales in its own stores in the quarter to Dec. 31, but a 3 percent decline at third-party retailers that still represent more than a third of group sales. 
Swiss watch exports, which reflect brands' sales to retail partners, rose a modest 2.8 percent in the first eleven months of 2017. 
Audemars Piguet, Hermes' watch unit, Roger Dubuis, Parmigiani and Richard Mille all said they were closing points of sales at third-party retailers. 
CONSOLIDATION 
The problems at multi-brand stores have already led to some consolidation, ultimately shrinking the number of such outlets. Last year, Canada's Birks Group sold its U.S.-based subsidiary Mayor's Jewelers to Britain's Aurum Holdings.
""There are too many retailers, this cannot go on. Their margins have shrunk, they have financial problems,"" Mille said.
Patrick Pruniaux, chief executive of Kering's Ulysse Nardin brand, said he was comfortable that his brand relied entirely on third-party sellers, but also said he expected further mergers and acquisitions among retailers as some were just not up to the new challenges in their industry.
Cartier said on Monday its inventories had returned to healthy levels, but it might still resort to selective buybacks.
Berenberg analyst Zuzanna Pusz said in a note on Tuesday that Richemont's close monitoring of the wholesale market suggested inventory levels were still too high.

BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of German industrial workers downed tools on Tuesday in support of trade union IG Metall's demands for a 6 percent pay rise and a right to the first new cut in weekly working hours since the 1980s.
Workers have been staging such warning strikes since last week, a common tactic in sectoral wage negotiations in Germany. About 33,000 workers took part on Tuesday, including 10,000 at Mercedes maker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), taking the total to 425,000 since last week.
With Europe's largest economy steaming ahead and unemployment at a record low, Germany's biggest trade union is confident of winning a significantly better deal for around 3.9 million workers in the metal and engineering sectors.
IG Metall said it would decide next Friday, after the current round of wage talks, whether to escalate the dispute into 24-hour strikes.
""The proposal that the employers have made is far from fair,"" IG Metall chief Joerg Hofmann told a news conference in Frankfurt. ""An offer of a 2 percent wage rise is more like a provocation.""
IG Metall is demanding that workers should be able to cut their weekly hours to 28 from 35 if they need to care for children, elderly or sick relatives and get the right to return to work full-time after two years. 
The union said it had beefed up its strike war chest by 84 million euros last year thanks to membership dues that rose 2 percent to 561 million euros.
""We have plenty of staying power,"" said treasurer Juergen Kerner. ""Our strike coffers are well filled.""
Flash strikes also took place on Tuesday at Schaeffler (DE:SHA_p), Bosch Rexroth [ROBG.UL], ZF Friedrichshafen [ZFF.UL],  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), BMW (DE:BMWG) and Osram (DE:OSRn). 
In the northern state of Lower Saxony, employers' association NiedersachsenMetall said a third round of negotiations had ended on Tuesday without a result.
""We've offered the trade union alternative solutions but unfortunately we're not seeing much movement from the other side yet,"" said NiedersachsenMetall head Volker Schmidt.
Roman Zitzelsberger, head of IG Metall in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, told striking workers at the gates of Daimler's factory in the town of Sindelfingen, near Stuttgart: ""The economy is booming because the employees like those here at Daimler do good work every day.""
""So 6 percent is appropriate and we won't be fobbed off with 2 percent.""

Employers reject the demands to cut hours unless working time for others could be increased temporarily as well. They argue that workers in Germany's industrial sector already have shorter weeks than their peers in other countries and worry that reducing their hours further would hurt German competitiveness.

906,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 11:02AM ET</span>",Goldman's Commodity Revenue Said to Drop 75% to Lowest on Record,"(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). suffered the worst annual commodities performance in its history as a public company as a drop of about 75 percent in net revenue in 2017 put it behind long-time rival  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), according to people familiar with the matter.
For decades Wall Street’s dominant commodities trader, Goldman performance was dragged down by losses in gas and power. The slump means the bank’s storied natural resources unit fell behind competitors such as Morgan Stanley, where net revenue in the sector rose by about a fifth last year, one of the people said -- a reversal of fortunes for the two banks known as the ""Wall Street refiners.”
Goldman’s commodities unit has been under scrutiny both within the bank and among investors since it revealed its second-quarter performance was the worst in its post-IPO history. That triggered an informal review of the unit and several high-profile departures, including global commodities head Gregory Agran.
The bank’s commodities earnings in the final three months of 2017 were better than the previous two quarters as losing natural gas trades were closed. Nonetheless, performance at the unit remained lackluster as it cut back risk-taking.
Goldman is due to report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, while Morgan Stanley follows on Thursday. Both banks declined to comment.
The bank -- which does not report commodities earnings separately from its fixed income, currencies and commodities division -- had net revenue from the unit of a little under $1.1 billion in 2016, Bloomberg has reported previously. It was ranked No. 1 among global investment banks in the sector, according to Coalition Development Ltd., a London-based analytics company.
A 75 percent drop suggests Goldman’s net revenue in commodities last year was less than half those of Morgan Stanley, where a strong performance in gas and power helped spur an increase in commodities net revenue to more than $600 million, according to one of the people.
While the contribution of commodities to the banks’ overall results these days is small, the asset class was once a significant driver of profits. 
In its heyday in the mid-2000s, Goldman enjoyed net revenue that peaked at $3.4 billion in 2009 thanks to volatile markets, rising interest from investors and little competition from other banks.
Many of the bank’s top executives -- including Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein -- cut their teeth in the commodities division.
The bank has remained committed to the unit in spite of its weak results, making at least seven new hires to the unit in the past few months, and pushing investment bankers to use their relationships with natural resources companies to help drive business.
Still, focus is likely to remain on the business and the executives charged with turning it around -- including Isabelle Ealet, co-head of the securities division who is leading the review, and Don Casturo, who was last year appointed chief operating officer of the unit.
So far, 2018 is proving kinder to Goldman’s commodities business than 2017, according to one of the people: it had a good start to 2018, profiting from volatility in energy markets as the U.S. northeast was hit by a blast of freezing weather.

Shares of  Citigroup jumped 3.10% to $79.22 on Tuesday before the bell after the bank reported earnings that beat Wall Street expectations.
The  bank posted adjusted earnings of $1.28 a share, above analysts' expectations of $1.19 a share. Yet the financial institution booked a one-time, non-cash charge of $22 billion, or $8.43 per share, due to the tax law.
Wall Street is anticipating a somewhat turbulent quarter as a result of the tax law. Many banks are  expected to book short-term losses because of repatriated cash and deferred tax assets that declined in value.
 JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),   Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) were the first of the big banks to post earnings on Friday. JPMorgan  posted a strong quarter despite taking a $2.4 billion hit from tax reform, while Wells Fargo  was boosted by tax reform.

In a report, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that its general business conditions index fell to 17.70 this month from a reading of 19.60 in December which was revised from an initial reading of 18.00. Analysts had expected the index to hold steady at 18.00 in January.
On the index, a reading above 0.0 indicates improving conditions, below indicates worsening conditions.
The Empire State index is of interest to traders primarily because it is seen as an early forecast of the national Institute for Supply Management factory survey.
The New York Fed also noted that the new orders index and the shipments index both showed ongoing growth, although at a slower pace than in December.
Unfilled orders and delivery times increased slightly, and inventory levels were higher, the report indicated.
Meanwhile, labor market conditions pointed to a modest increase in employment and steady workweeks, while both input prices and selling prices increased at a faster pace than last month.
“Firms remained very optimistic about future business conditions, and capital spending plans were robust,” the report concluded.
After the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.2225 from around 1.2224 ahead of the release, GBP/USD was at 1.3758 from 1.3754 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 110.73 from 110.77 earlier.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 90.44, compared to 90.46 ahead of the report.
Meanwhile, U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open. The Dow futures jumped 209 points, or 0.81%, the S&P 500 futures gained 12 points, or 0.41%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 35 points, or 0.51%.
Elsewhere, in the commodities market, gold futures traded at $1,334.80 a troy ounce, compared to $1,334.40 ahead of the data, while crude oil traded at $63.97 a barrel from $64.08 earlier."

The global survey, which covers 183 participants with $526 billion under management, was conducted from Jan. 5 to 11, when world stocks recorded their strongest start to a year since 2010.
In the bank's previous survey, the majority of respondents expected equity markets to peak in the second quarter of 2018. That forecast has now been pushed back to 2019 or beyond.
""Investors continue to favor equities,"" said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at BAML. ""By the end of Q1, we expect peak positioning to combine with peak profits and policy to create a spike in volatility.""
Investor allocations to stocks jumped to a two-year high of a net 55 percent overweight, while bond allocations fell to a four-year low of a net 67 percent underweight.
BAML noted that investors were at their most overweight equities versus government bonds since August 2014.
The average cash balance also fell to 4.4 percent, a five-year low, from 4.7 percent in December.
The upbeat mood was reflected in investors' outlook for corporates, with profit expectations climbing 10 percentage points to 44 percent in January.
Inflation and/or a crash in global bond markets was cited as the biggest tail risk, chosen by 36 percent of respondents, while 19 percent opted for a policy mistake by the U.S. Federal Reserve or European Central Bank.
A net 11 percent of investors surveyed expected the U.S. yield curve to flatten in 2018, the highest level in over two years, the bank noted. A net 9 percent of investors also thought that fiscal policy was too easy, the highest since 2011.
In terms of regional appetite, the eurozone remained in favor with the equity allocation holding at a net 45 percent overweight. The emerging market equity allocation also climbed to a net 41 percent overweight, from 34 percent in December.
But pessimism towards UK equities continued as Brexit uncertainty continued to weigh, with a net 36 percent underweight, back near its post global financial crisis era lows.
""The UK remains the consensus short amongst fund managers,"" BAML said.

The fourth largest U.S. bank by assets reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.28 in the three months ended December 31.
Analysts’ forecast pointed to earnings of $1.19 a share.
The adjusted earnings per share factored out the estimated impact of recent tax reform which contributed to the bank noting a a net loss for the fourth quarter of $18.3 billion, or $7.15 per share.
""The net loss of $18.3 billion, or $7.15 per share, included an estimated one-time, non-cash charge of $22 billion, or $8.43 per share, recorded in the tax line within Corporate / Other, related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform),"" Citi said in the press release.
Meanwhile, the company’s revenue increased 1.5% from the same quarter a year earlier to $17.26 billion, beating the forecast for $17.22 billion.
""While our fourth quarter results reflected the impact of a significant non-cash charge due to tax reform, the impact on our regulatory capital was much less significant,"" Citi chief executive Michael Corbat said.
""Tax reform does not change our capital return goals as we remain committed to returning at least $60 billion of capital in the current and next two CCAR cycles, subject to regulatory approval,"" he added.
Traders will now turn their attention to the firm’s conference call due to start at 10:00AM ET (15:00GMT).

PARIS (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA's (PA:PEUP) global sales jumped by 15 percent last year as strong growth in Iran and Latin America helped to offset difficulties in Britain and China.
The owner of the  Peugeot  brand sold 3,632,300 vehicles in 2017, it said on Tuesday, a day after domestic rival  Renault  (PA:RENA) announced a similarly robust performance.
Shares in PSA were up 1.9 percent by 1204 GMT, beating a 1.2 percent gain for the STOXX Europe 600 Autos index (SXAP).
Having resumed Iran operations in 2016 after the lifting of international sanctions over Tehran's nuclear activities, PSA sold 444,600 vehicles there last year. 
There was no year-on-year comparison for Iran, but sales in Latin America jumped 12 percent from 2016.
Sales in China fell sharply, though PSA said sales have shown signs of stabilising in recent months. Chief Executive Jean-Philippe Imparato told BFM TV that he was far more confident on China than a year ago.
PSA said it increased market share in all of its main European countries apart from the United Kingdom, where the company is grappling with difficulties at the Opel-Vauxhall business acquired last year.
The group also reported solid sales for Peugeot and Citroen light commercial vehicles (LCV) in overseas markets in the Middle East, Latin America and Asia.
In 2016 the company unveiled a strategic plan that built on a previous two-year recovery that hauled the company back from near-bankruptcy to its highest profitability in 14 years, helped by a government-led bailout.

""We currently hold Peugeot shares in our portfolio,"" said Roche Brune Asset Management fund manager Meriem Mokdad. ""The quality of the company has improved, with returns on capital coming back to a level above that of the automobile sector.""

951,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 06:57AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Saudi Aramco snubs UBS and Bank of America for listing roles - sources,"By Clara Denina and Dasha Afanasieva
LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has not invited UBS and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to pitch for senior advisory roles in its stock market listing because they have not lent money to the state oil giant in recent years, according to five finance sources.
The two investment banks, among the world's biggest, have not been asked to attend meetings in Saudi Arabia in the coming weeks where its rivals will pitch for global coordinator mandates for the IPO, said the people familiar with the matter.
They have been frozen out by Aramco, the sources added, despite having operations in the Middle East and wanting to take part in the initial public offering, which could be the biggest in history.
Saudi Aramco, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC) and Swiss lender UBS (S:UBSG) all declined to comment.
The sources said the exclusion of the banks reflected a corporate culture in the region of tying advisory mandates to how much of its own money a lender is willing to commit.
Aramco will need to borrow significant sums from Western banks in years to come to keep up with its investment pledges. Among its plans, it aims to invest $300 billion in oil and gas production in the next decade and expand its refining and petrochemical capacity around the world.
 Barclays  (L:BARC) has also not been invited to pitch, according to two separate banking sources who did not say why the British bank had been excluded.
Barclays declined to comment.
The three excluded banks could still be awarded more junior advisory or bookrunner roles in the stock market listing of the Saudi national champion, which is planned for this year.
The IPO is a central part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's reform drive aimed at restructuring the kingdom's economy and reducing its dependence on oil revenue. The government, which aims to float up to 5 percent of the company, says Aramco is worth $2 trillion.
CITI, GOLDMAN
Bankers see such advisory roles in the IPO as a gateway to a host of other deals they expect to flow from the kingdom's plan to revamp its economy via a wide privatization program. 
Sources told Reuters last week that Aramco has invited banks including Citi (N:C), Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to pitch for global coordinator mandates at the end of January or beginning of February in the city of Dhahran, where the state oil company is headquartered. 
There is no complete data available for the money investment banks have lent to Aramco, but fees generated from lending activities are closely correlated. 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch has not generated any fees from loans to Aramco since 2010, and generated just $180,000 in fees between 2002 and 2010, according to Thomson Reuters data. UBS does not appear as a loans adviser at all in the 15-year period covered by the data. 
JP Morgan (N:JPM) which has already been appointed as an adviser for the listing, generated the biggest fees from Aramco for loans, at $9.5 million over the 15-year period.
Citi and HSBC (L:HSBA), which is already mandated, were third and sixth biggest loan fee recipients with $8.1 million and $5.6 million respectively. Deutsche Bank is in the top 20, while Goldman is lower down at 34, but bought a slice of Aramco's $10 billion credit facility on the secondary market last year.

The Israel Securities Authority (ISA) has been investigating Bezeq, focusing on allegations that former chairman Shaul Elovitch, who owns Eurocom, had meddled in the merger in 2015 between Bezeq and its satellite TV unit YES for personal financial gain. Elovitch has denied any wrongdoing.
Elliott called for the immediate resignation of all Bezeq directors implicated in the ISA's investigation and those affiliated with Eurocom.
""Such directors should be replaced with independent and professional directors elected from a slate of candidates proposed by an independent special committee of the board,"" the letter said.
Bezeq shares were up 4.5 percent in midday Tel Aviv trade.
Eurocom Chairman Elovitch is under pressure to sell Eurocom, which is laden with nearly 1 billion shekels ($293 million) in debt.
On Monday Eurocom petitioned a Tel Aviv court to allow a debt settlement that would bring it a new controlling shareholder - a group led by U.S.-Israeli businessman Naty Saidoff.
Elliott, in its letter, said that in the event of a change in ownership of Bezeq, the directors nominated by the new controlling shareholder should be chosen according to their relevant experience in businesses at this scale, ""and their clean, established record"".
Key Bezeq shareholders should be consulted on the identity of new directors and their appointment should be confirmed by a shareholder meeting, it said.
Elliott noted that independent shareholders own 73.7 percent of Bezeq.
""We ... believe there is significant value to be unlocked if the right steps are taken to improve the company's corporate governance,"" the letter said.

JAKARTA, (Reuters) - Indonesia's stock exchange held a minute silence at the start of trading on Tuesday for more than 70 people injured when a mezzanine floor in the building suddenly collapsed.
No deaths have been reported from the collapse on Monday but dozens of people, many university students visiting the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX), are being treated in hospitals.
Bourse officials said the rest of the building complex was operating normally.
""Main structure wise, this building has no problem,"" said Samsul Hidayat, a director at the IDX. ""We have blocked the mezzanine floor.""
The high-rise building, constructed in the late 1990s, is part of a two-tower complex in the heart of Jakarta's financial district and houses dozens of offices including the World Bank.
It was the target of a car bombing by Islamist militants in September 2000. Police have ruled out a bomb as a cause of Monday's collapse. 
The second tower was reopened for business on Tuesday, with the parts of the floor that were still intact propped up by makeshift columns. 
Some employees felt nervous about going to work.
""I am so wary. I work underneath the bridge,"" said Nur Septi Febriananda, a receptionist, referring to another part of the same mezzanine floor that fell. 
A police forensics team was combing through the rubble for clues as to why the walkway, which overlooks the main lobby, crumpled without warning, said Jakarta police spokesman Argo Yuwono. 
Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan has ordered an ""audit"" of the building, which was last inspected by authorities in May, 2017. 
A group of nearly 100 university students were on the mezzanine floor when it gave way, and many fell one storey to the lobby. Several students are being treated for broken bones and concussions.
Safety standards are often loosely enforced in Indonesia. Last year, a fire that ripped through a fireworks factory on the outskirts of Jakarta killed around 50 people in one of the country's worst industrial accidents. A police investigation found multiple safety violations. 

The exchange was operating normally on Tuesday, with the year's first listing going ahead as scheduled. Telecommunication construction company PT LCK Global Kedaton Tbk, debuted its shares, which jumped 50 percent in early trade.

The U.S. investment bank has been mandated by the Hanover-based component and tyre maker to work on strategic options, including a separation of its current businesses, three people familiar with the discussions said.
Continental and JP Morgan both declined to comment on the bank's role.
""We are drawing on external expertise but are still pretty much at the start of the process,"" Continental Chief Executive Elmar Degenhart said in an interview at the Detroit auto show.
Continental said last week that it was in talks about a possible structural overhaul, confirming media reports, and pledged to flesh out its plans within six months.
With the auto industry wrapped up in a strategic transition to zero-emission and autonomous cars, carmakers and suppliers are adjusting their businesses and spinning off operations to focus more effectively on new technologies.
 Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) has said it may split into separate legal entities, which could allow for a partial listing to raise funds to invest in future mobility technologies and services.
Parts makers such as Delphi (N:DLPH) and Autoliv (N:ALV) have spun off divisions or announced plans to do so, cheered by investors who see combustion-engine cars as a sunset industry.
Continental has said software and electronics are the biggest growth drivers for the group, which also makes fuel-injection and transmission-control systems. It plans to boost sales to more than 50 billion euros ($61 billion) by 2020.
In the interview, Degenhart said structural change may be needed to deliver on Continental's goal of exceeding global auto production growth by 4-5 percentage points.
""We can't expect that structures that were successful and appropriate over the past 10 years will also be the right ones in 10 years from now,"" he said.
No specific plan has yet been drawn up, a person familiar with the matter said last week. Investment banks have presented ideas including a spin-off of the tyre operations, but Chief Financial Officer Wolfgang Schaefer has ruled out a spin-off of combustion engine assets.
Continental said a year ago it was reviewing the strategy for its Powertrain division after earnings at the business, whose products include transmission control units and fuel pumps, failed to meet expectations.
But it has also pledged to keep developing new products and systems for combustion-engine vehicles until at least 2025, when it expects demand for electric cars to accelerate on the back of continuing reductions in battery prices.

The risk of changes in legislation and regulation, including concerns over Brexit, new trade barriers and protectionism, climbed three places from a year earlier to become the second most significant concern for UK businesses, according to the UK part of a global survey by German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG)
""Companies must gear up to cope with the risk of sudden political and legal shocks, such as the lack of clarity over UK Plc’s future relationship with the European Union,"" said Brian Kirwan, UK Chief Executive of Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty.
Cyber incidents were again the top worry for UK businesses, including the potential for ""cyber hurricanes"", where hackers disrupt large numbers of companies through shared internet infrastructure. 
Business interruption was considered the primary risk globally in the Allianz survey of more than 1,900 risk specialists from 80 countries.

970,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>",Global carmakers to invest at least $90 billion in electric vehicles,"By Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's plan to double its electrified vehicle spending is part of an investment tsunami in batteries and electric cars by global automakers that now totals $90 billion and is still growing, a Reuters analysis shows.
That money is pouring in to a tiny sector that amounts to less than 1 percent of the 90 million vehicles sold each year and where Elon Musk's Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, with sales of only three models totaling just over 100,000 vehicles in 2017, was a dominant player.
With the world's top automakers poised to introduce dozens of new battery electric and hybrid gasoline-electric models over the next five years - many of them in China - executives continue to ask: Who will buy all those vehicles?
""We're all in,"" Ford Motor Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr said of the company's $11 billion investment, announced on Sunday at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. ""The only question is, will the customers be there with us?""
""Tesla faces real competition,"" said Mike Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN), the largest U.S. auto retailing chain. By 2030, Jackson said he expects electric vehicles could account for 15-20 percent of New vehicle sales in the United States.
Investments in electrified vehicles announced to date include at least $19 billion by automakers in the United States, $21 billion in China and $52 billion in Germany.
But U.S. and German auto executives said in interviews on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show that the bulk of those investments are earmarked for China, where the government has enacted escalating electric-vehicle quotas starting in 2019.
Mainstream automakers also are reacting in part to pressure from regulators in Europe and California to slash carbon emissions from fossil fuels. They are under pressure as well from Tesla's success in creating electric sedans and SUVs that inspire would-be owners to flood the company with orders.
While Tesla is the most prominent electric car maker, ""soon it will be everybody and his brother,""  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche told reporters on Monday at the Detroit show.
Daimler has said it will spend at least $11.7 billion to introduce 10 pure electric and 40 hybrid models, and that it intends to electrify its full range of vehicles, from minicompact commuters to heavy-duty trucks.
""We will see whether demand will drive our (electric vehicle) sales or whether we will all be trying to catch the last customer out there,"" Zetsche said. ""Ultimately, the customer will decide.""
For now, Nissan Motor Co Ltd's 7-year-old Leaf remains the world's top-selling electric vehicle and the company's sole battery-only car - an offering soon to be swamped by new rivals bringing tougher competition that could add pressure to pricing. 
""Everybody will find out that if you push you will have a lot of bad news on residual values,"" Nissan Chief Performance Officer Jose Munoz told Reuters. 
Jim Lentz, chief executive of Toyota Motor Corp's North American operations, said it took Toyota 18 years for sales of hybrid vehicles to reach 3 percent share of the total market. And hybrids are less costly, do not require new charging infrastructure and are not burdened by the range limits of battery electric vehicles, he said.
""What's it going to take to get to 4 to 5 percent"" share for electric cars, Lentz said. ""It's going to be longer."" 
The largest single investment is coming from Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), which plans to spend $40 billion by 2030 to build electrified versions of its 300-plus global models.
In the United States, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) has outlined plans to introduce 20 new battery and fuel cell electric vehicles by 2023, most of them built on a new dedicated, modular platform that will be introduced in 2021. 
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has not said how much the automaker will spend on electric vehicles. Much of the investment will be made in China, where GM's Cadillac brand will help spearhead the company's more aggressive move into electric vehicles, according to Cadillac President Johan de Nysschen.
In an interview on Monday at the Detroit show, de Nysschen said Cadillac would ""play a central role"" in GM's electric vehicle strategy in China, and will introduce an unspecified number of models based on GM's future electric-vehicle platform. Some of those Cadillacs could be assembled in China, de Nysschen said. 
Chinese automakers, including local partners of Ford, VW and GM, all have publicized aggressive investment plans.
Not every multinational automaker is moving so aggressively into electric vehicles.

In Detroit on Monday, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said it did not make sense to announce a specific number of new electric vehicles – and he said the company was not under pressure, but working to meet emissions requirements. “We do not have a gun to our head,” Marchionne said. He said EVs will likely become mandatory in Europe because of emissions rules.

971,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 04:57PM ET</span>","Citi to raise pay for women and minorities in U.S., UK, Germany","(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) will increase compensation for women and minorities to bridge pay gaps in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany, as part of its annual pay process this year, the Wall Street bank said on Monday.
As part of the move, Citi also becomes the first big U.S. bank to respond to a shareholder push to analyze and disclose its gender pay gap.
Citi said it had conducted a survey in the three countries, where it found that women and minorities are paid only slightly less than their male and non-minority counterparts.
On average, Citi found, women and minorities are paid 99 percent of what men and non-minorities are paid, respectively.
Compensation would be raised based on the pay gaps identified in the survey, Citi spokeswoman Jennifer Lowney said.
""Our continuing focus on pay equity furthers our goal of being the employer of choice for employees of diverse backgrounds,"" Citi said in a statement on its website.
The company also said it would adjust compensation for other individuals, where the analysis determined increases were necessary. (http://citi.us/2B2PnD8)
Citi, along with other U.S. banks and credit card companies, has been under investor pressure to disclose how much less it pays women than men.
Employers in the UK will be required to publish gender pay gaps by April. Banks have been among the largest offenders, with median pay gaps averaging 24 percent, according to a joint statement by Citi and activist investor Arjuna Capital on Monday.
Arjuna asked Citi's shareholders last year to vote in favor of a proposal requiring the bank to address the gender pay gap.
But on Monday, Arjuna withdrew that proposal, saying that Citi's announcement represented a major shift for U.S. banks and credit card companies.

""Citigroup is stepping into a leadership role on the gender pay gap that we have not seen from any of its U.S. financial peers,"" said Arjuna Capital Managing Partner Natasha Lamb.

974,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Major automakers urge Trump administration: don't ditch NAFTA,"By David Shepardson
DETROIT (Reuters) - Global automakers on Monday urged the Trump administration not to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement and expressed hope the United States, Canada and Mexico can successfully conclude a modernized and improved trade pact.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, who announced last week plans to shift heavy pickup truck production from Mexico to Michigan by 2020, said he hoped the Trump administration would ""retune"" some of its trade talk demands.
Trump has threatened to withdraw from NAFTA, which is heavily utilized by automakers that have production and supply chains spread across the three countries.
Marchionne, speaking at a news conference at the Detroit auto show, said FCA's truck production shift in part ""goes a long way I think in addressing some of President Trump's concerns about the dislocation of production capacity out of the United States.""
That decision reduces the risk those trucks would be hit with a 25 percent tariff if NAFTA unravels. 
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co CEO Jim Hackett on Sunday told reporters NAFTA needs ""to be modernized,"" adding that of Detroit's Big Three automakers, Ford has the highest percentage of U.S.-built vehicles.
""We've got a big commitment to our country and it's proven in the numbers,"" he said.
Unlike General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and FCA, Ford does not build trucks in Mexico.
GM CEO Mary Barra on Saturday expressed optimism NAFTA will survive with improvements. Other senior GM executives stood by the company's plans to continue building trucks in Mexico.
MICHIGAN GOVERNOR PUSHES NAFTA
Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, met with Vice President Mike Pence in December, urging the administration to improve NAFTA instead of terminating it, which could harm the auto industry.
""That would be a negative for all three countries,"" Snyder told reporters after touring the auto show.
Jose Munoz, head of North American operations for Nissan Motor Co, told Reuters the company has boosted U.S. production in recent years. 
""No matter what the new NAFTA rules, we will adjust very fast so we can maximize our business,"" he said. ""The more localized you are the less exposed you are to potential changes.""
Under NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in the region must be from North America to be able to enter the marketplace tariff-free.
The Trump administration has proposed increasing that minimum NAFTA content to 85 percent, with 50 percent made in the United States.
The 85 percent North American content proposal to avoid tariffs is unworkable, Toyota North America Chief Executive Jim Lentz told Reuters.
""There's not a vehicle that meets that,” he said.
Lentz said since NAFTA was agreed 14 auto plants have been built in the United States – eight by Toyota – and 11 in Mexico. 
""It's not like we are not investing in the United States,"" Lentz said.
Marchionne also said the 85 percent figure is not feasible. ""I’m hopeful that we'll see a more rational number going forward and if it is more rational, then I think we’ll be able meet the standard,"" he said.
A NAFTA breakup would raise costs, slow demand and put U.S. jobs in jeopardy, Lentz said.
Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) brand CEO Herbert Diess said the automaker wasn't preparing for NAFTA's demise.

The U.S. auto industry has worked to convince the Trump administration of NAFTA's importance. In October, major automakers, suppliers and auto dealers launched a coalition to back the agreement.

975,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 03:55PM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler CEO says no plans to sell brands to Chinese,"By Alexandria Sage and Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV's (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) has no intention of breaking up the company or selling individual brands to China or other parties, the company's chief executive said on Monday, adding that the group was counting on its coveted Jeep brand to drive future profits. 
""We're not going to break up anything,"" Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said at a news conference at the Detroit auto show. ""We have no intention of breaking it up and giving anything to the Chinese."" 
Marchionne said the Jeep sport utility vehicle brand could help FCA double its net profit. FCA's portfolio also includes luxury Maseratis, sporty Alfa Romeos and tiny Fiats. 
FCA's share price has jumped more than 30 percent this year on a bullish outlook for the auto sector, Jeep growth expectations and speculation that Marchionne's final year at the helm could prompt strategic deals such as spin-offs, technology alliances and disposals.
The popularity of the Jeep brand, which is targeting sales of 2 million vehicles this year, has prompted talk it could be spun off from the group, as happened with tractor maker  CNH Industrial  (MI:CNHI) and supercar group  Ferrari  (MI:RACE), or sold off. 
Rumors have resurfaced that Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd (SS:601238) might be interested in snapping up part of FCA. Marchionne said on Monday that while GAC has partnered to deliver Jeeps to the Chinese market and FCA is talking to the Chinese automaker about helping it enter the U.S. market ""none of these things are designed to impact on the independence of FCA.""
FCA has often been the subject of merger speculation, especially after its unsuccessful 2015 attempt to tie up with larger U.S. rival General Motors Co (N:GM). Its share price jumped to record highs in August after reports of interest from China's Great Wall Motor Co (SS:601633) and South Korea's  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380).
Marchionne said while both Jeep and truck brand Ram are strong enough to exist on their own, ""we need to talk about... what will be left behind."" 
Marchionne said he has recommended to the company's board that the automaker spin off Magneti Marelli, a maker of components for lighting, engines, electronics, suspension and exhausts, to shareholders by the end of 2018.
Marchionne confirmed FCA's targets for 2017 and for 2018, including a plan to erase all debt and generate up to 5 billion euros ($6.14 billion) in net cash.
Asked about the possibility of paying dividends, Marchionne said the markets had changed and ""it makes more sense to buy back shares than pay a dividend."" 
The 65-year-old executive is due to step down in early 2019, and a successor will be appointed from within FCA. 
Finance chief Richard Palmer, European head Alfredo Altavilla and Jeep boss Mike Manley have often been cited as possible candidates, according to sources close to the company.
Marchionne said there are other possible candidates who are not in the media spotlight. 
FCA announced last week it will shift production of Ram heavy-duty pickup trucks from Mexico to Michigan in 2020, a move that lowers the risk to the automaker's profit should President Donald Trump pull the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
""I think we’ve done the right thing by the American market, by the U.S. consumer,"" Marchionne said, ""... and I think we’ve addressed Mexican concerns"" about production with plans to repurpose the company's Saltillo, Mexico, plant to build commercial vehicles for sale globally. 
He said the U.S. tax code overhaul passed in December would provide a $1 billion boost to the company in 2018, noting that the overhaul ""was to make sure the economy got a boost... develop a sense of confidence about the future, and that's exactly what we as an automaker in the U.S. were waiting to hear."" 
A number of major automakers plan vast investments in developing electric vehicles.  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said on Sunday it plans to invest $11 billion and have 40 hybrid and fully electric vehicles in its model lineup by 2022.
Marchionne said electric vehicles will eventually form a large part of vehicle lineups, ""but it's a lot further off than people think"" in part because they are not profitable for automakers.

""I don’t know of a guy, or a person or a entity or economic organization that is making money out of selling electric vehicles unless you’re selling them at the very high end, which is rare,"" he said.

976,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 03:35PM ET</span>",Britain's Carillion collapses after banks pull the plug,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Carillion collapsed on Monday when its banks pulled the plug, triggering Britain's biggest corporate failure in a decade and forcing the government to step in to guarantee public services from school meals to roadworks.
The 200-year-old business went into compulsory liquidation at 0600 GMT after costly contract delays and a slump in new business left it swamped by debt and pensions liabilities of at least 2.2 billion pounds ($3 billion).
Its demise threatens to hurt smaller suppliers, merchants, rivals and Britain's biggest banks. The British government was left to ensure there was no disruption to public services.
The collapse poses a headache for Theresa May's government, which had employed Carillion to work on 450 projects including the building and maintenance of hospitals, schools, defense sites and a high-speed rail line.
May's government also faced questions from the opposition Labour Party about why it awarded the company 1.3 billion pounds of state contracts after Carillion fell into financial difficulty in July last year.
""In recent days we have been unable to secure the funding to support our business plan and it is therefore with the deepest regret that we have arrived at this decision,"" Chairman Philip Green said. 
The government's priority is to ensure that public services are not disrupted, said David Lidington, the minister in charge of the Cabinet Office, which oversees the running of government.
Lidington urged Carillion staff to continue to work and said the government would pay the salaries of the company's public sector workers. Workers on private sector contracts, however, will be paid by the government for only 48 hours. 
Some contracts handled by Carillion would in time go to alternative providers, he added.
The government stopped short, however, of bailing out the company as it did with major banks during the 2007-09 financial crisis. 
FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL
Employing 43,000 people around the world, including 20,000 in Britain, Carillion has been fighting for survival since July, when it revealed it was losing cash on projects and had written down the value of its contract book by 845 million pounds. 
With banks refusing in recent days to accept the latest restructuring plan, May's senior ministers met around the clock, under pressure from the Labour Party and unions not to use taxpayer money to prop up the failing company. 
Ministers, top bankers and company bosses scrambled to find a way to save the company in last-ditch talks over the weekend.
Carillion has committed debt facilities of about 1.6 billion pounds to banks including RBS (LON:RBS), Santander (MC:SAN) UK, Lloyds (LON:LLOY), HSBC and  Barclays  (LON:BARC). It has a pension deficit of 580 million pounds. 
Spun out of Tarmac nearly 20 years ago and including construction names such as Wimpey and Alfred McAlpine, Carillion operates in Britain and Ireland, Canada, the Middle East and North Africa. 
Its projects include London's Royal Opera House, the Channel Tunnel, the Copenhagen Metro, the Suez Canal road tunnel and Toronto's Union Station.
In July last year, a week after its initial profit warning, it was named as one of the contractors on Britain's new High Speed 2 rail line, a flagship project that will better connect London with the north of England.
Richard Howson quit as CEO at the time of the profit warning after five years in the role. Its shares have lost more than 90 percent of their value over the past six months. 
At its headquarters in Wolverhampton, central England, a handful of workers could be seen holding meetings.
Shares in rivals such as  G4S  (CO:G4S), Interserve, Balfour Beatty and Kier Group advanced on hopes they would pick up some additional work.
LEGACY CONTRACTS 
However, Balfour, which worked with Carillion on three British road projects, said the collapse would probably cost it between 35 and 45 million pounds. 
Many of Britain's service providers have been hit in recent years after they took on work during the financial crisis at low prices for long-running fixed-rate contracts that have also proved problematic for groups that include Capita and Mitie and Interserve.
Britain began outsourcing public services in the late 1980s under Margaret Thatcher and enjoyed a boom period under Labour's Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. It is now the world's second-largest outsourcing market behind the United states.
Britain's National Audit Office warned of risks in the sector in 2013, highlighting a government focus on what it called ""short-term savings"".
Andrew Wilkinson, a restructuring specialist at law firm Weil, said there was a serious issue about the pricing and profit recognition on long-term contracts. 
""The government pushes hard for cost savings and all these pressures build up,"" he said. ""It's not a new thing, it's happened before in this sector, but the shame of it here is this company didn't move fast enough,"" he told Reuters. 
Rudi Klein, head of Britain's Specialist Engineering Contractors' Group, warned that the impact was likely to be felt by small contractors. He estimated Carillion had left a trail of 1.2 billion pounds in unpaid bills to thousands of small subcontractors. 
Klein said the scale of the industry's exposure was not yet clear but he gave the examples of a small Northern Irish engineering contractor owed 150,000 pounds and a concrete frame manufacturer in northwest England owed 2 million pounds.

""This can't be allowed to happen again,"" he said.

NEW YORK/TORONTO (Reuters) - Nine large banks, including six from Canada, have been accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to rig a Canadian rate benchmark to improve profits from derivatives trading.
The complaint, filed by a Colorado pension fund in U.S. District Court in Manhattan late on Friday, accused Royal Bank of Canada (TO:RY),  Toronto-Dominion Bank  (TO:TD), Bank of Nova Scotia (TO:BNS) and the other banks of suppressing the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate (CDOR) from Aug. 9, 2007, to June 30, 2014.
According to the Fire & Police Pension Association of Colorado, the banks hoped to reduce interest they would owe investors on CDOR-based derivatives transactions in the United States, including swaps and Canadian dollar futures contracts, and generate potentially billions of dollars of improper profit.
The fund is seeking unspecified damages for investors in the proposed class action for alleged violations of U.S. antitrust, commodity and anti-racketeering laws over the nearly seven-year period.
Other defendants include Bank of Montreal (TO:BMO), Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (TO:CM),  National Bank of Canada  (TO:NA), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA).
Eight of the banks declined to comment on Monday. The ninth, Bank of Montreal, did not respond to requests for comment.
CDOR is a rate at which banks will lend to corporate clients using bankers' acceptances, a short-term credit instrument. It is now known as the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate, and calculated daily by Thomson Reuters based on rate submissions from banks.
Canadian regulators updated the CDOR-setting process after the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada in January 2013 identified the ""potential"" for manipulation.
That came after regulators worldwide began accusing, and eventually fined, many banks for manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate and other benchmarks.
According to Friday's complaint, the Colorado fund conducted more than $1.2 billion of CDOR-based derivatives transactions, including with seven defendants, during the alleged conspiracy.
The fund said banks coordinated false CDOR submissions after their CDOR-based derivatives portfolios, on which they made interest payments, had grown far larger than their CDOR-based loan portfolios, on which they collected interest.
It said the conspiracy was intended in part to address this imbalance, and included a 151-day stretch when four banks made identical submissions.
The federal court in Manhattan is home to a wide variety of private litigation accusing banks of conspiring to rig rate benchmarks, markets such as U.S. Treasuries, and prices for commodities such as gold and silver.
One case, over alleged currency manipulation, led to agreements by 15 banks to pay out $2.31 billion.

The case is Fire & Police Pension Association of Colorado v Bank of Montreal et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-00342.

(Reuters) - Killer Content Inc, the movie producer that has partnered with philanthropist Abigail Disney in a consortium vying to acquire the Weinstein Company, said on Monday that a bankruptcy may be the best way forward for the U.S. film and TV studio.
Killer Content's comments come as the studio continues to grapple with the fallout of sexual harassment allegations against its former co-chairman, Harvey Weinstein, who left the company three months ago. 
More than 70 women have accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, including rape. He has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.
The Weinstein Company has been looking for a buyer or rescue financing since last fall. The company's investment bankers at Moelis & Co (N:MC) have been focused on an outright sale, rather than a debt restructuring or bankruptcy. 
Killer Content said in a statement that it remained interested in acquiring the assets of the Weinstein Company, but that a sale process may not be the best way for the company to address its liabilities.
""We can only participate... if the process is transparent, affords due process, and is 100 percent aligned with the interests of survivors – all most likely to happen in bankruptcy,"" Killer Content said in the statement.
Killer Content, entertainment company  Lions Gate Entertainment Corp  (N:LGFa) and Maria Contreras-Sweet, the former head of the Small Business Administration under President Barack Obama, have made proposals for the company or some of its assets, people familiar with the matter have said. 
The Weinstein Company and Moelis declined to comment. Lions Gate and Contreras-Sweet representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Harvey Weinstein's brother and company co-founder Robert Weinstein, and David Glasser, the film studio's president, remain at the Weinstein Company, which has produced and distributed movies including “The King’s Speech” and “Silver Linings Playbook.""
Killer Content, which has produced more than 60 films including ""Boys Don't Cry,"" is arguing that a sale of the Weinstein Company outside bankruptcy could benefit some of the executives who allowed Harvey Weinstein's abuse to continue for years.
""We want to do our part to ensure that no matter the outcome, the blood money generated from the systemic protection of alleged rape, abuse and a culture of violence against women will soon be allocated to the prevention, the support and advocacy efforts of anti-discrimination and survivor support organizations,"" Killer Content said.

The Weinstein Company last year sold its rights to family movie ""Paddington 2,"" bringing in a cash infusion that would help the studio continue to operate until January, Reuters has reported. The company has $375 million in debt.

981,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 02:29PM ET</span>",U.S. automakers bet on diesel trucks after VW scandal,"By David Shepardson
DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. automakers are unveiling new diesel pickup trucks even as diesel sales have fallen sharply since Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) 2015 diesel emissions scandal.
General Motors Co (N:GM) said at the Detroit auto show it would offer a diesel 2019 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck and now offers diesel versions of its Equinox, Cruze, Colorado, Express and medium- and heavy-duty trucks.
GM product chief Mark Reuss said the automaker did not create the diesel crisis and know how to comply with diesel emissions requirements. ""We know how to do it, we know how to do it very well. There’s big value there but you've got to get it right,"" he told reporters at an auto show event Saturday.
Overall U.S. light-duty diesel sales fell 19 percent in 2017 to 94,810, according to hybridcars.com, and accounted for less than 1 percent of U.S. vehicle sales. Nearly half of U.S. diesel sales were Ford Transit diesel vans.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) plans this spring to offer a diesel engine version of its best-selling F-150 pickup truck. Ford executives said they expect the F-150 diesel model with a 10-speed transmission to achieve 30 miles per gallon highway fuel efficiency, a level comparable to some midsize cars.
Fiat Chrysler in 2013 offered a diesel engine in its light duty Ram pickup models and claiming best-in-class fuel economy.
There has been growing scrutiny of diesel vehicles in the United States since Volkswagen admitted in September 2015 to installing secret software on diesel U.S. vehicles that allowed them to emit excess emissions.
Last year, the Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler, accusing it of illegally using software to bypass emission controls in 104,000 diesel Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Ram 1500 trucks sold since 2014. In July, Fiat Chrysler won approval from federal and California regulators to sell 2017 diesel vehicles. It also faces suits from diesel vehicle owners.
Volkswagen North America chief Hinrich Woebcken on Sunday reiterated it will not resume U.S. diesel sales after halting sales in September 2015. ""We definitely pulled the plug for diesels here in this country,"" he said.

In May, German automaker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) dropped plans to seek U.S. approval to sell 2017 Mercedes-Benz U.S. diesel models. The company disclosed earlier investigations by authorities of diesel emissions could lead to significant penalties and recalls.

982,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 02:04PM ET</span>",Game of chicken: GM bets on Mexican-made pickup trucks,"By Anthony Esposito and Joseph White
SILAO, Mexico/DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (N:GM) assembly plant in Silao, a city in Mexico's automotive heartland, cranked out more than 400,000 highly profitable, large pickup trucks last year, and is critical to the launch of a new generation of Chevrolet Silverado trucks later this year.
Now, GM's Silao factory, and the profit it generates, are at risk. 
If U.S. President Donald Trump follows up on threats to dump the North American Free Trade Agreement, pickup trucks built at Silao and shipped to the United States could be hit with a 25 percent tariff, known in the auto industry as the ""chicken tax."" 
The truck tariff's origins go back to a 1960s trade spat between the United States and Germany over exports of U.S.-grown chickens. It protected profit for Detroit's automakers long after its origins faded from memory. Now, the chicken tax could ruffle the feathers of GM's pickup-truck profitability. It could also potentially jeopardize thousands of jobs on both sides of the border and billions of dollars in investment for automakers.
GM in recent weeks inaugurated a new production line for a 10-speed transmission in the central Mexican city of Silao, and late last year began hiring 600 new staff there, sources said, effectively doubling down on one of the most lucrative offshore production categories for U.S. auto companies. 
People familiar with GM's plans told Reuters the company will shift production of a small number of heavy-duty versions of the next-generation Silverado and Sierra to a plant in Flint, Michigan.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra did not directly answer when asked on Saturday if the company is considering pulling pickup truck production out of Mexico. ""We're going to continue to work constructively to get a modernized NAFTA agreement,"" she said.
Last week,  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) said it will move production of heavy-duty Ram pickups out of Mexico to Michigan by 2020.
At an event on Saturday to promote the 2019 Silverado, GM executives said Mexico is an important part of the automaker's manufacturing ""footprint"" in North America.
""The truck we build in Mexico, the engines come from the U.S.,"" GM North America chief Alan Batey told reporters. ""Everything is interlinked.""
A FAILED NAFTA IS A LOSE-LOSE
NAFTA has helped transform Guanajuato state, where Silao is located, since the trade pact was signed in 1994 with some $18 billion in investments in the auto sector. Silao's industrial park bustles with workers at the dozens of sparkling new offices of automakers, suppliers and service providers from an array of countries, including Japan, Germany, the United States and Mexico.
Nearly 200,000 direct and indirect jobs depend on the automotive sector in Guanajuato. An estimated 46 percent of Mexico's pickup trucks are produced in the region.
GM's Silao manufacturing complex is part of a web of factories owned by GM and its suppliers that stretches across Canada, the United States and Mexico. It is one of three main assembly plants for the next generation of GM's large pickups and sport utility vehicles, including plants in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Flint, Michigan.
Engines for trucks made in Silao come from GM factories in Flint; Spring Hill, Tennessee; and Tonawanda, New York. U.S. factories supply fuel systems and other components. In total, GM said it has more than 5,000 employees in U.S. plants with jobs tied to production in Silao.
In North America, GM's operations are primarily in the United States. It has four manufacturing plants in Mexico, and 40 in the United States.
The automaker's plans to build the next generation of Silverado pickups and related components in Mexico are too far along to reverse course in the near term without losing money, experts and company officials said.
GM's global purchasing chief, Steve Kiefer, told Reuters that suppliers for the pickup truck program have also made investments based on production that crosses the U.S-Mexico border.
""The installed capacity is such that it would be prohibitive to make huge changes to this,"" Kiefer said.
U.S., Canadian and Mexican officials are scheduled to meet in Montreal from Jan. 23 to 28 for the sixth and penultimate round of talks to update NAFTA.
""Surely the (NAFTA) negotiations will be positive. We don't believe this will lead to a destructive situation because it would be a lose-lose,"" said Alfredo Arzola, head of Guanajuato's automotive cluster.
During the first 10 months of 2017 GM, Fiat Chrysler, Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) exported nearly 700,000 pickup trucks from Mexico, mostly to the United States, according to data from the Mexican Auto Industry Association (AMIA).
GM executives emphasized that 80 percent of the pickups it sells in the United States are U.S.-made. 
FLEXIBLE
In the event of a NAFTA collapse carmakers could eventually switch out production of pickup trucks to the United States and bring compact car and sport utility vehicle production to Mexico, experts and industry officials said. 
""GM has certain flexibility ... to go back and only produce SUVs like the Suburban,"" said a Mexican official.
Under that scenario Mexican exports of SUVs to the United States would avoid the steep chicken tax and would be subject to a tariff of only 2.5 percent, barring an agreement to a different levy. 

Fiat Chrysler said it will use the Mexican plant that now builds pickups to assemble a commercial vehicle aimed at global markets, taking advantage of Mexican free trade deals.

995,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",The Wow factor in Iceland's role as global transit hub,"By Tommy Lund and Thyagaraju Adinarayan
(Reuters) - Icelandic transatlantic budget carrier Wow Air will fly Asian routes later this year, in an expansion that will further boost Iceland's credentials as a global transit hub thanks to its ""superior location"", the company's founder and CEO said.
Iceland has grown in strength as a transit hub for flights across Europe and North America in the past couple of years, and tourism to the island is booming, helped partly by the advent of low-cost carrier Wow, which started operations in 2012.
Passenger numbers to Iceland's Keflavik International Airport rose 28 percent in 2017 to 8.76 million, with the number of transit passengers jumping 38 percent.
""I think Iceland has a superior location that is hard to compete with, I do not see anyone else building an island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean,"" Skuli Mogensen told Reuters in a telephone interview in which he also drew parallels with Dubai.
""Dubai did not exist 30 years ago. It is now a 100 million passenger a year airport,"" he said, referring to the rise of the city in the United Arab Emirates as a hub for transfer traffic, especially between Europe and Asia.
Wow has focused on low-cost travel across the Atlantic. It uses smaller single-aisle planes to fly between Iceland and many destinations in the United States and Europe, helping to keep costs down as they do not need as many seats to fill them up.
Wow's fleet currently comprises 14 Airbus A320 family aircraft and three widebody A330 planes. It plans to increase the overall size of the fleet to 24 by the end of 2018.
""ROOM FOR GROWTH""
Wow has added to a revival of budget transatlantic travel, driven by Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC), that has prompted traditional long-haul players such as British Airways parent IAG (L:ICAG), Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) and Delta (N:DAL) to set up new operations or change pricing structures.
""I think we like to say that we attract the smart traveler, meaning people who want to get value for money and not pay ridiculously high prices for legacy airlines or older aircraft and mediocre service "" said Mogensen, who is sole owner of Wow.
Wow sees ""plenty of room for growth"" expanding into Asia, though he declined to name planned future destinations.
Mogensen said Wow's strategy was to ""go further and deeper"" into the United States and offer flights to places where passengers were unlikely to find routes directly from Europe.
Wow has added five flights to the Mid-West - Cleveland, Detroit, St. Louis, Dallas and Cincinati - that are due to start up in April or May, he said. 
Wow mainly competes with Norwegian Air on low-cost transatlantic routes from the Nordic countries. It has been operating on these routes since 2015.

Norwegian Air has a little over half of the market share in the fast-growing, low-cost, long-haul transatlantic market, while Wow controls a quarter, according to data from OAG flightview.

1001,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>","Carillion collapse hits banks and investors, boosts short sellers","By Emma Rumney, Ben Martin and Alasdair Pal
LONDON (Reuters) - Leading British lenders including  Barclays  (LON:BARC), the Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) and Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) face the prospect of hundreds of millions of pounds in outstanding loans going unpaid from Carillion's collapse on Monday. 
Along with 10 other banks, they arranged a 790 million pound ($1.1 billion) revolving credit facility for Carillion in 2015, which made up the bulk of 835 million pounds worth of syndicated bank loans owed by Carillion that mature in 2020.
Last September, five banks agreed to an additional 140 million pounds in loans repayable at the end of 2018.
In total, creditors to the UK support services and construction group, which was forced into liquidation on Monday, have around 1.6 billion pounds of debt exposure to the company.
Many already started booking writedowns last year, as Carillion's woes mounted following a profit warning in July. 
Lloyds took a 270 million pound impairment charge at its third quarter results, up from 204 million pounds over the same period a year earlier. A source familiar with the matter said on Monday this was largely due to problems at Carillion. 
These were also the main driver for a jump in provisions at Santander (MC:SAN) UK's global corporate bank, another source said. They rose to 47 million pounds in the nine months to September 2017, up from 21 million pounds a year earlier. 
The bank is likely to take a further hit at its annual results in February, the source said. At RBS's commercial bank, provisions in the third quarter also spiked, growing from 20 million pounds in 2016 to 151 million pounds. At the time, Chief Executive Ross McEwan said this was down to a ""single name"".
The banks declined to comment on their exposure to Carillion.
""I suspect that Lloyds and RBS could take a further writedown in Q4, and in addition to that the other lenders to Carillion are likely to take a writedown as well,"" said John Cronin, head of UK banks research at analyst firm Goodbody said. 
""The question is how material that is.""
SHAREHOLDERS SUFFER
Asset managers with stakes in the company have also been among the casualties since Carillion's crisis first became apparent last year.
Scotland's Kiltearn Partners, Canada's Letko Brosseau and Associates and BlackRock - the world's biggest asset manager - held large stakes in Carillion before a July 10 profit warning, which triggered a 39 percent plunge in its shares on the day.
Back then Kiltearn was Carillion's top investor with a 10 percent stake, according disclosures made to the stock market. BlackRock had a 7.6 percent shareholding and Letko owned 6.1 percent. All three have since cut down on their holdings. 
A spokesman for Kiltearn said the investment firm did not hold any shares by the time Carillion was placed in liquidation, having already reduced it stake to 4.9 percent by December.
BlackRock's holding went below 5 percent - meaning it no longer had to disclose its stake - just days after the July warning, while Letko's stake had been cut to 2.8 percent by November. 
SHORT POSITIONS PAY OFF
Among those who benefited from Carillion's demise, hedge funds shorting its shares have however made paper profits of hundreds of millions of dollars over the last year.
With a quarter of Carillion's shares shorted at the beginning of July 2107 – a total value of around $270 million – short-sellers made around $190 million when its share price fell 70 percent over the course of three trading days following the July profit warning, according to Reuters calculations. 
Many of the same funds made an additional $20 million when Carillion again warned on profits in November 2017, sending its shares down a further 48 percent in a single day. 
The latest disclosures to Britain's watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority show that BlackRock had a 1.95 percent short position on Carillion stock as of Jan. 11. 
A spokesman for BlackRock declined to comment on its overall exposure to Carillion. Letko did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
Hedge funds Bodenholm Capital and Coltrane Asset Management, which both also disclosed bets against Carillion shares to the FCA, made 4 million pounds each from shorting the stock since the July warning, Reuters calculations show.
Short-sellers pay institutional shareholders a fee to borrow their shares, before selling these on into the market. In most cases the hedge fund hopes to buy these shares back at a lower price in the future, return them to the original shareholder and pocket the difference. 
But if a company enters liquidation and its shares are eventually deemed worthless, the hedge fund does not have to return the stock. 
""They will sit on people's books for a while, the short-sellers will continue to pay a rental fee for a period of time to the original holder, but eventually they will be written off by both sides,"" said David Lewis, an analyst covering short-selling at data provider Astec Analytics. 
""The short-seller gets to keep the money they sold it for.""

1006,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>",Investors see few silver linings in Carillion collapse,"By Tom Pfeiffer 
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors struggled to find buying opportunities after the collapse of British construction and support services company  Carillion  (L:CLLN) on Monday, underscoring how risks have piled up for the whole industry. 
Calculating the implications of one of the biggest UK corporate failures of recent years is a challenge because of the wide scope of Carillion's operations. 
Companies from  Serco  (L:SRP) to  Interserve  (L:IRV),  Balfour Beatty  (L:BALF) and  Kier Group  (L:KIE) could now pick up work from Carillion, which did everything from providing school meals to building hospitals and managing part of the mammoth HS2 north-south rail project. 
Serco shares jumped 5 percent on Monday, with speculation it will swoop in to take over attractive Carillion healthcare facility management contracts. 
More work could come in for Babcock (L:BAB) in defense, Costain (L:COSG) and Kier in roads and Balfour Beatty in rail in coming months, broker Liberum said. 
It said contractors had been reporting better terms of new trade in the past six months and the disruption from Carillion's collapse may make customers think harder about driving deals that are too harsh for the supplier. 
But such optimism was tempered by the simple fact of one of the sector's biggest players going to the wall, with the government only willing to offer piecemeal help to minimize the disruption to public services. 
""People are looking at possible winners from this (but) in the short-term, it’s a pretty grim day for the UK construction sector,” said James Tetley, deputy head of research at N+1 Singer. 
Liberum estimated Carillion owes 1.5 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) to its banks RBS (LON:RBS),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), HSBC, Lloyds (LON:LLOY) and Santander (MC:SAN), including 500 million of ""reverse factoring"" where they have paid suppliers, and expects them to lose hundreds of millions. 
That will hardly make them more willing to lend to Carillion's peers when they share so many of its problems - an environment of often low-profit work where contracts are structured so the supplier shoulders much of the risk. 
""Ultimately the situation around Carillion is a function of a competitive outsourcing and construction market in the UK, amplified by excessive financial leverage which has built up over recent years,"" said UBS analysts. 
""While the departure of a competitor may ease this, we think the impact will likely be small given the fragmented nature of the market."" 
SUPPLY CHAIN RIPPLES
Much of Carillion's work was tied up in joint ventures. Its partners may be happy to shoulder its share of the work but in some cases they will be obliged to, and it might not benefit them. 
Where JVs have weak profitability or other problems, taking on even more of that business may hit earnings. Balfour Beatty and Galliford Try shares fell 2.4 percent and 3.5 percent respectively on Monday as they detailed the additional cost of completing projects in which they were a partner with Carillion. 
Analysts see little major supply chain disruption because the industry had time to prepare, although shares in  Speedy Hire  (L:SDY) - which counts Carillion among its biggest customers - dived 8 percent on Monday. 
That share price fall “looks a little bit harsh but it’s trying to price in all of the downside,"" said Tetley, who estimates Carillion was about 4 percent of Speedy Hire’s sales.

1008,By Business Insider,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 10:19AM ET</span>",Big pharma is getting ready to spend tax reform dollars on big deals," Every year, the biggest names in the pharma industry head to San Francisco to the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Healthcare Conference. And almost every year, a couple of big industry deals get announced at the event. 
This year, the expectation of M&A was especially pronounced. That's in large part because of tax reform in the US, which in addition to offering companies based in the US a lower corporate tax rate allows them to repatriate some of the cash they have overseas and put it to use. The life sciences is one of the industries with the  most cash overseas that'd be eligible for repatriation. 
""There was a big, big expectation that there was going to be some big M&A announced,"" UBS senior healthcare analyst Jerome Brimeyer told Business Insider.
On Sunday, biotech giant Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) acquired Impact Biosciences in a  $7 billion deal. And the Danish pharmaceutical company  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) made a $3.1 billion bid for the biotech company Ablynx, which was rejected. Based on the conversations Brimeyer's heard in San Francisco this week, the deals announced this year far have been underwhelming. ""There was almost a disappointment that there wasn't more M&A,"" Brimeyer said. 
That disappointment won't last forever, he said. ""I think given tax reform, there's much more to come. I think that's going to be an important factor for the performance of biotech and pharma this year. ""
It's something that's on company's radars, Brimeyer said, especially as they think of ways to use that repatriated cash. Other options besides acquiring companies with new medications in the works include share repurchasing programs, increasing dividends, and in some cases paying down debt. 
Eli Lilly chief financial officer Josh Smiley told Business Insider that the company has about $9 billion in cash overseas that will be repatriated over the next few years. While an estimated $3.5 billion will be paid in taxes to the US, the remaining money will ideally be used to build up the treatments Lilly has in the works. 
""We'd love to use the cash to buy and partner to expand our pipeline,"" Smiley said. Ultimately, the hope is to have one-third of Lilly's pipeline of medicines that are in development coming from outside the company.
But the changes that tax reform brings doesn't necessarily mean there's going to be an across-the-board flood of new deals, since some major pharmaceutical companies aren't based in the US to begin with. 
""You can't just say 'OK, it's going to trigger M&A in pharma,' I think it's going to be very company specific,"" GlaxoSmithKline US pharmaceuticals president Jack Bailey told Business Insider. The cash could also be used for other purposes, such as internal investments and dividends, he said.
""What we do know is there's a potential for another round of change within the pharmaceutical sector, given there's this much money overseas and that's got a chance to be repatriated,"" Bailey said. ""So I think it's going to be fascinating to watch, much like the pricing and reimbursement, legislative actions, and regulatory actions."""
1009,By Business Insider,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 10:18AM ET</span>",California's pain could be Colorado's gain as VCs shift investments outside Silicon Valley," When searching for startups to invest in, venture capitalists are increasingly casting their eyes outside of California — a trend that could benefit some states that were previously far from tech's center.
The number of funding deals outside of Silicon Valley's home state has been on the rise for years, noted PitchBook in its  2018 VC Outlook. That number is likely to increase in 2018, spreading the wealth to more areas of the country. ""With it becoming more expensive than ever to finance startups in the region, 2017 saw a growing proportion of deals and capital flow to developing VC hubs in mid-America,"" wrote analyst Joelle Sostheim in the report, PitchBook released last week. She continued: ""Geographically diverse investments tend to be less expensive for VCs while still offering competitive performance.""
Among the states or areas that stand to benefit from more investments are those with established or developing tech scenes, including  New York; Massachusetts; Washington, D.C.; Texas; and Illinois, according to the report. Other states that could see an investment boom are those with emerging startup sectors, including Colorado, Pennsylvania, and Florida. Those latter states could be boosted by their educational systems, their expertise in particular tech sectors, and their ""growing track record"" of startup successes, PitchBook reported.
As the number of investments in other states has grown, the number of California deals has shrunk by 16% in the last two years, according to the report.
But it's not guaranteed the trend will continue. Other states' startup scenes are less well developed than that in the Golden State, and that may limit how much money venture capitalists may be willing to put into them.
""Time is money, and many VCs may see sourcing investments from external hubs as not worth the cost,"" Sostheim said in the report. ""It takes time for ecosystems to develop, and some may be too undercapitalized or underresourced to offer a substantial enough pipeline for investors to commit."""
1010,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 10:13AM ET</span>",Airbus wins 2017 order race after last-gasp sales spree,"By Tim Hepher and Cyril Altmeyer
PARIS (Reuters) - Frenetic selling in the closing weeks of 2017 saw Airbus (PA:AIR) overhaul Boeing's (N:BA) recent lead in the global jet market to win their annual order contest for a fifth year in a row, though doubts remain over the future of its flagship A380.
The European planemaker said net orders after cancellations rose 52 percent to 1,109 jets in 2017, vaulting past Boeing's 912. Without the cancellations adjustment, Airbus gross orders were 1,229 compared with Boeing's 1,053
After peaking in 2014, Airbus says jet demand is growing faster than expected, reflecting busier traffic as global economies kick into a higher gear.
""The market is just stronger everywhere,"" Airbus sales chief John Leahy told reporters.
Airbus confirmed it had met its core 2017 target of more than 700 deliveries by releasing 718 jets to customers in 2017, up 4 percent from the previous year.
Boeing remained the world's largest jetmaker for the sixth year running, however, with a record total of 763 deliveries.
December's surge in commercial and industrial performance allowed Airbus to meet or exceed targets that had seemed elusive a few months ago and caps a turbulent year for the company after rows over corruption investigations and management tensions.
Analysts described it as a robust farewell performance by two of the company's dominant figures: record-holding salesman Leahy, who retires this month after more than 20 years at the helm, and chief operating officer Fabrice Bregier, who steps down in February after losing a corporate succession battle.
""We beat Boeing one last time ... we just went for it,"" Leahy told Reuters.
Both bequeathed challenging targets to their successors as Leahy predicted that orders would exceed deliveries in 2018 for the ninth year in a row, while Bregier predicted ""close to 800"" deliveries this year as output accelerates after engine delays.
That figure includes 30 aircraft already built and waiting for engines from United Technologies' (N:UTX) Pratt & Whitney, but Bregier said he was confident the U.S. business had turned the corner after delays on new engines.
The underlying production target is therefore closer to 770, implying 7 percent growth, which is closer to recent trends.
Oddo Securities analyst Yan Derocles said the more confident tone regarding engines for the A320neo gave more credibility to the target of 800 jets.
TARGETING TOP DELIVERY SPOT
Bregier also predicted a record order pipeline of more than 7,000 jets would allow Airbus to lift deliveries beyond those of Boeing in 2020. Both are neck-and-neck in planned production.
Boeing has questioned whether all of the aircraft sold by its rival will be delivered.
December's sales breakthrough focused mainly on the bread and butter of the Airbus portfolio - the medium-haul A320 family, which competes with Boeing's best-selling 737. 
Some in the industry have been left wondering how far Airbus was forced to cut prices to grab deals such as the 430 jets sold to four budget carriers via U.S. investor Indigo Partners.
Leahy, however, said the Indigo deal and other year-end activity reflected fundamental demand.
""It is a very serious deal with some very serious airlines,"" he told Reuters.
But in the wide-body, long-haul segment, Airbus lost about half its market share last year, with no new orders and two cancellations for the A380 superjumbo, though Boeing also suffered cancellations for its competing 747.
Airbus is locked in make-or-break talks with main A380 customer Emirates about buying 36 more superjumbos.
Leahy confirmed a Reuters report that the future of the A380 lies with Emirates, even though other airlines are interested in smaller numbers of the 544-seat jets. If the deal falls through, Airbus would have ""no choice"" but to close production, he said.
Reuters reported in December that Airbus had drawn up plans to phase out A380 production if those talks collapsed, without waiting for other potential buyers.
""There is some hope. Whether it means we soon conclude an agreement with Emirates? I hope so. There is a joint interest in achieving that, but we are not there yet,"" Bregier told Reuters.

Airbus confirmed it plans as part of any possible Emirates deal to reduce A380 output to six aircraft a year from 15 last year.

1013,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's Yunnan to inject capital in firm that missed shadow loan payments - sources,"By Shu Zhang and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - A Yunnan state-owned investment company that defaulted last month on two trust loans has secured financing to repay those loans and is set to get 2 billion yuan in additional equity capital from the provincial government.
Yunnan State-Owned Capital Operation Co, fully owned by the provincial government's state asset regulator, obtained the cash to repay the loans through one-month loans from three institutions, Liu Gang, the company's chairman, told Reuters in a telephone interview.
The loans will be repaid on Tuesday, Liu said, while declining to name the institutions providing the funds.
The Yunnan provincial government also is set to inject 2 billion yuan in the state-owned investment company, which defaulted on the two trust loans last month.
Those missed payments came amid growing fears that financing vehicles used by local governments throughout China, often for vanity projects that ran up large amounts of debt, may start to default this year.
Liu said Yunnan Capital was a platform to manage provincial state assets and carry out reforms at provincial government-owned companies. He said the anticipated capital injection had nothing to do with the loan repayments.
But, according to an internal memo from the trust company seen by Reuters and two sources with knowledge of the matter, the capital injection promised by the provincial government was to be used to help with the loan repayments.
On Dec 15, Yunnan Capital missed payments of more than 900 million yuan, representing principal and interest, that it had borrowed through two trust products issued by the Harbin-based Zhongrong International Trust, the two sources said on Monday.
The missed payments were the first known default of off-balance sheet, or shadow, loans borrowed by local governments, they said.
The case is closely being watched by investors and lenders concerned that China may be entering ""a year of defaults"" for off-balance sheet local government borrowing, one of the sources said.
The government capital injection to help the company repay loans, if it moves forward, could also indicate potential violations of the central government's ban that prevents local governments from providing implicit guarantees for local government financing vehicle (LGFV) debt, they added.
Yunnan Capital's Liu confirmed the government's capital injection plan but denied any relationship between it and the loan repayments. He said he did not consider his company to be a LGFV.
""Last week, Yunnan held four local governments accountable and punished a bunch of people for providing illegal guarantees - an activity that is not in line with the spirit of the central government,"" he said.
He said the 2 billion yuan capital injection from the government was aimed at boosting the company's capital strength and was pending budget approval by the local National People's Congress, the provincial legislature, which will convene later this month.
Ivan Chung, head of credit research and analysis for Greater China at Moody's Investors Service, said he expects the number of defaults by local government financing vehicles to increase in 2018 and 2019.
Thousands of financing vehicles have been created by local governments in recent years to fund large state-driven projects and hit economic growth targets.
They have taken on trillions of yuan in debt from banks, the bond market and shadow lenders such as trust firms, helping local governments bypass Beijing's limits on borrowing. Much of the debts come with implicit local government backing.
Beijing has increasingly cracked down on such debt-raising activities, stressing that it will not bail out local governments that run into financial difficulties.
One central bank researcher said recently that some cities should be allow to go bankrupt like Detroit.
Since late 2014, the central government has tried to address the situation of surging local government debt by revising the Budget Law, launching a municipal bond market, and stripping local government guarantees from debts held by local government vehicles.
At its annual economic conference in December, China's top leadership decided to take concrete measures to strengthen the regulation of local government debt in 2018 as policymakers look to rein in a massive debt pile and reduce financial risks facing the economy.
The finance ministry didn't immediately respond to a faxed request seeking comment. Zhongrong Trust didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
In September, Fitch said the first defaults on public bonds by Chinese local government financing vehicles were becoming more likely. Widespread defaults were a risk as the authorities relied on local government investment - supported by local vehicles - to hit economic growth targets, Fitch said.
Fitch estimated that 4 trillion yuan in bonds issued domestically by local government financing vehicles since the new Budget Law came into effect in 2015 remained outstanding by September. The amount was equivalent to 5.4 percent of China's gross domestic product.
""The central government's attitude is that the local governments are not allowed to provide guarantees,"" said Chung, adding that the governments ""have some space.""
""The question is do local governments have the resources to rescue the next defaulted state-owned company or LGFV?""

LONDON (Reuters) - Bruno Bulic doesn't have any problems asking a question when Swiss biotech firm Basilea Pharmaceutica (S:BSLN) hosts its earnings call. He's the only sell-side analyst to cover the company, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Though still rare, the number of billion-dollar stocks covered by just one broker could be about to increase after the roll-out of European Union rules aimed at making financial markets more transparent.
Under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), which went live this month, fund managers will have to pay an explicit fee for receiving research from banks, whereas previously they could get it for free and pay for it in trading costs.
One likely consequence of forcing fund managers to pay is that it will make them more selective and could force brokers to cut back on staff and rein in their scope of coverage.
Analysis of Europe's major small-cap indices shows companies in mainland Europe already suffer from a lack of analyst coverage, compared to the UK, the largest and most mature small cap market.
Switzerland, which is not in the EU but will have to abide by MiFID II rules, has the lowest analyst coverage among major European markets. Companies on its MSCI Small Cap Index are covered by just four analysts on average, compared with an average of nine on the equivalent UK index , and eight on Germany's small-cap index .
""If you are looking for good quality coverage in the MiFID context, it is going to be more and more challenging,"" said Bulic, who covers healthcare companies for broker Baader Helvea.
On Switzerland's main stock exchange index (SSMI), 30 companies, or 16 percent, have no sell-side research, while 28 (15 percent) are covered by just one analyst. The figures exclude investment trusts and companies with either a market capitalization under $100 million or a free float under 25 percent.
On Britain's FTSE All Share index (FTAS) in contrast, only 2 percent are covered by one analyst, while just one stock out of more than 450, Goodwin (L:GDWN), was not covered at all, Thomson Reuters data shows.
While a headache for fund managers, decreasing coverage can be a boon for specialist brokers, leaving them with monopolies on smaller companies and making them indispensable to investors.
""It is a good thing, of course,"" said Daniel Bürki, an analyst at ZKB, which is the only broker to offer coverage of Swiss media company APG (S:APGN).
""We have exclusive management contact and some clients have to contact you if they are interested in the stock.""
Even in the UK, with its far deeper, wealthier equity trading community, independent brokerages see a risk to the quality and depth of research on smaller companies.
Small-cap stockbroking specialists, who could lose out as big fund manager clients cut their research providers, may try to continue distributing research for free while relying solely on their corporate clients for payment.
""That causes complications, as investors may find themselves in a situation where the only research available on a small-cap company is from the house broker, which by definition is not independent,"" said Ross Mitchinson, co-CEO of Numis, which covers around 400 large and smaller UK companies.
He said it means less research written on smaller UK stocks, and far less independent research.
""That can only be a bad thing for capital markets, and for the UK as a listing venue,"" Mitchinson said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Struggling commodities trader Noble Group has completed the sale of its U.S.-focused oil business to the world's largest oil trader Vitol, but net proceeds from the deal are lower than a previously announced estimate, the company said on Monday. 
In a statement, Noble Group said net proceeds from the sale of Noble Americas Corp (NAC) to Vitol were expected to be about $400 million.
In October, Hong-Kong based Noble said gross proceeds from the deal would be about $1.42 billion and it expected to make about $580 million after repaying loans.
Noble said the lower return on the sale that closed on Jan. 12 was ""primarily due to operating losses of NAC from Oct. 1 2017 to the closing date.""
The Singapore-listed company, which had a market capitalization of $6 billion in early February 2015, was plunged into crisis after a report by blogger Iceberg Research later that month questioning its accounting.
Noble stood by its accounts and rejected the report's allegations but coupled with a major commodities downturn, the firm was unable to recover investor confidence. 
Its market value has shrunk to around $200 million as it has progressively sold off large parts of its business to stay afloat.
Noble also sold U.S. gas and power business to Mercuria for less than previously announced - $168 million compared with $250 million.
Paul Brough, a restructuring specialist who oversaw part of the liquidation of Lehman Brothers, was appointed chairman last year and said he was taking steps to avoid insolvency. 
The company has also been closing what remains of its global oil trading business, returning to its roots as an Asian hard commodities trader.
Noble said it had generated about $525 million in net proceeds after the sales to Mercuria and Vitol as well as monetizing what was left of its oil business within UK incorporated Noble Clean Fuels Ltd. 
On top of the approximately $400 million from the Vitol deal, the trader said it had ""generated over $100 million of cash proceeds"" from the wind down of working capital balances in NCFL, which was largely concluded in December 2017. 

Included in the total was $20 million released from escrow to the group from the deal with Mercuria.

Monday's statement on behalf of the company did not detail the amount outstanding. 
However, Thomson Reuters Loan Pricing Corp (LPC) reported on Thursday that aviation-to-property conglomerate HNA needed fresh funding to repay bridging loans and to finance development of four plots of land in Hong Kong's Kai Tak area.
One of the bridging loan tranches, worth HK$2.5 billion ($320 million), was due on Monday, LPC said.
HNA is facing rising financing costs after spending $50 billion over the past two years on deals that included investments in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBkGn) and the Hilton (N:HLT) hotels group.
An executive at the indebted group told Reuters in December that the conglomerate was not facing a liquidity crisis and characterized its high-profile investments as successful.
The HNA unit said in Monday's statement that the bridging loan maturity was being extended to July 15 because it needed ""extra time to complete arrangement"" for the development of the Hong Kong land.
""We would like to stress again that we have planned meticulously on all aspects of the development and funding of the project and the company has good relationship with the bankers,"" it said.

""We can speak with confidence that we have secured sufficient capital to support development of this project and the project will proceed smoothly as planned.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Insurance market Lloyd's of London [SOLYD.UL], an integral part of the British business scene since the 17th century, is on track to start operations at its Brussels unit next January, its chief executive said on Monday.
Lloyd's has been among the most vocal financial businesses on the need for a European Union subsidiary if Britain has no access to the single market after leaving the bloc and is one of the first to announce such a move.
Lloyd's, which started life in Edward Lloyd's coffee house in 1688, houses more than 80 syndicates in a building in the City of London. Its syndicates focus on specialist insurance and reinsurance in anything from oil rigs to athletes' legs.
The venerable insurance market said last March that it had chosen Brussels as the site for its EU subsidiary because of its strong regulatory framework.
""We are hiring people, we hope to make some appointments shortly. We will have the Brussels subsidiary up and running by January 1, 2019,"" Chief Executive Inga Beale told Reuters on the sidelines of a financial forum in Hong Kong.
""That is ahead of the actual official exit, but we run a market and we want to be ready for all of our businesses and syndicates that operate within the market. That's why we are really pushing ahead.""
Beale said that the application for setting up the Brussels subsidiary was with the Belgium regulator and that Lloyd's is seeking office space and putting technology systems in place. 
""The only thing that might change it ... is any sort of delay to an actual impact of Brexit,"" she said, referring to the launch plan.
On the hiring plans for the Brussels unit, Beale said ""it will be in the tens, probably, up to 40 or something"", adding that the group would also move some roles from other centers to the new subsidiary.
Lloyd's, which earns about 10 percent of its global revenue from insurance premiums underwritten in Asia Pacific, has also been expanding in the region and set up an onshore presence in India last year.
Its major markets in the Asia Pacific region include China, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore.

""It's very, very important and we will be growing,"" Beale said, referring to the Asia Pacific region, adding that there is growing demand for insurance providing coverage for political risk, terrorism and cyber breaches.

BEIJING/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish toymaker Lego is teaming up with Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) to jointly develop online games and potentially a social network aimed at Chinese children. 
Privately-owned Lego has seen a slowdown in sales growth in recent years, but the Chinese market has been a bright spot with sales growing 25-30 percent in 2016.
It is competing with Barbie maker  Mattel Inc  (O:MAT) and Hasbro (O:HAS), the firm behind My Little Pony, for a slice of the $31 billion toys and games market in China.
Lego said on Monday the partnership with Tencent, China's biggest social network and gaming company, aimed to create a safe online environment covering content, platforms, and experiences tailored for Chinese children.
""What we are looking for now with Tencent is just to find more creative ways... (of) reaching children, and creating bespoke content with Tencent, in this case, video games,"" Jacob Kragh, head of Lego in China, told Reuters on Monday at joint event with Tencent in Beijing. 
The partnership includes developing a Lego video zone for children on the Tencent video platform, as well as developing and operating Lego branded licensed games, the toymaker said.
It also includes LEGO BOOST - a building and coding set that lets children turn their brick creations into moving objects - and will explore developing a joint social network for children in China.
Tencent is Asia's most valuable company with a market capitalization of $537 billion.
Last year, Mattel struck deals with Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) and online content developer BabyTree to sell interactive learning products based on its Fisher-Price toys.
Lego has about a 3 percent market share in China, followed by Mattel and Hasbro with around 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively, according to Euromonitor International.

In November 2016, Lego opened a factory in Jiaxing, China, which it expects to produce 70-80 percent of all Lego products sold in Asia.

1024,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 05:09AM ET</span>",Euro hits three-year high as Europe leads global optimism,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro hit a fresh three-year high on Monday as optimism around growth buoys expectations of tighter policy from central banks, while the chance of a pro-European coalition in Germany also boosted confidence in the continent.
With the world in general and Europe in particular showing signs of sustained economic growth, global stocks benchmarks jumped to fresh highs, even though investors are now pricing in the withdrawal of central banks' extraordinary stimulus. 
That view was given further fuel last week by an account of European Central Bank discussions which suggested policymakers could soon start preparing the ground for a reduction in support. 
The single currency rose to $1.2227 at one stage on Monday, a price last seen in December 2014, just before the ECB first announced its massive government bond purchase program.
Nor is the ECB the only game in town: Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda offered a positive view on his nation's economy and inflation on Monday, sending the yen to a four-month high against the dollar.
""The latest leg up in the euro has clearly come from optimism that the German government is moving towards a agreement for a coalition government,"" said Investec economist Victoria Clarke. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party and the Social Democrats (SPD) are moving towards formal coalition talks, soothing concerns around Europe's largest economy.
The SPD's pro-European stance -- leader Martin Schulz recently argued for a ""United States of Europe"" -- also strengthens the case for investment in the euro. 
""This follows an earlier move triggered by the crucial line in the ECB account which has got people thinking about when the first move on rates will happen,"" said Clarke.
Euro zone money markets now price in a 70 percent chance of a 10 basis point hike from the European Central Bank by the end of the year, up from 50 percent a week before.
The strength in the euro pushed European stocks a touch lower, as exporters were hit by the currency strength. An index of pan-European stocks was down 0.2 percent on the day, but still not far from multi-year high hit last week. 
The slight fall comes in the wider context of a storming 2018 for world stocks so far as investors bask in strong growth numbers from most of the world's largest countries. 
MSCI's all-country index of world stocks soared to new records overnight and MSCI's Asia ex-Japan index breached its 2007 high for the first time to set a new all-time record. 
Stocks in Hong Kong jumped 0.9 percent from Friday's record closing high. Investors were optimistic that Chinese gross domestic product data for the December quarter due on Thursday would show growth of at least 6.7 percent for the world's second biggest economy.
The momentum of global economic growth through the closing months of last year is being underlined by the early stages of the fourth-quarter earnings season. 
Earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to increase on average by 12.1 percent in the quarter, with profit for financial services companies likely to increase 13.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Wall St stocks set new records on Friday, but U.S. markets will be mostly closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Day holiday. 
DOLLAR DOWN 
The dollar index showed no sign of bouncing early on Monday, instead edging down to a fresh trough of 90.571.
Though the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to continue to hike rates this year, this has been largely priced in and investors are starting to position for central bank action in Europe and Japan instead. 
The dollar slipped to a six-week low on the yen at 110.73 yen, even as the head of the Bank of Japan reiterated his commitment to keeping yields low.
Oil prices consolidated following six straight sessions of gains, with output cuts led by OPEC and Russia as well as healthy demand keeping crude near December 2014 highs. [O/R]

Brent crude futures fell 23 cents to $69.64 a barrel, while U.S. crude was lower 11 cents at $64.20.

1025,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's JD.com targets $2 billion fundraising at logistics unit - sources,"By Julie Zhu and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's second-biggest e-commerce firm JD.com (O:JD) has kicked off a fundraising round at its logistics unit with a target of at least $2 billion, and eventually plans to list the business overseas, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
JD.com, which only trails  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) in China's e-commerce market, has invited a select group of investors to join the funding round that values its logistics business, JD Logistics, at around $10 billion, two of the people told Reuters.
The move comes as China's major e-commerce companies are looking to bulk up their logistics businesses to support their global expansion ambitions and boost revenues by offering services to third-party entities.
Chinese investment firm Hillhouse Capital Group and Sequoia Capital China will likely be lead investors of JD Logistics' funding round, while a number of state-owned and international investors have also shown strong interest in the deal, according to the people.
Demand could be strong enough that smaller investors putting up just $100 million - the floor for investments, according to two people - would have to prove they could help the logistics unit to bring in new business, one of them said.
JD.com declined to comment. Hillhouse and Sequoia did not respond to requests for comment. The sources could not be named as the information is confidential.
JD Logistics is currently 100 percent owned by JD.com. It is not clear when and where the IPO process will be undertaken.
Hillhouse Capital is the second-biggest equity investor in JD.com, according to Thomson Reuters data. Alibaba rival Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) is also a top-10 investor in JD.com, the data shows.
The fundraising and any ensuing spin-off would give JD Logistics - set up as a separate entity within the company last April - some independence and help it offer services to third-party clients as well as to compete with Alibaba's logistics network Cainiao and delivery services firms such as SF Express, the people said.
Logistics groups have increasingly sought investments to fund work on solutions to supply-chain issues, including autonomous driving, automated warehousing, cross-border logistics and smart logistics services. JD.com, being aggressive in that push, was the first one in China to invest in drones.
Last year, JD.com invested in logistics infrastructure in Southeast Asia, expanding from existing commitments in Indonesia. It also announced a partnership with Japanese delivery firm Yamato Holdings (T:9064) last month to ship products from Japanese retailers to China.
JD.com posted net earnings of 1 billion yuan ($151 million), its highest-ever quarterly profit, in the three months to September 30, confounding analysts' forecasts of a 213 million yuan loss.
The company has a current market cap of $66 billion.

Speaking to journalists after posting higher orders and deliveries in 2017, Chief Operating Officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said he was prepared to bet that Airbus would deliver more airplanes than Boeing in 2020 - a feat it last achieved in 2011 - because of a record order backlog.
For 2018, he predicted deliveries would accelerate to reach close to 800 aircraft, up around 11 percent compared with annual gains of 8 percent and 4 percent in 2017 and 2016 respectively.
Airbus delivered 718 jets in 2017, compared with 763 delivered by Boeing.

Bregier also expressed confidence in the ability of engine maker Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) to keep up with aircraft production plans after overcoming a series of delays.

A spin-off - potentially the biggest IPO by a Japanese company in nearly two decades - would give the unit more autonomy and help investors value the business as well as its parent which has myriad holdings across the tech industry.
SoftBank Group is aiming to sell about 30 percent of SoftBank Corp, Japan's No. 3 wireless carrier, for around 2 trillion yen ($18 billion), the Nikkei newspaper said without citing sources. It added that proceeds will go towards investments in growth such as buying into foreign information technology companies. 
""It makes sense to spin off the mobile-phone business using a public offering that would leave SoftBank in control and provide SoftBank with more cash to pursue its strategy of investing in companies with potentially high growth prospects,"" Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.
""It is a way of obtaining capital without adding debt or diluting SoftBank's equity interests in the growth companies.""
SoftBank Group plans to seek approval from the Tokyo Stock Exchange as early as spring, the Nikkei said, adding that it was aiming to list around autumn in Tokyo as well as overseas, possibly London. 
The conglomerate said in a statement that a listing of the telecoms business was one option for its capital strategy but that no such decision had been made. Its shares finished 3 percent higher on the news.
An IPO of about 2 trillion yen would be one of the biggest offerings by a Japanese company, rivaling a 2.1 trillion yen listing by NTT DoCoMo Inc (T:9437) in 1998 and the 2.2 trillion yen raised by the government's sale of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (T:9432) shares before its 1987 listing.
Large companies seeking to list in Tokyo are required to float at least 35 percent of their shares although these rules can be eased when the company is also listing overseas. 
COMPLEX STRUCTURE
SoftBank Group has a vast range of holdings including stakes in British chip designer ARM Holdings (L:ARM), struggling U.S. wireless service provider Sprint Corp (N:S) as well as  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA).
It has with other investors also set up a $93 billion Vision Fund that is investing in a range of firms to capitalize on a tech future expected to be driven by artificial intelligence, robotics and interconnected devices.
That complicated structure and constant stream of new investments has made valuing the company extremely difficult and analysts often note that its market value does not accurately reflect the value of its massive holdings.
SoftBank Group's market capitalization currently stands at around $92 billion. By contrast, its near 30 percent stake in Alibaba is worth around $140 billion. 
An IPO could lead to softness in SoftBank Group shares for a while as some telecoms-focused investors sell their holdings to buy shares in the newly listed entity, said Chris Lane, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. 
""What SoftBank will ultimately have to do, and they would have to do this in any case, is attract investors who are looking at this as a tech focused investment co(mpany),"" he said.
The domestic telecoms unit posted a 4.5 percent rise in operating profit to 720 billion yen in the year ended March on sales of 3.2 trillion yen.
While it has been SoftBank Group's most profitable source of income, it faces headwinds including an aging population, a shift by consumers to cheaper carriers and plans by e-commerce firm  Rakuten Inc  (T:4755) to enter the market.
With SoftBank's founder Masayoshi Son reluctant to sell stakes in investments seen as having large upside potential such as Alibaba, listing the telecoms business could provide a place to park some of the conglomerate's large debt burden.
""If the desire is to be able to raise capital for future vision funds, pushing as much of the debt into the telco as possible makes sense,"" said Lane. 
SoftBank's debt pile stood at around $100 billion in the financial quarter ended September.

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) on Monday unveiled a redesigned Ram large pickup that along with General Motors Co's (N:GM) new Chevrolet Silverado, which debuted on Saturday, sealed a double victory for the steel industry's fight to remain the dominant metal in the auto market.
The 2019 Ram is made mostly of “real steel,” Michael Manley, head of the global Ram and Jeep brands for Fiat Chrysler, told reporters at a briefing ahead of the official debut of the truck at the Detroit Auto Show. The new Silverado also is made mostly of steel, including a high-strength steel cargo box, unlike the top-selling U.S. pickup truck,  Ford Motor Co 's (N:F) F-150, which has a body and cargo box made of aluminum.
Ford jolted the industry in December 2014 when it launched the current generation F-150 with an all-aluminum body. Ford’s F-series trucks represented the largest-scale use of aluminum in a high-volume vehicle, and required technological risk-taking at a level rarely seen among the Detroit automakers.
The aluminum F-150 was up to 700 pounds (318 kg) lighter than the previous steel model, and delivered an 11-percent improvement in combined city and highway fuel economy - a substantial boost for Ford’s effort to meet escalating federal fuel efficiency targets.
However, it came at a cost. Rolled steel costs around $800 per ton, while aluminum is more than $2,000 per ton, estimated metals industry analyst Charles Bradford of Bradford Research. The high-strength steels used in the new Ram and Silverado cost more than standard steel alloys, but still have the price edge over aluminum, he said.
The auto show, officially called the North American International Auto Show, opened to media on Sunday and runs until Jan. 28.
LOW GAS PRICES TIP THE SCALES
Since the aluminum F-150's launch, U.S. auto executives have come to a consensus that U.S. gasoline prices will be stable for the long haul. In that environment, Ford’s rivals chose to stick with steel, and aim for higher profit margins. The automakers are lobbying the Trump administration for changes to federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, targets that would make it easier for trucks to comply.
""CAFE standards have been driving much of the shift to aluminum and the Trump administration has really backed off those,” Bill Hickey, president of Chicago-based Lapham-Hickey Steel, which has seven steel processing plants in the Midwest and Northeast.
Fiat Chrysler is taking steps to improve the fuel efficiency of the 2019 Ram over the current model, which is rated at 20 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving.
The new Ram is more aerodynamic than its predecessor, and will offer a 48-volt hybrid system on most gasoline versions, one of the highest-volume uses of such technology yet. When accelerating from a stop, the hybrid system will use electricity to launch the vehicle before the gasoline engine kicks in.
The 2019 Ram is wider than the current model and has a 4-inch longer wheelbase. Passengers get more leg room and Fiat Chrysler benefits from federal fuel economy rules that set lower mileage targets for wider, longer vehicles, company officials said.
GM's new Silverado's wheelbase is also stretched by four inches compared to the current model, and can carry more in the back. GM executives on Saturday said it will nonetheless it is 450 pounds lighter, and will be more efficient.
GM is taking between 200 and 500 pounds out of all its new models using a mix of materials, including high strength steel, and redesigning parts to reduce weight, said Mark Reuss, head of the automaker's global product development. ""That's a great formula without charging all kinds of money for materials that people don’t care about,"" he said after the official debut of the 2019 Silverado in Detroit on Saturday.
GM and Fiat Chrysler together sold about 1.3 million large pickup trucks in 2017, and the Silverado and Ram are respectively the second- and third best-selling model lines in the United States.
Fiat Chrysler identified its steel suppliers as AK Steel[AKST.UL],  Nucor  Corp (N:NUE) and Arcelor Mittal.
The auto industry accounts for about two-thirds of sales for AK Steel, and trucks and sport utility vehicles accounted for about three-fourths of those automotive sales, spokeswoman Lisa Jester wrote in an email. She declined to comment on specific customers.
Fiat Chrysler engineers said using high-strength steel in the new Ram's frame and body helped cut a total of 225 pounds (102 kg) from the vehicle’s weight, or about a 4 percent reduction compared with the outgoing model. The new Ram has some aluminum parts, including the tailgate and certain components such as engine mounts and elements of the suspension.
Cutting weight makes more room to boost payload, and add luxury features to increase revenue per truck, such as an optional 12-inch touch screen to control entertainment and other features, and optional ""barnwood"" accents in the interior of the Western-themed Longhorn model.

1035,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>","HNA's problems mount as airlines delay payments, bank sets up team to handle debt: sources","By Engen Tham and Anshuman Daga
SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Some airlines affiliated with China's HNA Group Co Ltd are delaying aircraft lease payments to lessors, and Export-Import Bank of China, which is a long-term financer of the group, has formed a team to handle the conglomerate's liquidity issues, several banking and leasing sources said.
Executives from leasing units of Chinese lenders including Bank of China Ltd (SS:601988), China Minsheng Banking Corp Ltd (SS:600016) and Bank of Communications Co Ltd (SS:601328) have held talks with some HNA-linked airlines to recover payments, the sources said.
""Some payments have been delayed by over two months,"" said one senior Beijing-based executive at a Chinese lessor. He said HNA airlines had informed the lessor that payments would be made soon as they expected banks to support HNA in coming months.
HNA, an aviation-to-financial services conglomerate, said in a statement to Reuters: ""HNA and its subsidiaries are maintaining stable operations, and are in the process of gradually paying each lessor's fees as planned.""
HNA's $50 billion worth of deal-making over the past two years, which included investments in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBkGn) and the Hilton (N:HLT) hotels group, has sparked intense scrutiny of its opaque ownership and use of leverage.
In June, the Chinese government told major banks to review their credit exposure to HNA and a handful of other non-state companies, putting pressure on its finances.
Some of the sources from lessors and banks said HNA's flagship Hainan Airlines (SS:600221) and smaller ones including Lucky Air and Capital Airlines had missed payments, while Tianjin Airlines was seeking to extend the term for payments due this year.
The sources declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Lucky Air and Capital Airlines declined to comment. Tianjin Airlines, Bank of Communications Financial Leasing, Minsheng Financial Leasing and EXIM did not respond to requests for comment.
Hainan Airlines suspended trading on Jan. 10 pending an announcement. The reason for the share suspension is unclear.
Tianjin Airlines has asked a Chinese lessor to delay June rental payments for three aircraft, said one source with direct knowledge.
Another source said one HNA-affiliated airline has told Bank of Communications Financial Leasing that it will not be paying rental payments due in January. He did not name the airline.
In the last few weeks, executives from some international lessors have flown to China to meet executives at HNA-affiliated airlines and thrash out a repayment plan, the sources said.
""This is a widespread issue among many lessors but they understand that a lot depends on whether banks re-open their funding for HNA and lessors are betting on that,"" said one financier at a European bank.
In November, Airfinance Journal reported the delays in lease rental payments and the problems have intensified since then, the sources said.
However, Robert Martin, the chief executive of BOC Aviation Ltd (HK:2588), said his company, the leasing unit of Bank of China, did not have problems on lease payments by HNA-linked airlines.
""BOC Aviation has very strong focus on receivables management and we ended 2017 with a collection rate of 99.9 percent. This included airline subsidiaries of the HNA Group,"" Martin said in an e-mail.
RECOVERY GROUP
Faced with a slew of repayment obligations and concerns about rising financing costs, HNA had its creditworthiness downgraded in November by S&P Global Ratings, as a result of its ""aggressive financial policy"".
Underlining the growing concern by lenders over the group's repayment obligations, the Beijing-based EXIM set up a team this month to handle HNA's debt, which the conglomerate is struggling to repay, banking sources said.
HNA has promised to pay all outstanding delayed payments by the end of January, said a source with direct knowledge.
EXIM did not respond to request for comments.
EXIM's HNA team was set up after meetings at the conglomerate's headquarters in Hainan, in southern China, late last year, when HNA asked for new loans to cover existing debt, the source said.
HNA has also been attempting to re-organize its debt commitments from other lenders, the banking sources said.
BIG PLAYER
HNA Group has 223 planes on either financial or operating leases, according to financial reports at the end of June, making up around 62 percent of their fleet.
Many aircraft leases in China are full-recourse leases, said David Yu, a professor and aircraft leasing specialist at New York University Shanghai. This means lessors are on the hook for the money banks have lent them to acquire the planes, putting them at risk of default, he said.
Depending on the terms of the loans, lenders would be able to take steps including asking for early repayment of loans to seizing planes for sale. But the lessors for the HNA airlines had not taken any steps to seize any planes as they were confident of receiving the payments, the sources said.

1036,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2018 11:57PM ET</span>","Ford plans $11 billion investment, 40 electrified vehicles by 2022","By Nick Carey and Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) will significantly increase its planned investments in electric vehicles to $11 billion by 2022 and have 40 hybrid and fully electric vehicles in its model lineup, Chairman Bill Ford said on Sunday at the Detroit auto show.
The investment figure is sharply higher than a previously announced target of $4.5 billion by 2020, Ford executives said, and includes the costs of developing dedicated electric vehicle architectures. Ford's engineering, research and development expenses for 2016, the last full year available, were $7.3 billion, up from $6.7 billion in 2015.
Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett told investors in October the automaker would slash $14 billion in costs over the next five years and shift capital investment away from sedans and internal combustion engines to develop more trucks and electric and hybrid cars.
Of the 40 electrified vehicles Ford plans for its global lineup by 2022, 16 will be fully electric and the rest will be plug-in hybrids, executives said. 
""We're all in on this and we're taking our mainstream vehicles, our most iconic vehicles, and we're electrifying them,"" Ford told reporters. ""If we want to be successful with electrification, we have to do it with vehicles that are already popular."" 
General Motors Co (N:GM), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) have already outlined aggressive plans to expand their electric vehicle offerings and target consumers who want luxury, performance and an SUV body style - or all three attributes in the same vehicle.
Mainstream auto makers are reacting in part to pressure from regulators in China, Europe and California to slash carbon emissions from fossil fuels. They also are under pressure from 
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA)'s success in creating electric sedans and SUVs that inspire would-be owners to line up outside showrooms and flood the company with orders. 
GM said last year it would add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global lineup by 2023, financed by robust profits from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles in the United States and China.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has promised investors the Detroit automaker will make money selling electric cars by 2021.
Volkswagen said in November it would spend $40 billion on electric cars, autonomous driving and new mobility services by the end of 2022 – significantly more than when it announced two months earlier it would invest more than 20 billion euros on electric and self-driving cars through 2030.
Toyota is racing to commercialize a breakthrough battery technology during the first half of the 2020s with the potential to cut the cost of making electric cars.
Ford's additional investments in electric vehicles contrasted with many of the vehicle launches at the Detroit show which featured trucks and SUVs. On Sunday evening,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) unveiled its new G-class SUV, a bulky off roader, in an abandoned movie theater in downtown Detroit once used as a set for the movie “8 Mile.” 
Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche hinted to Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger during an exchange on stage next to the G-class that Daimler would someday have an electric version of the vehicle.
SUVs figured in Ford's electric vehicle presentation. The automaker's president of global markets, Jim Farley, said on Sunday that Ford would bring a high-performance electric utility vehicle to market by 2020. The company will begin production of a hybrid version of its popular F-150 truck at a plant in Dearborn, Michigan, in 2020.
""What we learned from this first cycle of electrification is people want really nice products,"" Farley said.
'THINK BIG'
Ford’s shift to the electric vehicle strategy has been more than six months in the making after Hackett replaced former Chief Executive Mark Fields in May.
The plan was finalized in recent months after an extensive review, a person familiar with the process said. In October, Ford disclosed it had formed a team to accelerate global development of electric vehicles, whose mission is to “think big” and “make quicker decisions.”
Some of the electric vehicles will be produced with Ford’s JV in China aimed at the Chinese market. One aim of Ford’s “Team Edison” is to identify and develop electric-vehicle partnerships with other companies, including suppliers, in some markets, according to Sherif Marakby, vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification.

China, India, France and the United Kingdom all have announced plans to phase out vehicles powered by combustion engines and fossil fuels between 2030 and 2040.

1038,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2018 11:09PM ET</span>","After emissions scandal, VW on U.S. comeback trail with all-new Jetta","By Andreas Cremer
DETROIT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) launched an all-new Jetta compact car, its biggest seller in America, at the Detroit Auto Show on Sunday as it looks to revive sales in the world's second-largest auto market and move on from the emissions scandal that has tarnished its reputation over the past few years.
The world's largest automaker is still grappling with investigations and lawsuits around the world related to revelations that it cheated government emissions tests for diesel-powered vehicles and has already paid $30 billion in fines and costs for the fraud.
But there are signs the German carmaker is repairing the damage with consumers. Volkswagen brand sales worldwide rose to a record 6.23 million cars in 2017, with demand in the United States growing for the first time since 2013, VW said late on Sunday.
""Some of our critics thought the diesel crisis would block our view. Instead we have, undeterred by the crisis or rather fired by it, developed our digitization and electrification strategy,"" Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, a member of VW's executive board, told reporters on Dec. 11.
In the United States, VW brand sales rose 5.2 percent in 2017, even as U.S. consumers turned away from smaller cars that are still the brand's mainstay.
""We are really starting to see the efforts of our work reflected in our sales,"" Hinrich Woebcken, the new head of the Volkswagen brand in North America, said on Sunday at the Detroit auto show.
Spurred by a perception that the authoritarian culture at VW had been a factor in the cheating, top management has also loosened the reins on the VW empire and decentralized power from its Wolfsburg, Germany headquarters.
For example, German native Woebcken told reporters on the sidelines of the Los Angeles auto show in November that U.S. managers concluded that the original name for an SUV the company planned to launch in America would not work. 
The original name ""started with a T, and then it broke your tongue,"" Woebcken said. 
U.S. Volkswagen executives proposed a simpler name for the U.S. market - Atlas. Wolfsburg management went along. The Atlas, launched from VW's Tennessee factory last year, accounted for nearly 8 percent of VW brand sales in the U.S. last year.
""It's unusual to give a regional name to a product,"" Woebcken said. ""In terms of VW, it is a pretty big thing."" 
VW brand CEO Herbert Diess agreed.
""We have given the regions much more responsibility and we are improving operations,"" he said, adding the new Jetta would be $100 cheaper than the outgoing model even though it offers additional driver-assistance functions and LED lights as standard.
ELECTRIC VEHICLES, MICROBUS AHEAD
VW Group CEO Matthias Mueller will stay away from the Detroit auto show next week to let the carmaker's U.S. leaders present the redesigned Jetta, which represented a third of the brand's 340,000 U.S. sales in 2017.
With a lowered roofline and a new 8-speed automatic transmission, the model is tailored to U.S. design and fuel-economy needs and drew more input from North American engineers than its predecessor, the sources said ahead of the launch.
VW's historical underperformance in the United States was a problem for the company long before ""dieselgate"" and the failure by top managers to tap the SUV boom and other market trends in 2014 caused labor boss Bernd Osterloh to denounce VW's U.S. business as a ""catastrophe.""
VW now hopes to reshape its image, in part by persuading environmentally conscious, younger consumers and regulators in its major markets that it is serious about electric vehicles (EVs). VW has raised its planned spending on EVs, self-driving technology and digital mobility businesses across the group to 34 billion euros ($41 billion) through 2022. 
Volkswagen is now betting that a new modular platform dubbed MEB, designed to underpin more than 20 purely battery-powered brand models, will allow it to turn profits on EVs when they launch from 2019, in part because they share parts with other cars built from MEB.
Woebcken said in Los Angeles that VW was working on a decision about where to build future EVs for the United States, including a new VW Microbus promised for 2022.
VW has been teasing U.S. consumers with Microbus concepts for years, trying to rekindle the warm feelings for the vehicle synonymous with the free-wheeling 1960s. 
""We did not have a clue how to get it industrialized,"" Woebcken said. ""Now, we have, with the MEB platform. It's decided. It's industrialized. It will come.""

Some $1.2 billion of the planned investments are destined for the United States where Volkswagen in 2018 will launch a redesigned version of its top-selling Jetta compact sedan and the all-new Arteon fastback, it said on Sunday.
""We want to gain market share and grow from a niche player to a truly relevant brand in the United States,"" Hinrich Woebcken, chief executive of VW's North America business, said on Sunday at the Detroit auto show.

The world's largest automaker has been seeking to revive its business in the United States where its diesel emissions scandal broke in September 2015. VW said it planned to launch at least two new models in the United States as it aims to break even in terms of operating profits in North America by 2020.

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2018 06:51PM ET</span>",Ford unveils future Ranger pickup for segment rivals dominate,"By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Sunday will officially take the wraps off its long-awaited Ranger midsize pickup truck, a year ahead of its arrival in showrooms, as rivals consolidate positions in a segment Detroit automakers once gave up for dead.
Ford executives did not disclose prices or fuel efficiency ratings for the new Ranger during a briefing for the media ahead of the official unveiling at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.
More than two years ago Ford telegraphed its decision to re-launch the Ranger midsize truck in North America after killing the model in 2011. At the time, Ford executives said they could satisfy pickup truck demand - and make more money - by widening the price range and engine options of its larger F-150 pickup model line. Detroit rivals General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) abandoned the segment around the same time.
However, in late 2014, GM launched new Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Sierra pickups, and Japanese automakers Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) reinvigorated their midsize pickup trucks, aiming at customers who wanted to haul bikes, surfboards and other bulky recreational gear, not sheets of plywood.
As gasoline prices stabilized, more customers turned to the new, smaller pickups. GM in 2017 sold more than 145,000 Colorado and Canyon trucks. Toyota, the segment leader, sold more than 198,000 Tacoma trucks in 2017, up 3.4 percent from a year earlier and 27 percent ahead of 2014, according to figures compiled by Autodata.
Sales in the U.S. compact pickup segment as a whole grew in 2017 to more than 417,000 vehicles, up more than 70 percent from 2014, according to Autodata.
""We see more of an opportunity that didn't exist five years ago,"" Ford truck marketing manager Todd Eckert said. 
Ford executives said the North American Ranger will share engineering and some design elements with a work-oriented pickup the company builds and sells in Southeast Asia and other markets. The exterior and interior styling of the North American Ranger will be aimed at a more affluent, recreational use buyer.

The new Ranger will start arriving in North American dealerships in early 2019 and be assembled at its Wayne, Michigan, factory in suburban Detroit. Ford's decision to invest $850 million in the Wayne plant to build the Ranger and a new Bronco SUV won praise last year from U.S. President Donald Trump.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra expressed optimism on Saturday that the North American Free Trade Agreement would survive, and other senior GM executives stood by the company's plans to continue building trucks in Mexico.
At an event to tout GM's 2019 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck ahead of the Detroit auto show, Barra twice did not answer directly when asked if the automaker is reconsidering current production in Mexico in light of potential changes or the collapse of the trade deal between the United States, Canada and Mexico.
Company executives did not rule out future changes to its North American production plans depending on the outcome of ongoing NAFTA renegotiation talks, even though it would be costly to shift production of trucks.
Rival  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) said on Thursday it will move production of its next-generation heavy-duty pickup trucks to Michigan from a plant in Mexico, a move that reduces the risk that those trucks would be hit with a 25 percent tariff if NAFTA unravels.
Barra sidestepped a question about GM's Mexican truck factory, saying, ""When I look at our footprint, there is so much more work and negotiations to be done on NAFTA.""
Mark Reuss, GM's product development chief, said the company is using its existing truck plants in North America, but would not elaborate when asked if GM could stop building trucks in Mexico. 
""I'm not sure that we would tell anybody that,"" Reuss said. ""I don't think we'd be talking about our footprint in the future.""
In a separate exchange with reporters, Reuss said GM intended to use its North American factories, including those in Mexico.
Barra, who met in November with Vice President Mike Pence along with other U.S. auto executives, said GM has been working to educate the Trump administration about the complexities of the auto industry and its supply base.
""We're going to continue to work constructively to get a modernized NAFTA agreement,"" she said.
Barra said she was optimistic that NAFTA would survive. President Donald Trump has threatened to walk away from the 1994 accord unless major changes are made in negotiations with Mexico and Canada.
Other GM executives defended the company's North American manufacturing strategy, saying 80 percent of the trucks sold in the United States are made in U.S. factories.
GM North America President Alan Batey said GM's Mexican truck plant supports U.S. jobs. 
""The truck we build in Mexico, the engines come from the U.S. Everything is interlinked,"" Batey told reporters after showing off the new Silverado. [nL1N1P80GX]
Asked what GM would do if the United States pulls out of NAFTA, Batey said GM would ""have to worry about that when we get there.""

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2018 07:39PM ET</span>",GM's new Chevy Silverado bids for more U.S. pickup profits,"By Nick Carey and Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Saturday fired a new round in the battle for profits from one of the U.S. auto industry's most lucrative segments when it showed a new generation of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck at Detroit's auto show. 
The new Silverado, a highlight of the show, is the successor to GM's best-selling vehicle in North America. Sales of the current Silverado rose nearly 2 percent to 585,000 vehicles in 2017. 
Analysts and company executives say the Silverado and the similar GMC Sierra are among the highest-profit models for the company, generating a significant share of its $9 billion in North American pretax earnings for the first nine months of 2017.
By adding luxury features to their pickups, automakers have pushed prices in the segment to an average $46,984 a vehicle, according to Cox Automotive. That is well above the industry's average 2017 transaction price of $31,600 cited by GM. 
Competition in the North American large pickup market will heat up as GM and rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV begin selling their redesigned trucks later this year and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co invests in its best-selling F-series.
Speaking on stage flanked by several gleaming new Silverados, GM global product development chief Mark Reuss said the automaker had cut the pickup's weight 450 pounds (204 kilograms) using lighter materials including aluminum doors, hood and tailgate. 
But unlike Ford, which jolted the industry in December 2014 when it launched the current generation F-150 with an all-aluminum body, Reuss said the frame and above all the pickup truck bed - one of the most important parts of pickups used for work functions - were still made of steel.
""I don’t think you’d get much work done with an aluminum hammer,"" Reuss said, in a dig at Ford.
Fiat Chrysler plans to unveil a new generation of its Ram pickup truck at Detroit's auto show on Monday.
At a sneak preview in December, GM said it would offer eight versions of the new Silverado and more engine and transmission combinations than the current lineup.
Executives said the new Silverado would have a high-strength steel bed floor and use ""mixed materials"" to cut weight and improve fuel economy. 
The F-series, which has an aluminum body, has been the best-selling model line in the United States for 41 years, with 2017 sales of nearly 900,000 vehicles.
Ford announced this month it will launch a diesel version of the F-150 that will achieve 30 miles per gallon highway fuel efficiency, a level comparable to some midsize cars as it seeks to gain an edge in this competitive segment.
When describing the fuel economy of the diesel version of the Silverado Saturday evening, Reuss said ""I am confident that we have the best performing diesel in the segment.""
Last year GM sold a total of 947,972 of its four Chevrolet and GMC pickup models, two of which were mid-sized.
U.S. consumers are shifting away from smaller cars in favor of larger SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks, a major boon for the Detroit automakers. 
Light trucks accounted for 63.2 percent of U.S. new vehicle sales in 2017, up from 59.5 percent in 2016. 

However, U.S. new vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2017 after hitting a record high in 2016 and are expected to drop further in 2018 as interest rates rise and more late-model used cars come back to dealer lots to compete with new ones.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Protesters angered by a ""racist"" H&M advertisement ransacked several of the Swedish fashion group's South African stores on Saturday.
The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) protesters targeted six H&M stores in the Gauteng province, where South Africa's economic hub of Johannesburg is located, tearing down shop displays and throwing clothes around, police said.
In one instance, officers fired rubber bullets to disperse the protesters, the police added.
H&M earlier this week issued an apology for the widely criticized ad, which featured a black child modeling a sweatshirt with the slogan ""coolest monkey in the jungle"", and said it had removed it from all its marketing.
But Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, spokesman for the ultra-left EFF, said that was too little, too late.
""The time of apologies for racism are over; there must be consequences to anti-black racism, period!"" Ndlozi wrote on Twitter, posting pictures of a vandalized H&M store and video footage of chanting EFF supporters.
H&M South Africa did not respond to a request for comment, but its local website carried an apology for the advertisement.
""Our position is simple, we have got this wrong and we are deeply sorry,"" the apology read.
Police said they were monitoring the protests, but that they had made no arrests so far.

Protests over perceived corporate wrongdoing have a history of turning violent in South Africa, where some drivers for ride-hailing service Uber have had their vehicles torched over the past year by regular taxi operators.

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2018 01:23PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Current and former Uber security staffers cast doubt on spying claims,"By Joseph Menn and Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The former security chief of Uber Technologies Inc. swore in a closed legal proceeding that he knew of no attempts to steal trade secrets from anyone, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's self-driving unit Waymo, and would be ""shocked"" if that had occurred.
In a deposition taken in mid-December near San Francisco, Joe Sullivan, Uber's security chief from 2015 to 2017, said that the most explosive claims made by another former Uber employee of unethical and illegal behavior by members of his security team were false.
The testimony, described to Reuters by people familiar with it, came in connection with a lawsuit brought by Waymo which accuses arch rival Uber of stealing trade secrets.
Sullivan's testimony has not been made public. He has not spoken in open court or spoken publicly since leaving Uber in November, when he was fired following an investigation.
The previously unreported testimony from the onetime senior Uber official, as well as interviews conducted by Reuters with five current and former Uber employees, rebuts statements made in an explosive 37-page letter last year that triggered the internal probe and drew the attention of federal prosecutors, who are still investigating.
The letter was written by an attorney for Richard Jacobs, a security analyst who worked at Uber from 2016 to 2017 and was about to be fired, Jacobs has acknowledged.
Jacobs' lawyer wrote that Uber's security apparatus was engaged in stealing trade secrets, spying on rival executives and wiretapping, among other questionable behavior.
Uber's internal probe of Jacobs' claims also uncovered something new, which was not mentioned in Jacobs' letter: an undisclosed 2016 data breach and a $100,000 payout to a hacker in Florida. This discovery led to Uber firing Sullivan and legal deputy Craig Clark for failing to have the company disclose the breach to customers and regulators.
Waymo seized on the claims made by Jacobs because they explicitly mentioned that Uber had stolen Waymo trade secrets, and Waymo was already suing Uber in a federal court for theft of trade secrets.
Sullivan in his testimony and the other executives in interviews with Reuters questioned Uber's decision to pay Jacobs a $7.5 million settlement and offer him a consulting contract in connection with his threats to expose Uber's alleged wrongdoing.
An Uber spokesman did not comment on the implication of Sullivan's testimony, but said that Uber had already substantiated some of Jacobs' claims, although nothing related to Waymo. He added that the company is ""changing the way we do business, putting integrity at the core of everything we do."" A spokeswoman for Waymo declined to comment.
Jacobs' attorney in the Waymo case, Martha Boersch, who did not write the 37-page-letter, did not respond to requests for comment. Jacobs did not respond to a request for comment.
Attorneys for Waymo have said in court that over the nearly year-long case they have amassed a file of evidence against Uber and were ready to go to trial before the revelation of the Jacobs letter, which came days before the original trial date. On Friday, Waymo filed a court document that said it had corroborated some of Jacobs' claims about Uber's data-gathering efforts against rivals, but the specifics were redacted.
In interviews with Reuters, three current Uber executives repeated Sullivan's rejection of Jacobs' claims and said they were unaware of any of the lawbreaking allegations by Jacobs. They called false Jacobs' statements that the security unit had misused attorney-client privilege or encouraged the use of ephemeral messaging services in order to cover up improper behavior.
Uber received the letter from Jacobs in May 2017, but it was not publicly disclosed until November, when federal prosecutors shared the letter with the judge overseeing the Uber-Waymo lawsuit. The judge delayed the trial to allow Waymo attorneys to question Sullivan and other Uber employees about the letter.
In his own recent court appearance in the Waymo case, Jacobs stood by his claims that Uber's security team spied on and stole from competitors and tried to cover its tracks. But he admitted he was not aware of Uber stealing anything from Waymo, contradicting part of his letter. He attributed the contradiction to a miscommunication with the attorney who wrote it on his behalf.
Though the new accounts contest most of Jacobs’ claims, his letter played a major and previously undisclosed role in the bitter battle for control over Uber, according to the current and former top executives. 
It landed in May as Kalanick and the board were clashing over his role at the company and directors were hearing the results of other investigations, including one into sex harassment. 
Kalanick resigned under pressure the following month. 
By then, a committee of directors had assumed oversight of the investigation into the Jacobs letter, led by law firm WilmerHale, which eventually uncovered an event that was not in the Jacobs letter: the 2016 data breach, the current and former executives said.
In interviews with Reuters, current and former members of Sullivan's security team provided details of the hack that were previously unreported, and they defended the payout Uber made to the Florida hacker.
In the emails among Uber security staff and a representative for the hacker, Uber treated the breach as a ""bug bounty,” something normally reserved for hackers who discover weaknesses in a system without extracting data. 
Investigations chief Mat Henley established the hacker’s identity and secretly obtained access to electronic records showing that the Uber data had been deleted, giving Sullivan and other members of the security team comfort that it had not reached any criminals, the security staffers said. With no data on the loose and a danger to customers, they felt Uber did not have to disclose the breach to regulators. 
In addition, they said Sullivan was not responsible for Uber's decision about whether to disclose data breaches to regulators since this decision was made by the legal department. 
Uber declined to discuss the details of responsibility for disclosure decisions. But it has made clear that the Florida breach should have been disclosed under various regulations and in fairness to users and drivers.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) said on Saturday it had been ordered to pay 104 million euros in fines over a missile sale to Taiwan in 1992, the latest French arms company to reach a settlement over disputes arising from one of France's biggest ever arms sales. 
The scandal around French arms sales to the island in the early 1990s was one of a series of cases that underpinned accusations of widespread corruption during the final years of late French president Francois Mitterrand.
Airbus said in a statement that its subsidiary behind the missile contract, Matra Defense, was ""reviewing the award before evaluating the next steps to take"".
The arbitration fine comes three months after Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD), radar supplier  Thales  (PA:TCFP) and engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) said they had been fined a combined 227 million euros ($276.80 million) in Taiwan to settle the 25-year-old dispute over the wrongful use of commissions in the sale of 60 Mirage fighters to the island.
""This was a commercial dispute and not a corruption allegation,"" said an Airbus spokesman.
In a separate case, Airbus said it was in talks with Munich prosecutors that could lead to the termination of their investigation into alleged corruption in the sale of Eurofighter combat jets to Austria in 2003.
That investigation is one of several corruption cases still facing Europe's largest aerospace company. 
Airbus did not mention the status of a parallel Austrian investigation into the same arms deal.
The company and individuals including CEO Tom Enders are being investigated in Vienna over industrial deals that were built into the Eurofighter sale and have denied any wrongdoing.
Separately, Airbus faces UK and French investigations into the use of middlemen in commercial airliner sales.

""In every market we have a share of at least 15 to 20 percent,"" CFO Hans Ohlmeyer told the Boersen Zeitung in an interview published on Saturday. 
""Our medium-term goal in the United States is also to reach that level. Currently we are significantly lower,"" he added. Market researchers estimate Adidas' share of the U.S. market at about 10 percent, implying a goal to at least double it.
Adidas has been taking market share in North America and China from its main competitor  Nike  (N:NKE), and hopes the launch of new team kits before this year's soccer World Cup will revive its relatively weak sales in Europe.
Growth in the U.S. market has, however, ""been too fast for our infrastructure"", Ohlmeyer said, adding that Adidas would build out its logistics capacity there this year to clear supply bottlenecks.
Adidas expects to keep its Reebok brand, which has undergone a restructuring and is expected to return to growth in the United States this year, he said, although it is not yet making money.
""The brand is far from the level that we are striving for,"" said Ohlmeyer, who started the job last May.
Adidas will also this year open a new warehouse facility in the German state of Lower Saxony to help scale up its e-commerce business, he said. Online sales rose by around half last year to 1.5 billion euros ($1.83 billion).

Washington is expected to impose fresh penalties against Russia as soon as early February for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential vote. Russia has repeatedly denied this.
Moscow expects the United States to present two anti-Russian reports with the sanctions, Ryabkov told Tass news agency.
One of the reports will likely extend the number of Russian officials and companies on the sanctions list, while the other will analyse whether sanctions so far have proved to be effective, Ryabkov said.
""We see this as yet another attempt to influence our internal situation, especially ahead of the presidential election,"" he said.
Russia will hold its next presidential vote on March 18 when President Vladimir Putin is widely expected to win another six-year stint.
In August, U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law a new package of sanctions drafted by U.S. lawmakers. The new legislation also limits Trump's own ability to lift any sanctions against Russia.
The first U.S. sanctions against Russia were imposed in 2014 for its role in the Ukrainian crisis and for annexing Crimea. The European Union has also imposed penalties against Moscow, prompting it to retaliate with banning food imports from countries that sanction Russia.
The new round of U.S. sanctions could possibly include a ban on the purchase of Russian treasury bonds.

(Reuters) - Wall Street continued its rally on Friday with record closing highs as the fourth-quarter earnings season kicked off with solid results from banks and robust retail sales drove investor optimism about economic growth.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both registered their eight record closing highs out of the first nine trading days of 2018, while the Dow boasted its sixth closing high of the year.
JPMorgan (N:JPM), the biggest U.S. lender by assets, said a U.S. tax overhaul would help future profits by reducing its tax bill and stimulating more business. The bank's shares rose 1.7 percent.
""The fact all the big money center banks beat on the bottom line is a good omen for the rest of the earnings season,"" said William Lynch, director of investments at Hinsdale Associates, in Hinsdale, Illinois.
Investors were also hopeful 2018 financial forecasts from U.S. companies would beat Wall Street estimates as many analysts may not have tax savings fully reflected in their models as the tax bill was signed into law so late in December. 
""I don't know how much of that is priced in right now,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. ""It seems like the economy is going OK, inflation is kind of nonexistent right now, wage growth is not an issue for most income statements, so what's not to like here."" 
Earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to increase on an average by 12.1 percent in the quarter, with profit for financial services companies likely to increase 13.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
BlackRock (N:BLK) rose 3.3 percent. The world's largest asset manager reported profit that beat estimates as investors flooded into the relatively low-cost funds.
While  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) earnings beat expectations, its shares slipped 0.7 percent after it set aside $3.25 billion in the fourth quarter to cover legal expenses related to probes into its mortgage and sales practices.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 228.46 points, or 0.89 percent, to 25,803.19, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 18.68 points, or 0.67 percent, to 2,786.24 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 49.29 points, or 0.68 percent, to 7,261.06.
For the week, the S&P rose 1.6 percent, compared with the Dow's 2-percent rise and a 1.8-percent advance in the Nasdaq. 
The S&P consumer discretionary index (SPLRCD) jumped 1.3 percent after retail sales data showed households bought more goods, suggesting the economy exited 2017 with strong momentum.
Amazon (O:AMZN) rose 2.2 percent to breach $1,300 for the first time. It closed at $1,305.20.
The sector was also helped by a late-afternoon Bloomberg report that activist D.E. Shaw built a position in Lowe's Companies (N:LOW), sending its shares up 5.3 percent.
Bank stocks were helped by a rise in Treasury yields after underlying U.S. consumer prices for December posted the biggest gain in 11 months, signaling a pickup in inflation.
The Treasury move helped push the utilities sector (SPLRCU) down 0.6 percent, making it the weakest performer of the S&P 500's 11 sectors. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.54-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 164 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 222 new highs and 14 new lows.

 Deutsche Bank  is headquartered in Frankfurt, but has large operations in the UK with 8,600 staff based there.
""The 4,000 number that comes up again and again in media reports is much too high,"" John Cryan was quoted as saying in the paper's Saturday edition, adding that initially several hundreds of jobs will be created in Frankfurt, but also in other cities such as Milan and Paris.

Deutsche Bank is planning a new booking center in Frankfurt to handle the billions of euros of non-European business currently routed through London, which may not be allowed after Brexit.
While the bank has never been specific about how many jobs may move from London following Brexit, a senior official earlier this year indicated that up to 4,000 may be affected.
In April, Chief Regulatory Officer Sylvie Matherat had said: ""For front office people, if you want to deal with EU clients you need to be based in the EU, in continental Europe. Does that mean that I have to move all the front office people to Germany or not? ... and we are speaking of 2,000 people."" 

She had added that local supervisors were asking for risk management to be done locally, a demand that would require more jobs to be moved. ""It means another 2,000 people,"" she had said at the time.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) Chief Executive Jack Dorsey will not seek re-election to Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) board because of growing conflicts of interest between the media giant and the technology companies, Disney said on Friday.
Disney is moving heavily into online delivery of its TV shows and movies as viewers abandon traditional cable, and at one point had explored an acquisition of Twitter. At the same time, Twitter and Facebook are trying to attract audiences to video content on their platforms.
""Given our evolving business and the businesses Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey are in, it has become increasingly difficult for them to avoid conflicts relating to board matters, and they are not standing for re-election,"" Disney said in a statement.
Lead independent director Orin Smith, former CEO of  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX), also will leave Disney's board, due to rules that specify retirement at age 74, the company said. Former Seagram Company vice chairman Robert Matschullat will depart because of a 15-year term limit.
The departures take effect in March at the time of Disney's annual meeting, when shareholders will be asked to re-elect 10 other board members. They include General Motors (N:GM) CEO Mary Barra,  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) CEO Mark Parker and Oracle (N:ORCL) CEO Safra Catz, whose election in December to the board takes effect on Feb. 1.
The board will select a new lead independent director when it meets after the annual meeting, Disney said.
Representatives for Facebook and Twitter had no comment.

Disney also disclosed on Friday that compensation for its chief executive, Robert Iger, declined by 17 percent in fiscal 2017 to $36.3 million. Iger was awarded a smaller cash bonus due to the ""absence of growth"" in the year that ended Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing.

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",Whoops! Last-minute change to U.S. tax overhaul splits grains sector,"By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Republican U.S. senators are working with some of the world's biggest agricultural merchants to undo a last-minute provision in the tax overhaul that threatens to distort the grains market and starve private firms of corn, soy and wheat supplies.
It was included during final revisions of the tax bill that passed the Republican-controlled Congress last month. The restructuring of the tax code, the biggest in 30 years, handed President Donald Trump his first major legislative victory since taking office.
The provision gives farmers a 20 percent deduction on payments for sales of crops to farmer-owned cooperatives, but not for sales to private or investor-owned grains handlers such as global firm Archer Daniels Midland Co.
The modification was introduced to compensate co-ops and their farmer owners when Congress eliminated a part of the tax code, known as Section 199, which had benefited them for more than a decade.
Republican Senators John Hoeven of North Dakota and John Thune of South Dakota are among the lawmakers whose offices said their attempt to create an equivalent to the old tax code had backfired by incentivizing sales to co-ops at the expense of others in the market.
""Sen. Thune is now aware of the unintended situation this new provision could create in the agriculture industry,"" his spokesman Ryan Wrasse said in a statement. He added that Thune believes tax laws should not sway where farmers sell their harvests.
The government wants to correct the disparity, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Friday it expects a solution to be forthcoming.
""The federal tax code should not pick winners and losers in the marketplace,"" Greg Ibach, an undersecretary at the USDA, said in a separate statement.
ADM and Cargill Inc (CARG.UL), two of the world's top agricultural traders, joined talks with Hoeven, Senate aides, and trade associations that represent co-ops and private firms to come up with a way to even the playing field. Representatives of grain companies and lawmakers met in Washington twice this week in a sign of the urgency of the matter.
If legislators do not address the provision by the autumn harvest, private grain companies could lose out on deals to buy billions of bushels of corn and soybeans. Farmers already are looking at how they can transfer grain stored at private elevators to co-ops to take advantage of the new law.
""It's a massive issue for people like us, ADM, Cargill, all the private ethanol buyers and on and on and on,"" said Dale Beyer, chief financial officer for Minn-Kota Ag Products, a private grain handler in Minnesota.
Thune and Hoeven began hearing in early January that the provision would influence where farmers sell their products, according to the National Grain and Feed Association, a trade group that has met repeatedly with the lawmakers' aides this month to discuss the issue.
The association told members in an email that it learned of the provision in late December, after it was included in the final version of the tax law, and immediately asked tax experts for advice. The group then met with Thune and Hoeven staffers to learn why the senators included it in the law.
The association, in a separate statement with the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, said it was working with Hoeven, Thune and Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, also a Republican, to reach ""an equitable solution"" that preserves benefits formerly available to co-ops under Section 199.
""It’s disappointing to learn a provision in the tax reform bill is distorting the grain markets,"" Roberts said in a statement. ""The authors of the measure did not intend that outcome.""
TENSIONS RISE
The grain sector is struggling with low crop prices following years of big harvests and is paying close attention to the tax law after support from rural communities helped propel Trump into office in 2016. 
On Monday, the president said farmers would score big from the overhaul.
""It’s a total of $5.5 trillion in tax cuts, with most of those benefits going to working families, small businesses, and who? The family farmer,"" Trump said in a speech to the American Farm Bureau’s annual convention in Tennessee.
Farmers generally decide to whom they want to sell their grain based on the prices offered by different handlers, how close they live to delivery sites and personal affiliations.
However, the wording of the new provision wrongly assumes that all farmers deliver their grain to co-ops, said Bob Zelenka, executive director of the Minnesota Grain and Feed Association, a trade group that represents co-ops and private companies.
""It tells me that someone who wrote this is unused to how things work in the ag industry,"" he said. 
Efforts to adjust the provision have some co-ops pushing back out of concerns farmers could lose tax benefits.
Chris  Pearson  (LON:PSON), chief executive of the South Dakota Wheat Growers co-op, said on Twitter on Wednesday that the law ""gives farmers some nice tax advantages when doing business with the ORGANIZATION THEY OWN!"" 
Pearson did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment.

""I would hate to see private companies raise our farmers' taxes!"" he tweeted on his account @CEOWheatGrowers.

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said on Friday it will offer automatic emergency braking on more than half its U.S. models in 2019, and that it is on track to equip all U.S. models with the device by 2022.
Automatic emergency brakes (AEB) are designed to help vehicles avoid collisions. In an interview, Raj Nair, president of Ford's North American operations, said the company's rollout of AEB has been relatively slow due to lack of consumer demand.
For 2018, Ford is offering AEB on about 15 percent of its U.S. models, including the best-selling F-Series pickup and the sporty Mustang. It will make AEB standard later this year on four 2019 models: the all-new Ford Ranger midsize pickup and the redesigned Ford Edge, Lincoln MKC and Lincoln Nautilus crossovers. The 2018 rate compares with less than 10 percent last year.
In an update last month, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said four of 20 automakers in 2017 equipped at least half of their U.S. models with standard AEB. The 20 automakers have agreed to install the devices on all their models by 2022.

Among mass-market companies, Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) fitted the devices to 56 percent of its 2017 fleet, NHTSA said. The automaker on Thursday said that rate grew to more than 90 percent for 2018.

The Italian-American automaker said one accident had potentially been linked to the defect. Under a rare set of conditions, a vehicle’s engine control module may incorrectly assess the engine’s operating status and cause it to stall, Fiat Chrysler said.
Dealers will update the engine control software, the company said, adding that most incidents associated with the glitch took place at low speeds or when the vehicles were starting up.
The Center for Auto Safety, a consumer advocacy group, petitioned the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in November to investigate the issue after it said at least 50 owners had reported stalling in new Pacifica minivans. The agency asked Fiat Chrysler to answer questions about the stalling last month.
Fiat Chrysler said it had begun investigating the issue before the petition was filed.
The recall includes nearly 154,000 vehicles in the United States and more than 8,000 others around the world, but the company did not immediately say when the new software would be available.

Hybrid gas-electric versions of the minivans are not included in the recall.

(Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) has agreed to a settlement worth up to $232 million (C$290.5) with owners of vehicles in Canada affected by its diesel emissions-cheating scandal, the automaker said on Friday.
The agreement provides for cash payments to owners of about 20,000 3.0-liter Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche diesel vehicles in Canada and is subject to court approval. The German automaker also agreed to pay a $2.5 million Canadian dollar civil penalty.
""This is an important milestone towards making things right for all of our customers with affected diesel vehicles in Canada,"" Daniel Weissland, president and chief executive officer of Volkswagen Group Canada, said in a statement.
Last year, in a similar settlement in the United States, VW agreed to spend at least $1.22 billion to fix or buy back nearly 80,000 vehicles with 3.0-liter engines. It also agreed to pay owners of vehicles who obtained fixes for excess emissions between $8,500 and $17,000.
In total, the German automaker has now agreed to spend more than $25 billion in North American to address claims from owners, environmental regulators, U.S. states and dealers and to make buyback offers. The company said in September it had set aside $30 billion to address the scandal.
In June 2016, Volkswagen agreed to spend up to $10 billion to buy back or fix 475,000 2.0-liter U.S. vehicles. Also in 2016, Volkswagen agreed to spend up to $2.1 billion Canadian dollars to buy back or fix 105,000 polluting 2.0-liter diesels and compensate owners in Canada.
Last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board approved an emissions fix for 24,000 Audi 3.0-liter passenger cars. The approved fix entails removing defeat device software that reduced emission control effectiveness and replacing certain hardware components.
Previously, U.S. regulators approved a fix for 38,000 other 3.0-liter diesels.

VW, Europe’s biggest automaker, admitted in September 2015 that it had used illegal software to cheat U.S. diesel emissions tests, sparking the biggest business crisis in its 80-year history.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Global drugmakers are looking to a tiny biotech's $850,000 therapy for a rare type of blindness as a model for getting paid for highly expensive – and effective – new medicines.
 Spark Therapeutics Inc  (O:ONCE) plans to launch its recently approved Luxturna treatment for an inherited genetic mutation that causes blindness in March. The drug is to be administered only once, by injection, and Spark plans to charge $425,000 per eye, an unprecedented price.
But what is grabbing the attention of other drugmakers is not just what might be called an eye-popping price to treat a condition that Spark estimates affects 1,000 to 2,000 people in the United States, but the ways Spark is looking to help payers ranging from the federal government to private insurers absorb the drug's high cost, including spreading out payments over several years.
""We're laying the groundwork for the future of our pipeline and the future of one-time curative gene therapy treatments,"" Spark's chief executive officer, Jeffrey Marrazzo, said in an interview at the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Healthcare Conference in San Francisco this week. 
The high cost of prescription drugs has become an increasingly critical and contentious issue.
The independent Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) issued a report on Friday saying the proposed Luxturna price was far too high in most cases.
Healthcare spending accounts for 18 percent of the U.S. economy and has been rising faster than the rate of inflation as drugs and medical services costs increase. An influx of very expensive drugs that offer a one-time cure – such as a hepatitis C treatment from  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD) – has already stretched state and federal budgets. 
The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which provides coverage for 125 million elderly, poor and disabled Americans, spends hundreds of billions of dollars annually on medicines.
CMS is trying to tackle the overall high drug costs. It has asked for input from private health insurers and drugmakers on payment models that are expected to influence how medical breakthroughs for millions more patients are covered. 
Spark itself is working with CMS on a legal structure to allow government and private-sector health plans to pay for Luxturna, which restores some vision for most patients with the inherited mutation, over several years, rather than in a single payment, without hurting its profits. 
Spark has also offered refunds if the treatment stops working and ways for payers to buy the drug outside of hospitals, which can significantly mark up the price of a medicine administered in their facilities.
In interviews with Reuters, executives from large drugmakers including Eli Lilly & Co (N:LLY), GlaxoSmithKline Plc (L:GSK), Roche Holding AG (S:ROG), Merck & Co Inc (N:MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY) said they would pay close attention to the outcome of Spark's payment discussions.
They are also following two revolutionary gene-based therapies for blood cancers from  Novartis  AG (S:NOVN) and Gilead Sciences. Novartis' Kymriah, with a list price of $475,000, is covered by CMS based on outcomes achieved for pediatric and young adult leukemia patients by the end of the first month of treatment.
Spark is also looking at guaranteeing its product. It is working on a plan with pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co (O:ESRX) on a long-term payment schedule for privately insured patients. 
Spark plans to sell Luxturna through specialty pharmacies, including one owned by Express Scripts, so that large employers and health plans can avoid hospital markups that could reach hundreds of thousands of dollars. Express Scripts is working with Spark on provisions to refund money to insurers if the drug does not work as promised.
""Spark is willing to guarantee its product over a period of time and potentially extend that payment over a period of time; it needs someone to be a chassis,"" Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said.
POTENTIAL ROADBLOCKS
Large drugmakers already offer refunds on some drugs, including treatments for diabetes or high cholesterol, if they do not provide a benefit.
But it is tougher to create a long-term payment model for a very expensive drug administered only once. The U.S. system is built to cover the whole cost immediately, and CMS needs to determine how smaller payments could be made without triggering bigger-than-intended discounts. 
CMS does not negotiate prices or purchase drugs, but it sets ground rules for the managed care companies and state Medicaid agencies that do. CMS chief Seema Verma told Reuters last year that she was looking at new payment models for high-priced breakthrough treatments. 
Another road block under discussion: Patients often change insurance, or move between private and government-sponsored health coverage depending on their age or employment status. Under a deferred payment plan, the government could be billed for patients who they no longer cover. 
""The innovation is there, but the financing vehicles need to catch up,"" said Jack Bailey, GlaxoSmithKline's U.S. pharmaceuticals head.  
Paul Biondi, head of business development at Bristol-Myers, said the drugmaker is closely following the payment outcome for gene therapies. ""I'm glad other people are plowing the ground,"" he said.
The next U.S.-approved gene therapy may come from Bluebird Bio (O:BLUE). The small biotech company expects to submit this year a potentially one-time treatment for the inherited blood disorder beta thalassemia, which can cause severe anemia. Bluebird also aims to seek approval for a gene-based cancer therapy in 2019.
""We've been thinking about pricing for years,"" Jeffrey Walsh, Bluebird's chief financial and strategy officer, said. ""Now we can bring in the regulators.""
The company is talking to the U.S. government, as well as governments in the UK, France, Germany and Italy, about pricing over a period of time and how to prove a drug is working. 

""The system in the U.S. isn't built for a single intervention,"" Walsh said.

1066,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 05:13PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com - A look at the top five things that rocked markets this past week.
Up, Up, and Away as Wall Street Extends Rally 
US stocks made their best start to a year since 2003 this past week, and showed no signs of weakness as banks got earnings season underway in earnest.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) reported quarterly earnings that topped analysts' estimates.
Meanwhile, inflation got back on track, as data showed core consumer prices rose at their fastest since January. Wells Fargo said the upbeat CPI data should help to allay some FOMC members' fears that “inflation is stuck at undesirably low levels.”
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) were at extreme ends of trading action this week as the former came under heavy selling pressure while the latter hit all-time highs.
Boeing’s jump higher followed a report this week in which the company revealed aircraft deliveries rose to an all-time high last year, while Facebook slumped after it announced Thursday that it will be changing its news feed algorithm to focus more on content from friends and family rather than from the public.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at record highs on Friday.
WTI Crude Notched Fourth-Straight Weekly Win
WTI Crude oil prices settled at three-year highs on Friday amid ongoing optimism that OPEC-led output cuts would continue to drain the market of excess supplies, while a surprise fall in US production fulled the rally.
Data earlier this week showed US crude oil production dropped by 290,000, the most since October, as the “bomb cyclone” winter storm continues to disrupt output, while US crude supplies fell for the eighth-straight week.
Sterling, Euro Rallied
Sterling shrugged off recent sluggishness with an explosive move higher on Friday, rising 1.44% above $1.37 for the first time since June 2016 as traders cheered a report suggesting Spain and the Netherlands are prepared to back a soft Brexit deal.
Spain and the Netherlands are potentially open to a soft Brexit deal for the UK in order to maintain trade ties, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the mater.
The euro rallied against the greenback as political tensions eased in Germany after Chancellor Angela Merkel struck a deal with the Social Democrat Party (SPD) on Friday paving the way for government coalition talks.
That added to earlier gains in the single currency after the minutes of the ECB December meeting showed policymakers could consider a gradual shift in guidance from early 2018, raising the prospect of tighter monetary policy measures.
Gold Rides Low Dollar Wave to Glory 
Gold prices rose to four-month highs buoyed by a weak dollar despite upbeat inflation data suggesting that the trend of subdued consumer prices growth may be nearing an end, strengthening the Federal Reserve’s case to hike rates.
Gold prices, however, could come under pressure in the weeks ahead amid investor expectations that central banks are set to rein in loose monetary policy measures.
The Bank of Canada could raise rates as soon as next week, Action Economics said, as the recent swathe of positive labor market data may force the central bank’s hand on monetary policy tightening.
Ethereum Rallied as Bitcoin Bears Gained Control 
Ethereum’s ether, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, rose more than 30% over the past seven days hitting an all-time high of $1,382 as it nears its ‘Casper’ software update which aims to improve security and scalability on the network.
Ripple's XRP, meanwhile, slumped more than 30% over the past seven days despite growing signs that RippleNet, the technology behind the cryptocurrency, continues to garner support from major financial institutional. Moneygram announced Thursday it will partner with Ripple to test the startup's XRP token for international payments.
Bitcoin struggled to keep the bears at bay, falling nearly 20% over the past seven days as traders continued to ditch the popular digital currency for its rivals. Some suggested the fall in bitcoin was linked to China’s purge of its bitcoin mining industry. Others said, however, this would have a limited impact on miners as they would likely move operations abroad beyond Beijing’s regulatory purview."
1067,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>",U.S. 'socially screened' funds draw second-biggest inflows ever,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investors poured $4.7 billion into so-called socially responsible mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in 2017, the category's second-biggest annual inflow ever, with managers pointing to Trump administration policies as a reason for the move. 
The industry remains relatively small, with an estimated $2.6 trillion in funds that screen investments based on companies' social and environmental impact, compared with $16.3 trillion in all funds, according to the Investment Company Institute trade group.
Fund managers and advisors said interest in socially conscious investing was boosted by President Donald Trump in June announcing his intention to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord, arguing it would undermine the U.S. economy.
""Trump saying he would withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Accord was the biggest single driver and served as a call to arms for pension funds and other investors to step up,"" said William Vaughn, a research analyst at Philadelphia-based Brandywine Global, which manages approximately $74 billion in assets. 
Inflows into socially screened funds typically do not track those of the broader market, due in part to a smaller investor base that tends to keep their money invested regardless of year-by-year performance. 
Indeed, inflows into such funds and ETFs grew by 22 percent in 2017, compared with a 232 percent increase into mutual funds and ETFs overall. 
But the 2017 inflows into socially screened funds marked a 340 percent jump from 2013, when investors directed just $1 billion into the category, according to Lipper data. By comparison, inflows into all funds grew 154 percent from 2013. 
Joe Sinha, the head of sales and marketing at San Francisco-based Parnassus Investments, said inflows were roughly split between retail investors and institutions such as university endowment funds and religious organizations over the last year.
The previous record amount of inflows into socially responsible funds came in 2001, when investors directed $11.6 billion into the category. That coincided with the launch of 13 funds by Dallas-based GuideStone Funds, which brought in $10.2 billion in assets, according to Lipper data. 
The $5.5 billion Parnassus Endeavor fund had the largest inflows among socially screened funds in 2017, bringing in some $1.6 billion in cash, followed by the $2.8 billion Parnassus Mid-Cap fund, which received net positive inflows of approximately $689 million, according to Morningstar data. 
The Parnassus Endeavor fund, which has its largest positions in Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc,  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD), and  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT), has gained an average of 16.1 percent over each of the last three years, putting it in the top 1 percent of 1,197 other large-blend funds in its Morningstar category. 
The inflows will likely prompt the launch of similar funds, which have been a bright spot for active managers that have been losing ground to cheaper, passive index funds and exchange-traded funds.
And while a host of ETFs have emerged that track indexes screening by similar criteria, some active managers hope that their funds will retain an edge by offering products such as Christian or Islamic-screened products that may not translate well to an ETF format. 
Joe Keefe, chief executive of Pax World Investments, based in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, said that there is a strong possibility of the firm launching new funds in 2018. 
Investors in socially responsible funds may be less sensitive to underperformance because they are also taking the social attributes into consideration, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at New York-based CFRA Research. 
""These investors chose the fund more for its investment approach than its track record,"" he said.

1068,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 05:05PM ET</span>",New Vanguard CEO Buckley says indexing fosters competition,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Vanguard Group Inc's vast scale helps it promote efficient markets, its new chief executive said on Friday, pushing back on concerns the growth of passive index funds could reduce the pressure on corporate executives to perform.
""We want everyone competing. We don't want one industry winning out over another industry,"" said Tim Buckley, who took over as CEO of the world's biggest mutual fund manager on Jan. 1.
""We need the ultimate in capitalism, that's what we need. That's what makes indexing tick,"" Buckley said in a telephone interview, one of his first as head of the Malvern, Pennsylvania firm where he previously was chief investment officer.
When his watch as CIO began at the start of 2013 Vanguard's total assets stood at $2.2 trillion. At Dec. 31 it had nearly $5 trillion, a scale that has helped it cut fees.
But the increased assets have also raised fears Vanguard is altering some of the basic dynamics of investing, because the firm and other passive fund managers cannot sell stocks to punish corporate managers. Their ultimate impact is a major uncertainty for the investment industry, said Morningstar analyst Kevin McDevitt.
""It's an open question how will this all work out,"" he said 
Market structure is just one issue for Buckley, 48, who takes over a workforce of 16,600. He joined Vanguard in 1991 and earned degrees at Harvard University where his rowing coach assigned hard workouts of uncertain duration. ""You never knew when the pain was going to end,"" he said.
Buckley said the experience taught him to stay focused during choppy events - including market volatility. ""You just have got to keep bearing down and keep going,"" he said. 
He also wants to harness technology through products such as Vanguard Personal Advisor Services, a combination of automated investment tools and direct human input.
At a typical cost of 30 basis points, it is cheap enough to attract Vanguard customers who previously used a do-it-yourself approach, Buckley said.
Buckley also said the company will look to grow in foreign markets like China, where it has about two dozen employees including at a new office in Shanghai. Unlike other western companies in China it controls all its own business, giving it time to decide matters like when it might introduce a retail product.

China is a ""a very long opportunity for us,"" he said.

1071,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 04:26PM ET</span>","Facebook changes News Feed, investors click on 'sad'","By Noel Randewich and David Ingram
(Reuters) - Shares of  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) fell more than 4 percent on Friday and were on track for their worst session in more than three months after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg announced changes that he said would hit user engagement in the near term.
Zuckerberg said late on Thursday the world's largest social network would adjust its centerpiece News Feed to prioritize what friends and family share, while reducing the amount of non-advertising content from publishers and brands.
A warning by Zuckerberg that people could spend less time on Facebook in the short term as a result of the changes sent the company's stock $8.29 lower to $179.47. 
If the stock closes at that level, it would be the biggest one-day decline since September and would shrink the company's market value by $23 billion, which is more than the total market value of rival  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP), the owner of Snapchat.
""There is too much uncertainty relating to the economic impact of Facebook's pending News Feed changes for us to be comfortable retaining a Buy rating on the stock,"" wrote Stifel analyst Scott Devitt in a research note, cutting his recommendation to ""hold"" from ""buy."" 
The change announced by Zuckerberg follows criticism that Facebook's algorithms may have prioritized misleading news and misinformation in people's feeds, influencing the 2016 American presidential election as well as political discourse in other countries.
Facebook said its new ranking system would hurt non-advertising content from publishers and brands, like news stories and viral video posts, but not change the ranking of advertising that has been paid for. 
That will leave businesses that want publicity on Facebook no choice but to spend more on advertising, and as a result prices will climb, predicted Eric Schiffer, chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, which advises corporate brands on social media. 
""They're definitely going to be required to buy an ad,"" Schiffer said. 
TECH RALLY
With its stock up 48 percent over the past 12 months, Facebook has been a major driver of a technology rally that has propelled the S&P 500 to record highs. Its revenue is expected by analysts on average to have surged 45 percent in 2017, a rare accomplishment for a company of its size.
Some hedge funds used Friday's drop in Facebook's stock to bolster their positions, said Joel Kulina, a senior trader at Wedbush.
""Guys were hoping there would be more of a pullback so they could buy more,"" Kulina said. ""They don't think there are any real cracks in the Facebook story."" 
Changes to Facebook's News Feed may have an impact on major suppliers of news and other content.
John Ridding, the chief executive of the Financial Times, warned on Friday that the domination of online advertising revenue by search and social media platforms was putting pressure on media firms.

""The FT welcomes moves to recognize and support trusted and reliable news and analysis. But a sustainable solution to the challenges of the new information ecosystem requires further measures,"" he said.

1078,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>","Fields of Gold? Jana seeks new money, allies with impact hedge fund","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Wall Street investor Barry Rosenstein's new impact investing fund aimed at serving environmental and social causes could, if he plays his cards right, enhance his traditional business of pushing companies to boost earnings.
The founder of JANA Partners has tapped British musician and activist Sting to sit on the new fund's advisory board and burnish his credentials with green and socially conscious investors he hopes will pledge at least $1 billion.
That amount is a fraction of the billions that have been pulled from Jana since 2015. Its assets have shrunk by more than half to $5 billion since then, as hedge fund investors fled to cheaper, passive products. Still, it gives him an important foothold in the growing arena of ""responsible investing"".
Industry watchers said Rosenstein could forge more alliances with institutional investors that could carry over to Jana's main business: pushing companies to make financial changes that often include recapitalizing or restructuring the business.
""There is a longer game here than just this one fund,"" said a hedge fund industry advisor who is not permitted to speak publicly about individual hedge fund firms. ""The new fund will create a bridge with other institutional investors which Jana may need in its future activism.""
People familiar with the fundraising say commitments have already been made and interest is high. The fund will not be a typical hedge fund product, people familiar with the matter say, noting the fees are expected to be lower.
Jana made its first foray into socially minded investments this month, pressuring Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to give parents more control over the setup options of their children's iPhones. The fund partnered with CalSTRS, the largest U.S. public sector teachers' pension fund and one that is increasingly emphasizing social responsibility in its bets.
Calstrs does not invest with Jana but with $222 billion in assets under management, more than half of it in stocks, it could be a powerful ally in future activist fights. Apple reacted quickly, promising new parental controls, and the hedge fund industry is chalking this up as a victory for Jana.
Calstrs spokeswoman Michelle Mussuto declined to comment on its work with Jana. 
Rosenstein cut his activist teeth during the 1980s heyday for corporate raiders, a background that has made traditional environmental, social and governance (ESG) activists doubt the sincerity of his pivot to socially conscious investing.
Last year, John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods, called Jana ""greedy bastards"" as the hedge fund pushed for a sale of the grocery chain.
Charles Penner, a partner at Jana, defended the new direction. 
""It is not inconsistent with what we have done historically, it is just different,"" he said.
The Jana Impact Capital Fund is set to launch later this year. Joining Sting as an advisor is Patricia Daly, a nun who battled  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) over environmental disclosures. Sustainability expert Robert Eccles, who has taught at Harvard Business School, will also be on board. None of the three were available to comment.
WALL STREET CHOPS
Until recently, activism in the responsible investing space was largely the preserve of religious funds and public pension leaders with a genteel approach to boardroom battles and the patience to wait years for progress.
But now more major investors, including sovereign wealth funds and pensions, are pushing companies on issues like climate change, income and gender equality. By bringing some hard-charging Wall Street chops into this arena, Jana could stand out and, if successful, curry favor with such investors.
    In its 17-year history, Jana has waged roughly 75 activist campaigns at companies ranging from Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) to Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF)., delivering an annualized average return of 11 percent in its flagship fund.
Its JSI fund, which concentrates purely on activist situations, has returned an annualized 18 percent since its 2010 launch after gaining 22 percent in 2017, matching the S&P 500's 22 percent gain.
The flagship Jana Partners fund, meanwhile, gained 5.6 percent last year, underperforming the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index. 
At a time when flows to hedge funds have been thin, the socially responsible space is appealing. Net deposits into socially responsible mutual funds were $4.7 billion in 2017, a 22 percent jump from the year before and a large leap from 2013, when investors directed just $1 billion into the category.
One reason is returns. A Vanguard fund based on the popular FTSE4Good US Select Index of ESG stocks for instance beat the S&P 500 in three of the last five years, including in 2017, according to Morningstar.
Hedge funds are still smarting from $70 billion in redemptions in 2016, Hedge Fund Research data show. The sector, including activist funds, did see an uptick of investor inflows in 2017, with $2.9 billion added in the first three quarters. 
""A BIT OF A STRETCH""
Jana’s past record of shareholder activism means it is carrying some baggage as its climbs onto the responsible investing bandwagon, some people say. Some investors think the firm has a way to go to prove its commitment to social and environmental concerns.
    The new fund is ""a bit of stretch, no question"" said Seamus Finn, chairman of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, whose members include religious groups, foundations and other organizations.
    Some of Finn's members have described Jana as disinterested at best in their efforts to get companies to heed environmental or social concerns.
Jana’s Penner said the firm would not have been able to take up such causes in the past because it was not part of its investment profile.
“We didn’t have a mandate to do that,” he said.       
    Boston Common Asset Management, which has a long-running partnership with energy producer  Apache Corp  (NYSE:APA) aimed at improving sustainability and protecting the rights of indigenous peoples, said it did not hear from Jana when it took a stake in Apache in 2014. [http://reut.rs/2AKl8AH]
But Geeta Aiyer, Boston Common's president, is willing to give Jana the benefit of the doubt.

    ""If they move from the business of shortening already-short time horizons to taking a longer-term view, it could put to bed this whole debate about whether being a responsible investor is somehow bad for returns,"" Aiyer said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher at 25,802.02. The S&P 500 closed 0.67% higher, while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 7261.06, up 0.68%.
Financials had a strong end to the week after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) reported quarterly earnings that topped analysts' estimates.
Also supporting sentiment on banks were signs that inflation is gathering steam after data showed core consumer prices rose their fastest since January.
The Labor Department said on Friday its core Consumer Price index rose 0.3% in December, edging up 0.2% in November. The uptick in consumer prices in year-on-year through December rose to 2.1%.
Wells Fargo said the upbeat CPI data should help to allay some FOMC members' fears that “inflation is stuck at undesirably low levels.” Subdued inflation has been one of the key factors weighing on the pace of rate hikes.
Higher interest rates are seen as a boon for banks, boosting their net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.
In corporate news,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) closed more than 5% lower after the social media company announced Thursday that it will be changing its news feed algorithm to focus more on content from friends and family rather than from the public.

1080,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 03:59PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court takes up challenge to SEC in-house judges,"By Andrew Chung
(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a challenge to a key Securities and Exchange Commission practice -- its use of in-house judges to enforce investor protection laws -- by a former California-based radio host and investment adviser who is backed by the Trump administration.
The justices took up an appeal by Raymond Lucia, who was found liable for fraud by an SEC administrative law judge and hit with a lifetime ban from investment-related work. The case took a twist in November when President Donald Trump's Justice Department reversed course and sided with Lucia, known for his ""Buckets of Money"" investment strategy.
Lucia and the administration argue that the SEC violates the U.S. Constitution in the way it hires its administrative law judges. SEC critics have said the use of these in-house judges gives the agency an unfair home-court advantage in enforcement disputes.
The case is being closely watched by the business community and corporate rights advocates well beyond Wall Street. They have said that as the SEC's enforcement powers have expanded, the agency has sent more cases to its own judges rather than federal district courts.
This allows the SEC to win more frequently, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce told the high court in a brief supporting Lucia's case, adding, ""That materially and adversely affects the rights and interests of businesses.""
At issue in the case is whether the administrative law judges are merely SEC employees or ""inferior officers"" who wield significant decision-making authority and should be covered by the Constitution's ""appointments clause."" 
Inferior officers under the Constitution must be appointed by the president, the head of a federal agency or by a court.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2016 rejected Lucia's challenge, saying the SEC judges are employees rather than officers because their decisions are not final and still subject to SEC review. 
But the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last May had ruled in a similar case that the SEC violated the Constitution in how its in-house judges were appointed.
The Trump administration in November stopped defending the SEC's position, telling the justices in a brief that the agency's judges are officers subject to the appointments clause. It said it urged the court to hear the case because other agencies also employ judges in a manner similar to the SEC.
That prompted the SEC on Nov. 30 to say that it had ratified the prior appointment of its administrative law judges, which it said resolves any constitutional concerns over cases they preside over. [nL1N1O015E]
The SEC charged Lucia with securities fraud in 2012. SEC Administrative Law Judge Cameron Elliot found him liable, barring him from the industry and ordered him to pay $300,000 in fines. 
In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Lucia told the justices he is unemployable in his lifelong profession and on the verge of bankruptcy because the SEC judge imposed ""the securities industry equivalent of capital punishment.""

The court is likely to decide the case by the end of June, when its current term ends.

1081,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: EU Parliament expected to soften euro clearing relocation powers,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Parliament is aiming to soften plans to give European Union regulators the power to force London's main clearing house to relocate if it wants to continue doing business in the single market after Brexit, an EU lawmaker said.
Euro clearing is one of the main battlegrounds between London and Brussels in divorce talks that will shape how Europe's financial market is divided up when Britain leaves the European Union.
The European Commission proposed in June to give broad powers to itself, the European Central Bank and the European Securities and Markets Authority allowing them to force foreign clearing houses deemed ""substantially systemically important"" to move into the bloc, or face exclusion from the EU market.
""We don't want to give those bodies this right to use total discretion in deciding what is cleared where,"" Danuta Hubner, chair of the powerful constitutional affairs committee of the EU legislature, told Reuters.
Hubner, who is the leading EU lawmaker on clearing, said her report on the Commission's plan, due to be finalised by the end of January, will include stricter conditions for regulators to determine whether clearing should be moved.
She said she was confident parliament would back her amendments, although other prominent lawmakers have previously called for a sweeping relocation of euro business from London to the EU after Brexit.
Any new rules would also need approval from EU member states, which are competing to attract business from London, Europe's biggest financial center, after Brexit.
If confirmed by parliament, Hubner's unexpected move is likely to be welcomed by the financial industry, which has warned that forced relocation could split markets, increase trading costs and diminish the status of the euro - besides threatening thousands of jobs in the City of London.
At the moment, most derivatives denominated in euros are cleared in London through LCH, a subsidiary of the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) which reported record volumes last year across multiple clearing services.
Its interest rate derivatives clearing service, SwapClear, which dominates clearing of euro-denominated swaps or derivatives, processed trades with a notional value of more than $873 trillion in 2017.
LCH is the only clearing house operating in the EU that, once turned into a foreign company by Brexit, could be deemed substantially systemically important by EU regulators, Hubner said. Its German rival Eurex is a comparable size, but the new rules would not apply to it because it is in the EU. 
""We take additional criteria, and among them is the costs for the economy,"" said Hubner, who is a former EU commissioner.
She said relocation decisions should also consider whether a service provided by a foreign clearing house could be replaced by companies within the EU. If not, the relocation could be put on hold, said Hubner.
NO SPECIAL TREATMENT
Clearing houses, also known as central counterparties, sit between two sides of a financial trade to ensure it is smooth and completed safely. 
The importance of clearing houses to the financial system has increased since the global financial crisis because regulators around the world have pushed for more derivatives to be cleared by third parties in a bid to reduce risks. 
LCH is currently one of 17 clearing houses authorized in the European Union. Another 28 foreign central counterparties in countries such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland and United States, are also allowed to operate in the EU.
Under the law proposed by the Commission, non-EU counterparties operating in the single market under a so-called equivalence regime and deemed ""systemic"" would be subject to stricter supervision.
The EU allows non-members to operate in the bloc if Brussels deems that the other country's legal and regulatory regime is at least as good, or equivalent, as its own.
Those counterparties classified as ""substantially systemically important"", however, could face relocation so they can be overseen more closely by the bloc's supervisors.
Hubner, a Polish lawmaker and member of the main center-right political group in the EU parliament, said the decisions needed to be more evidence-based and the powers of EU regulators should be less discretionary than envisaged so far.
The Commission said in its June proposal that it would clarify criteria to assess the systemic importance of clearing houses in further regulations, expected six months after the draft law is adopted by the European Parliament.
The Commission's proposals need the backing of the Parliament and a qualified majority of EU states to become law.
Although her draft report on clearing could be seen as a boost for Britain, Hubner stressed that the country's financial sector was unlikely to be given special treatment in any new trade deal with the European Union.
She said the best option for Britain's financial interests would be to maintain full access to the EU market with an agreement similar to those the bloc has with Norway and Iceland.
Such a deal would imply that Britain would have to make contributions to the EU budget and accept the jurisdiction of the EU Court of Justice - options the British government has ruled out so far.

Hubner also said the EU parliament wants agreements on several issues such as data protection and customs, as well as clearer rights for EU citizens in Britain, before it could approve any Brexit trade deal.

1082,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 03:44PM ET</span>","U.S. holiday spending surges to 12-year high, helped by tax cuts","By Richa Naidu
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. holiday spending jumped 5.5 percent - its biggest gain since 2005 - spurred by stronger employment, rising consumer confidence and expectations of higher wages and bonuses after the recent tax bill, the National Retail Federation said on Friday. 
Sales in November and December rose to $691.9 billion, compared with $655.8 billion the previous year, excluding sales at restaurants, automobile dealers and gasoline stations. The NRF previously forecast sales would rise 3.6 to 4 percent for the period. Holiday sales can account for up to 40 percent of annual sales for some stores.
While strong sales were widely expected, many retailers were particularly hungry to prove themselves this past holiday season, following a year marred by tumbling stock prices, management shakeups, a slew of store closures and several industry bankruptcies. 
The Dow Jones Retailers Index (DJUSRT) was up 1.5 percent on Friday afternoon, led by jumps in the stock prices of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN),  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (N:WMT), among others.
NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said a number of factors contributed to surging consumer confidence including a pickup in income, a rising stock market, unemployment levels at 17-year lows and the timing of the tax cuts. 
""When that got passed and companies started to announce bonuses and wage increases, the consumer felt very much more at ease going into the holiday season and spending,"" Kleinhenz said in an interview, adding the possible tax cuts had not been accounted for in the NRF's forecast.
Several large U.S. employers, including Walmart,  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), AT&T Inc (N:T) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), have announced employee bonuses or wage increases after U.S. President Donald Trump's tax overhaul in December cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.
Kleinhenz also said retailers had the right mix of inventory, pricing and staffing to help connect with shoppers.
Struggling with competition from Amazon and off-price stores, traditional retailers have worked hard to address changing consumer habits by lowering prices, sprucing up physical stores and websites and improving delivery options.

1083,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",Spark's price for Luxturna blindness gene therapy too high: ICER,"By Bill Berkrot
(Reuters) - The proposed price for Spark Therapeutics Inc's (O:ONCE) groundbreaking one-time gene therapy for a rare form of blindness is far too high, an independent U.S. nonprofit organization that evaluates clinical and cost effectiveness of new medicines said on Friday.
Spark announced that its recently approved treatment, Luxturna, would carry a list price of $850,000, or $425,000 per eye, for a form of blindness that affects only 1,000 to 2,000 people in the United States.
Despite strategies proposed by the company, such as stretching payment over several years and refunds if the treatment fails, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) said Luxturna in most cases should cost about 50 percent to 75 percent less than the proposed price.
""We believe it's a scientific milestone, but that for the majority of patients being treated, the cost is not in line with what's considered cost-effective,"" ICER Chief Medical Officer David Rind said.
Spark shares were down 1.8 percent at $53.09.
The report comes at a sensitive time for Spark as it negotiates payments and reimbursement with the government and private health insurers ahead of a planned March launch of the therapy. 
Companies developing gene therapies for other conditions are also looking to Spark for indications on what pricing will be deemed acceptable.
The long-term benefit of Luxturna remains unknown. Assuming a 10- to 20-year benefit, the treatment failed to meet cost-effectiveness thresholds, ICER said.
Considering only direct healthcare system benefits with a patient treated at age 15, Luxturna should be priced 75 to 82 percent lower, or between $153,000 and $217,000, ICER said.
However, taking into account the many benefits and cost savings of regaining vision to society, such as greater productivity and reduced caregiver burden, ICER figures the price should be about $400,000.
""For a condition like blindness, a lot of the benefits and impact is outside the healthcare system,"" ICER founder Steve  Pearson  (LON:PSON) said.
Pricing needs to be set ""in a way that will be sustainable and affordable,"" he added. 
If a child of three were to receive the therapy and it lasted long-term - a best-case scenario - the value of Luxturna does approach $850,000, Pearson said.

While ICER often recommends significantly lower pricing for expensive new medicines, it said the cost of the two new CAR-T cancer therapies that genetically modify a patients' own immune cells was appropriate. Those one-time treatments from  Novartis  (S:NOVN) and Gilead Sciences (O:GILD) carry list prices of $475,000 and $373,000.

1085,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",Goldman thwarts fraud class action tied to Abacus CDO: U.S. appeals court,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court said a shareholder lawsuit accusing  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) of fraudulently claiming to put client interests before its own when creating risky subprime securities before the financial crisis, including a collateralized debt obligation known as Abacus, cannot proceed as a class action.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said on Friday a lower court judge imposed too high a burden on the Wall Street bank to show that its alleged conflicts of interest and misleading statements had no impact on its stock price.
While the 3-0 decision permits shareholders to again seek class certification, it may now be easier for Goldman to convince U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty, who had certified a class action in September 2015, not to let the plaintiffs sue as a group.
Thomas Dubbs, a lawyer for the shareholders, said he was ""confident"" a class action would again be certified. Goldman had no immediate comment.
Shareholders from February 2007 to June 2010 claimed to lose more than $13 billion because Goldman had in regulatory filings and public comments overstated its ability to manage conflicts.
They said Goldman did this while concealing short positions that the bank or hedge fund manager John Paulson made in four subprime mortgage CDOs: Abacus 2007 AC-1, Anderson Mezzanine Funding 2007-1, Hudson Mezzanine Funding 2006-1, and Timberwolf.
Shareholders sued after news about federal enforcement activity hurt Goldman's stock, including when the Securities and Exchange Commission brought civil fraud charges in April 2010 against Goldman and vice president Fabrice Tourre over Abacus.
In certifying a class action, Crotty had said Goldman ""failed to conclusively sever th (e) link"" between its statements and its stock price.
But in Friday's decision, Circuit Judge Richard Wesley, citing a more recent ruling involving  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, said Goldman had only to show it more likely than not that its alleged misrepresentations did not affect the stock.
Wesley also said Crotty erred in deciding not to consider evidence offered by Goldman of 34 dates prior to 2010 when news reports of its alleged conflicts did not hurt its stock price.
He expressed no view on whether such evidence would suffice for Goldman to meet its burden of proof.
The SEC has estimated that Paulson made about $1 billion by betting against Abacus.
Goldman settled with the SEC for $550 million in July 2010, without admitting wrongdoing. A federal jury found Tourre liable in August 2013, and a judge later ordered him to pay more than $856,000, including a fine.

The case is Arkansas Teachers Retirement System et al v Goldman Sachs Group Inc et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-250.

Leandra English is the deputy director of the CFPB and argues that Mick Mulvaney, Trump's budget director and pick to temporarily lead the consumer watchdog, was wrongly installed.
A federal court this week rejected English's argument, leading her to file a further challenge with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
English has so far lost two arguments in federal court, both to the same judge. On Friday, her lawyer asked the appeals court for expedited hearings in a fight that could end in the Supreme Court. 
""There is an urgent public need for clarity,"" wrote Deepak Gupta, English's attorney, in the filing. ""Until the full judicial process has run its course, the Bureau’s employees, the companies it regulates, and millions of American consumers will continue to suffer under a cloud of disruptive legal uncertainty.""
The CFPB was conceived to protect borrowers from abuse, but has become a partisan lightning-rod as Democrats see it as a critical watchdog while Republicans see an excessively powerful bureaucracy.
English was endorsed by former CFPB Director Richard Cordray, an appointee of President Barack Obama, before he stepped down in November. Trump named Mulvaney on the same day, setting off a legal feud that has been in the courts for weeks.
In the meantime, Mulvaney has made his mark at the agency, ordering a freeze on all new rules and other activity while he reviews agency policies.

Mulvaney, who also serves as director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, is meant to only lead the agency on an interim basis. A permanent replacement to Cordray would have to be nominated by the President and endorsed by the Senate.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) has profited by being beating its competitors in exchange-traded funds to the punch, but Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink seems happy to be out of step with at least one trend - the race to build a bitcoin fund.
The world's largest asset manager on Friday reported earnings that beat Wall Street expectations, due in no small part to aggressive investments in ETFs that track all sorts of financial markets. Investors are flocking to the relatively low-cost investments.
But when asked about a recent proposal by a competitor to build a ""leveraged"" ETF that would rise - or fall - twice as fast as the price of bitcoin on a given day, Fink was dismissive.
""Those are not the kinds of products we would introduce at BlackRock,"" Fink told Reuters.
""Our actions will speak louder than our words.""
The comments come as a host of BlackRock's smaller rivals in the ETF space position themselves for they hope is a gold rush to capitalize after bitcoin's 1,500 percent surge last year.
Among the proposals, Direxion Asset Management LLC is hoping to list a leveraged bitcoin ETF on Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (N:ICE) NYSE Arca exchange that is intended to double the price moves of the digital asset on a given day, according to filings last week.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been reluctant to let bitcoin funds come to market, with the regulatory agency asking tough questions about the stability of the market for the digital asset and pushing some issuers to withdraw their proposed funds.
For his part, Fink has told Reuters that bitcoin is a ""speculative"" investment that thrives because of its anonymous nature and he puzzled over ""why it has so much fascination for the press.""
In 2014, Fink shocked some in the ETF business when he said that leveraged ETFs' structural problems had the potential to ""blow up the whole industry one day.""
Leveraged ETFs are designed to deliver 1.5 or more times a given market index on a day, but they can vary significantly over longer periods. Brokerage firms have been penalized for selling leveraged ETFs to investors for whom they were not suitable.

BlackRock and Vanguard Group dominate ETF inflows. Last year, BlackRock's iShares ETFs attracted $245 billion in cash, while Vanguard pulled in $147 billion, according to the companies.

The move reduced capital requirements for financial firms by 25 percent, or $1.36 billion, in part because it meant trading margins did not need to be held as long, according to the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation. 
Now the DTCC, an industry-owned organization that processes nearly all U.S. securities transactions, plans to cut another full market day of risk from the settlement cycle by settling trades in the morning, pre-market open, instead of later in the afternoon, said Mike McClain, head of equity clearing at the DTCC.
The move, planned for early next year, will not require any changes by industry participants and will again reduce capital requirements for trading firms, McClain said in an interview. He said the DTCC is working on a study to determine the exact amount of savings to the industry. 
The idea of shortening the settlement cycle gained steam during the 2007-09 global financial crisis as a way for firms to limit the risk associated with the person or firm on the other side of a trade defaulting.
Currently, traders can choose to have their orders settled in a single day, but it can be difficult to find the other side of a trade that is also seeking faster settlement. Such trades make up less than one percent of the 56 million trades the DTCC processes on an average day.
In an effort to make it easier to match buyers and sellers who want expedited settlement, the DTCC is also in talks with two alternative trading system (ATS) operators about helping to create exchange-like trading venues that would only accept orders for single day settlement, McClain said. 
He declined to name the ATS operators because the talks are ongoing, but said at least one of the trading venues could have the changes in place this year.

""We have no plans to relocate Aetna’s operations from Hartford and, in fact, view Hartford as the future location of our center of excellence for the insurance business,"" CVS spokeswoman Carolyn Castel said in an email.
CVS will continue to be headquartered in Rhode Island. The company's CEO met with Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy as well as Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin on Thursday.
Aetna had said last year that it planned to move its corporate headquarters to New York in 2018.
CVS struck its deal to buy Aetna last month, combining one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefits managers and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose national business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans.

1096,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",U.S. airlines November on-time rates highest in eight years,"By Alana Wise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. airlines in November had their highest on-time arrival rates in eight years, the U.S. Department of Transportation said on Friday, setting another watermark in a record-breaking year for safety and performance. 
November also matched the record for fewest canceled domestic flights - 0.3 percent - equal to the record set in September and November of 2016. 
Leading the flock with the highest on-time arrival rates were Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), with 93.7 percent of flights arriving on time,  Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE), with 89.8 percent on-time arrivals, and Hawaiian Airlines logging 89.3 percent of flights as arriving on time. 
The airlines with the lowest on-time arrival rates were Virgin America and Alaska Airlines, both subsidiaries of  Alaska Air  Group Inc (N:ALK), and regional carrier  SkyWest  Airlines (O:SKYW). 
Commercial passenger airlines also set a record for safety in 2017, with zero accidental deaths recorded last year, according to groups that track crashes.
Despite carriers' commercial success, 2017 ranked among the most turbulent years for airline-customer relations amid a number of high profile public relations crises and congressional threats of more stringent regulation of the industry. 

While complaints about the treatment of disabled passengers and about discrimination were both down year-over-year in the month of November, general complaints about airline service increased 27.1 percent in the month to 1,299.

1111,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>","Traders Don't Think Facebook's Shift Will Benefit Twitter, Snap","(Bloomberg) -- Twitter and Snap aren’t likely to gain significant advertising dollars from Facebook’s decision to de-emphasize business content in favor of posts from family and friends, according to seven of eight traders and money managers surveyed by Bloomberg.
Some said Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) may not even lose much advertising revenue in the long run, as the site could charge more for the reduced number of ads it will carry. Another common take among those surveyed was that Facebook could increase the advertising load on Instagram, which they said is currently under-monetized relative to the core platform.
One portfolio manager agreed with Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jitendra Waral, who said that the steps Facebook is taking could change the advertising landscape. Facebook’s strategy is “great to gate the long-term decline in user engagement,” he said in an email. However, in the near term, publishers relying on Facebook for content distribution “are most at risk so they may seek alternatives like Snap, Twitter and LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD),” he added.
Facebook dropped 4.2 percent to 179.96 as of 11:42 a.m. in New York, heading for its biggest one-day loss since September amid concern about the strategy change. Snap fell 4.1 percent to $14. Twitter added 4 percent, the most in almost two months, to $25.36 after BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield raised his price target to $30 from $25 and said that he sees the company being acquired.

1113,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",Legendary investor Boone Pickens closes energy hedge fund amid setbacks,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Legendary investor T. Boone Pickens said on Friday he has closed his Dallas-based energy hedge fund amid health and financial setbacks. 
Pickens, 89 years old, said in a letter posted online that he plans to focus on his health and on entrepreneurship, philanthropic and political activities. He is still recovering from a serious fall last summer and suffered a series of strokes in late 2016. 
""Trading oil is not as intriguing to me as it once was,"" he wrote in the letter posted on Friday. ""It's no secret the past year has not been good to me, from a health perspective or a financial one.""
The fund, which he formed in 1996, has struggled and in recent years its assets have been well below a peak of $2 billion in 2007, a spokesman said. 
Pickens gained notoriety and celebrity in the 1980s as a dealmaker who launched leveraged buyouts of oil companies including Phillips Petroleum Co, Gulf Oil Corp and Unocal Corp. Even though many did not succeed, he and his investors made substantial money from the sale of stock of his target companies.
In 1956, he founded an oil production company that became Mesa Petroleum and ran it for nearly 40 years. 
A decade ago, he unveiled his ""Pickens Plan,"" a lobbying effort to wean the United States from OPEC oil by championing the use of alternative energy and natural gas. He spent in excess of $100 million to promote the effort, a spokesman said. 
Brian Bradshaw and David Meaney, executives of the shuttered Pickens hedge fund,  BP  (LON:BP) Capital, have started their own hedge fund, Assert Capital Management LP.
Their energy commodities fund will start operations next week with about $25 million, mostly from past investors. It plans to raise another $200 million this summer, Meaney said in an interview.
Pickens remains involved in his charitable foundation and on the board of Clean Energy Fuels Corp (O:CLNE), which operates natural gas refueling stations. 

Two of Pickens investment vehicles, private equity funds BP Energy Partners and mutual funds manager BP Capital Fund Advisors, remain in operation.

By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Electronic trading is becoming increasingly important when it comes to corporate debt as fund management firms try to knit together sources of liquidity in a fragmented market, executives from Alliance Bernstein LP and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) said on Thursday. 
""Our goal by the end of the year is that every trade we do is going to be done electronically,"" Jim Switzer, global head of credit trading at Alliance Bernstein, said at the inaugural meeting of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Fixed Income Market Structure Advisory Committee. 
That does not mean traders will not pick up the phone to make a trade anymore, but it does mean that all of those trades will be processed electronically, he said. 
Putting the information together electronically gives Alliance Bernstein a much better picture of the liquidity available in the market, making it easier to get the next trade done quickly, he said. 
BlackRock also aims to capture all of its bond trades electronically, said Richie Prager, head of trading, liquidity and investments platform at the world's largest fund manager, which oversees $6 trillion in assets.
Around two-thirds of BlackRock's corporate debt transactions are now done electronically, Prager said at the SEC meeting. By volume, however, that number drops to around 30 percent, pointing to the lasting importance of large block trades done by voice, especially for less standardized offerings, he added.
But electronic trading venues do help marry up the fragmented liquidity across the market, Prager said.
Electronic trading platforms have proliferated in recent years in the over-the-counter debt market as big banks have scaled back their bond dealing in response to post-financial crisis rules that make such activity more expensive. 
The pullback by banks has raised concerns about a liquidity crunch as U.S. interest rates rise and the market heats up. That has helped drive the shift to more electronic trading, as well as automation, to make sense of an often opaque market that has exploded in size over years of cheap borrowing rates.
Alliance Bernstein gets around 3 million unique trading messages a day and it is vital to be able to aggregate that information, especially as volatility begins to increase, Switzer said. 

""How do you have a trading desk ... of four guys with eight eyes that can look at 3 million messages and actually make any sense in rapidly changing and dynamic markets? That's where we're headed,"" he said.

The new factory in Newberry, South Carolina, aims to produce 1 million washing machines in 2018 and create over 1,000 jobs by 2020, Samsung said in a statement. 
It announced the $380 million plant in June 2017.
In November, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) recommended tariffs to keep Samsung and domestic rival LG Electronics (KS:066570) from selling inexpensive washing machines in the U.S. market, a step that would benefit American appliance maker Whirlpool Corp (N:WHR). 
U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to make a decision on the recommendation early this year.
""Because we are committed to supplying the U.S. market from Newberry, no remedy is necessary,"" said John Herrington, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Home Appliances for Samsung Electronics America, about the tariff recommendation before a U.S. trade committee earlier this month. 
If the United States decides to take action to ""lock in"" Samsung's commitment, tariffs recommended by the ITC that will ""facilitate Samsung's transition from importer to domestic producer"" should be chosen, Herrington said, citing the ITC, according to a Samsung statement. 

The plant, Samsung's first U.S. appliances factory in more than three decades, was among a long list of investment pledges by global companies reacting to pressure from Trump to create more U.S. jobs.

1129,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>",Good News Just Keeps Stacking Up for Europe Assets on a Roll,"(Bloomberg) -- The frantic start to 2018 continued for European markets on Friday, as reports of a breakthrough in negotiations to form a German government boosted positive sentiment toward assets in the world’s biggest single market.
The euro surged to the highest in three years as leaders of the region’s largest economy reached a preliminary accord to end months of political deadlock. Gains in the common currency would ordinarily sap Europe’s exporter-heavy stock gauge, but equities rose with most industry sectors in the green, and core government bonds steadied after a tumultuous week.
The resilience underlines the bullish picture for investors in Europe. A new German government would remove one of the key remaining political risks in the region, allowing traders to focus on the burgeoning growth story spurring both the currency and corporate profits. The minutes of the European Central Bank’s December meeting released on Thursday showed that policy makers are open to tweaking their policy guidance soon to align it with a strengthening economy.
Here’s a look at how assets are benefiting across the board.
FX
The euro gained 0.8 percent to $1.2132 as of 4:41 p.m. in London, leading gains among Group-of-10 currencies against the greenback and reaching its strongest level since Dec. 31, 2014. The currency has gained 14 percent against the dollar in the past year.
The latest move may open up a test of $1.23, according to Martin Enlund, chief analyst at Nordea Markets in Stockholm.
Stocks
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fluctuated on Friday before turning higher to head for a second week in the green.
While the five-day advance is set to be minimal, it follows the best week since April and comes despite both the rampant euro and the ECB’s perceived hawkish turn, which may signal the end of the unprecedented stimulus that stoked asset prices. Even Germany’s DAX Index, which is heavily skewed to exporters like car manufacturers, advanced.
Meanwhile, price targets for the Stoxx 600 are likely to be raised in coming weeks, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, adding another catalyst to European stocks’ developing breakout. European equity funds recorded inflows of $2.2 billion the week through Jan. 10, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) strategists.
Bonds
The bond markets have been in turmoil this week after a selloff in benchmark U.S. Treasuries with multiple possible drivers. But against this backdrop, it was the busiest week for issuance in Europe in at least four years, and all the sales were were comfortably digested by investors.
As confidence builds, yield spreads between periphery and core nations are narrowing despite the supply glut, which included a 9 billion-euro ($10.9 billion), 20-year offering from Italy. Conditions are so good that one of the week’s riskiest sales, a subordinated bond from Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA, received orders for more than triple the subordinated debt it offered on Thursday, just months after an Italian government rescue. The notes are already bid a point higher than where they priced.
Fund flow data on Friday suggest further cash has moved into credit assets, while the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) EuroAgg Corporate index hit new post-crisis lows this week.

1132,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 11:39AM ET</span>","Forget the Fed, Capital Flows May Be the Real Threat to Markets","(Bloomberg) -- “Safe” assets are at risk of turning dangerous.
The major risk in global financial markets right now is that traditional safe-haven assets in the U.S. such as Treasuries are expensive, and that creates the danger that global liquidity flows out of the country at a rapid pace, CrossBorder Capital wrote in a report.
Too many investors are focused on risks from developed-market central banks unwinding their quantitative-easing policies this year. “Instead, we put far more weight on the threat from a too rapid reversal of cross-border capital flows,” the report said. “The asset bubbles are migrating eastward.”
The worries for 2018 include a Chinese economy that exceeds too-pessimistic consensus expectations, weaker global bonds and a stronger euro. The latest liquidity data show a boom in Europe, Asia accelerating and improving, and the U.S. with a “subpar outlook,"" CrossBorder said, and that’s moving capital into non-U.S. markets from the U.S. Also, market volatility has a positive link to the rapidity with which global liquidity leaves the U.S., “much like 1987.”
“Sterling and the euro will be the major beneficiaries, while the yen will flat-line because of the implicit replacement of Japan’s previous liquidity-targeting policy by a new exchange rate target that includes the Chinese yuan,” the report said. “Japanese bonds will react negatively to this regime, forcing yields higher and reinforcing rising term premia and steepening yield curves worldwide.”

1133,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>",JPMorgan says tax changes will spur more profits after quarterly beat,"By Sweta Singh and David Henry
(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations on Friday and said tax law changes will help future profits by not only reducing the amount it pays the federal government but also by stimulating more business.
JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, recorded $2.4 billion in one-time charges in the fourth quarter related to the tax law changes. However, it expects its effective tax rate to drop to 19 percent this year from 32 percent last year, which will save it billions of dollars.
The sweeping tax changes President Donald Trump signed into law in December, designed to kick-start economic growth, slashed the U.S. corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.
As a result, JPMorgan said it expects corporations to borrow more, offer more stock and pursue more mergers and acquisitions, all of which would boost revenue.
Although the bank plans to use some of that money for compensation, business investments, helping rural communities and other uses, it will mostly boost profits, executives said on a call with analysts.
""Much of it will fall to our bottom line in 2018 and beyond,"" Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on a call with analysts.
The bank's shareholders should benefit as JPMorgan returns more capital to them through dividends and stock buybacks, she said.
Several financial companies, including  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), have warned investors that they will face short-term pain over some of the tax changes. However, over the longer term, the changes are widely expected to generate gains for large U.S. corporations.
Some of the benefits will likely be lost as banks vie to offer better deals to customers, starting with businesses where prices change more quickly, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said.
JPMorgan's charges related to a one-time repatriation tax on income it has kept abroad and adjusting the value of its deferred tax assets and liabilities. The bank said it does not expect to bring any substantive amount of the foreign cash home, because it has capital and liquidity requirements abroad.
JPMorgan's shares were up 1.3 percent at $112.18.
RISING RATES, STEINHOFF WOES
Excluding one-time items, JPMorgan's fourth-quarter profit was higher than analysts had expected. Rising interest rates produced gains in net interest income that offset a slowdown in trading revenue.
The bank's adjusted net profit was $6.7 billion, or $1.76 per share, compared with the average estimate of $1.69 per share. Net revenue rose 4.6 percent to $25.45 billion and beat the estimate of $25.15 billion. Including the tax charge, its net profit fell to $4.23 billion, or $1.07 per share, from $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, a year earlier. Analysts were generally positive about the results, although some asked for more detail on how the bank will use its expected tax savings and expressed concern about the benefits fading quickly in a competitive environment. JPMorgan's earnings per share would have been 17.5 percent higher last year if its taxes had been as low as they will be going forward, according to an estimate by Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI, who rates JPMorgan shares ""outperform."" ""Good economy, lower tax rate and continued JPMorgan-specific strength ... should keep people plenty happy,"" he wrote in a note to clients. Trading revenue across the industry has been under pressure due to low volatility. Markets were especially active in the year-earlier quarter as investors changed positions around the U.S. election. JPMorgan's bond trading revenue fell 27 percent. Equity trading revenue was flat, after a mark-to-market loss of $143 million on a margin loan related to troubled South African furniture retailer Steinhoff International (J:SNHJ) (DE:SNHG).  The bank set aside an additional $130 million for potential credit losses related to Steinhoff, which has been embroiled in an accounting scandal. Lake said other banks may also take a hit from the loan which was syndicated. Other banks with substantial lending exposure to Steinhoff include Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), UniCredit (MI:CRDI), Calyon, BNP (PA:BNPP), HSBC (L:HSBA), Citigroup Inc (N:C), Mizuho (T:8411) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC).  
Rising interest rates helped JPMorgan cushion the blow from lower trading revenue, lifting net interest income by 11 percent to $13.4 billion.

1141,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 10:26AM ET</span>",U.S. 2-Year Yield Tops 2% for First Time Since Financial Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- The two-year U.S. Treasury yield rose above 2 percent for the first time since September 2008, marking a rebound to a key psychological level last seen during the depths of the global financial crisis.
The past 14 months have witnessed a remarkable reversal for the coupon maturity that’s most sensitive to Federal Reserve expectations. After failing to eclipse 1 percent through much of 2016, the yield surged following President Donald Trump’s election victory, and kept climbing throughout 2017 as policy makers delivered on their promised three rate increases.
Data Friday showing that the underlying pace of U.S. inflation accelerated last month finally drove it above 2 percent, as the market-implied probability of a Fed rate increase in March exceeded 80 percent. Treasuries fell broadly, with the difference between yields on five- and 30-year maturities approaching the smallest since 2007.
The last time investors saw two-year Treasuries yielding 2 percent was Sept. 30, 2008, about two weeks after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which sparked a global flight to safety. On Sept. 15, the day of the bankruptcy filing, the yield plunged 50 basis points, driving it below 2 percent on an intraday basis.
After a turbulent stretch where the Treasury and the Fed tried to bolster confidence in the financial system, the yield closed below 2 percent at the end of September 2008 and remained below that mark until today. In September 2011, it set a record low of 0.143 percent, with the Fed’s benchmark rate locked near zero.
S&P Comparison
Now, in a development that may have seemed unthinkable during much of the economic recovery, the two-year note provides investors with more income than dividends on the S&P 500 Index.
Just 18 months ago, investors grappled with the prospect of an unprecedented drop in 30-year yields below 2 percent. While that didn’t happen, the yield spread between long- and short-maturity Treasuries has continued to shrink, flattening the yield curve.
Bond traders are betting the Fed will gradually raise rates in 2018, meaning the two-year yield may have more room to climb. At the same time, any sign that policy makers will pause could halt the momentum that’s sent the yield higher for six consecutive quarters, the longest stretch since 2000."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian conglomerate Sistema, which has to make a big payment to energy giant Rosneft (MM:ROSN) to settle a business dispute, is in talks with one of the country's sovereign wealth funds about transferring two of its companies, sources said on Friday.
The negotiations concern the possibility of the state-owned Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) taking over control of two retail and power businesses from Sistema, a banking source and a source close to the conglomerate told Reuters.
Asked by Reuters for comment, RDIF said it had no plans to take over the assets, and Sistema said it was not planning to transfer the assets to the fund.
The dispute centred on mid-sized oil company Bashneft (MM:BANE), pitting Rosneft's chief executive Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, against Sistema owner Vladimir Yevtushenkov, a billionaire who some Russian media reports suggest is close to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.
Under the settlement announced last month, Sistema has to pay Rosneft 100 billion roubles ($1.8 billion) by March 30 and RDIF has agreed to lend Sistema 40 billion roubles. Russia's largest lender Sberbank (MM:SBER) will also help Sistema to raise funds before the deadline.
Sistema put up two of its assets, toy retailer Detsky Mir (MM:DSKY) and the Bashkirian Power Grid Company, as collateral against the RDIF loan. The talks centre on the possible transfer of these firms to the fund. 
""The parties have been in discussion over the terms and the deal structure,"" a banking source said.
Another source, close to Sistema, confirmed that such talks have been under way and that the terms of the deal have not yet been agreed. It was not clear whether they would include any cash payments to Sistema or it would be non-cash transaction. 
RDIF said in the emailed comments that the fund did not plan to acquire or in any way ""gain control"" over the assets. ""RDIF acts as the arranger of the 40 billion-rouble-financing secured by these assets, as it was set in the amicable agreement,"" the fund said. 
Sistema's spokesman said that the company was not considering transferring control over Detsky Mir and Bashkirian Power Grid Company to RDIF. 
The RDIF's possible acquisition of the assets would mark a boost for the fund, which is headed by ex-banker Kirill Dmitriev. RDIF, which manages capital of $10 billion, was launched in 2011 with the aim of attracting foreign investments to Russia.

KPMG sacked its South African leadership in September after it found work done for companies owned by the Gupta family, a trio of Indian-born businessmen with close ties to President Jacob Zuma, ""fell considerably short"" of its standards.
""The IRBA can confirm that one of the lines of investigation is nearing completion and will be tabled at the upcoming investigating committee, while others are progressing satisfactorily,"" Bernard Agulhas, chief executive of the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA), said in a statement.
Information requested from KPMG remains outstanding and the IRBA continues to engage with KPMG to obtain it to complete these investigations, he said.
He said most of the information required from the South African Revenue Service has been received.
Companies including the African arm of German insurer Munich Re (DE:MUVGn) and local ones such as  Sasfin  (J:SFNJ) and Hulisani (J:HULJ) said last year they would drop KPMG as their auditor. The South African parliament has also said it would no longer use the company.
KPMG is one of several high-profile international companies facing questions about its work for the Indian-born Gupta brothers, who have been accused by an anti-graft watchdog of unduly influencing the awarding of government contracts.

The Guptas and Zuma deny wrongdoing and say they are victims of a politically motivated witch-hunt. The Guptas and their companies have not been charged with any crime.

LONDON/PARIS/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's COFCO International is in the throes of a staffing upheaval as the group pursues its professed ambition of sitting at the top table of global agricultural traders.
But doubts persist among some in the industry over whether the trading firm will really challenge the existing four dominant players in grains, oilseeds and sugar. In the end, they suspect, it may prioritize securing strategic food supplies for China over commercial aims in an era of rising trade tensions.
State-owned conglomerate China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corp began building its foreign commodities operations in 2014 and formally launched the COFCO International Ltd (CIL) trading division in April last year. Its assets include port facilities in Brazil and Romania, sugar mills in Brazil and grain silos across the globe. 
Last month Yu Xubo, president of the Beijing-based parent COFCO Group, laid out a bold expansion. ""We aim to become the largest international food trader by 2020, not only in assets we own and revenues we make, but also in the quality of our assets, business operation, and return on investment,"" he told the official China Daily.
COFCO Group, which has interests that include hotels, real estate and some of China's leading food and drink brands including Great Wall wine, reported revenue of 344.796 billion yuan ($53 billion) in the first nine months of 2017.
Reflecting progress toward its targets, by the middle of last year the group was already the second biggest grain exporter from Argentina, one of the world's top food producers. 
PAINFUL INTEGRATION 
China is securing its global supply lines, moving into mining ventures in Africa, expanding its ocean shipping fleet and buying ports around the world. This effort is accelerating under President Xi Jinping's trillion-dollar Belt and Road initiative involving huge infrastructure projects connecting China to Europe and beyond.
But COFCO International - in which Singapore, London-based  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) and the World Bank's commercial arm also hold stakes - has spent most of the past year integrating past purchases rather than expanding. 
This process has been painful at a difficult time for all traders. Four years of bumper global grains and oilseeds harvests have squeezed profits at the established players: Archer Daniels Midland Co, Bunge, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co, known as the ""ABCDs"" due to their initials.
""It has been a challenging period,"" said one source with knowledge of COFCO International's strategy. But the source told Reuters the worst was over, with the trader poised to try to take market share from rivals. ""The big ambition is still there - to be the new C of the ABCDs.""
COFCO International has been trying to integrate two purchases, together worth more than $3 billion, that it agreed three years ago - of Rotterdam-based grain trader Nidera and the agribusiness of Singapore-listed Noble Group. 
This has meant heavy job losses. A company official said last month that over 2,500 jobs had been shed in its Brazilian sugar operations alone, with further cuts expected there, although this was separate from the integration process. 
COFCO Group has also sent a team of managers from Beijing to take pivotal roles in operations across the globe, including in Canada, Brazil and Europe, company memos seen by Reuters showed.
A spokesman for Geneva-based COFCO International said around 50 of its staff are former COFCO Group employees, although he noted this was out of a total workforce that exceeds 13,000. The spokesman declined to comment further on human resources issues.
Chief executive Johnny Chi, who held top positions with COFCO Group in China, has overseen the departure of several top staff at Nidera, from which the trader inherited big losses. These included a $150 million financial hole in its Latin American operations and $200 million in unauthorized trading losses on its biofuels desk.
Company memos show Chi has been followed by Frank Feng, appointed chief risk officer for South America and Lucas Shi, who has taken the same role at a regional level in the ""Southern Cone"" countries including Argentina. Another recruit from Beijing is Dong Guo, who has become chief research officer.
Sources said Nidera teams have been shrunk or removed in Europe and North America. This followed a management reshuffle in Brazil after the accounting irregularities.
The firm has also hired high profile figures from the industry, with Pierre Lorinet, former chief financial officer at trade house Trafigura, and Serge Schoen, an ex-Louis Dreyfus chief executive, both joining its board.
CULTURAL QUESTIONS
Whether the firm has achieved a turnaround yet is unclear. No profit and loss accounts are available for COFCO International, in which the Beijing parent holds 48 percent and the sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp 12 percent. 
COFCO International announced in November an agreement to sell its crop seeds business to Swiss-based  Syngenta  AG (SIX:SYNN) - which has been bought by ChemChina - but did not disclose price terms.
""The seeds sale has boosted the balance sheet,"" a second source said. ""2017 has been an effective year and COFCO International is back on track and can start thinking again about growing.""
COFCO has said it will pursue partnerships to expand overseas after signing a supply deal with U.S. cooperative Promark last year.
One former COFCO International manager who left in the past year said the firm had been struggling over how to cut costs and ensure future revenues after shedding people who had been making it money. Other problems lay in overcoming cultural differences across its global operations. 
""It's a big machine. It doesn't think like a business. It thinks like a government,"" the former manager told Reuters, declining to be named.
The spokesman for COFCO International Ltd (CIL) said ""differences in corporate culture are normal in the context of a merger of companies"". 
""CIL is currently deploying a new common corporate culture across all CIL locations which was developed by various CIL management in 2017,"" he added.
FEEDING CHINA
Chi has played down suggestions that the firm is torn between competing objectives, unsure whether to pursue its own commercial aims or the strategic interests of its home country. In November, he told the Financial Times it did not want to be ""just a procurement platform for COFCO Corporation or China"".
But some remain sceptical. ""What COFCO International should strive for is to be the most efficient procurement office for China – the feeding of China's population is of the utmost strategic importance,"" said Jean-Francois Lambert, founding partner of Lambert Commodities consultancy. ""This is in fact their prime objective.""
With such powerful Chinese shareholders, the firm has the financial clout to become an ABCD ""if they want to"", said Jay O'Neil, senior agricultural economist at Kansas State University.
COFCO International had overpaid for the investments in Nidera and Noble and not got the results it was looking for, he told Reuters. However, he noted the possibility that the purchases were designed to let COFCO and China diversify supplies of soyabeans and to ""protect them from potential political issues with the U.S."".
President Donald Trump has repeatedly complained about the size of China's trade surplus with the United States, and accused the country of stealing U.S. intellectual property.
The views of COFCO International's shareholders remain unclear. COFCO Group did not respond to requests for comment while China Investment Corp declined to comment, as did Standard Chartered and China-based private equity firm HOPU Investments.

(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) on Friday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, as investors flooded into the world's biggest asset manager's exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
The company's profit was boosted by a $1.2 billion gain related to the recent enactment of the U.S. tax laws, and the company also raised its quarterly cash dividend by 15 percent.
Booming markets drove demand for index-tracking ETFs in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, and helped push the assets BlackRock oversees past $6 trillion.
""We're winning more and more clients, and we're winning more of their wallet,"" Chief Executive Larry Fink told CNBC, who said he is generally optimistic about the trajectory of U.S. stocks.
BlackRock said its iShares ETF business took in $54.8 billion in new money in the quarter, up from $49.3 billion a year earlier.
The New York-based company's net income surged to $2.3 billion, or $14.07 per share, from $851 million, or $5.13 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding the benefit from the new tax law, BlackRock earned $6.24 per share. Analysts on an average expected the company to earn $6.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company ended the quarter with $6.29 trillion in assets under management, up 22 percent from $5.98 trillion at the end of the third quarter.
Net investment in fixed-income securities totaled $42.95 billion. BlackRock attracted total ""long-term"" net flows of $102.93 billion in the quarterly period.

BlackRock shares were up nearly 2 percent in pre-market trading on Friday.

1176,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 07:13AM ET</span>",JP Morgan Shares Turn Higher as Investors Digest Tax Impact on Q4 Earnings,"Investing.com – After shares in JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) initially reacted to the downside, falling more than 1% in pre-market trade Friday, investors seemed to accept the fact that the hit to income was a result of the recent tax reform and shares managed to once again turn higher.
The bank reported that net income for the last three months of 2017 was $4.2 billion with earnings per share (EPS) of $1.07, while consensus was looking for earnings of $1.69 a share.
However, the largest financial services firm by assets noted that, excluding significant items, fourth quarter income would have been $6.7 billion, or $1.76 per share.
Under the heading for significant items, JP Morgan highlighted that it took a charge of $2.4 billion, or $0.69 per share, due to the recent tax overhaul.
Meanwhile, the company’s revenue came in at $24.2 billion, compared to the forecast of $25.18 billion.
Chairman and chief executive Jamie Dimon commented that 2017 was a record year for JP Morgan as the bank added clients and customers and delivered a “record EPS”.
“The enactment of tax reform in the fourth quarter is a significant positive outcome for the country,” Dimon stated.
“U.S. companies will be more competitive globally, which will ultimately benefit all Americans,” he explained.
“The cumulative effect of retained and reinvested capital in the U.S. will help grow the economy, ultimately growing jobs and wages,” he added.
“We have always invested, even in difficult times, in our employees, customers and communities, and as a result of the tax plan we will be increasing and accelerating some of these investments,” Dimon concluded.
Prior to the report, JP Morgan shares had been trading mostly flat, barely in positive territory. The initial reaction to the report saw shares drop more than 1%. However, at 7:15AM ET (12:15GMT), shares once again changed direction and gained 0.44% to $111.32.
Investors now look forward to JP Morgan's conference call at 8:30AM ET (13:30GMT). "

1184,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 06:47AM ET</span>",Some Chinese Apple users warned by firm on dodging new data law,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Some Chinese users of Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) products who have created Apple IDs overseas to circumvent a new law that requires their personal data to be stored within China say they have been warned by the tech giant that they risk losing the data.
China introduced a new cyber security law on June 1 that imposes tougher controls over data than in Europe and the United States, including mandating that companies store all data within China and pass security reviews.
Apple announced last year that it will migrate all user data from Chinese iCloud accounts to local servers run by Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Industry Co Ltd (GCBD), which is part of a state-backed infrastructure project overseen by local Communist Party officials.
The move is scheduled to happen on Feb. 28, and Apple this week notified users of the shift via emails linked to Chinese iCloud accounts.
However, despite earlier assurances by Apple that only local accounts will be affected, five Chinese users who had set up Apple iCloud accounts using U.S. emails, payment methods and addresses said they had received notices that they needed to opt into the transfer or risk losing their data. Their U.S. accounts did not contain any of their Chinese information, they said. 
""As far as they [Apple] know I'm a U.S. resident with a U.S. address, phone, email and payment details,"" one user in Beijing surnamed Liu, 26, told Reuters. He declined to share his full name in case his secondary account is identified and closed.
""How could they possibly judge that I'm a Chinese citizen?"" 
It was not immediately clear how many users in all received these warnings from Apple or how the company identified the users to send the notices. 
But thousands of users have taken to social media to criticize the firm and crowd source workaround solutions to the new rules, which don't give users an opt-out option that would allow them to keep their data. 
Apple declined to comment on why users with U.S. Apple IDs received the notices.
Opening foreign Apple ID accounts is one way that Chinese users are able to evade strict censorship controls by accessing overseas App Stores which host virtual private network (VPN) apps and other features.
Apple last year removed dozens of local and foreign VPN apps from its Chinese app store, as well as popular media apps and communication tools including Microsoft Corp's (O:MSFT) Skype, cutting off a major resource for Chinese users looking to access uncensored content. 
Chinese authorities maintain that the bans on foreign content - which include popular U.S. services by  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) - are designed to maintain social stability and eliminate threats to China's sovereignty. 
Apple said last year that it has strong data privacy protections in place for its Chinese data operations, and that no backdoors will be created in any of its systems.
However, some users say they are unconvinced and will disable their accounts. Other Apple loyalists told Reuters that they feared that refusing the new data terms or attempting risky solutions could mean losing their accounts or data. 
""I'm pretty sure the is a technical issue, (but) even if you choose a different region now, you will still be unclear where your data will go after the handover,"" said one user surnamed Wang, who told Reuters he has been using U.S. Apple IDs since before iPhones were available in China. 

""My iCloud service is paid in U.S. dollars and the billing address is in Portland, how can this data be in a Chinese server?""

1185,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>","Global stocks recover from wobble as ECB sends euro, yields higher","By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks scaled fresh peaks on Friday while the euro hit a three-year high and Bund yields rose as progress on forming a German government gave fresh impetus to a bond market sell-off triggered by signs the ECB may accelerate an end to its stimulus.
MSCI's broadest gauge of the world's stock markets hit yet another record high and was on track to rise for its eighth of the nine business days so far this year -- for a total increase of 3.5 percent.
U.S. stocks were set to open higher as well, likely hitting new records once again having made a rapid recovery from Wednesday's losses. Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were up 0.1 to 0.4 percent.
""This bull market is highly related to the fact we are facing good growth, low inflation and soft monetary policy normalization. If any of those were to be shaken that would be a big problem,"" said Jeanne Asseraf Bitton, head of cross-asset research at Lyxor Asset Management.
Germany's 10-year Bund yield hit a fresh five-month high of 0.54 percent after Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats agreed a blueprint for formal coalition negotiations, news that also buoyed the euro.
Germany's DAX gained 0.3 percent on the news and European stocks took their cue from a recovery in Asian trading, but gains were more muted than the stellar start to the week as a surging euro weighed on European exporters. 
MSCI's index of European stocks rose 0.2 percent as the euro hit its highest in three years at $1.2128 and last traded up 0.8 percent at $1.2126. 
The euro's overnight index swap rates have risen sharply this week as traders priced in a higher chance of a rate hike early next year.
While the currency's rise has reflected growing optimism over the bloc's economic recovery, investors have flagged it as a potential brake on stocks. Monica Defend, head of strategy at Amundi Asset Management, said the currency, for which she has a target of $1.22, was the biggest risk to European equities.
""COMPLACENT"" BOND MARKETS HIT BY ECB
A sell-off in European bonds gathered pace, with yields driven higher by minutes on Thursday of the ECB's December meeting that showed it thinks it should revisit its communication stance in early 2018. 
Lyxor's Bitton said Bund yields were already near to hitting her target for the first quarter.
""Markets were a bit too complacent about bonds so they took some excuses to correct,"" she said. ""We were a little surprised that the market reacted so strongly to the ECB.""
The minutes showed that with the euro zone seeing its best growth in a decade, ECB policymkaers were considering a gradual shift in its stance to reduce the focus on bond purchases and raise the emphasis on interest rates.
The ECB has pledged to continue its bond purchase program at least until September, and investors expect any rate hike to take place only next year.
Amundi's Defend said the gradual removal of liquidity from central banks would drive volatility higher across asset classes this year.
The end of a turbulent week for bond markets also saw U.S. Treasury yields extending Thursday's pullback after China disputed a media report that government officials had recommended it slow or halt its purchases of U.S. bonds.
The 10-year Treasury yield stood at 2.5425 percent, settling down further from Wednesday's 10-month high of 2.597 percent when fears of a bond bear market gripped investors.
""Our target for U.S. 10-year treasuries is 2.8 -- and we might afford up to 3 percent -- but going beyond that it's becoming an alert signal,"" said Amundi's Defend.
The dollar stayed in the doldrums after U.S. wholesale prices dipped in December from November, reinforcing investors' expectations that inflation will remain low.
The dollar index slipped to a six-week low, down 0.5 percent.
Bitcoin flirted with this year's low, having fallen 11.1 percent on Thursday after the government in South Korea, a major source of digital currency demand, unveiled plans to ban cryptocurrency trading. 
It traded at $13,926.58 on the Bitstamp exchange, up 5.3 percent but not far from Thursday's low of $12,800, which was its lowest since Dec 31.
Oil prices retreated from 2014 highs hit the previous day, but stayed near three-year highs on signs of tightening supply in the United States.
Brent crude futures hovered at $69.28 a barrel after hitting $70.05 a barrel on Thursday, their highest level since November 2014, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures stood at $63.49, down 0.3 percent on the day.
Investors warned that while rising oil prices were supportive, they could weigh negatively especially on crude consuming regions.

1186,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 06:38AM ET</span>","China cracks down on foreign companies calling Taiwan, other regions countries","By Brenda Goh and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's aviation authority on Friday demanded an apology from Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) for listing Taiwan and Tibet as countries on its website, while another government agency took aim at Inditex-owned (MC:ITX) fashion brand Zara and medical device maker  Medtronic  Plc (N:MDT) for similar issues.
The moves follow a regulator's decision on Thursday to suspend Marriott International Inc's (O:MAR) Chinese website for a week to punish the world's biggest hotel chain for listing Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as separate countries in a customer questionnaire.
The apparent intensification of efforts to police how foreign businesses refer to Chinese-claimed territories - even if only in pull-down menus - underscores just how sensitive the issue of sovereignty has become in a China that is increasingly emboldened on the international stage.
The involvment of more than one Chinese authority in rebuking businesses across different industries suggested possible coordination at a high level of government.
""It's hard not to see it as part of the wider trend where nationalist issues are being emphasized very deliberately as part of the new era,"" said a China-based Western businessman who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the topic.
""It's hard not to think that this is the shape of things to come for foreign companies, having to be even more careful about these sensitivities.""
Hong Kong and Macau are former European colonies that are now part of China but run largely autonomously. China annexed Tibet in 1950, although Beijing has long claimed the Himalayan region has been an indivisible part of China throughout history.
Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial issue. The ruling Communist Party considers the self-ruled, democratic island a wayward province and refuses to renounce the threat of force to bring it into the fold.
On Friday, the Civil Aviation Administration of China asked Delta to investigate the listing of Taiwan and Tibet as countries on its website, and called for an ""immediate and public"" apology.
The aviation authority also said it would require all foreign airlines operating routes to China to conduct comprehensive investigations of their websites, apps and customer-related information and ""strictly comply with China's laws and regulations to prevent a similar thing from happening"".
In a statement, Delta apologized for making ""an inadvertent error with no business or political intention"", saying it recognized the seriousness of the issue and had taken steps to resolve it.
Separately, the same regulator that penalized Marriott - the Shanghai branch of the state cyberspace administration - accused Zara of placing Taiwan in a pull-down list of countries on its Chinese website.
Medtronic had also put ""Republic of China (Taiwan)"" on one of its websites, the office said in a WeChat post, giving both companies until 6 pm local time to apologize.
Medtronic issued an apology via social media, saying it had updated the website. An executive who answered the phone at Zara's Shanghai office was not able to immediately comment.
China has long-running territorial disputes with several neighbors and has never been shy about correcting what it sees as misrepresentations of Chinese territory.
Foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular briefing on Friday that Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Tibet were all part of China.
""The companies that come to China should respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, abide by China's laws, and respect the feelings of the Chinese people. This is the minimum requirement of any company going to another country to carry out business and investment,"" he said. 

Last year, German carmaker Audi AG apologized for using a map that excluded Taiwan and parts of Tibet and the western Xinjiang region after it was heavily crticized on Chinese social media.

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>","Japan's retailers struggle to raise prices, even as economy gains momentum","By Sam Nussey and Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy is gathering steam, profits are at record levels and companies are poised to raise wages — yet retailers and restaurant chains are struggling to lift prices for fear of losing customers conditioned by nearly two decades of deflation.
This predicament could undermine the sustainability of Japan's recovery and highlights just how difficult it will be for the central bank to even get close to its 2 percent inflation target any time soon. Many retailers see lower prices as essential to appealing to Japan's thrifty consumers. The nation's biggest retailer Aeon Co. (T:8267) said its price cuts on own-brand groceries actually boosted third-quarter profits and on Friday announced that it would follow up discounting prices on 100 more everyday items from bread to dishwashing detergent by an average of 10 percent. 
""Our rivals are checking competitors' prices and lowering their prices in response,"" said Soichi Okazaki, president of Aeon Retail. ""If we don't do the same thing, we lose. I expect this behavior to continue."" 
Deflation is seen as a key reason Japan's economy has taken so long to recover from the bursting of its ""bubble economy"" in the 1990s. Consumers held back from spending and companies cut prices, which led to a vicious cycle of expectations that prices would continue to fall.
Fast Retailing Co Ltd (T:9983), whose budget clothing chain Uniqlo boomed during the country's deflation era, learned the hard way when sales slumped after it raised prices in 2014.
On Thursday it announced a record profit in its fiscal first quarter on stronger overseas sales but said that a pick-up in some economic data was not being reflected in shoppers' habits.
""Customers are still very strict about prices, so we can't be too optimistic,"" CFO Takeshi Okazaki said. 
The Bank of Japan, desperate to beat deflation once and for all, has said it will continue its massive monetary stimulus until inflation approaches 2 percent.
The most recent reading of the core Consumer Prices Index was 0.9 percent, which is progress given that for years prices were flat or falling, but still well short of the target. 
HOLDING BACK
Many consumers are holding back because their wages have not been rising very much - even though companies are sitting on mountains of cash thanks to robust profits.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been pushing companies to raise wages by at least 3 percent in March's annual negotiations with unions, going so far as to offer tax breaks for those that do. 
So far, a handful of companies have signaled they will. Many have had to because they are feeling the pinch of a labor shortage as Japan's population ages and shrinks. Average wages for part-time and contract workers have risen more quickly than salaried workers, helping to narrow that pay gap.
But many companies will likely hike salaries for full-time regular employees only by around 2 percent, the same as last year, although they may fatten bonuses, as they have in the past, because those are much easier to reduce in the future.
""People might be getting bigger bonuses but base pay isn't that much higher, so people aren't going to be willing to pay more for every day necessities,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. ""I don't think there's a sense that prices at supermarkets and such are about to rise."" 
MIXED RESULTS
Companies that have hiked prices in recent months are often doing so to stem losses coming from higher labor costs, and have seen mixed results.
Top delivery firm Yamato Holdings Co Ltd (T:9064) has been raising its prices due to labor shortages and pressure from the growth of e-commerce. The Nikkei business daily reported this week that higher prices helped push quarterly profit back into the black for the first time in a year.
When cost pressures drove  Torikizoku Co Ltd  (T:3193) to announce it would in October raise prices of its grilled chicken skewers for the first time in almost 30 years, shares rose. But the shares retreated this week when it said December customer numbers fell, reflecting the risk of hikes for firms that have made their names on the promise of low prices. 
Hiday Hidaka Corp's (T:7611) ramen noodle shop chain Hidakaya seems to be weathering its September price hike better, with sales and average customer spend rising each month since then. 
Still, these frugal habits don't seem like they are changing any time soon.
The country's brewers predicted this week that beer sales would continue to slide this year as consumers turn away from the premium priced brew in favor of cheaper fizzy canned cocktails.

""Consumers' economizing habits are as strong as ever,"" said Takayuki Fuse, president of Kirin Brewery, part of Kirin Holdings Co Ltd (T:2503).

1193,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 04:05AM ET</span>","Ford urges 2,900 pickup owners to stop driving after new Takata death","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Thursday it had confirmed a second death in an older pickup truck caused by a defective airbag inflator of Takata Corp and urged 2,900 owners in North America to stop driving immediately until they can get replacement parts.
The second largest U.S. automaker said it confirmed in late December that a July 2017 crash death in West Virginia in a 2006 Ford Ranger was caused by a defective Takata inflator. It previously reported a similar death in South Carolina that occurred in December 2015.
Ford said both Takata deaths occurred with inflators built on the same day installed in 2006 Ranger pickups. At least 21 deaths worldwide are linked to the Takata inflators that can rupture and send deadly metal fragments inside vehicles. The faulty inflators have led to the largest automotive recall in history. The other 19 deaths have occurred in Honda Motor Co vehicles, most of which were in the United States.
Ford issued a new recall for automobiles that had been previously recalled in 2016. 
Of the 391,000-plus 2004-2006 Ranger vehicles recalled at the time, the new recall announced on Thursday affects 2,900 vehicles. These include 2,700 in the United States and nearly 200 in Canada. The new recall will allow for identification of the 2,900 owners in the highest risk pool.
A Mazda Motor Corp spokeswoman said on Thursday the company would conduct a similar recall and stop-drive warning for some 2006 Mazda B-Series trucks, which were built by Ford and are similar to the Ranger.
Japanese auto supplier Takata plans to sell its viable operations to Key Safety Systems, an affiliate of China's Ningo Joyson Electric Corp, for $1.6 billion. 
A Takata spokesman said the company will make all attempts to ensure it can deliver replacement inflators as soon as possible.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration urged owners to heed Ford's warning. ""It is extremely important that all high-risk air bags are tracked down and replaced immediately,"" NHTSA spokeswoman Karen Aldana said.
'FAILED RECALL'
Ford said it would pay to have vehicles towed to dealerships or send mobile repair teams to owners' homes and provide free loaner vehicles if needed.
Takata said in June that it has recalled, or expected to recall, about 125 million vehicles worldwide by 2019, including more than 60 million in the United States. Some 19 automakers worldwide are impacted.
Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks and have injured more than 200. The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June.
In 2017, prosecutors in Detroit charged three former senior Takata executives with falsifying test results to conceal the inflator defect. None have come to the United States to face charges.
Last year, Takata pleaded guilty to wire fraud and was subject to pay a total of $1 billion in criminal penalties in a U.S. court in connection with the recalls. 
Automakers have struggled to get enough replacement parts for the massive recalls. A November NHTSA report said about two-thirds of U.S. vehicles recalled have not yet been repaired.
Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat, said in a statement on Thursday the latest death is evidence of ""the very definition of a failed recall"" pointing to the earlier Ford death in 2015. NHTSA must do more, he said, to make the recall a priority.
In November, NHTSA rejected a petition from Ford to delay recalling 3 million vehicles with potentially defective airbag inflators to conduct additional testing.

In June 2016, NHTSA warned airbag inflators on more than 300,000 unrepaired recalled 2001-2003 model year Honda vehicles showed a substantial risk of rupturing, and urged owners to stop driving them until getting them fixed. NHTSA said they have as high as a 50 percent chance of a rupture in a crash.

Powerful labor union IG Metall said workers at Audi's main plant in Ingolstadt in Bavaria downed tools during the night shift and BMW staff at three factories in Dingolfing, Landshut and Regensburg were to follow suit on Friday.
Spurred on by the fastest economic growth in six years and record low joblessness, the union is demanding 6 percent more pay for 3.9 million metals and engineering workers.
It has also embarked on its first major campaign for shorter working hours in more than three decades, demanding that workers gain the right to reduce their weekly hours to 28 from 35 to care for children or elderly or sick relatives and then return to full-time employment after two years.
Employers have offered 2 percent plus a one-off 200-euro ($239) payment in the first quarter. 
They have rejected demands for a shorter working week unless hours could be increased temporarily as well so as not to put output at risk.
Labour bosses and industrial employers took a small step toward a deal in regional talks in southwestern Baden-Wuerttemberg on Thursday, agreeing to appoint experts to look into the issue of working hours.
Some 160,000 workers have already taken part in industrial action this week to support IG Metall's wage claims and the union has threatened to call for 24-hour walkouts if talks fail to make progress.
Labour talks for workers in Baden-Wuerttemberg will resume on Jan. 24. Talks in Bavaria continue on Monday and in North Rhine-Westphalia resume on Thursday.

1205,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Explainer: Investors to scour outlooks for U.S. companies' tax cut plans,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Corporate results for 2017's final quarter will start pouring in next week and are expected to be laden with one-time charges as U.S. companies begin to cope with tax code changes, including a one-time tax on trillions of dollars in profits held overseas. 
Wall Street investors will be tuned in to chief executives' statements about plans for 2018 and beyond for savings that will result from a deep cut in corporate income taxes enacted last month by the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump.
Some investors expect many companies will use their tax savings to buy back shares and increase dividends, while others will look for increased capital spending or wage increases.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) announced on Thursday that it will raise entry-level wages for hourly employees, partly because of tax cuts. It also said it would lay off thousands of workers and close dozens of Sam's Club stores. 
The tax law was Trump's first major legislative achievement since he took office in January last year, and it slashes the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.
The tax package, approved despite the unanimous opposition of Democrats, helped drive stock market gains in the last months of 2017. The momentum has continued in 2018, and there are widespread expectations that investors will overlook fourth-quarter charges and focus on upbeat corporate outlooks.
""What you'll see is companies will take a one-time hit, but it's not going to have a bearing on stock price movements,"" said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York. ""They will talk about 2018, and we feel pretty confident it will be a win to a big win for U.S. companies.""
Estimates for 2018 S&P 500 earnings have risen more than 2 percentage points since the beginning of the year, partly due to analysts factoring in the impact of the tax code changes.
Profit growth for the year is forecast at 14.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, while analysts expect fourth-quarter earnings to have risen 11.8 percent from a year ago.
WINNERS IN ENERGY 
The energy sector is expected to post the biggest year-over-year gain in earnings. Estimates have risen in recent weeks following a surge in oil prices, which this week climbed to their highest level in three years.
In the short term, many companies are expected to take one-time charges against earnings because of the tax bill, which includes a one-time tax on an estimated $2.6 trillion in profits held offshore by multinationals.
Among early reporters, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said on Thursday that it was taking a one-time charge of $150 million on tax code changes. It said the new tax law would lower its tax rate to between 22 percent and 24 percent in 2018, and that it expects the tax cuts to help drive business demand. Delta's stock rose on Thursday, as did other airlines' shares.
Under the new law, companies with earnings parked offshore will face a one-time tax of 15.5 percent on cash and equivalents and 8 percent on illiquid assets, payable over eight years.
In the future, domestic corporate profits will be taxed at 21 percent, while most foreign profits will no longer be taxed, within some limits. The new law also allows companies to write off immediately the full value of new capital investments.
BANKS TO ADJUST 
Banks and other companies will need to remeasure the value of their deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new tax rate, a note from strategists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said.
For instance, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),, which will be the first big bank to give results when it reports on Friday, could show a 35 percent plunge in net income from a year earlier, based on analysts' estimates. 
Technology and healthcare companies are sitting on the largest stash of overseas cash and are expected to post the biggest charges related to the one-time repatriation tax, Goldman strategists wrote.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ""will incur the largest tax bill of any company under the provision, owing $33 billion on its $216 billion of overseas cash,"" they wrote.
As a group, the technology sector, which led the market's rally in 2017, is expected to benefit less from the tax rate cut than most other sectors, analysts said.

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>","Investors green-light infrastructure trade, but expect road bumps","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Volatility awaits shares of U.S. construction, engineering, building materials and other companies tied to infrastructure spending, but steel-nerved investors could be poised for gains if they weather a few bumps.
The stocks are set to be in focus in the coming weeks as President Donald Trump seeks legislation geared at overhauling the country's aging roads, bridges and other infrastructure, fresh off passage of a tax reform bill by his Republican party. 
A bipartisan group of U.S. senators met with administration officials this week to discuss legislation to spend $1 trillion to improve infrastructure.
An infusion of federal spending is expected to boost infrastructure-sensitive companies, but the stocks could see a rocky performance as a bill maneuvers through Congress and details of any legislation emerge.
Improving the country's infrastructure, which last year was given a failing grade by the American Society of Civil Engineers, has broad appeal. 
Still, while some Democrats want such a bill, political differences may undermine the effort and affect the amount of private sector investment.
Regardless of federal legislation, however, investors and analysts see a favorable climate for such stocks, including the need for an upgrade of national infrastructure, an expected spike in earnings for many companies this year, and positive economic trends that support investment in big projects.
“There is money flowing in this area even if you don’t get the big federal one,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina. ""That would just be icing on the cake if that happened and would really flow through to these stocks.”
INFRASTRUCTURE STOCKS SWING
Todd says his firm is overweight infrastructure-related names, including owning civil contractor Granite Construction Inc, building materials companies Eagle Materials Inc and US Concrete Inc and steel company  Nucor  Corp (NYSE:NUE).
Those shares and other construction-related names soared in the immediate aftermath of Trump's November 2016 election, spurred by his campaign vow to spend on infrastructure.
But while the benchmark S&P 500 stock index has been on a steady ascent since Trump's election, construction-related stocks in particular have endured a rollercoaster ride, whipsawed in part last year by uncertainty over Trump's agenda. 
Even with outsized gains over the past two months, the infrastructure trade has posted lukewarm returns since just after Trump's win. 
For example, since early December 2016, while the S&P 500 has surged more than 22 percent, the S&P 1500 construction and engineering index has climbed 9 percent, and the S&P 1500 steel index and the S&P 1500 construction materials group have each climbed about 5 percent.
""From a year-over-year standpoint, a lot of these names have not really done anything,"" Todd said.
At this relatively late point in the economic recovery, customers should be more comfortable making capital spending decisions on projects, according to analysts.
'LATE-CYCLE PLAY'
Engineering and construction companies “are a late-cycle industrial play, so we have just started to see the juice kick in for a lot of them,"" said Tahira Afzal, managing director at KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
""Even without an infrastructure stimulus or infrastructure bill, the next two years should be years in which the sector outperforms.”
Earnings for S&P 1500 engineering and construction (E&C) companies overall are projected to grow 27 percent in 2018, while construction materials companies could see a 32 percent jump, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares to a estimated 13.9 percent increase for the S&P 500, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
“The market is trading off of near-record earnings and the E&C companies aren’t at those record earnings yet as a group,” said John Rogers, founder of independent engineering and construction consulting firm JBR Advisory, LLC in Portland, Oregon.
Some optimism over an infrastructure bill may already be reflected in stock values. For example, Fluor and Jacobs Engineering shares have climbed 28 percent and 18 percent respectively, since the start of November, while U.S. Steel shares have jumped more than 50 percent.
While other factors could be fueling the gains, such as the tax-cut legislation or global economic momentum, these shares could pull back if the federal infrastructure package disappoints.
“You really have to take a longer-term perspective and just realize that if something does happen in Washington there will be a lot of two-steps-forward, one-step-back,” said Eric Marshall, portfolio manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management, which owns building materials stocks as well as equipment rental company  United Rentals  Inc (NYSE:URI) and contractor Primoris Services Corp.

“You can make a multi-year argument that there is pent-up demand for things like waterworks and roads and bridges and highways,” Marshall said.

1209,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 11:10PM ET</span>","U.S. Commerce Dept sends Trump steel probe findings, keeps details under wraps","By David Lawder and Eric Walsh
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Thursday said it sent President Donald Trump the results of its probe into whether steel imports threaten U.S. national security, but declined to reveal any details of its recommendations.
In a statement that offered no insight into the investigation's conclusions, the Commerce Department said Trump now has 90 days to decide ""on any potential action"".
The probe could lead to broad tariffs or import quotas.
White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement that Trump would announce his decision ""at the appropriate time.""
Trump opened the ""Section 232"" investigation in April. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross set an internal deadline of end-June for announcing his recommendations, but an announcement was delayed for a G20 summit and bilateral talks with China in July.
Trump said later in July that a final decision could wait until other top priority issues on his agenda were addressed, including healthcare and taxes.
The investigation was kept under wraps at the Commerce Department, but the agency faced a Monday statutory deadline to present its report to the White House. A similar national security probe into aluminum imports invoking the same Cold War-era trade law is due on Jan. 22.
""Although the report is not yet public, we believe that the investigation findings will confirm what domestic steelmakers already know. Imports of certain steel products to the United States should be restricted on national security grounds,"" said Philip Bell, president of the Steel Manufacturers Association.
In a statement, Bell called for ""broad, meaningful and impactful"" remedies that reduce the volumes of subsidized and dumped foreign steel products. 
Trump has promised he would take action to protect steelworkers from imports. But potential broad tariffs or quotas on steel and aluminum have been the subject of intense debate in the White House, among officials who favor more aggressive restrictions and pro-business factions that favor a more cautious approach to avoid a run-up in steel prices or disruptions to U.S. allies.
While forcing a reduction of excess production in China, which now supplies half the world's steel, is a key goal of any potential restrictions, broad tariffs would have a bigger impact on steelmakers in Europe, Japan, South Korea and Turkey.
Most direct steel imports from China are already blocked by previous product- and country-specific anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties.
But anticipation of restrictions after the steel probe was launched triggered a surge in steel imports in 2017, causing them to rise by about 18 percent through November compared with 2016, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.
Imports held about a 27 percent market share last year, helping to keep several U.S. steel mills idled and thousands of workers laid off. 
In August, senior executives from 25 U.S. steel and steel-related companies sent a letter to Trump asking for immediate import restrictions.
The executives from companies including  Nucor  Corp (N:NUE), U.S. Steel (N:X), ArcelorMittal (AS:MT) and Commercial Metals Co (N:CMC) said the sustained surge of steel imports into the United States had ""hollowed out"" much of the domestic steel industry and was threatening its ability to meet national security needs.
Critics charge that using national security to erect steel tariffs could trigger a trade war with China, undermine the global rules-based trading system and hurt U.S. allies more than China and damage global growth prospects.

1210,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 08:19PM ET</span>","Fiat Chrysler to invest $1 billion in Michigan plant, add 2,500 jobs","By Paul Lienert and Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) said on Thursday it will shift production of Ram heavy-duty pickup trucks from Mexico to Michigan in 2020, a move that lowers the risk to the automaker's profit should President Donald Trump pull the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Fiat Chrysler said it would create 2,500 jobs at a factory in Warren, Michigan, near Detroit and invest $1 billion in the facility. The Mexican plant will be ""repurposed to produce future commercial vehicles"" for sale global markets. Mexico has free trade agreements with numerous countries.
Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne a year ago raised the possibility that the automaker would move production of its heavy-duty pickups to the United States, saying U.S. tax and trade policy would influence the decision.
If the United States exits NAFTA, it could mean that automakers would pay a 25 percent duty on pickup trucks assembled in Mexico and shipped to the United States. About 90 percent of the Ram heavy-duty pickups made at Fiat Chrysler's Saltillo plant in Mexico are sold in the United States or Canada, company officials said.
Negotiators for the United States, Mexico and Canada are scheduled to meet later this month for another round of talks on revising NAFTA. Canadian government officials earlier this week said they are convinced that Trump intends to announce his intention to quit the agreement.
Trump has threatened to force the rollback of NAFTA, which enables the free flow of goods made in the United States, Canada and Mexico across the borders of those countries. He also has criticized automakers for moving jobs and investment in new manufacturing facilities to Mexico and prodded them to add more auto production in the United States.
On Wednesday, Toyota Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp announced they would build a new $1.6 billion joint venture auto assembly plant in Alabama, drawing praise from Trump.
Vice President Mike Pence praised Fiat Chrysler's announcement. ""Manufacturing is back. Great announcement. Proof that this admin’s AMERICA FIRST policies are WORKING!” Pence said in a Twitter posting.
Chrysler raised its output in Mexico by 39 percent in 2017 to 639,000 vehicles, according to Mexican government data. That made Fiat Chrysler the third-largest producer of vehicles in Mexico in 2017, after Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and General Motors Co (N:GM). 
The United States and Canada are the principal markets for full-size heavy-duty pickup trucks, most of which are produced in the United States by FCA, GM,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Nissan Motor Co (T:7201).
Miguel Ceballos, FCA spokesman for Mexico, said the company in 2018 and 2019 expects more growth in Mexico, and the moment it stops producing the Ram Heavy Duty pickups it will start to produce the new commercial vehicle, ""which still does not have a name,"" Ceballos said.
""It is going to be for global distribution, at the moment the Ram is only distributed at the level of NAFTA,"" he said. 
Ceballos said there was no current plan to either reduce or grow the workforce in Mexico.
GM has been readying a plant in Silao, Mexico, to build a new generation of large pickup trucks. 

FCA on Thursday said it also would make a special bonus payment of $2,000 to about 60,000 FCA hourly and salaried employees in the United States totaling about $120 million. Typically, U.S. automakers only pay bonuses to hourly workers as part of collective bargaining agreements.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI said on Thursday they would rename their Telecommunication Services Sector and add Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to the newly broadened category. 
In an overhaul of the Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, an industry taxonomy widely used by investors, the Telecommunication Services Sector will be expanded and renamed Communication Services, S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI said in a statement.
The new classification puts Facebook, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet - companies whose explosive growth has helped propel a stock-market rally - alongside traditional telecom players including AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ).
Indexes including the S&P 500 are a guide for trillions of dollars of capital worldwide, including index-tracking, exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Many of those funds track sector-specific indexes and could be affected by the GICS changes. 
S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI said in November 2017 they were planning changes to the categories and that they would be implemented after the close of business on Sept. 28, 2018. 
The updates are meant to reflect changes to industries resulting from technology and acquisitions.
Also moving to the newly named Communications Sector are  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP), both currently part of the Information Technology Sector.
Walt Disney Co and  DISH Network  Corp (NASDAQ:DISH), both currently in the Consumer Discretionary Sector, will also join the Communications Sector.

1214,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 07:03PM ET</span>",Corporations may dodge billions in U.S. taxes through new loophole: experts,"By David Morgan
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A loophole in the new U.S. tax law could allow multinational corporations like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to avoid paying billions of dollars in taxes on profits stashed overseas, according to experts.
Stemming from a Republican overhaul of international business taxes, the loophole involves the tax rates - 15.5 percent or 8 percent - that companies must pay on $2.6 trillion in profits they are holding abroad.
By manipulating their foreign cash positions, a determining factor under the new law, a U.S. multinational could potentially save money by shifting profits to the lower rate from the higher one, according to Stephen Shay, a senior lecturer at Harvard Law School.
The savings could amount to more than $4 billion in Apple's case alone, he said.
An Apple spokesman declined to speak on the record about Shay's analysis. U.S. Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service officials did not respond to Reuters' queries seeking comment.
""This is clearly the result of rushed legislation,"" said Shay, formerly a top Treasury Department tax official.
The sweeping Republican tax law was President Donald Trump's first major legislative triumph since he took office almost a year ago. Rushed through Congress, and approved over the unanimous opposition of Democrats, it took effect this month, delivering tax cuts and tax code changes that large, U.S.-based multinationals had sought for years.
One of those changes was a one-time tax break on about $2.6 trillion in profits that multinationals have socked away overseas in recent years under a ""deferral"" rule that let companies hold profits offshore tax-free, as long as the money was not brought into the United States, or repatriated.
There is no such deferral under the new law and accumulated overseas profits will now be taxed at either 15.5 percent for cash holdings or at 8 percent for more illiquid investments.
Both rates are far below the 35 percent rate that would have been charged on repatriated foreign profits before the law was passed, and below a new 21 percent corporate income tax rate.
To knock their taxes even lower, experts said, multinationals could have leeway to shift foreign earnings into the 8 percent tax bracket and out of the 15.5 percent bracket. 
""Even before the legislation was unveiled in November, multinationals were planning to convert cash to non-cash assets, although it wasn't entirely clear what would constitute cash for this purpose,"" said Reuven Avi-Yonah, a leading tax expert at the University of Michigan Law School.
The loophole that makes the bracket-shifting possible involves a formula for calculating how much foreign earnings are subject to the higher tax rate. The benchmark is a company's foreign cash position, calculated as the greater of either the average of the past two tax years, or the cash balance at the end of the last tax year begun before Jan. 1, 2018.
Companies would pay the 15.5 percent rate on sums up to the calculated foreign cash position. Anything over that would get the 8 percent rate. 
Shay said some multinationals could reduce their cash positions, and the amount of money subject to the higher rate, through legitimate distributions including dividend payments. 
He estimated Apple could have as much as $289 billion in foreign cash at the end of its current fiscal year on Sept. 30. Averaged across the last two tax years, the figure would be $234 billion.
To avoid paying 15.5 percent on the higher of those two figures, he said, Apple could distribute some of its cash through dividends or other means. Reducing its 2018 position by $55 billion to the lower, two-year average would save the company more than $4 billion in taxes, according to Shay. 

The new law says transactions meant principally to reduce taxes due on foreign profits can be disregarded by U.S. tax authorities. But tax experts said this anti-abuse measure does not apply automatically and that corporate tax lawyers could argue it does not apply to legitimate corporate actions.

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 06:32PM ET</span>",Grain glut leaves U.S. farmers facing losses from specialty corn,"By Michael Hirtzer
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. farmers who sought to boost revenues by planting corn used to make tortillas may be forced to sell their crops at a loss to makers of ethanol or animal feed because of a glut of what typically is a human food-grade product.
Oversupply of the most common grains such as corn and soybeans has spread to niche markets because so many farmers have switched to planting different strains of seed to diversify and bolster returns after four years of bumper crops cut farm income and pushed down prices for staple grains. 
White corn, which makes up roughly 1 percent of the 14.6 billion-bushel U.S. corn harvest, can command a premium of as much as $1 per bushel over the commoditized yellow strain. But premiums have shriveled to four-year lows - to as little as 5 cents above Chicago Board of Trade corn futures (Cc1).
Too many farmers planted white corn in states such as Illinois, Illinois, Kentucky and Nebraska. Corn prices in 2017 declined for the fifth straight year and record-large U.S. stocks pushed growers to look for potentially higher-value alternatives.
However, as acres devoted to varieties such as white corn, organic and non-genetically modified corn continue to rise, the benefits have shrunk for farmers switching to such strains.
White corn is used by companies such as the PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP) unit Frito-Lay to make corn chips, and by tortilla and chip makers including Chicago-based Azteca Foods. In South Africa, it is eaten as part of the breakfast staple pap and in Colombia and Venezuela in patties known as arepas.
Randy Anderson, who has planted white corn for 10 straight years in southern Illinois, said the market has become crowded. Local elevators, such as a  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG) facility that loads grain barges on the Ohio River, are buying white corn at prices that are below his cost of production.
""I feel like there could be a better bid in the near future,"" Anderson said, adding that he was holding out for another 20 cents per bushel to bring him closer to eking out a profit.
Premiums for white corn in the United States surged in 2015 and 2016 because of a drought-reduced South African harvest that led to increased U.S. exports and more demand from Mexico, which also shipped white corn to South Africa.
But with supplies in South Africa once again abundant following a record-large corn harvest, there is more global supply than demand. 
Anderson, who sold some white corn in 2016 at a 90-cent premium to CBOT futures, now can sell about 10 cents above futures. ""This year, we are getting the same price for white corn as yellow corn,"" he said.
CBOT March corn futures (CH8) settled a 1/4 cent lower at $3.48-3/4 per bushel, just above the contract's lifetime low of $3.46-3/4, reached in December.
Since the white corn growing region is centralized in a few U.S. states, the variety can be prone to more severe price fluctuations than the more widely grown yellow strain, Roger Theisen, specialty corn manager in DowDuPont Inc's (N:DWDP) agriculture division, said in an email.
""This means a single weather event can have a significant impact on white corn production in an area,"" he said.
DowDuPont has as much as a 90 percent market share of the global white corn seed market, according to industry sources. The company declined to comment on sales or market share but Theisen said, ""the total food corn market is growing.""
Exports of U.S. white corn through November of 1.48 million tonnes were down about 10 percent from 2016's corresponding total of 1.63 million tonnes, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. The value of those sales declined to $312 million, from $367 million in 2016. 
And there are signs that 2018 could see a further decline. South Africa is likely to return to its status as a net exporter, limiting demand for U.S. shipments, said Max Thomas-Olson, an analyst at Global Risk Management, which publishes the Orville Fisher White Corn Newsletter.
Ben Scholl, president of specialty grain buyer Lewis B. Osterbur and Associates, said many of his farmer clients are looking for places to sell their white corn.
""End users have all they need and there's more available to buy,"" Scholl said.
Reed White, a 56-year-old farmer in Sturgis, Kentucky, said this spring he will plant no white corn for the first time in recent memory. He was not able to secure a big enough contract to supply white corn to a local tortilla maker and will instead plant only yellow corn.
""If we could get a larger chunk of that business, we might consider growing for them,"" he said. 
Grain handler Andersons Inc (O:ANDE), a Frito-Lay supplier, said it has a waiting list for farmers interested in growing white corn or other specialty varieties for the company.

""It's not uncommon for farmers to wait two or three years,"" said Andy Vollmar, food and specialty ingredients director at Andersons.

INDIANAPOLIS (Reuters) - More than 200 workers clocked in for their final shifts on Thursday at Carrier Corp. in Indianapolis in the latest round of layoffs at a plant President Donald Trump toured in December 2016 to trumpet a deal to save jobs and prevent its closure.
Under pressure from the newly-elected Trump, Carrier and its parent company United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX), dropped its plan in late 2016 to close the plant and move 1,400 factory jobs to Mexico. In return, the company received $7 million in state tax breaks to stay in Indiana. 
Trump praised the deal, under which he said 1,100 jobs would be saved, as a model of how he would push American companies to keep jobs in the country. 
Trump did save hundreds of positions at Carrier, but manufacturing workers who now face unemployment say they feel let down by a deal that started out as a presidential campaign rallying cry but turned out to be less than it appeared.
Carrier said this week that 1,100 workers will remain at the factory, upholding its deal with Trump. They include 730 manufacturing jobs and about 300 engineering and administrative positions that were never slated to move.
But Carrier also laid off 338 manufacturing workers in July and another 215 this week. Those jobs are going to the company's plant in Monterrey, Mexico, where workers make about $3 an hour, according to Indiana union officials.
""Yes he (Trump) saved jobs, yes he did. But he didn't save mine, he didn't save manufacturing jobs. He saved office personnel, okay?"" said Renee Elliott, 45, who supported Trump in the 2016 election and was among those being laid off on Thursday.
Elliott began working at Carrier in 2013 as a seasonal employee making $13 per hour. She currently makes $18 per hour, taking advantage of overtime shifts, and sometimes works seven days a week. 
DISAPPOINTED BY DEAL
She does not know what she will do next and said she is disappointed that Trump did not make a better deal for factory-floor workers.
During his visit, Trump strode through the furnace factory, with TV cameras rolling, and shook hands with workers, telling them the deal with the company was ""very exciting.""
""Companies are not going to leave the United States any more without consequences. Not going to happen,"" Trump said.
Elliott said Trump's visit raised hopes among the entire workforce but it became clear later that some workers would lose their jobs anyway.
""It was like royalty coming here, we knew the world was watching,"" Elliott said. ""He's walking through and we're in awe, like 'Savior!'. That's the way we're looking at it. He led us to believe that we were all going to be saved.""
The White House said Trump's intervention in the case of Carrier was successful. 
""The President was proud that he was able to help save the jobs of 1,100 Americans from being shipped to Mexico by overseeing a deal between United Technologies and the state of Indiana,"" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement on Thursday.
The U.S. economy is growing steadily, unemployment is low at 4.1 percent and wages have started to rise. About 2.1 million new jobs were created in 2017 and 2.24 million in 2016 as one of the longest economic recoveries on record has pulled people back into the labor force.
Trump had repeatedly criticized Carrier during the presidential campaign as he pledged to rip up bad trade deals and save American jobs. And he put pressure on the company to change course after his election victory in November 2016. 
Carrier workers now question why their factory, which will continue making furnaces after fan coil operations move to Monterrey, was singled out by Trump when hundreds of steelworkers in Indiana are in a similar predicament.
United Technologies Electronic Controls, another United Technologies facility two hours away in Huntington, Indiana, is closing in 2018, also sending its operations to Monterrey. 
About 400 workers were laid off in 2017 and another 230 will be this year, a company spokeswoman said. 
Rexnord Corp., just down the road from Carrier, closed in November, laying off 300 workers represented by the same local steelworkers union as the Carrier employees. 
Trump wrote on Twitter shortly after touring Carrier that Rexnord, which also relocated operations to Mexico, was ""rather viciously firing"" its workers. ""This is happening all over our country. No more!"" Trump wrote.
""Don't get me wrong, me and the people here that work for Carrier are very grateful for it but when he was running during the election he stated that these things wouldn't happen anymore,"" said Robert James, president of the local United Steelworkers union. 
""How do you save 730 jobs at Carrier and not give a damn about the 700 jobs in Huntington? Both owned by the same company. Why would you leave them out of the equation?"" James asked.
Indiana's unemployment rate was 3.7 percent in November 2017, lower than the national rate of 4.1 percent.
But the U.S. steel industry, in particular, has struggled over the past decade.

Chuck Jones, the former president of the local United Steelworkers union, said that while some laid-off Rexnord and Carrier workers have been able to find comparable union jobs, others are in warehouse jobs paying about half the $25 per hour they used to make.

The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand, after the number of active drilling rigs fell last week.

(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc's energy unit on Thursday named William Fehrman as its new chief executive to replace Gregory Abel, who was promoted a day earlier to oversee more Berkshire units, and potentially succeed Warren Buffett.
Fehrman, 57, joined the energy unit, Berkshire Hathaway Energy Co, in 2006.
He had been chief executive of its MidAmerican Energy Co subsidiary, which provides electric and natural gas service in four Midwest U.S. states, and BHE Renewables, which builds wind and solar farms. Adam Wright, 40, a MidAmerican vice president, will become that unit's new chief executive.
Berkshire on Wednesday added Abel, 55, and Ajit Jain, 66, who oversees its reinsurance operations, to its board of directors, and gave them new oversight over its more than 90 business units. This confirmed expectations of many investors and analysts that Abel and Jain are the frontrunners to become Berkshire's chief executive whenever Buffett, 87, is no longer in charge. Berkshire Hathaway Energy is 90 percent-owned by Berkshire, and has in recent quarters generated roughly one-sixth of its Omaha, Nebraska-based parent's operating profit. This included $1.98 billion for the parent in the first nine months of 2017. The unit serves the central and western United States, Alberta, Canada and Britain, and operates HomeServices of America, the majority owner of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices and one of the largest U.S. residential real estate brokerages.
Fehrman, through a spokeswoman, had no comment.
Berkshire Hathaway Energy used to be called MidAmerican Energy but rebranded itself in 2014. 
It is one of several Berkshire units to take its parent's name, which is closely associated with Buffett, the world's third-richest person and one of its most admired investors.
Abel has used big acquisitions to help expand Berkshire Hathaway Energy, but had a setback last year when his $9 billion offer for Texas power transmission company Oncor was trumped by a higher bid from San Diego-based  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE). Berkshire Hathaway Energy has not disclosed Fehrman's expected compensation. Abel was awarded more than $58 million, mainly in incentive pay and bonuses, in 2015 and 2016.

Buffett typically receives less than $500,000 in annual compensation, including security to keep him safe, to run Berkshire.

1231,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 04:32PM ET</span>",Walmart wage hike may show wage pressures building for lowest paid,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart's tit-for-tat minimum wage battle with  Target , ratcheting to $11 an hour for the least experienced workers with likely pressure to move higher, may signal broader gains to come for workers in a tightening U.S. labor market - a moment politicians and policymakers have been hoping for.
There are still problems, labor economists note, with overall wage gains weaker than would be expected with a 4.1 percent unemployment rate, comparatively large numbers of people in part time jobs, and millions of prime age adults between 25 and 54 years old not even looking for work.
But the Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) announcement, its third boost in entry level wages in as many years, is a possible sign wage pressure is building in general, as gains filter down to the lowest-paid jobs and the least-educated workers.
""This may be evidence that we are starting to see the wage acceleration,"" that officials at organizations like the Federal Reserve have been anticipating as unemployment dropped to a 17 year low, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at the jobs website Indeed.
That, in turn, could boost U.S. economic growth overall and strengthen a U.S. inflation rate whose weakness has bedeviled the Fed for the last five years. 
Kolko noted that while overall wage increases were modest last year at around 2.5 percent, data through November showed that workers with only a high school degree got average raises of 3.6 percent, while hourly rates for less well-paid positions rose 3.1 percent. 
Wage increases at the lower end of the scale are typically a sign that labor markets are tight, said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
""When you get low unemployment rates, that affects lower-wage workers the most,"" Gould said. ""Slack is diminishing.""
Whether slack is fully gone, however, is another question, and one which policymakers at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere are struggling to understand.
Along with the headline unemployment rate, a broader measure of joblessness that includes discouraged workers who have largely stopped job-hunting, as well as those only able to find part-time jobs, stood at 8.1 percent at the end of 2017. That is comparable to the hot economy years before the 2007 to 2009 economic crisis.
The Fed's Beige Book research report in recent months has been filled with anecdotal stories, gathered by policymakers from the central bank's 12 regional branches, of entrepreneurs struggling to fill positions and of wage pressures building.
Even at 2.5 percent, current wage growth is ""likely to be greater than inflation, which means households would continue to enjoy gains in purchasing power,"" Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist with the Economic Outlook Group, wrote in a recent analysis.  
But the Fed isn't claiming victory yet. 
Job creation is expected to slow in coming months, as it inevitably does late in a recovery, with unemployment now well below the 4.6-percent level central bankers estimate the economy can sustain over the long run. 
Yet, participation rates for prime-age workers remain around three percentage points below their late 1990s peak, translating into around 3 million 25- to 54-year-olds who could be employed or looking for jobs. 
""We still have many months, if not a year or two, to get as tight we like,"" said Gould.
The Walmart announcement may also be a product of dynamics other than the demand and supply of labor. 
The company said it was merely passing along to workers some of the savings it will get from a cut in the corporate tax rate. 
But Target Corp (NYSE:TGT), a main competitor, pushed its entry level wage to $11 last fall and has pledged to hit $15 by the end of 2020.
In addition, states have been steadily raising the legal minimum wage, with 14 now at $10-an-hour or more as of this year.

California hit $11 on Jan. 1 and New York will move to $11.10 this summer. Wal-Mart employs around 130,000 people in the two states out of a U.S. workforce of 1.5 million, according to the company's website.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart will raise entry-level wages for U.S. hourly employees to $11 an hour in February as it benefits from last month's major overhaul of the U.S. tax code and competes for low wage workers in a tight labor market.
But on the same day, the world's largest retailer and private employer, officially called Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), announced layoffs as it shuttered many of its Sam's Club discount warehouse stores.
A senior company official who declined to be named said about 62 stores would be affected, about one tenth of the chain overall. 
About 50 stores will be shut permanently after a review of store profitability and up to 12 more stores will be shut and reopened as e-commerce warehouses, the person said.
Every Sam's Club store employs about 150 workers, bringing the total number of affected jobs to about 7,500, the person said. Many of them will be accommodated in new jobs at the newly opened warehouses and other stores, the official said.
Earlier on Thursday, Walmart announced the wage hike saying it would also offer a one-time cash bonus, based on length of service, of up to $1,000, and expand maternity and parental leave benefits.
The layoffs went unaddressed but the wage increase attracted praise from the White House. 
""Walmart is the largest employer in the country and to see them make that kind of effort to over a million workers is a big deal... and I think further evidence that the tax reform and tax cut package are having the impact that we had hoped,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Thursday.
U.S. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin also praised Walmart's decision to raise wages.
The timing of the store closure announcement hours after the wage hike drew some criticism.
""While pay raises are usually a good thing, this is nothing but another public relations stunt from Walmart to distract from the reality that they are laying off thousands of workers and the ones who remain will continue to receive low wages,"" said activist Randy Parraz, director of Making Change at Walmart, a United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW) affiliate.
The pay increase, Walmart's third minimum wage increase since 2015, and bonus will benefit more than 1 million U.S. hourly workers, the company said. 
The Walmart wage hike, taking minimum pay up from the current $10 an hour after in-house training, is aimed at helping the company attract workers at a time when the U.S. unemployment rate is at 4.1 percent, a 17-year low, making it harder to attract and retain minimum wage employees. 
Walmart is likely to save billions of dollars from the new tax law, which slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, and the wage hikes will cost the retailer only a fraction of those gains, analysts said.
""Given how low unemployment is, they would have had to hike wages anyway, the tax bill just made that move easier,"" said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarborough.
Rival retailer  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) raised its minimum wage to $11 in September, and said it would raise its minimum wage to $15 by 2020.
Walmart and Target's new minimum wage levels exceed the state minimum wage, in all but three states, according to a research note from financial services firm BTIG. Eighteen U.S. states increased their minimum wage on Jan.1 but the federal minimum wage has been $7.25 since 2009.
Walmart's announcement follows companies like AT&T Inc (NYSE:T),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, which have all promised more pay for workers since the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress passed the biggest overhaul to the U.S. tax code in 30 years. 

Shares of Walmart closed up 0.3 percent at $100.02.

FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Gucci-owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) plans to spin off German sports brand Puma (DE:PUMG) to the French conglomerate's shareholders to focus squarely on its luxury brands. 
Kering said on Thursday it planned to distribute 70 percent of Puma shares to its investors, leaving it with only a 16 percent stake, confirming an exclusive Reuters report.
Puma shares were down 4.4 percent at the close as some investors worried about the company losing a powerful backer. Kering stock was down almost 1 percent.
The deal comes after a recent turnaround at Puma, which struggled for years following Kering's 5.3 billion euros ($6.4 billion) purchase in 2007. 
The French firm, meanwhile, has long wanted to focus purely on its high-margin luxury business, where it rivals larger groups such as French conglomerate LVMH (PA:LVMH). 
""We found ourselves in a sort of imbalance, linked to the outperformance of the luxury sector,"" Kering's finance chief Jean-Marc Duplaix told journalists, adding the group would also look at options to shed its remaining sportswear label, Volcom. 
Kering is a little more than 40 percent controlled by France's Pinault family, which would receive about 29 percent of the sporting goods company, while Puma's free float would stand at about 55 percent. 
The French company was retaining a stake in Puma to reap some benefits from the brand's recovery, Duplaix said, as Kering will make no cash gains from the deal. 
The price of the transaction, which will be put to Kering shareholders in April at the group's annual meeting, has yet to be determined, he said. 
The disposal was likely to be a boost for Kering shares, analysts said. 
""The Puma divestiture materializing sooner - rather than later - will add oomph to the stock,"" Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst Luca Solca said in a note
PUMA TURNAROUND
Under Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden, appointed in 2013, Puma has refocused on its core sports business after sales were hurt by a shift into fashion products, ousting  Nike  as sponsor of English soccer club Arsenal.
A distant third in the global sportswear market behind Nike and Adidas, Puma has focused on the world's most popular sports, such as soccer, running and motorsport, and launched a new drive to tap into booming sales of women's sportswear by appointing singer Rihanna as creative director in 2014. 
Puma said it welcomed the transaction because it increases the company's free float - or freely tradable shares. It added the move would not affect its current strategy. 
Puma will likely now be a candidate for inclusion in Germany's mid-cap index (MDAXI), Duplaix said. 
The sports goods company is due to report full-year results on Feb. 12, having increased its profit guidance three times last year on the popularity of the collections designed by Rihanna, and shoes worn by Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt.
Like German rival Adidas (DE:ADSGn), Puma has enjoyed a revival in the United States as shoppers snap up its retro styles instead of basketball shoes, hurting Nike (N:NKE) and  Under Armour  (N:UAA).
Puma's shares have risen by 45 percent over the past year, bringing its market capitalization to 5.3 billion euros, back at the level at which Kering bought. 
Kering emerged as one of the big winners in a luxury goods revival last year as Chinese demand picked up, with a stellar turn at brand-of-the-moment Gucci helping earnings, and other labels such as Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga doing well.

1257,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 03:26PM ET</span>",British PM May tells bankers they are a priority for Brexit amid job warnings,"By Andrew MacAskill and Anjuli Davies
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May told bankers from firms such as Goldman Sachs on Thursday they were a priority for her in the Brexit talks, just as new warnings emerged of job losses in the London financial sector unless there is a trade deal.
May's comments contrast sharply with her stance before last year's election when she made a point of showing voters she wanted to break with what some considered an overly cozy relationship between big business and the government. 
""It was an encouraging, positive meeting,"" a banker briefed on the talks said. ""The whole point of the meeting was to say to us, look we know you feel we haven't prioritized you so far in the negotiations, but we will."" 
Last year, bankers complained that they were not being listened to by May's government as Britain prepared to leave the European Union, which is due to happen in March 2019.
As May plots Britain's course for Brexit, London's vast financial services industry is scrambling to prepare for losing access to the world's biggest trading bloc, the City of London's biggest challenge since at least the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
May met in Downing Street with some of Europe's most powerful financiers including Mark Tucker, the HSBC (L:HSBA) chairman, Axel Weber, the UBS (S:UBSG) chairman, and Richard Gnodde, chief executive of Goldman Sachs International (N:GS). 
The meeting focused on Brexit, how to make Britain a more attractive place for financial services and how to rein in executive pay, three people briefed on the talks said.
 Barclays  (L:BARC) chief executive Jes Staley told May that Britain's tax regime is uncompetitive and more could be done to make it more attractive, sources said.
A spokesman for May said the executives asked for more clarity on the future relationship between Britain and EU and the prime minister asked them to emphasize the benefit of preserving London's position as Europe' financial center. 
""LOST DECADE""
The meeting came after London Mayor Sadiq Khan warned that Britain would be shunted into a ""lost decade"" of low investment and shed almost 500,000 jobs if it fails to agree a trade deal with the EU.
Khan cited research from the Cambridge Econometrics consultancy which showed that in a no-deal scenario, the industry that fares the worst will be financial and professional services, with as many as 119,000 fewer jobs nationwide.
Hours earlier recruitment firm Morgan McKinley said Brexit was the main reason for a 37 percent drop in new jobs available in London's financial sector last month.
London vies with New York as the world's financial capital. By far the biggest EU financial center, London dominates the $5.1-trillion-a-day global foreign exchange market and hosts more banks than any other center.
But other EU capitals see Brexit as an opportunity to grab business from London. The EU has already proposed that clearing of euro-denominated derivatives, done mainly in London, could move to the euro zone without a comprehensive Brexit deal.
A stand-off between Britain and the EU over future access to the single market for London's financial services industry is shaping up to be one of the key Brexit battlegrounds before Britain is due to leave the bloc in March 2019.
A FAREWELL TO LONDON? 
Many banks, insurers and other financial firms are enacting contingency plans to shift parts of their European operations to the continent because they are likely to lose the right to sell their products freely within the bloc from London.
Bloomberg reported that Germany would demand Britain pay for financial firms to have access to the EU market after Brexit, though EU officials said Britain would not be able to cherry pick its post-Brexit relationship.

A spokesman for May on Thursday said Britain will not pay for market access.

(Reuters) - Wall Street surged to record highs on Thursday as rising oil prices lifted energy stocks and investors bet on a strong U.S. corporate earnings season. 
The S&P energy sector jumped more than 2 percent as Brent crude (LCOc1) rose above $70 a barrel for the first time since December 2014, boosted by a surprise drop in U.S. production and lower crude inventories. [O/R]
The industrial index was helped by airlines after an upbeat forecast from No. 2 U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines (N:DAL).
""The unifying factor of today's move and this whole week is a heightened confidence in the pace of economic activity. That helps explain the demand picture which has oil up at $70,"" said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, in New York. 
At 2:51 p.m., the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 138.1 points, or 0.54 percent, to 25,507.23, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 13.76 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,761.99, and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 43.16 points, or 0.6 percent, to 7,196.73.
Wall Street had dropped on Wednesday, the first daily declines in 2018 following a report that China would slow U.S. government bond purchases and a report that U.S. President Donald Trump would end a key trade agreement.
Investors were expecting bullish quarterly earnings reports from the biggest U.S. companies and were hoping for some details on expected savings from the new federal tax code. The reporting season kicks off in earnest on Friday, with results from the big U.S. banks JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC).
Earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to have increased by 11.8 percent in the recently ended quarter, with the biggest gain from the energy sector, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""This market feels this week like a deep breath before the onslaught of earnings reports,"" Clemons said. ""This is a wait-and-see mode with a healthy amount of optimism."" 
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) shares rose as much as 5.96 percent after the company predicted a double benefit from the U.S. corporate tax cut - savings on its own bill and an uptick in business travel as it expects companies to spend tax savings. It also reported an upbeat quarterly profit.
Delta helped the Dow Jones U.S. Airlines index (DJUSAR) rise about 5 percent. The Dow Jones Transport index (DJT) was up 2.3 percent, on track for its biggest one-day percentage gain since Nov. 29. 
""You see this continued rotation into stocks that will accelerate with the economy,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. 
Xerox shares (N:XRX) jumped about 5 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the copier maker was in deal talks with Japanese camera maker Fujifilm Holdings (T:4901) that could include a change in control of Xerox.
Investors shrugged off data that showed U.S. producer prices fell for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years in December and weekly jobless claims increased for a fourth straight week to a more than three-month high.

WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - The fuel economy of new U.S. cars and trucks hit a record 24.7 miles per gallon in the 2016 model year, a government report said, even as some automakers had to buy credits to meet federal requirements.
Fuel economy rose by just 0.1 mile per gallon in 2016 and was projected in the 2017 model year to hit another record of 25.2 mpg, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said in a report. 
Regulators have been considering whether to revise fuel efficiency requirements. Last March, President Donald Trump ordered a review of tough U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards put in place by the Obama administration, but states like California have pushed back against this decision.
Low oil prices have encouraged Americans to shift away from smaller passenger cars to trucks and SUVs. This has led automakers to worry that rising fuel efficiency requirements through 2025 may be too stringent, but environmentalists say automakers must make vehicles more efficient.
Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, said in a statement that the 2016 fuel economy improvement fell well short of the 1 mile per gallon that the Obama-era rules called for.
The automakers ""have the technology to improve mileage,"" Becker said. ""The standards need to be strengthened, not weakened."" 
The report said that after running surpluses in meeting greenhouse gas emission limits, automakers ran a 9 gram per mile deficit. The EPA said all major automakers still comply with the standards, with some using credits banked from prior years to meet the requirements.
Two automakers -- Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover -- have emission deficits, but they have three years to come into compliance. Neither automaker responded to a request for comment.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV had the biggest deficit, falling 28 grams per mile short. But the company had credits banked to meet the requirements.
The company purchased nearly 2.5 million megagrams of emissions credits in 2016 from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, the EPA said. A megagram is equal to 1,000 kilograms and is calculated on emissions saved over legal requirements.
The government does not disclose how much automakers pay for credits. Since 2010, Fiat Chrysler has purchased 22 million megagrams of credits from other automakers, including nearly 6 million from Tesla.
Mazda Motor Corp led the industry in average fuel economy at 29.6 mpg in 2016, but Honda Motor Co is projected to surpass Mazda as the leader in 2017. 
""We are confident that our future engineering developments on internal combustion engines... will reinforce our leadership position as the fuel economy champion,"" Mazda said in a statement.
Detroit's Big Three automakers -- including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co -- had the least fuel-efficient fleets overall. They sell a larger share than their foreign rivals do of pickup trucks and SUVs, which generate much larger profit margins than passenger cars.
A GM spokesman said that despite the market shift away from passenger cars, the company's fuel economy was improving, in part because of rising miles per gallon among trucks and SUVs, coupled with sales of electric vehicles. 
According to the EPA, GM's fuel economy rose to 23 miles per gallon in 2017, from 22.4 miles in 2016 and 22.2 in 2015.
Fiat Chrysler technically had the worst record, but the EPA said data for that automaker and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) were preliminary pending completion of investigations and corrective actions.
The U.S. government filed a civil lawsuit last May accusing Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV of illegally using software to bypass emission controls in 104,000 diesel vehicles sold since 2014.
VW has struggled to draw a line under its diesel emissions test cheating scandal, which broke in the United States in 2015 and which has cost the automaker as much as $30 billion.

The EPA report measures real world fuel economy, which is less than the values listed on new vehicle window stickers.

(Reuters) - Sam's Club, a unit of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (N:WMT), said it had closed a series of stores following a review, the membership-only store chain said in a tweet on Thursday.
Business Insider, citing Wal-Mart, reported that Sam's Club was closing 63 stores and laying off thousands of workers. (http://read.bi/2qYH8bE)
Sam'S Club's tweet comes after local news outlets in Arizona, Alaska, Texas, New Jersey, Indiana and New York reported that some Sam's Club stores closed abruptly on Thursday, with employees learning of the move as they arrived for work. ""Closing clubs is never easy and we're committed to working with impacted members and associates through this transition,"" Sam's Club said on Twitter. Sam's Club was not immediately available for comment. Earlier in the day, Wal-Mart said it would raise entry-level wages for U.S. hourly employees to $11 an hour in February as it benefits from last month's major overhaul of the U.S. tax code. Sam's Club said pharmacies at the closed locations would stay open for at least two weeks and the company would work with the respective state's Board of Pharmacy to help customers with the transition. 
Wal-Mart's shares were up 0.5 percent in afternoon trading, while shares of Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST), which competes with Sam's Club, were up 2.7 percent.

(Reuters) - Tivo Corp (O:TIVO) has again sued cable operator Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) of using its patented interactive programing technology without authorization, the latest salvo in the companies' long-running royalty dispute.
Tivo filed lawsuits in Boston and Los Angeles on Wednesday, saying Comcast's X1 video recording system infringed on patents describing functionality like pausing and resuming shows on different devices and restarting live programing in progress.
A pioneer in digital video recording technology, Tivo said on Thursday that it also planned to sue Comcast at the U.S. International Trade Commission, a government agency that can hear patent disputes and ban infringing products from entering the country.
Comcast said in a statement that it independently created its X1 products and that it would aggressively defend itself against the lawsuits, calling them an attempt by Tivo to make money from an ""aging and increasingly obsolete patent portfolio.""
Tivo subsidiary Rovi Corp sued Comcast in federal court in Texas and at the ITC in April 2016 after the cable operator declined to renew a long-standing agreement to license the company's patents. That deal, reached 13 years ago and valued at $250 million, expired in March 2016, according to a Tivo court filing.
The ITC ruled in November that Comcast's X1 platform infringed on two Tivo patents describing a system for s`1cheduling recordings through a smartphone app. The agency said four other Tivo patents were not infringed.
Comcast said it would remove the scheduling feature, which only a small percentage of customers used, so it could continue to offer X1 to customers while it appealed the ITC's ruling.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Sterling Auty said in a November research note that the ruling could prompt Comcast to resolve the lawsuits through a new licensing agreement.
San Carlos, California-based Tivo was one of the first DVR makers but in recent years has focused on licensing its patent portfolio.

The patents at issue in Wednesday's lawsuits were originally granted to Rovi, a provider of digital television guides that merged with Tivo in 2016, and its Andover, Massachusetts-based subsidiary Veveo Inc.

1273,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 01:29PM ET</span>","Delta sees double benefit from tax cut, shares rise","By Alana Wise and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) is anticipating a double benefit from the U.S. corporate tax cut this year as it saves money on its own bill and expects an uptick in business travel as companies use tax savings to invest in generating new business.
""We're very excited about the potential for increased business demand with the tax cuts,"" Delta President Glen Hauenstein told analysts in a conference call after quarterly earnings on Thursday. 
""We haven't seen that materialize yet, but we expect that to materialize in the first quarter.""
The No. 2 U.S. carrier reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by higher business fares and a busy holiday travel season, and forecast even better performance this quarter as demand for travel remains strong across the board.
Its shares rose 2.7 percent to $57.37 on the New York Stock Exchange, helping the NYSE Arca airline index (XAL) up 2.3 percent, on track for its best day since Nov. 29. 
Atlanta-based Delta forecast total unit revenue, a measurement closely watched by investors, to increase by 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent in the first quarter of 2018, not including any benefit from increased travel that may result from the tax cut. 
In December, U.S. Congress passed a sweeping tax law designed to kick-start economic growth that slashed the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. 
Several U.S. companies have already said they will make more investments in their businesses and raise pay or bonuses for workers because of the new tax law, both of which could lead to an uptick in air travel.
Delta said on Thursday the law would cut its own tax rate to between 22 percent and 24 percent in 2018. Partly due to those savings, Delta raised its full-year profit outlook to between $6.35 and $6.70 per share, well ahead of Wall Street estimates.
Delta said it would not use tax savings to pay any U.S. tariffs slapped on its order of 75 CSeries jets from Canadian planemaker  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) as a result of an unresolved trade spat. A ruling on the matter is expected later this month.
FIRST OUT OF THE GATE
Delta is the first to report earnings after a broadly positive quarter, where airlines managed to hike fares to partially offset growth in fuel prices and other costs. 
Earlier this week United Airlines (N:UAL) and American Airlines (O:AAL) forecast higher unit revenue, followed by JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) on Thursday. 
Delta's quarterly net profit fell as it took a combined hit of $60 million from December's power outage at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Airport and Winter Storm Benji. It also took a one-time charge of $150 million due to the tax code change.
Including those items, Delta's fourth-quarter net income dipped to $572 million, or 80 cents per share, compared with $622 million, or 84 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding the tax charge and other one-time items, Delta earned 96 cents per share, above the average 88 cents per share expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Total operating revenue rose 8.3 percent to $10.25 billion from $9.46 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $10.13 billion.
""Stronger than expected revenues, good unit revenue momentum and raised 2018 guidance aided by benefits of tax reform would be the major takeaways,"" said CFRA Research analyst Jim Corridore on the increase in Delta shares.

Year over year, Delta's costs, excluding fuel and special items, increased 5.6 percent, driven by higher labor expenses and accelerated depreciation from aircraft retirements.

As part of the arrangement, MoneyGram will test the use of Ripple's cryptocurrency, XRP, to move funds in a faster and cheaper way.
Ripple, created by the founder of bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, has risen 31,000 percent over the past year, overshadowing bitcoin's 1,200 percent increase.
XRP rose 13 percent to $13.38 on Thursday, according to coinmarketcap.com.
Many see it as a close contender to bitcoin, which is by far the biggest cryptocurrency with a market value of more than $250 billion. (http://reut.rs/2D0S11W)
XRP allows banks and payment companies to send money quickly, no matter the location. Its transaction fee, at just ""fractions of a penny"", is also comparable to bitcoin's $30 per transaction fee.
Several companies such as UBS (S:UBSG) and Santander (MC:SAN) already use Ripple's products to enable payments. In November 2017,  American Express  Co (N:AXP) also launched an instant blockchain-based payment system using Ripple.

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 10:54AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Lufthansa CEO calls for significant Alitalia cuts - letter,"By Ilona Wissenbach
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) sees a need for significant restructuring at Italy's Alitalia before the German group would be prepared to buy the airline, Lufthansa's chief executive said in a letter seen by Reuters, tempering expectations for a quick deal.
""While recognizing the valuable measures that have been undertaken to date... we strongly believe that there remains a considerable amount of work to be achieved before Lufthansa would be in the position to enter comprehensively into the next phase of the process,"" Carsten Spohr said in the letter to Italian Industry Minister Carlo Calenda on Thursday.
He said a restructured ""NewAlitalia"" would be smaller in terms of both staff and its fleet.
Alitalia, which has made a profit only a few times in its 70-year history, was put under special administration last year after staff rejected a plan to cut jobs and salaries.
There was no immediate response from the Italian ministry or the airline itself.
Alitalia has around 9,200 full-time staff, plus a further 1,600 in a state-backed temporary layoff scheme. Any permanent job cuts would be particularly sensitive ahead of a national election in March. 
Italy has said it aims to strike a deal before the election, and a person familiar with the matter has said the commissioners managing Alitalia were hoping to agree exclusive talks within the coming days.
Lufthansa, British low-cost carrier easyJet (L:EZJ) and U.S. private equity fund Cerberus are among companies that have expressed an interest in Alitalia.
A source close to the matter had told Reuters in November that Lufthansa had offered 250 million euros ($300 million) to take on most of Alitalia's fleet of aircraft and half of its staff.
Lufthansa had offered to keep around 90 to 100 Alitalia planes, down from a fleet of 123. It is not interested in Alitalia's ground handling services.
Alitalia was once a symbol of Italy's post-war economic boom but is now struggling to compete against low-cost carriers and high speed trains at home. It has not invested sufficiently in higher-margin long-haul routes to get back to profit.
Rome has ruled out renationalising Alitalia, but the fate of the airline remains politically sensitive and any tough restructuring to suit a foreign investor would rankle - especially if it involved thousands of job cuts.
Spohr said in the letter to Calenda that he saw ""considerable merit"" in developing the opportunity to add Alitalia to Lufthansa's stable of airlines but that the German group was not in position to play a leading role in the Italian company's restructuring.
""We therefore strongly recommend and indeed encourage the commissioners to start implementing key restructuring measures which would be common and beneficial to all prospective bidders,"" he said.

Lufthansa surpassed Ryanair last year to retake the crown as Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers.

1301,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",U.S. says Vietnam should have notified eight state firms to WTO,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States has notified the World Trade Organization of eight Vietnamese firms it says should have been registered as state trading enterprises under the global trading rules, a U.S. filing published by the WTO showed on Thursday.
The United States said it was notifying the WTO on Vietnam's behalf, a so-called ""counter-notification"", because Vietnam had failed to do so. 
Washington has previously taken similar steps to flag Chinese companies that it suspects are competing unfairly because of their government connections. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has vowed to toughen up on transparency at the WTO.
The U.S. filing named oil firm PetroVietnam and its subsidiary PV Oil, as well as fuel importer Petrolimex (HN:PVX) and jet fuel supplier Vietnam Air Petrol Company (Vinapco/SKYPEC) as firms that should be declared under the WTO rules on state trading enterprises.
The list also included the Northern Food Corporation and Southern Food Corporation, known as Vinafood I and Vinafood II, Saigon Jewelry Company Limited and the mining group Vietnam National Coal and Mineral Industries Group (Vinacomin).
Vietnam joined the WTO exactly 11 years ago, on Jan 11, 2007, and followed in China's footsteps by transforming its economy on the back of cheap labor and export-led growth.
It notified the WTO of two state trading enterprises in April 2016, prompting the United States to ask about other companies. 
Last October, Vietnam replied that most of its former state enterprises had been equitised and operated under market economy conditions, without their previous preferential privileges. 
""Shortly after Vietnam's response, the United States independently-researched Vietnam's claims and, based on publicly-available information, has determined that there appear to be a number of entities that Vietnam failed to identify as STEs,"" the U.S. filing said. 
Vietnam is divesting hundreds of state-owned enterprises, partly because of the need to fund a budget deficit and amid growing public debt, but progress has been slow. 

It has accelerated its plans, and began this year by announcing that it would privatize almost half of Vinafood II, Vietnam's main rice exporter, raising about $100 million, within three months.

1313,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Saudi state taking control of Binladin construction giant - sources,"By Stephen Kalin, Tom Arnold and Reem Shamseddine
RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is taking managerial control of Saudi Binladin Group and discussing a possible transfer of some of the giant construction group's assets to the state while its chairman and other family members are in detention, sources told Reuters. 
Binladin, which had over 100,000 employees at its height, is the biggest builder in the country and important to Riyadh's plans for large real estate, industrial and tourism projects to help diversify the economy beyond oil.
However, the group has been hurt financially in the past couple of years by a slump in the construction industry and a temporary exclusion from new state contracts after a crane accident killed 107 people at Mecca's Grand Mosque in 2015. It was forced to lay off thousands of employees.
Riyadh's move to take control appears aimed at ensuring the group can continue to serve Saudi Arabia's development plans, said banking and industry sources, who declined to be named due to the political and commercial sensitivity of the matter.
The government detained scores of senior officials and businessmen in October as part of a sweeping crackdown on corruption. The Binladin group's chairman Bakr Bin Laden and several family members have been held, the sources said.
Saudi officials are trying to negotiate settlements with detainees, saying they aim to claw back some $100 billion of funds that rightfully belong to the state. The talks on Binladin's future are part of this effort, the sources said.
Since the detention of Bin Laden family members, the finance ministry has formed a five-member committee, including three government representatives, to oversee the group's business and handle relations with suppliers and contractors, the sources said. 
Binladin executives did not respond to phone calls seeking comment. Finance ministry officials and the government media office also did not respond to requests for comment.
SETTING A PRECEDENT? 
Although ownership of Binladin currently remains with the family, the group is in negotiations with the government about the potential transfer of some assets to the state, or possibly reducing or eliminating the government's outstanding debts to Binladin, the sources said.
One banking source with detailed knowledge of the group said the debt might total around $30 billion - the legacy of a period about 18 months ago when the government held off from settling many of its debts as its finances were hurt by low oil prices.
It is not clear whether the government's handling of Binladin may set a precedent for the cases of other businessmen detained in the corruption purge. 
They include one of the kingdom's most prominent businessmen, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who is chairman and owner of global investment firm  Kingdom  Holding (SE:4280).
Because of Binladin's strategic importance to the construction industry and development projects, as well as its financial struggle, it may be treated differently from the assets of other detained suspects.
The new management committee's government representatives include Abdulrehman al-Harkan, a former chief executive of Saudi property company Dar Al Arkan, and Khaled Nahas, a board member of petrochemical producer Saudi Basic Industries Corp, the sources said. There are also two family members on the committee: Yehia Bin Laden and Abdullah Bin Laden.
Previously, the family was in total control of the group, with Bakr Bin Laden taking most decisions, the sources said.

Although Osama Bin Laden, the founder of al-Qaeda who was killed by U.S. forces in 2011, was part of the same family, the company did not have any ties to him.

SHANGHAI/PARIS (Reuters) - A deal long sought by French company Areva to build a $12-billion nuclear waste reprocessing plant in China looks increasingly unlikely to go ahead despite a visit to Beijing by President Emmanuel Macron meant to drum up business.
During Macron's state visit this week, Areva and China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC) signed a new ""protocol agreement"" to build the plant but, not for the first time, no definitive contract was signed. 
Since talks began more than a decade ago - when uranium prices (UXXc1) were near record highs - a series of non-committal French-Chinese memorandums of understanding have been signed for building a reprocessing plant in China modeled on state-owned Areva's plant in La Hague, northern France.
The reprocessing of nuclear fuel waste involves separating plutonium from the spent uranium and reusing it in ""Mixed Oxide"" (MOX) fuel at nuclear power stations. 
But the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster and competition from renewable energy are weighing on the nuclear sector, and uranium prices are down 80 percent from a decade ago, making the expensive and dangerous recycling process less attractive. 
Chinese nuclear scientist Li Ning, dean of Xiamen University's College of Energy and a member of State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation's (SNPTC) expert committee, sees ""a fairly low probability"" that China will sign a formal contract for the project.
""In China, no new reactor projects have been approved for two years, a reflection of overcapacity of power from other sources and concerns about nuclear power, so the urgency of this (reprocessing) plant isn't strong,"" he told Reuters. 
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday Paris had been given assurances that a contract would be signed this spring. 
But French ministers and Areva executives have made similar comments before. In November 2007, former CEO Anne Lauvergeon said Areva could be building a reprocessing plant in China in two-to-three years ""but we will not sign the contract today"".
In a statement on Wednesday, CNNC spoke of ""deepening Chinese-French nuclear cooperation"" but did not even mention spent fuel or reprocessing. Areva CEO Philippe Knoche said he hoped to finalize the deal and start the project this year. 
Without a site for the plant, that could be difficult. 
In 2016, China suspended preliminary work on a possible site in the city of Lianyungang, about 500 km (312 miles) north of Shanghai, following protests by local residents.
An industry source, who has discussed the matter with CNNC, said that with China no closer to selecting the location, it is unlikely a contract will be signed any time soon.  
""Time is playing against Areva, and most people in the industry are skeptical. What's the hurry?"" he said. 
Le Maire said talks with the Chinese were extraordinarily difficult and that France had ""made an effort"" on the price to try to unblock negotiations. He said the deal would be worth 10 billion euros ($12 billion). Ten years ago, Lauvergeon spoke of 15 billion. 
SAVIOUR
Le Maire also said a contract for a reprocessing plant would ""save"" the French nuclear industry. After years of losses wiped out its equity, Areva had to sell its nuclear reactor arm to utility EDF (PA:EDF), and the state last year provided 4.5 billion euros to recapitalizes the firm. 
A contract for a reprocessing plant would be a major boost for uranium mining and nuclear fuel group New Areva, whose margins are under pressure from the uranium glut. But it still appears to be a long shot. 
""The Chinese government and Chinese industry are not in the business of saving Areva,"" Xiamen University's Li said.
He said China was likely to consider alternative solutions for nuclear waste, including dry cask storage.
Reprocessing nuclear fuel requires highly secure, capital-intensive installations that take a decade or more to build. Nuclear industry analyst Mycle Schneider said reprocessing can cost up to 10 times more than enriching uranium for fuel. 
Critics say that when uranium is scarce, reprocessing can make sense, although using plutonium creates proliferation and security risks. The alternative is to store spent fuel in ponds next to the reactors and to put it in central repositories, often underground, once it has cooled sufficiently. 
The United States has given up on reprocessing, while Britain is phasing out nuclear fuel recycling and the Rokkasho reprocessing plant in northern Japan, built with Areva's help, has struggled to start up after years of technical problems. 
Besides France, Russia is the only country that reprocesses fuel, which it uses in two breeder reactors. Such reactor models are highly suited for the fuel but have been abandoned in most other nuclear nations.

""It makes no sense to do something as exorbitantly expensive as reprocessing when there is plenty of fresh natural uranium out there,"" Schneider said.

German born Plein started out in furniture design in the late 1990s and eventually switched to fashion, earning the name ""King of Bling"" in the media for his eccentric designs. Celebrities such as Lindsay Lohan and Fergie have featured in his advertising campaigns.
""At the end of 2017, we found out that he had started the new Plein-Sport line in which he reproduced this particular cat on t-shirts, hoodies, shoes and so on,"" Puma's head of intellectual property, Neil Narriman, said.
Some of Plein's clothes on the website feature a tiger's head while others are adorned with a leaping tiger. Narriman said there are also other design features similar to Puma's.
The temporary injunction from a regional court in Duesseldorf prevents Plein's online store selling in Germany where Puma is based, Narriman said.
Plein's company, based in Lugano, Switzerland, was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
But in a posting on social media platform Instagram on Thursday, Plein announced a campaign offering customers a discount on Plein-Sport branded products in exchange for their used Puma shoes, using the slogan: ""Don't be a puma, be a tiger"".
He also told German daily Bild: ""I really cannot see any similarity between the jumping kitty cat of (Puma) and our Plein-Sport tiger. We have done nothing wrong.""
The court in Duesseldorf said it could not confirm it had issued an injunction because such information was generally not made public.
Puma's Narriman said the company had also obtained a court order against Plein similar to an injunction in the Netherlands and was prepared to take legal measures in other countries as well if necessary.
""But our whole purpose is not to fight for the sake of it... We want to find a resolution to this matter and not escalate,"" Narriman said.
So far, he said Puma had not received any direct response from Plein. The next step is for the court in Duesseldorf to schedule a hearing after giving Plein a chance to respond to Puma's allegations.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England has proposed easing the burden of European Union capital rules for insurers, but the industry urged the regulator to go further and meet calls from British lawmakers for more radical change.
The BoE's  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (PRA), which supervises banks and insurers, published a consultation paper to lighten some reporting requirements under the bloc's Solvency II rules.
The PRA said the proposed changes take into account recommendations for reform made by the Association of British Insurers (ABI), and by parliament's Treasury Select Committee.
""The PRA believes that these proposals would, in particular, reduce the reporting burden for smaller firms,"" the watchdog said in its consultation paper.
Solvency II came into force in January 2016 and was the PRA's single biggest regulatory task at the time. The ABI has called for several changes and has found backing from UK lawmakers.
The TSC said in a report last October that the BoE and insurers must find common ground over proposed tweaks to keep the 1.9 trillion pound sector in Britain competitive after the UK leaves the EU in 2019.
The PRA is too focused on capital levels and not enough on allowing insurers to compete, the TSC said.
Lawmakers want the PRA to urgently ease the ""risk margin"", an add-on capital requirement to cover what a third party would need to safeguard policies if an insurer goes bust.
But PRA Chief Executive Sam Woods has so far resisted making unilateral changes to the risk margin, and hopes that the EU would step in before Brexit to change the risk margin have faded.
Woods is expected to respond to the TSC report when he addresses the ABI's annual conference on Feb. 27.
The ABI said the PRA's proposals were a ""step in the right direction"" after Solvency II increased reporting requirements by four to eight times compared with previous rules.

""There still remains plenty of opportunity for the PRA to go further to ensure our insurance industry is able to fulfill a vital role in helping Britain thrive post-Brexit,"" said Steven Findlay, the ABI's head of prudential regulation.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's financial markets watchdog criticized top credit rating agencies like S&P Global (N:SPGI), Moody's (N:MCO) and Fitch on Thursday, saying they were not providing enough clarity on the fees they charge.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said it was sometimes unable to understand the key elements of agencies' fee 'schedules' and why they sometimes deviated from them or increased or cut their prices.
""ESMA has found that there are areas for significant improvement by both credit rating agencies (CRA) and trade repositories (TR) in their current fee practices,"" ESMA's chairman Steven Maijoor said.
He added the Paris-based watchdog would give ""supervisory priority to the issues identified"".
It wants them to provide clearer explanations and transparency on the fee-setting process as well as how sister companies that provide supplementary ratings-related services, such as bulk provision of ratings data, set their prices.
ESMA said there was no apparent link between the fees that were charged and the costs involved in actually calculating and providing the rating.
In some cases there had also been triple-digit price hikes by the affiliated companies with little obvious explanation.
""The ultimate aim is to ensure that customers know exactly what they are paying for,"" Maijoor said.
ESMA added it could provide agencies with ""further supervisory guidance to ensure compliance with the relevant requirements"".
The work so far has ESMA taken just over a year but it expects firms to start taking action to address its concerns this year and for it to continue next year.

1346,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Spain international tourism breaks records for fifth straight year,"MADRID (Reuters) - The number of international tourists visiting Spain broke records for a fifth straight year in 2017, despite Islamist militant attacks in Catalonia and political uncertainty over its independence movement, government statistics showed.
Spain, where tourism accounts for around 11 percent of the economy, has seen a surge in international visitors partly due to security concerns in other popular holiday destinations such as Egypt and Turkey.
Preliminary data released late on Wednesday showed the number of visitors arriving in Spain rose 8.9 percent year-on- year to 82 million tourists, which would make Spain the world's second most visited country after France and push the United States into third place.
Figures showed that tourist spending also hit a new record in 2017, rising 12.4 percent in the year from 2016.
According to final data for the first 11 months of 2017, also released on Wednesday, British tourists remained Spain's largest group of visitors by nationality, accounting for 18 millions tourists, up 7 percent from a year earlier.
Catalonia remained Spain's most visited region in 2017, despite two attacks at major tourist haunts in August which left 16 people dead and more than 100 people injured.
Tourism in the region's capital Barcelona dipped slightly after the attacks, then dropped again in October after an illegal independence vote prompted scenes of police violence and mass protests, but it has since rebounded.
Tourism has also seen benefited from a boom in renting flats out to tourists via web platforms such as Airbnb. However, this has prompted a backlash in popular destinations such as Barcelona, Palma de Majorca or San Sebastian as locals complain of a drop in long-term rentals and rising prices.
The tourism surge has raised business activity in the sector, including increased merger and acquisition interest between hotel groups and expected passenger records at Spanish airports.
On Wednesday, NH Hotels (MC:NHH) declined a takeover offer by rival Barcelo, an operation which would have created the country's largest hotel chain, though it said it would still analyze future strategic possibilities.

PARIS (Reuters) - The global business jet market, which had been bruised by the 2007-08 financial crisis, has started to show signs of recovery, the head of France's Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD) said on Thursday.
Sales of business jets halved from their peak of 1,317 in 2008 to 661 in 2016, according to data from the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, but jet maker Dassault's chairman and CEO Eric Trappier told reporters there were signs the market is picking up and that his company is also in the process of developing a new business jet.
Speaking in his capacity as head of the French Gifas aerospace business interest group, Trappier said there had been a pick up in activity over the past month.
Trappier's comments echoed those made in October by Honeywell (N:HON), which said it expected the market to receive a boost from the global economy's steady growth and upgrades to newer aircraft from U.S. companies.

Dassault Aviation last month said it was scrapping development of the Falcon 5X jet because of delays and technical problems with its French-supplied engines. It added that it would launch a new model powered by Pratt & Whitney Canada, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp (N:UTX).

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya Airways (NR:KQNA) expects its daily direct flights to the United States that it launches for the first time in October to boost annual revenue by 10 percent from 2019, the chief executive said on Thursday.
The carrier, which is 7.8 percent owned by Air France KLM (PA:AIRF), has started taking bookings for the flights to and from New York that will carry 234 passengers each way on a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliner plane.
The new long haul route is part of an effort to revive the airline's fortunes after it came close to collapse, leading to a $2 billion financial restructuring in November that included a government bailout which shrank Air France KLM's stake.
""This is going to increase 2019 (revenues) by roughly 10 percent,"" Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Mikosz told reporters at an event to launch the new 15-hour route.
U.S.-bound passengers from Kenya must now change planes in Europe or the Gulf on a journey that can take 20 hours or more.
""This is a symbol of the comeback of Kenya Airways,"" Chairman Michael Joseph said.
Kenya has long wanted to fly direct to the United States, but Kenyan carriers were only granted U.S. security clearance for the route in February 2017 after a major refurbishment of facilities at the main Nairobi airport.
Kenya has suffered frequent attacks by an Islamist militant group based in neighboring Somalia in recent years. The attacks hammered Kenya Airways by driving away tourists from the East African nation, which boasts palm-fringed beaches and safaris.
CEO Mikosz said the new route aimed to encourage more business and tourist travel with the United States, which he said was the biggest source of visitors to Kenya.
In the first 10 months of 2017, 95,771 tourists traveled to Kenya from the United States, a figure that has been rising 20 percent in each of the past two years, he said.
Kenya also hosts regional hubs for 48 U.S. or U.S.-based, organizations, such as Google (O:GOOGL) and  IBM  (N:IBM), he added.
Thursday's event was held at a five-star hotel to signal the end to recent hard times when gatherings were staged under a tent at the carrier's training school to save costs.
The direct flights would create about 150 new jobs at Kenya Airways, said Mikosz, who was hired from LOT Polish airlines last June to help turn around the carrier.

Kenya Airways shares, which have tripled in value since the November restructuring, jumped 5.9 percent to 17.15 shillings ($0.1666) on Thursday.

An arrangement where Britain gives up full access to the single market and customs union could threaten as many as 14,000 jobs at automotive suppliers in Germany and shrink their sales by 3.8 billion euros ($4.54 billion), the study published on Thursday found. Britain will leave the European Union in 2019.
Germany is the largest exporter of car parts to the UK, with companies such as Continental (DE:CONG) and Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] providing nearly a fifth of all components used in UK-based car production.
Some 42,500 jobs in Germany depend on suppliers' ties with Britain and German parts makers generated 16.9 billion euros in sales in 2016 from UK car production, a study by global accounting firm Deloitte published on Thursday showed.
""Trade barriers emerging in the course of Brexit such as tariffs or regulation would considerably harm supply chains and raise the costs for suppliers,"" Thomas Schiller, head of automotive at Deloitte, said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing has advertised online for a range of jobs in Mexico as it prepares to break into the country, one of rival Uber's regional strongholds.
Didi Chuxing plans this year to launch a smartphone app in Mexico and to recruit drivers to the platform, Reuters reported last month. The expansion underscores Didi's growing interest in Mexico and, more broadly, Latin America, a market where Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] doubled down after Didi drove it out of China.
A spokesman for Didi declined to comment. The company is the second-most highly valued, venture-backed private firm in the world, after Uber.
Over the past two weeks, Didi has advertised on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) for eight jobs based in the Mexico City area, postings on the social network show. The company is hiring for roles in government affairs, public relations, marketing and driver operations, among other fields.
Uber stressed its commitment to Mexico, noting its presence in 43 cities.
""We will continue working toward the future of urban mobility in the republic,"" an Uber spokeswoman said in a statement. 
Didi has been outspoken about its global ambitions, but the Mexico expansion marks a turning point. The company's plans had previously been limited to financial commitments to ride-hailing companies in other countries and a research lab in Silicon Valley that opened last year. 
Didi has invested in a variety of Uber rivals around the world. The Chinese firm agreed to acquire control of Brazil's ride service 99, the companies announced earlier this month.
Didi will likely face regulatory battles in Mexico, just as Uber has. Legislators in the state of Quintana Roo, home to tourist destination Cancun, proposed legislation that would ban cash fares, which Uber views as a critical tool to reach users in emerging markets.
Last month, Uber announced it would halt its service in Cancun as it worked with authorities on the regulation and said it hoped to resume operations early in the year.

In its posting for a government affairs specialist, Didi wrote that responsibilities would include being an advocate for the future of urban mobility ""and how Mexico could benefit from new technologies including self-driving cars.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European share trading got off to a hesitant start on Thursday as concerns over protectionism and a bond market sell-off made the breakneck New Year rally in equities fizzle out. 
Results drove the bulk of stock moves, with some disappointments weighing heavily. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) and euro zone equities (STOXXE) dipped 0.1 percent, recovering from sharp losses in the previous session when jitters over a report that China was considering slowing purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds spilled over into stocks.
A Chinese regulator on Thursday said the report may be ""fake"".
Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) meanwhile touched a fresh record, its third in as many days, before falling back to trade down 0.1 percent. 
UK retailers  Tesco  (L:TSCO) and Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) were among the biggest European fallers after their Christmas trading updates disappointed, with consumers cutting down on non-essential items.
Europe's retail sector (SXRP) was the worst-performing, down 0.8 percent as a result, while bank stocks (SX7P), which had jumped on Wednesday as bond yields surged, fell back 0.3 percent.
Danish jewellery firm  Pandora  (CO:PNDORA) dropped to the bottom of the STOXX, down 13 percent after the company said it expected profit margins to fall in the next few years and reported 2017 revenue below expectations.
Hexagon (ST:HEXAb) jumped up 4.2 percent, after its CEO was cleared of insider trading charges.
While it was too early in the season to fully determine what impact results were having, investors said earnings would be under particular scrutiny this year as the market hoped for another year of earnings growth. 
""You didn't really have any earnings growth coming through since the euro zone crisis, it was a kind of Groundhog Day every year, but 2017 was a break from that effect,"" said Nick Davis, European income fund manager at Polar Capital. 
""The earnings season will be quite important. If Europe can continue demonstrating earnings growth at index level as an asset class it will be very attractive,"" he added. 
In other big moves, the restructuring French telecoms and cable firm Altice (AS:ATCA) tumbled 5.8 percent, extending Wednesday's slide, after its U.S. unit announced a $500 million junk bond sale.
Chipmaker STMicro (MI:STM) gained 3.2 percent after  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) upgraded the stock to 'outperform', saying margins for the iPhone supplier would continue to expand.
Sodexo (PA:EXHO) also fell victim to disappointing results, its shares down 3 percent after the firm reported a slow start to its first quarter.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Marriott International (O:MAR) apologized on Thursday over a questionnaire sent to customers that listed Chinese-claimed regions such as Tibet and Taiwan as separate countries, which provoked an outcry on social media and an investigation by the Shanghai government.
""Marriott International respects Chinese sovereignty and its territorial integrity...We sincerely apologize for any actions that led to misunderstanding on the aforementioned stance,"" the company said in a statement on its official Weibo account.
In a Mandarin-language questionnaire sent out to customers a few days ago, Marriott listed Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan as separate countries.
Eagle-eyed netizens soon pointed out the error and took to Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, asking Marriott to make adjustment, with many accusing the American company of disrespecting Chinese sovereignty, and some calling for a boycott.
China claims sovereignty over all four of territories, though Taiwan is self-ruled and has democratic elections.
In a statement on Wednesday, the Shanghai government said it had asked Marriott to ""take down all relevant content, conduct a thorough check on all contents it posted on its website and online application to prevent anything similar, and address the public's concern in a timely fashion to eliminate a negative impact.""
It also said Shanghai's Huangpu district market supervision bureau was launching an investigation into Marriott, as it was suspected of violating China's cyber security law and advertisement law.

Last year, South Korean companies were hit heavily by Chinese economic retaliation over Seoul's deployment of a US missile shield system.

Cambridge Econometrics, an economics consultancy, looked at five different Brexit scenarios, from the hardest to the softest form of Brexit, and broke down the economic impact on nine industries, from construction to finance.
The study said that in a no-deal scenario, the industry that fares the worst will be financial and professional services, with as many as 119,000 fewer jobs nationwide.
""If the Government continue to mishandle the negotiations we could be heading for a lost decade of lower growth and lower employment,"" Khan said. ""Ministers are fast running out of time to turn the negotiations around.""
Britain and the EU will soon begin the much harder task of defining their future trading relationship, after settling the broad terms of their divorce settlement last month.
A stand-off between Britain and the EU over the future access to single market for London's vast financial services industry is shaping up to be one of the key Brexit battlegrounds before Britain is due to leave the bloc in March 2019.

The powerful union IG Metall is demanding 6 percent more pay for 3.9 million metals and engineering workers in Germany. It also wants them to gain the right to reduce their weekly hours to 28 from 35 to care for children or elderly or sick relatives, and return to full-time employment after two years.
Employers have so far offered 2 percent plus a one-off 200- euro ($239) payment in the first quarter and have rejected demands for a shorter working week unless hours could be increased temporarily as well.
""We can always talk about flexible working hours, but only if they can go not only down but also up,"" Rainer Dulger, the head of the Gesamtmetall employers' association, told the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
IG Metall, Germany's biggest trade union, has threatened to call for 24-hour walkouts if talks fail to make progress, harkening back to seven weeks of strikes in 1984 that helped push through a shortening of the work week to 35 hours from 40 hours.
Tens of thousands of workers have already staged short walkouts and rallied outside factory gates in recent days.
IG Metall chief Joerg Hofmann said employers have to soften their resistance to the union's proposals to avoid an escalation of the dispute.
But he held out little hope that major progress would be made on Thursday, when the union and employers meet for regional talks in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, where  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), Bosch [ROBG.UL] and Porsche (DE:VOWG_p) are based.
In remarks released on Thursday, Hofmann also said the union's wage demand was adequate given dividend payouts rose by 10 to 15 percent and that companies had enough leeway to pay up without choking off investments.
""And I do think that we will reach a decent result there,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The New Year rally in Asian shares petered out on Thursday due to concerns about rising U.S. protectionism, while bonds rebounded after China's regulator said a report about Beijing slowing or halting of its U.S. bond buying was possibly wrong.
Bitcoin fell more than 11 percent after South Korea said it was preparing a bill to ban trade in the cryptocurrency.
But European stock futures were 0.2 percent higher, portending a brighter opening for the region, with DAX futures up 0.1 percent and FTSE futures up 0.2 percent.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.3 percent, slipping further from Tuesday's 10-year peak. Japan's Nikkei finished 0.3 percent lower.
Bitcoin dropped 9.2 percent to $13,517.83 on the Bitstamp exchange, after South Korea's justice minister said a bill was being prepared to ban cryptocurrency trading. 
U.S Treasuries pared some of their losses, pushing down the 10-year yield to 2.544 percent from Wednesday's ten-month high of 2.597 percent, hit after a Bloomberg report that China is considering slowing or halting purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds.
The country's foreign exchange regulator said on Thursday the report may be based on erroneous information and could be ""fake"", prompting investors to buy back bonds.
""That should have been good news for the U.S. dollar, but it's still trading very weakly - it's a weak dollar story,"" said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo. ""The market seems to have been looking for one-sided news to sell the dollar, this week.""
Globally bonds markets had been spooked by the Bank of Japan's routine announcement on Tuesday of a reduction in purchases of longer-tenor bonds and a jump in oil prices on top of the report about China's investment in U.S. bonds.
Those factors combined to push 10-year Treasury yields to their highest levels since March, and also pressured the dollar and stock markets. The VIX implied volatility index, the markets' so-called ""fear gauge,"" hovered just above 10 on Thursday, from as low as 8.92 on Jan. 2. 
U.S. shares snapped their New Year rally on Wednesday while the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso fell after a Reuters report said Canada increasingly believes that U.S. President Donald Trump will soon announce his intention to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement treaty.
""I would think that China is flexing its muscles as the United States is looking into measures to deal with its trade deficit with China,"" said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank.
""I have been expecting rising trade frictions between the United States and China this year. It appears China is quick to touch the Achilles heel of the States,"" he added.
Reports on investigations into U.S. imports are due to be sent to Trump this month, including probes into whether imports of steel and aluminum threaten U.S. national security.
A separate probe into Chinese intellectual property practices may also conclude as early as this month, Axios reported, and could result in tariffs on the country's consumer-electronics exports.
The speculation that China may reduce its buying in U.S. bonds helped to underpin the euro, the most obvious alternative to the dollar for assets.
The euro traded at $1.1945, nearly flat on the day, and holding above Tuesday's low of $1.1916.
Against the yen, the dollar added 0.4 percent to 111.83, after hitting a six-week low of 111.27 yen in the previous session when it skidded 1.1 percent to mark its largest decline in almost eight months.
The yen was buoyed this week after a cut in the Bank of Japan's bond buying on Tuesday fueled speculation that the central bank could eventually seek to exit from its stimulus later this year, following in the footsteps of other major central banks. 
The BOJ maintained the amount of its bond purchases on Thursday, helping to soothe a market rattled by its reduction earlier this week.
The Canadian dollar traded at C$1.2554 per U.S. dollar after having lost 0.7 percent on Wednesday. 
Crude oil prices jumped on Wednesday and settled near three-year highs after U.S. government data showed a drop in crude inventories and production, though the fall in the latter could be the result of extreme cold temperatures across the United States.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures traded at $63.47 per barrel, down 10 cents, after hitting a high of $63.67 in the previous session, their loftiest level since December 2014.

Norwalk, Connecticut-based Xerox been targeted by activist investor Carl Icahn as it struggles to reinvent its legacy business amid waning demand for office printing. Fujifilm is trying to streamline its copier business with a larger focus on document solutions services.
Xerox, which pioneered photocopiers, and Fujifilm already have a five-decade old Tokyo-based copier joint venture focusing on the Asia Pacific region including Japan and China, leaving Xerox to cover the rest of the world.
The Journal report on Wednesday cited people familiar with the matter. It also said a full takeover of Xerox is not on the table, citing one of the people.
Xerox declined to comment. Fujifilm said it would not comment on speculative reports.
Xerox has a market value of about $7.7 billion, while Fujifilm is valued at around $22 billion.
Xerox ""desperately"" needed new leadership as it was slow to launch new products and increase revenue, Icahn wrote in an open letter to shareholders in December, a day after nominating four members to the board. He is Xerox's biggest shareholder with a stake of 9.7 percent.
Xerox spun off its business process outsourcing unit in 2016 and separated into two independent, publicly traded companies.
Fujifilm shares fell 1.8 percent in Tokyo to 4,724 yen per share following the Journal report, while the broader Japanese market (N225) slipped 0.3 percent.
The copier joint venture, Fuji Xerox, was created in 1962 and now accounts for nearly half of Fujifilm's sales and operating profit.
Fujifilm has been seeking growth outside its shrinking photographic film business, stepping up its acquisition drive in areas such as regenerative medicine.
Past deals include the 2015 purchase of Cellular Dynamics International Inc, a U.S. biotechnology firm that makes human-induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines and tissue cells.
Last August, it said it aimed to spend 500 billion yen ($4.49 billion) in strategic acquisitions over three years.

Ant Financial's planned $1.2 billion purchase of transfer firm MoneyGram International Inc (O:MGI) collapsed last week after a U.S. government panel rejected the deal over national security concerns.
It was the most high-profile Chinese deal to be torpedoed since Donald Trump was elected U.S. president a year ago on promises to put America first and protect U.S. jobs from foreign competitors. 
""We’ve noticed recently that protectionist voices have been rising in the U.S.,"" Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng said in a briefing.
China was particularly worried about countries using national security concerns as a way to block foreign investment, he added. 
Ant Financial is owned by Chinese internet conglomerate  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA).
In another blow to the global ambitions of Chinese firms, Huawei Technologies Co's  planned deal with U.S. carrier AT&T Inc (N:T) to sell its smartphones in the United States also fell apart because of security concerns, people with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.
The failed deals come as the U.S. considers several new tariff moves in the coming weeks, including broad restrictions on steel and aluminum imports and punitive actions against China arising from an investigation into Beijing's alleged theft of intellectual property.
""(Trade) remains foremost in my mind as a risk for China because it's something they can't control,"" said Michael Spencer, chief Asia Pacific economist for  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 
""But my base case is that we will see more trade frictions this year than last, but that it's not going to led to a significant decline in real exports from China."" 
An editorial in the official China Daily on Thursday blamed the termination of the Huawei-AT&T deal on political pressure instead of business considerations, and said this threatened the kind of win-win deals China sought. 
""This is not the first time U.S. politicians have stooped to mudslinging to prevent the entry of Chinese high-tech companies into the U.S. market on the pretext they pose national security threats,"" it said. 
Washington's criticism of China's tightly controlled economy and restrictions on foreign investment rang hollow, it added.

""Its blocking of deals involving Chinese companies in sectors where it has traditionally had an advantage shows its criticisms have more validity if directed at the U.S. market,"" the editorial said.

Ford will fit the brakes on its redesigned 2019 Edge midsize crossover vehicle and its new 2019 Ranger midsize pickup, that will compete later this year with the Chevrolet Colorado and Toyota Tacoma. 
The brakes are part of a suite of standard safety features on the new Edge, Ford said, including technology that detects objects and pedestrians and can prevent collisions by automatically braking and steering for the driver.
The 2019 Edge, which goes on sale this summer, will also offer new optional safety features, including a more sophisticated cruise control system as well as automatic steering assist to help avoid potential crashes.
In an update last month, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said four of 20 automakers in 2017 equipped at least half of their U.S. models with standard automatic emergency brakes, with the highest installation rates for luxury brands such as Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz. 
Among mass-market companies, Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) fitted the devices to 56 percent of its 2017 fleet, compared with 30 percent for Honda Motor Co (T:7267), 20 percent for General Motors Co (N:GM) and less than 10 percent for Ford.
Overall, 20 carmakers have agreed to equip virtually all of their new passenger vehicles with automatic emergency brakes by September 2022, NHTSA said.

In an interview, Raj Nair, president of Ford's North American operations, said the company plans to be ""more aggressive"" in standardizing features that assist drivers. He declined to say when Ford planned to make automatic emergency brakes standard on all its U.S. models.

1388,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 08:38PM ET</span>","Buffett succession gains clarity as Berkshire promotes Abel, Jain","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc on Wednesday promoted two of its top executives, Gregory Abel and Ajit Jain, adding them to its board and cementing their status as the front runners to succeed Warren Buffett atop the conglomerate. 
Abel, 55, the chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, was named Berkshire's vice chairman for non-insurance business operations, while Jain, 66, Berkshire's top insurance executive, was named vice chairman for insurance operations. 
Buffett, 87, remains chairman and CEO of the roughly $500 billion conglomerate he has run since 1965. Charlie Munger, 94, who has worked at Buffett's side for more than four decades, remains vice chairman. 
Both Buffett and Munger will continue handling major capital allocation and investment decisions, including acquisitions, for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, though they have reduced their responsibilities in recent years with their increasing age. 
""It is probably fair to say it's not just the Warren and Charlie show any more,"" said David Rolfe, who oversees $5 billion of assets at Wedgewood Partners Inc in St. Louis, whose largest holding is Berkshire. 
""Today's news codifies the importance of Greg Abel and Ajit Jain to not just their current businesses, but their future authority once Buffett relinquishes the CEO title,"" Rolfe added. 
In an interview on CNBC, Buffett called Abel's and Jain's new roles ""part of the movement toward succession"" at Berkshire. 
""They are the two key figures at Berkshire"" and ""have Berkshire in their blood,"" he said. 
Many investors view Abel as the favorite to become CEO, citing his age and experience in acquisitions and operations. 
Still, Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management LLC in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, said, ""Shareholders should be happy that these large, large contributors to Berkshire's value are now vice chairmen and on the board."" Both he and Rolfe consider Abel the top CEO candidate. 
BUFFETT SAYS NO HORSE RACE 
Berkshire has more than 90 operating units including the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurance, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, See's Candies and a variety of industrial and chemical operations. 
While Munger had the idea to make Abel and Jain vice chairmen, Buffett said managing a large portion of Berkshire, including input on smaller acquisitions, would provide valuable experience to his successor. 
Buffett dismissed the idea of a horse race between Abel and Jain for the top job. 
""They know each other well, they like each other well, they both have their areas of specialty,"" he said. Berkshire's board will grow to 14 members from 12 with the addition of Abel and Jain. 
Buffett, who first publicly raised the succession issue more than a decade ago, said he remained in ""remarkably good health"" and that his health was not a factor in making the announcement. ""Maybe six weeks ago,"" he said, ""I just decided, 'Why not now?'"" 
While Buffett has no plans to quit soon, when asked how long he expected to remain at the helm, he said: ""Ten years would be a long time."" 
Munger told CNBC he thought Berkshire shareholders had ""seven or more good years coming out of Warren,"" but ""not very many"" out of him, saying, ""I have to face reality.""
None of the executives was immediately available for interviews. 
Berkshire's Class A shares closed up 1.3 percent at $308,350.00. Its B shares also rose 1.3 percent, to $205.61.
OTHER SUCCESSION PLANS 
Abel, who grew up in Alberta, joined Berkshire Hathaway Energy in 1992. His Iowa-based unit now runs several power companies in the United States, Canada and Britain, as well as natural gas pipelines and solar and wind farms. 
Jain, a native of India who joined Berkshire in 1986, runs the reinsurance operations, providing coverage against major catastrophes and unusual risks. 
Berkshire's insurance businesses employed roughly 44,000 people at the end of 2016, while businesses that Abel will oversee employed about 323,000. 
Still, insurance remains critical to Berkshire, recently contributing $113 billion of ""float,"" or premiums collected before claims are paid, for Berkshire to invest.
Buffett, the world's third-richest person according to Forbes magazine, has long said Jain has probably made more money for Berkshire than he has. 
""If Jain becomes CEO it would be great, but the complexity of the insurance business requires someone there with more day-to-day supervision,"" Rolfe said. 
In the CNBC interview, Buffett repeated that Berkshire’s board, whose members include  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates, can install a new chief executive within a day when he steps down, dies or becomes incapacitated. 
Abel and Jain became the apparent front runners after Munger singled them out as ""world-leading"" performers in a 2015 letter to Berkshire shareholders. 
Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who are Buffett's investment deputies, are expected eventually to succeed Buffett as Berkshire's chief investment officer. 

Buffett's eldest son, Howard, is expected to become Berkshire's non-executive chairman, to help preserve the company's culture.

1389,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 08:22PM ET</span>",SEC seeks trustee for firm behind alleged $1 billion Ponzi fraud,"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission urged a federal judge on Wednesday to appoint a trustee to manage the Woodbridge Group of Companies, a bankrupt property developer the regulator accused of being a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme.
Woodbridge filed for bankruptcy in December and weeks later the SEC sued to freeze its assets, accusing it of selling unregistered securities to raise funds to repay earlier investors.
The regulator has said investors are owed more than $961 million, and has alleged the company's owner, Robert Shapiro, used at least $21 million for private jets, luxury cars, wine and political donations.
Shapiro has denied the allegations. Larry Perkins, who was hired as a chief restructuring officer in October, said the company is investigating the allegations.
More than 40 lawyers attended the U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing in Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday as creditors, investors and authorities sought to protect their interest in the company assets, including the Owlwood estate in Los Angeles once owned by singer Cher.
The SEC and an official creditors committee wants an independent trustee, while the company and lawyers for some investors argued for sticking with Perkins.
The judge, Kevin Carey, said in similar situations he has benefited from having an independent examiner.
""My concern was if there were improprieties I want to hear about them publicly rather than have them buried in settlements,"" he said. 
Carey continued the hearings until Jan. 18.
Perkins was grilled on Wednesday about deals worth millions of dollars to Shapiro that Perkins said were necessary to convince Shapiro to cede management of Woodbridge prior to the bankruptcy. Shapiro also contributed property to the company. 
Beginning in 2012, Woodbridge raised about $1.2 billion from 8,400 investors, many of them senior citizens, through the sale of securities that promised interest of up to 8 percent, according to a federal complaint by SEC. 
Woodbridge told investors the funds would be loaned to commercial property developers for up to 15 percent interest, according to the SEC. The company also said it was investing in high-end property.
In reality, the developers that were borrowing from Woodbridge were actually entities controlled by Shapiro, according to the SEC. 
Woodbridge skirted scrutiny by avoiding licensed broker-dealers and instead distributing its securities through insurance agents and unregistered investment advisers, incentivized with large commissions, according to the SEC. The company also sold securities through seminars and television advertising, the SEC said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico's federally-appointed oversight board on Wednesday granted a two-week extension for the bankrupt island's government to deliver a revised blueprint for its fiscal turnaround. 
The board said in a statement that the turnaround plan, initially due on Wednesday, will now be due on Jan. 24. Fiscal plans for Puerto Rico's debt-laden power utility, PREPA, and sewer authority, PRASA, were extended to the same date. 
Puerto Rico, burdened by $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt, filed the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history last May. Its finances are under the management of a seven-member board appointed by federal lawmakers. 
The fiscal plan, which requires approval by the board, is meant to forecast Puerto Rico's financial standing over several years, and serve as the basis for debt restructuring talks with creditors. Puerto Rico delivered such a plan last year, but the board called for revisions after Hurricane Maria battered the island in September, killing dozens and decimating local infrastructure. 
The new plan is to account for economic losses from Maria, with bondholders bracing for increases to projected repayment cuts. Even before the storm, the fiscal plan did not bode well for bondholders, forecasting just $800 million a year available to service debt - around a quarter of what Puerto Rico owed. 

According to the board's statement on Wednesday, Governor Ricardo Rosselló initially sought an extension only for the PREPA turnaround plan. But the board extended all three ""to ensure alignment of the assumptions and plans,"" the board said in a letter to Rosselló, published along with its statement.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp announced on Wednesday they will build a $1.6 billion joint assembly plant in Alabama that will employ up to 4,000 workers, a boost for President Donald Trump, who wants automakers to expand U.S. production.
Toyota President Akio Toyoda and Mazda President and Chief Executive Officer Masamichi Kogai joined Alabama Governor Kay Ivey in Montgomery at an event to announce the decision.
""Welcome to sweet home Alabama,"" Ivey said to the two executives, after saying that the anticipated 4,000 workers at the plant to be built in Huntsville would earn an average of $50,000 a year.
The plant will produce 300,000 vehicles a year and should open on a 2,500-acre former cotton field in 2021, about 14 miles from Toyota’s engine plant in Huntsville.
Toyota plans to build Corolla cars at the plant, while Mazda will build crossover SUVs.
""Together, I am confident we will create yet another 'Built in America' success story,"" Toyoda said.
Alabama will provide tax incentives. Officials said the state tax incentives were worth $370 million, but they did not disclose how much the local incentives were worth.
But with U.S. auto industry sales are declining, the new plant could exacerbate overcapacity and add pressure to cut prices. U.S. new vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2017, after hitting a record high in 2016, and are expected to fall further in 2018.
Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle said the plant will ""provide jobs for decades to come for Huntsville and Alabama. It vaults Alabama to the top as an industry leader in producing the next generation of cars that will power our nation.""
Among U.S. states, Alabama is already the fifth largest producer of cars and light trucks. The state has more than 150 major auto suppliers and 57,000 automotive manufacturing jobs.
Two decades ago, Alabama spent an estimated $250 million to woo Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz to put an auto plant in Tuscaloosa, sparking the birth of auto production in the state.
In September, Daimler said it would invest $1 billion to expand its Alabama Mercedes-Benz plant to start building electric sport-utility vehicles there from about 2020.
Alabama is also home to assembly plants operated by Honda Motor Co and Hyundai Motor Co. A Kia Motors Corp assembly plant operates near the Alabama border in Georgia.
Mazda and Toyota said they still need approvals and authorization by antitrust agencies for the new joint venture. They announced a capital alliance in August and plans to jointly develop technology for electric vehicles.
Trump tweeted in March that he wanted ""new plants to be built here for cars sold here."" Many automakers have announced expansions of facilities or new jobs but no other new U.S. auto plants have been announced.
A year ago, shortly before his inauguration, Trump criticized Toyota and threatened hefty tariffs against the Japanese automaker if it built its Corolla sedan for the U.S. market in Mexico.
In announcing plans for a new plant in August, Toyota said it would shift production of Corollas from Canada to the new venture rather than in Guanajuato and would build Tacoma pickups in Mexico instead.
Toyota North America chief executive Jim Lentz said in an interview on Wednesday that pressure from Trump was not a factor in the decision to build the plant. ""These plants are going to live 30, 50 years plus and we have to make good business decisions,"" he said.
Lentz said it makes sense to build Corollas because Toyota needs the volume even in a declining car market. He called the $800 million investment a ""bargain"" to get the additional volume.
Toyota hopes to break ground this spring after initially getting more than 100 proposed sites from 22 states. ""It was a daunting task,"" Lentz said.
In October, Toyota said it would scale back investment in a planned plant in Mexico by 30 percent to $700 million and cut planned annual capacity in half to 100,000 vehicles as it shuffles its production plans to meet market demands.
Over the last 30 years Toyota and other automakers from Germany and other parts of Asia have built a second auto industry in the United States. Its size and employment rivals operations of the Detroit Three automakers, but with newer plants and fewer unionized workers.

U.S. states covet auto assembly plants because they typically pay above-average wages and spin off jobs at suppliers and service companies. Southern states have been home to the majority of new auto production by German and Asian automakers. These states generally have good transportation infrastructure, business-friendly regulators and anti-union politicians.

1392,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 07:06PM ET</span>",U.S. 10-year yields highest since March on China bond holdings fears,"By Karen Brettell and Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields jumped to 10-month highs on Wednesday after Bloomberg News reported that Chinese officials have recommended the country slow or halt its purchases of the U.S. bonds.
China is the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt, with $1.19 trillion in Treasuries as of October 2017, according to the Treasury Department.
The Chinese officials, who were not named, said the market for U.S. government bonds is becoming less attractive relative to other assets, Bloomberg said. They also cited trade tensions with the United States as a reason to slow Treasury purchases, the report said.
Analysts said the move may be a political signal, rather than a policy-driven choice, citing the difficulties China would have extricating itself from the market and finding new places to invest. 
“The reason that China holds Treasuries doesn’t have to do with their tactical trading and profit goals. China owns Treasuries because they export goods to the United States and they get dollars in exchange for those goods and they have to do something with those dollars. As long as China continues to export goods to the U.S. on that basis, they’ll need to invest dollars in something,” said Guy LeBas, chief income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.
The report comes amid increasing nervousness about bond weakness after the Bank of Japan said on Tuesday it will trim its purchases of Japanese government bonds, raising speculation it will reduce its monetary stimulus this year.
The 10-year notes pared price losses after the U.S. auctioned $20 billion of reopened 10-year government bonds to strong demand. 
Indirect bidders were awarded 71.42 percent, the biggest share of 10-year supply since the record high set in August 2016. Direct bidders took 6.5 percent with primary dealers at 22.0 percent. 
""We suspect that the strength of the auction was primarily fueled by short-covering. Normally these are short-term trades that are bearish signals for the market,"" said a note by Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies & Co. in New York.  
Benchmark 10-year note (US10YT=RR) yields were last down to 2.564 percent, after peaking at 2.597 percent, the highest since March 15.

The yield curve between two-year notes and 10-year notes  was last flatter at 58.6 basis points, after steepening to 62.4 basis points earlier Wednesday.

The news that senior Chinese government officials have recommended slowing or halting purchases of Treasuries in part given trade tensions with the U.S. wound up having little lasting impact on Wednesday’s trading. Yields ended little changed after spiking to the highest since March, luring buyers.
Almost nine years ago, at a time when yields were already heading higher and the U.S. was issuing a record amount of debt to finance stimulus measures, then-Premier Wen Jiabao added fuel to the selloff by saying he was “worried” about the safety of the securities. Weeks later, China’s top foreign-exchange official said the nation would keep buying Treasuries.
Then as now, analysts say that while America’s biggest foreign creditor has the power to jolt U.S. bond markets, wide-scale selling by China is unlikely given that it has few alternatives to invest its $3.1 trillion in foreign-currency reserves, the world’s largest stash.
“One thing that has been really important to China is that the Treasury market is so deep and so liquid,” said Amar Reganti, a fixed-income strategist at GMO’s asset-allocation group, and former deputy director of the Treasury’s Office of Debt Management. “It’s challenging to find any real substantial alternatives,” with China earning dollars given the U.S. current account deficit.
Brief Jolt
Yields on 10-year Treasuries ended Wednesday little changed at about 2.56 percent, pulling back from close to the highest levels since 2014. As in 2009, the latest news fanning concern about China’s appetite for U.S. borrowings comes at an inopportune time, with Treasury set to ramp up issuance as the Federal Reserve is shrinking its balance sheet.
China owns almost $1.2 trillion of U.S. government debt, more than double the level from a decade ago, with most of the buildup coming as the nation boosted foreign-exchange reserves to help offset a strengthening yuan. The increase came as the size of the U.S. debt market more than tripled to $14.5 trillion.
“China’s showing that they have power in the relationship, as anyone who’s a buyer of U.S. Treasuries does,” said Eric Stein, co-director of global fixed income at Eaton Vance in Boston. “It’s been this symbiotic relationship for the past 15 years or so. I don’t think that’s worked out so poorly for the US.”
For China, the market for U.S. government bonds is becoming less attractive relative to other assets, and trade tensions with the U.S. may provide a reason to slow or stop buying American debt, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named as they aren’t allowed to discuss the matter publicly. China regularly assesses its strategy for investing reserves, and it isn’t clear whether the officials’ recommendations have been adopted.
2009 Episode
Days after Wen’s comments in March 2009, President Barack Obama assured America’s creditors that U.S. government debt was safe and the nation’s finances were sound.
Later that month, Hu Xiaolian, director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said Treasuries form “an important element of China’s investment strategy for its foreign-currency reserves.”
In the end, China lifted its Treasuries holdings by $167 billion in 2009, or 23 percent, U.S. data show.
The stakes may be higher now as tensions with the U.S. have been building since the election of President Donald Trump, who’s been critical of the American trade deficit with China and other countries. Meanwhile, China has been gradually moving to a more flexible foreign-exchange regime that would allow it to intervene less in the market.
There are signs that the adjustment the Chinese officials recommended may already be happening, according to Jefferies. The amount of Treasuries that foreign central banks hold in custody with the Fed and the movement of the yuan point in that direction, in the bank’s view. The Fed holds $3.015 trillion of Treasuries for other central banks, down from $3.052 trillion in September.
In the eyes of some analysts, Chinese officials may be trying to send a message that they have leverage with President Trump talking tough on trade.
‘Veiled Threat’
“The markets interpreted this as a veiled threat from China,” said David Bloom, global head of currency strategy in London at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA). “That doesn’t mean that it is. But people are nervous about the Treasury market at the moment with a global pickup in growth.”
Bloom agrees that China has few places to shift its reserves. If it were to dump Treasuries, German bunds could be a destination, though yields there are rising too, he said.
Coming into this year, strategists at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and some other banks were expecting China’s Treasuries buying to ebb as they predicted stability in the yuan after a 2017 rally. The consensus among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is for little change in the yuan by the end of 2018, from its current level of around 6.50 per dollar. A steady exchange rate suggests limited pressure on Chinese authorities to add Treasuries as part of intervening in currency markets.
For China and its Treasuries holdings, “things are more or less as they always have been,” said Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS Securities LLC in New York and a former Fed and Treasury official.
“Their holdings have moved up and down through time,” he said. “And when it comes to the heightened political interaction between China and the U.S., there has always been this tension.”

1398,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 05:34PM ET</span>",Ford sued by truck owners alleging diesel emissions cheating,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co installed software that enabled its F-250 and F-350 Super Duty trucks to cheat at passing federal emissions tests, according to a lawsuit by truck owners filed on Wednesday, a claim the No. 2 U.S. automaker described as ""baseless.""
Ford manipulated the emissions system in violation of federal requirements and the affected trucks released twice the legal limits of emissions during normal driving, the lawsuit claimed. An emission-cheating scandal that came to light in 2015 cost German automaker Volkswagen tens of billions of dollars in settlements and fines.
Ford said in a statement that all of its vehicles comply with all U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board emissions regulations. 
""Ford vehicles do not have defeat devices,"" the company said. ""We will defend ourselves against these baseless claims.""
The law firm representing the owners, Hagens Berman, has launched lawsuits in the last year against General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV as well as engine maker  Cummins Inc  (NYSE:CMI), making similar allegations.
In the tests Ford conducted on the F-250 and F-350 vehicles, ""emissions are routinely as high as five times the standard,"" the lawsuit said, quipping that the trucks should bear the moniker ""Super Dirty.""
Erik Gordon, an expert in entrepreneurship and technology at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said that if true, the ""allegations would expose Ford to the risk of billion-dollar liabilities and punch a hole in its attempts to position itself as a vehicle technology leader.""
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, also named German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] as a defendant.
In a statement Wednesday, Bosch said allegations against the company ""remain the subject of investigations and civil litigation"" and it takes allegations of diesel software manipulation ""very seriously."" 
Last year, Bosch agreed to pay $327.5 million to U.S. owners of Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) vehicles for its part in installing illegal emissions-cheating software.
More recently, German prosecutors investigating whether carmaker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) manipulated emission tests on its diesel cars have looked at whether Bosch was involved.
Volkswagen has struggled to draw a line under its diesel emissions scandal, which broke in the United States in 2015 and has cost the German company as much as $30 billion.
An EPA spokeswoman did not immediately comment on the lawsuit against Ford.

Ford shares closed down 0.4 percent at $13.03.

The S&P also dipped on a Reuters report saying Canada is increasingly convinced President Donald Trump will soon announce the United States intends to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The report cited two unnamed government sources.

The China report put the S&P and the Nasdaq on track to snap a six-day run of record closing highs as investors worried that the market was overdue for a correction.
""It's a reflection of investor weariness and awareness that the market has risen for four straight months without seeing a major pullback,"" said Pavlik. ""They're on alert in case something develops.""

Italy's Ferrero is seen as a front-runner, according to several other sources, who said that the maker of the Nutella spread was keen to boost its presence in the U.S. market, following last year's purchase of the U.S. groups Ferrara and Fannie May.
One source said Ferrero raised its offer for Nestle's business last week in an attempt to outbid rival Hershey (N:HSY).
""(Executive Chairman) Giovanni Ferrero is really committed to the deal, that's why the group sweetened its offer to something in the area of $2.5 billion,"" the source said.
Nestle and Ferrero declined to comment, Hershey was not immediately available for comment.
If successful, the deal would make Ferrero the third-biggest confectioner in the United States after Mars Inc. and Hershey, according market research provider Euromonitor.
Nestle in June said it was exploring strategic options for the business, which includes candy bar brands such as Butterfinger and Baby Ruth, and had sales of more than $900 million in 2016. It is keeping the rest of the global business, which includes KitKat and Aero.
    Ferrero, which also makes Ferrero Rocher pralines and Kinder chocolate eggs, is run by Giovanni Ferrero, whose grandfather founded the firm in 1946 in the small Italian town of Alba, in Piedmont.

    For many years Ferrero relied on internal growth but began making acquisitions after Giovanni became the company's sole CEO in 2011 following the death of his brother.

Not all of Kohl's roughly 300 ""right-sized"" stores will necessarily lease unused footage, at least at the start, Chief Executive Kevin Mansell said in comments reported by CNBC. (http://cnb.cx/2CQevyH)
He added that the company has already identified ""a whole list of partners"" and was also considering partnerships with competitors.
Kohl's confirmed the plans outlined in the CNBC article.
""If we had our preference, we are going first after well-capitalized companies, and preferably ones that have high traffic in grocery and convenience,"" Mansell told CNBC on the sidelines of the ICR Conference in Orlando, Florida.
The company has been cutting the size of some of its large stores to better manage inventories and other costs, and is also building small-format stores to access customers in suburbs.
It posted strong holiday sales on Monday, helped by online sales, the revamp of its beauty departments, and partnerships with brands such as Under Armour and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE).

The company's shares are up 9 percent since the report and hit a more than one-year high of $59.31 on Wednesday.

The CAV, designed and built in less than three months, is powered by an environmentally-friendly electric propulsion system and can carry up to 500 pounds, Boeing said.
""Our new CAV prototype ... presents new possibilities for autonomous cargo delivery, logistics and other transportation applications,"" said Steve Nordlund, vice president of Boeing HorizonX, the unit that developed the CAV.
Chicago-based Boeing's development of the environmentally-friendly electric propulsion system comes as the race intensifies to advance battery technology and electric motors to lower flying costs and move away from fossil fuels.
Airbus (PA:AIR), Rolls-Royce (L:RR) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) came together in November to develop a hybrid electric engine, with Airbus responsible for the control architecture of the propulsion system and batteries.

In October, a Seattle-area startup - backed by the venture capital arms of Boeing and JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) - announced plans to bring a small hybrid-electric commuter aircraft to market by 2022.

1424,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 01:21PM ET</span>",Pimco could add U.S. Treasuries if market weakens further: Ivascyn,"By Jennifer Ablan and Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pimco, one of the world's biggest money managers, sees this week's U.S. bond market selloff as a buying opportunity and is not ready to call the spike in 10-year Treasury yield to a nine-month high a bear market precursor.
Dan Ivascyn, the group chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co, told Reuters on Wednesday he would consider adding U.S. Treasuries to the firm's portfolios if the bond market weakens further.
The $14 trillion Treasury market has been roiled in the past 48 hours. On Tuesday, the Bank of Japan said it would trim its purchases of Japanese government bonds, raising speculation it will reduce its monetary stimulus this year.
On Wednesday, Bloomberg News reported that officials in China, the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt, had recommended the country slow down or halt its purchases of the bonds amid a less attractive market for them and rising U.S.-China trade tensions. 
China had $1.19 trillion in Treasuries as of October 2017, data from the Treasury Department show.
U.S. yields jumped broadly with the two-year yield hitting 1.985 percent on Wednesday, the highest level since Sept. 2008. The benchmark 10-year yield touched 2.597 percent, its loftiest level since March, according to Reuters data.
Ivascyn said shorter-dated U.S. Treasuries are ""looking more interesting at these levels"" and that Pimco ""prefers (the) front end"" of the U.S. Treasury yield curve. 
Pimco, a unit of German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE, oversaw more than $1.69 trillion in assets under management as of Sept. 30, 2017.
""There's a lot going on behind the scenes, regarding trade and North Korea,"" Ivascyn said. ""This is likely a warning shot that can lead to a bit of volatility short term. The U.S. and China trade policy is a legit risk in 2018.""
""With all that said, and similar to our views from a year or so ago, it remains premature to declare beginnings of bear markets,"" he added.
Others are not so sure.
On Tuesday, Bill Gross, the high-profile fixed-income investor, tweeted: ""Bond bear market confirmed today. 25 year long-term trendlines broken in 5yr and 10yr maturity Treasuries."" Gross revealed on Wednesday that his main fund had made a bearish bet on the bond market.
The Janus Henderson manager said his $2.2 billion Global Unconstrained Bond Fund had taken a short position on Treasuries, U.K. gilts and German Bunds. In an interview with Bloomberg, he said that there appears to be a “negative type of posture for bonds.”
For his part, Jeffrey Gundlach, known on Wall Street as the 'Bond King', said on an investor webcast on Tuesday that if the 10-year Treasury yield pushes above 2.63 percent, it will accelerate higher.

That 10-year yield level Gundlach referred to was a level last seen a day before the Federal Reserve raised interest rates at its March 14-15 policy meeting.

1425,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",European banks braced for 'slow burn' payments revolution,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - New European rules on online payments and banking due to go into effect on Saturday mark the start of a ""slow burn"" revolution that will prise open traditional retail banking and may force lenders to rethink their business models, regulators say.
The Payments Services Directive 2 (PSD2), which allows retailers and consumers to bypass banks by authorizing payments directly from personal accounts, among other things, aims to cut costs and increase choice by widening the range of firms offering financial services.
The European Union rules, which also reflect rapid advances in technology in banking like the use of smart phones, open the door to ""fintech"" online applications like Money Dashboard, Plum and Moneybox, as well as established retail giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
""The development of the market is likely to be a slow burn,"" said Karina McTeague, director of retail banking supervision at Britain's regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). ""We, like everyone in this industry, don't know exactly which direction it will go.""
Industry experts said the directive would likely have enormous implications for traditional retail banks.
Although firms with PSD2 licenses will not be authorized to take deposits or make loans, bypassing the banks means debit or credit cards will not be necessary for most of their customers' online transactions.
Customers will also be able to authorize firms to access their accounts to help them manage their finances, for example by guiding them to the cheapest points of credit and consolidating data from accounts with more than one bank, which banks have resisted up until now. 
""PSD2 is a revolutionary piece of regulation that is likely to signal the end of the high street bank in the medium-to-long term,"" said Michael McKee, head of financial services regulation at international law firm DLA Piper. 
The FCA said it has received 40 license applications for PSD2 services in Britain. As many as a dozen could be in place by Saturday, it said.
The directive puts the EU at the forefront of efforts to disrupt the central role of banks in how people pay for goods and services online and encourage competition by giving customers the right to share their account data. 
Fintech startups in the United States have argued that a little-known provision in the Dodd-Frank Act gives them the right to source data from their customers’ accounts, but say some banks have been slow to comply. 
OPEN BANKING
The ""open banking"" system may take a while to gain momentum with the public.
British government efforts to make it easier to switch bank accounts have had limited success due to customer inertia, for example. Another difficulty is convincing customers that their bank account data is safe in the hands of outside firms.
""It will be a challenge for all existing banks and payments firms, given their responsibilities to protect information, to properly and promptly handle requests for access to customer data from new open banking portals,"" said Tim Dolan, a regulation lawyer at Reed Smith.
Steve Tigar, CEO of Edinburgh-based personal financial management service Money Dashboard, said the new rules will help their business by establishing trust.
""Using a service like Money Dashboard will become commonplace as opposed to the sole domain of early adopters,"" he told Reuters.
The Bank of England has said direct payment and account services firms could become the future ""face"" of day-to-day banking, effectively turning traditional retail banks into vaults.
That represents a challenge for banks. A BoE stress test of top UK lenders last year said PSD2's feature of finding the cheapest credit could mean banks will lose revenue from charging for overdrafts, for example.
Income from processing payments and overdrafts currently contribute 800 million pounds and 2.6 billion pounds respectively to annual pre-tax profits of the major UK banks, the BoE said.
That's a relatively small amount compared to the 2016 pre-tax profit of 3.2 billion pounds at just one bank,  Barclays  (LON:BARC). But banks may also have to spend more on marketing to attract and retain customers in face of increased competition, the BoE says.
""I think the days of when you have a big bank and it provides all the touch points to that financial services organization and provides you with all the product sets, and keeps you captive, are gone,"" said Anne Boden, CEO of upstart Starling Bank. ""PSD2 could change banking forever.""
Reed Smith's Dolan said there is nothing to stop banks competing in the same space. HSBC has already said it will launch a new app to aggregate bank accounts. 
""We are expecting a mixed market to develop here with both small firms challenging and larger players offering these services to their customers for the first time,"" said Christopher Woolard, the FCA's executive director of strategy and competition.
The FCA this year is reviewing the business models of retail banks to see if they are sustainable, and will include the impact of PSD2 as an added consideration.

Britain's plan to leave the EU next March will not affect the implementation of PSD2 because all of the EU's financial rules will be incorporated into UK law.

1453,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Special Report: How courts help companies keep sexual misconduct under cover,"By Dan Levine, Benjamin Lesser and Renee Dudley
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cristina Chen-Oster, a senior salesperson in Goldman Sachs’s convertible bonds department, was a few years out of MIT when a male colleague pinned her against a wall, kissed her, groped her and tried to engage in a sexual act, she said in a lawsuit in federal court. After reporting the incident to her boss, the lawsuit alleged, she missed out on pay and promotions while her accused attacker steadily rose through the ranks.
Cathy Sellars, a 59-year-old mother of two adult children, was training to become a truck driver for freight hauler CRST when she complained to her bosses about repeated sexual harassment by male colleagues, according to a class action lawsuit against the company. Her complaints ignored, she says in court records, she eventually found herself in a truck cab with a male driver who pulled a knife on her after she rebuffed his sexual advances. He then refused to allow her to exit the truck during a trip through the southwest and held her for several hours, she said.
And Sebastian Kelly, a gay driver for an ambulance company in Alabama, said in a lawsuit that he worked in a sexually charged atmosphere, where two male co-workers routinely exposed their genitalia.
News headlines of late have focused on sexual harassment accusations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, former Today show anchor Matt Lauer, former U.S. Senator Al Franken and other media figures, entertainers and politicians. In each case, the accusers say they waited years to confront the men who accosted them, most of them too ashamed or fearful to complain publicly or persuaded to keep quiet by tactics meant to suppress the truth.
But these three plaintiffs, and many like them, chose to confront their alleged abusers and hold the companies they work for accountable in public court. Rather than opening the incidents to full public scrutiny, however, judges let companies push the legal boundaries of what should be considered confidential and to keep details of abusive behavior secret.
A Reuters review of federal court cases filed between 2006 and 2016 revealed hundreds containing sexual harassment allegations where companies used common civil litigation tactics to keep potentially damning information under wraps. Plaintiffs in some cases say companies sought to conceal internal documents that reveal similar harassment claims, as well as corporate policies that favored abusers over victims.
In one case, plaintiff lawyers collected secret evidence about alleged criminal behavior, including details of a pharmaceutical saleswoman who alleged a doctor sexually assaulted her at a work-related event. Her supervisor admitted to giving a sheriff’s detective false information about the allegations, court records show.
THE COST OF SECRECY
The true number of such cases is likely much greater than the hundreds identified by Reuters. Federal courts categorize sexual harassment within a larger group of gender discrimination claims, which makes a full accounting difficult. In addition, many sexual harassment cases are filed in state courts. Reuters focused its review on the federal courts because records are more accessible and consistent.
As a result of the sealed documents, cases that could shine light on specific abusers, or on toxic corporate cultures, do the opposite: They enable the very secrecy and corporate complicity that allow sexual harassment to persist in the workplace.
Shira Scheindlin, a former Manhattan federal judge, said judges should make public human-resources complaints that result in employee discipline.
“Otherwise, you get the serial abuser just doing it at the next job,” said Scheindlin, who currently heads the American Bar Association’s federal courts subcommittee and whose private practice includes advising companies on handling sexual harassment complaints. “If that record had been available, there would have been no next job.”
U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said courts are going too far in routinely sealing such cases. Documents filed in federal court are presumed to be public, he said, so people can understand how the judiciary works. Companies should not be allowed to cloak evidence just because it is damaging, said the judge, based in San Francisco. That goes not only for sexual harassment but also for broader corporate governance issues.
“It’s hard to see why their private interests to avoid embarrassment trumps the public’s right to have access to litigation,” Breyer said.
Companies say they have good reason to seek broad protective orders. They frequently argue that their internal documents contain unproven allegations that shouldn’t be public, or sensitive business information that could aid a competitor. Plaintiff attorneys say they often agree to protective orders and motions to seal information from public disclosure because fighting over public access can increase the length and cost of a lawsuit.
Many judges, meanwhile, are reluctant to enforce transparency when neither side has requested it, according to several current and former federal judges. 
“I don’t think any judge is presumptively hostile to the idea of disclosure,” Breyer said. “We may be presumptively hostile to doing more work. I’m speaking for myself.”
Most civil cases settle before they can be publicly aired before a jury. That means the pre-trial secrecy allows companies to permanently conceal information about their sexual harassment policies and how they respond to specific complaints of abuse. 
A broad protective order in the ongoing lawsuit by Chen-Oster and three other women against Goldman has allowed the Wall Street giant to keep hundreds of documents under wraps for three years.
Asked about the secrecy, a Goldman spokesperson told Reuters the firm keeps details private because it promises employees confidentiality when they report concerns. The spokesperson would not discuss the specific allegations raised by Chen-Oster and the other plaintiffs.
In court documents, the company acknowledges that Chen-Oster told her boss about the contact with her co-worker and that the supervisor contacted Goldman’s human resources department about it. Chen-Oster, the company says in court filings, did not want to pursue a human resources complaint.
The protective order permitted lawyers on either side to mark any document exchanged in discovery as confidential, thus barring anyone from disclosing it outside the case. Such orders have become standard to ensure secrecy during the pre-trial evidence discovery phase in U.S. civil litigation. 
There are no nationwide standards on what information should be sealed when discovery documents are later filed in court. Several federal appeals courts recognize that trade secrets, sensitive financial data, or personal information like Social Security Numbers can remain secret. When it comes to allegations of misconduct, some case law allows information that would intrude on an individual’s privacy to be kept secret. But it is left to judges to decide if someone’s privacy outweighs the public’s interest in disclosure.
Initially, Chen-Oster’s lawyers agreed to the protective order, but later, when they sought to broaden the case, they took the rare step of arguing that many documents filed in court should be made public. 
Adam Klein, one of her lawyers, said plaintiff attorneys usually agree to protective orders to gain access to company documents in the first place. 
“It’s balancing the interest of the client to get information with the public’s right to know,” Klein said. In Chen-Oster’s case, Klein said, they later pushed to unseal documents in part so that more women working at Goldman who could join the lawsuit would know the details.
The lawyers asked then-U.S. Magistrate Judge James Francis IV in Manhattan to certify the lawsuit as a class action to address pay and promotions lost to gender discrimination at Goldman. To support their request, they filed, under seal, nearly 300 internal Goldman documents the company had given them during discovery. Some of those documents, the lawyers alleged, showed that Goldman rewarded men who engaged in sexual misconduct. Because Goldman had asserted confidentiality during discovery, Chen-Oster’s lawyers had to file those documents in secret.
The plaintiffs also secretly filed a chart that logged gender discrimination complaints Goldman female employees made to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
MYSTERY RULING
The plaintiffs’ first request in 2014 to unseal is itself not public, nor is Goldman’s response. Francis sided with Goldman – though his reasoning is unknown because he also sealed the ruling from disclosure on the public court docket. 
In a subsequent filing, Chen-Oster’s lawyers argued that details about Goldman HR investigations should be made public, at least without revealing employee names, because they did not contain the type of trade secrets that legal precedent allows companies to keep confidential.
In response, Goldman attorneys argued the documents should remain secret, arguing many contained hearsay and violated the privacy of people who aren’t parties to the suit. The material had been “selectively culled” from Goldman’s internal personnel files to “sensationalize this proceeding,” Goldman’s lawyers said.
U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan reaffirmed Francis’s ruling in 2017, saying the sealed materials “include sensitive content about identifiable non-parties.” Because of that, Torres ruled, the plaintiffs’ request to make the material public should wait until after a judge decides whether to let the case proceed as a class action. 
That legal question has now been pending for more than three years.
Torres declined to comment. Francis, who recently left the bench, also declined to comment on the Goldman case. But in general, he said, judges often wait to wade into secrecy issues until after they know what evidence will be important in their rulings. That way they have a roadmap to decide which secret court filings are most relevant to the public, he said. 
“Making a decision later with more information may be better,” Francis said. “But later may be much later, and that’s problematic.”
Goldman says in court filings that it takes harassment seriously. Out of 12 human-resources cases highlighted by Chen-Oster’s lawyers, Goldman said it had fired five subjects of those complaints and disciplined five. The identities of those employees, however, are not public, leaving other companies unaware of the abusers’ histories.
Chen-Oster and one other plaintiff declined to talk for this article, and the others did not respond to Reuters’ efforts to reach them.
IDENTITY BLACKOUT
In some cases, companies have persuaded judges to require plaintiffs to keep secret the alleged abusers named in lawsuits, before discovery even begins.
The 2011 claim filed by Sebastian Kelly against his former employer, Regional Paramedical Services Inc of Jasper, Alabama, described a hyper-sexualized environment in which his colleagues allegedly exposed their genitalia regularly and discussed sex in graphic terms. He described one instance in which a colleague told Kelly that he “can’t be gay, you like titties too much.”
That employee’s name, and several others, were blacked out in Kelly’s complaint on the order of Judge James Hancock of the Northern District of Alabama. Hancock ruled that all names of employees who weren’t in supervisory roles, including the human resources director, must be kept secret.
Hancock wrote that allegations against non-supervisory employees are “embarrassing” and that the public’s right to access court records was outweighed by the privacy interests of the employees.
In July 2012, both parties asked the judge to dismiss the case after reaching an out-of-court settlement; the terms weren’t disclosed. 
A company spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. The company denies Kelly’s allegations in court documents. Kelly would not disclose the terms of the settlement.
Because the case did not go to trial, the identities of the accused remain blacked out in Kelly’s lawsuit. The accused are named openly, however, in a complaint Kelly filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Kelly’s lawyers filed the document after Hancock ordered them to submit the EEOC records. Anyone reviewing the filing would find the names of the accused men.
Hancock, who has retired, could not be reached to explain why he did not order the names to be blacked out when the lawyers filed the EEOC complaint.
CLASS SECRETS
In the case against CRST Expedited Inc., a large trucking company, secret court filings were compelling enough to persuade Judge Leonard Strand that plaintiffs had grounds to mount a class action alleging widespread systemic abuse against female employees. Yet even with the class certification, the judge continues to keep important details under wraps.
The case, filed in U.S. District Court in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, centers on the complaints of three women, including Cathy Sellars, the 59-year-old who says she was held at knifepoint after rejecting a coworker’s sexual advances. She said she complained about harassment to her superiors and the human resources department. When she contacted human resources to check on the status of her complaints, she says in her lawsuit, she was told that information was “none of my business.”
After Sellars and the other plaintiffs took CRST to court, their attorneys sought information from the company about how it handled sexual harassment complaints, and how many had been filed. The plaintiffs eventually obtained much of that information. 
However, the broad protective order adopted at the beginning of the case – agreed to by both the plaintiffs and the defendants – barred anyone from disclosing that information. The order also forced the plaintiffs to file secretly their motion asking the court for class certification. As a result, all of their allegations of widespread abuse at CRST remained confidential.
Judge Strand granted the plaintiffs’ bid for a class action. In that March order, Strand disclosed some of the sealed material, including the number of female employees – 106 – filing sexual harassment complaints with CRST between October 2013 and February 2016.
But the documents he cited – along with the entire motion he ruled on – still remain under seal. 
“The public has a right to know about the gravity of harm in cases like this,” said Giselle Schuetz, an attorney for Sellars. She said she agreed to the sealing, however, because she couldn’t afford to delay the case.
The litigation is pending, and CRST attorney Kevin Visser said he could not discuss the case or any of the specific allegations as a result. The company denied Sellars’ allegations in court documents. Strand did not respond to requests for comment. 
CONCEALED EVIDENCE
Plaintiff attorneys say secrecy orders tie their hands even when apparent criminal acts are uncovered during the pre-trial exchange of information, such as evidence that women were sexually assaulted while doing their jobs.
In one gender discrimination claim that went to trial eight years ago, Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis attempted to keep secret evidence that one of its managers had given false information to a sheriff’s detective investigating a sexual assault complaint, court records show. 
That attempt came to light when the manager testified during a deposition with the plaintiff’s attorneys before the trial. The attorneys could not disclose the revelation to law enforcement authorities without seeking permission from the company or the judge because the deposition was required to be kept secret under the terms of the protective order.
Novartis tried to keep the details under wraps as the case went to trial. The company’s lawyers argued that the alleged sexual assault and the criminal investigation were irrelevant and would prejudice the jury because the details were “unusually graphic and offensive to any reasonable person.” 
The judge rejected that argument, so in April 2010, Novartis sales rep Marjorie Salame told the jury that she was sexually assaulted by a doctor at a work-related golf event. 
Salame testified that she had considered herself on a management track and enjoyed a good relationship with her boss when she headed to a country club near Tampa, Florida, in May 2002. At the end of the night, Salame said at an earlier deposition, Dr. Edwin Colon got her alone, lifted her skirt and penetrated her with his fingers. 
The next day, Salame told her manager, Joseph Simmons, what had happened. Simmons told the jury he also received a phone call from Colon, who was apologetic but denied culpability, saying he had been drinking. The doctor said the sexual contact with Salame had been consensual, Simmons testified.
Colon declined to discuss the case with Reuters. Simmons also declined to comment.
Salame reported the incident to the sheriff’s office, and investigators interviewed Simmons. The Novartis manager told a detective that the doctor had not said he had been drinking and that Novartis was not investigating the matter, court records state. In fact, Simmons later testified, a human resources employee at Novartis was looking into the complaint, a fact he knew when he talked with the detective. 
Salame’s ex-manager testified both in the pre-trial deposition and during the jury trial that he had misinformed the detective about what Colon told him and about Novartis investigating the complaint, though he told the jury he had not deliberately lied.
The doctor was not charged with a crime.
Had Salame’s lawyers wanted to tell law enforcement authorities about Simmons’ pre-trial revelation, they would have had to go through an elaborate process with Novartis and the judge. Nothing on the court docket shows they did so. Katherine Kimpel, who represented Salame and other women against Novartis, declined to comment. 
U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, co-sponsored legislation in 2014 that would have allowed victims to disclose evidence obtained in civil litigation to law enforcement, if it impacts public health or safety. The bill died in committee.
Broad protective orders and motions to seal, Blumenthal said, can often conceal evidence of criminal behavior, allowing abusers to prey on unsuspecting women. 
“The present practice sends her on a trail where all of the warning signs about the dangers have been removed, and she’s there vulnerable and alone,” he said. 
Salame told Reuters she was too overwhelmed to pursue the matter involving her supervisor after learning he had misled investigators. She did file a civil lawsuit against the doctor, who denied her allegations. Three years ago, both sides agreed to a settlement.
The manager’s testimony was the first time Salame learned what he had done. “It took eight years for it to come out and vindicate me,” Salame said in an interview.
Few sexual harassment cases reach trial, making the Novartis case – and the details disclosed during public testimony – unusual. 
The 2010 trial generated weeks of testimony – and headlines – about how the company treated women. The jury eventually ordered Novartis to pay $250 million in punitive damages in the class action. The company later decided to settle the case and pay about $153 million to class members, rather than appeal the jury verdict. 
A Novartis spokesman declined to discuss the case with Reuters.
As part of the resolution of the case, the company agreed to internal reforms, including annual training on a new sexual harassment policy and new measures for tracking and investigating complaints. On pay, it agreed to analyze gender discrepancies and to share the results of that analysis with the plaintiffs’ attorneys.
More than three years later, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon congratulated Novartis for successfully complying with the reforms. 
Yet even in a case with such transparency, the openness had its limits. The details of Novartis’s compliance efforts were not filed on the court docket and remain secret.

1454,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Lufthansa usurps Ryanair to regain place as Europe's biggest airline,"BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) has overhauled Ryanair to retake the crown as Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers after the Irish budget carrier was forced to cut thousands of flights because of pilot rostering problems.
The Lufthansa group as a whole carried 130 million passengers last year, it said on Wednesday. The equivalent figure from Ryanair was 129 million, meaning Ryanair (I:RYA) slips behind Lufthansa after overtaking it in 2016.
Lufthansa has grown rapidly, having taken over Brussels Airlines at the end of 2016 and is aiming to grow its budget brand Eurowings to become Europe's third largest point-to-point carrier.
The group, which also includes Swiss and Austrian Airlines, has also benefited from the collapse of German rival Air Berlin in the latter part of 2017. Air Berlin, Germany's second largest carrier, ceased flying in October. 
Ryanair, meanwhile, has curbed its growth plans after a pilot rostering issue left it without enough standby pilots to fly its planes, forcing it to cancel 20,000 flights. 
""Next year, as we grow to 140 million passengers, we expect to overtake Lufthansa again, unless they acquire some other airline to boost their figures,"" Ryanair said in an e-mailed statement.
Ryanair and Lufthansa were both ahead of rival IAG (L:ICAG), the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, which carried 104.8 million people in 2017, an increase of 4 percent.
Franco-Dutch Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) reported a 5.6 percent rise in group passenger numbers to 98.7 million, helped by its low-cost carrier Transavia.
Lufthansa was already the largest European airline in terms of distance, or revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), as it operates flights over both long and short distances, while Ryanair flies only short-haul routes.

Most airlines use RPK as their main measure of traffic, however Ryanair does not provide this in its monthly updates.

1469,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 10:48AM ET</span>",U.S. yields at 10-month high on report China may slow U.S. bond purchases,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major government bond yields hit multi-month highs and world stock indexes fell on Wednesday following a report that Chinese officials have recommended slowing or halting purchases of U.S. government bonds.
The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury hit a 10-month high, while the dollar slumped against a basket of currencies following the Bloomberg News report.
The Chinese officials, who were not named, said the market for U.S. government bonds is becoming less attractive relative to other assets, according to the report. They also cited trade tensions with the United States as a reason to slow Treasury purchases, the report said.
""It's pretty significant. That takes an important buyer out of the market at the same time you're taking the most important buyer out of the market - the U.S. Fed,"" said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategists at Robert W. Baird & Co in Sarasota, Florida. 
""It's upsetting the supply and demand balance if the report is true. Who's going to replace the demand side?""
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 10/32 in price to yield 2.5825 percent, from 2.546 percent late on Tuesday. It earlier rose to 2.597 percent, the highest since March 15.
China is the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt, with $1.19 trillion in Treasuries as of October 2017, data from the Treasury Department show. 
Germany's 10-year bond yield hit its highest level since the October European Central Bank meeting when policymakers first announced the extension of its bond-buying scheme, with one trader citing heavy supply as the latest trigger for the move. 
A combination of factors has pushed global bond yields higher in recent weeks, with global growth and higher oil prices leading investors to speculate that the world's major central banks might withdraw from their stimulus program sooner rather than later. 
Some investors saw a reduction of bond purchases by the Bank of Japan this week as a potential indication of this. [nL4N1P41ZO]
Analysts also said the rise in yields across the board is fuelling speculation as to whether this is the start of a sustained bear market for bonds.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 52.2 points, or 0.21 percent, to 25,333.6, the S&P 500 lost 6.67 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,744.62 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 32.02 points, or 0.45 percent, to 7,131.56.
U.S. stocks have had a strong start to the year, with the S&P and the Nasdaq having closed at record highs on every single day in 2018, buoyed by optimism over global economic growth and expectations of a strong quarterly earnings.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.46 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.11 percent.
The dollar index had its biggest single-day drop against the Japanese yen in nearly eight months.
The dollar index fell 0.48 percent, with the euro up 0.48 percent to $1.1992.
The Japanese yen strengthened 1.15 percent versus the greenback at 111.40 per dollar.
Crude oil prices hit new multi-year highs as OPEC-led production cuts and healthy demand helped to balance the market.
U.S. crude rose 0.64 percent to $63.36 per barrel and Brent was last at $69.00, up 0.26 percent.

“People who own the businesses, they now own 20 percent more of the domestic earnings,” Buffett, chief executive of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  . (NYSE:BRKa), said in an interview on CNBC Wednesday.
Describing the change as a “big deal,” he gave as an example Berkshire Hathaway’s BNSF Railway.
“The government doesn’t own the assets of the business,” Buffett said. “We own 100 percent of the assets of BNSF, but we don’t own 100 percent of the profits. And we went from 65 to 79 percent of the profits of BNSF and that is a more than 20 percent increase.”
Still, when asked about whether he would have pushed lawmakers to vote for or against the legislation, he chose another route.
“I would have had a different bill,” he said. “If I did it as a representative of Berkshire shareholders, I would have had to vote for it.”
Here are some of his other comments:

Berkshire Vice Chairman Charles Munger joined Buffett in the interview and also addressed succession at the conglomerate, saying shareholders probably have “seven or more good years coming out of Warren.”
Asked how many they had for him, Munger, 94, said: “Not very many.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York-based real estate investment company Cadre has partnered with  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) to allow the bank's private wealth management clients to invest through the startup's platform. 
Goldman Sachs clients have committed to investing $250 million in properties through Cadre's platform so far, the companies said on Wednesday.
The startup takes advantage of technology to make it easier and less costly for accredited individual investors - who must meet U.S. securities regulations for annual income of at least $200,000 or a net worth topping $1 million - and institutions to buy small stakes in U.S. commercial real estate online. Cadre says it offers a better alternative to real estate funds. 
Cadre was co-founded in 2014 by its chief executive, Ryan Williams, along with brothers Joshua and Jared Kushner, part of a well known New York real estate family. Jared Kushner is a senior adviser and son-in-law of U.S. President Donald Trump, while Joshua Kushner is a venture capitalist. 
The company said it has closed more than $1 billion in total transaction value since launching.
Through the partnership, Goldman Sachs clients will be able to use Cadre's platform to pick investments identified by Cadre's team.
""Cadre is offering a high-quality, diversified way to invest in real estate, with more transparency and lower fees,"" Williams said in an interview. 
Goldman's partnership with Cadre highlights sustained interest by large banks in working with young financial technology companies that are seeking to make financial services more user friendly and accessible. 

In June, Goldman Sachs was among the investors in a $65 million equity financing round in Cadre. The investment was led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from others including Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital, Ford Foundation, General Catalyst, Khosla Ventures and Joshua Kushner's Thrive Capital.

1483,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 09:09AM ET</span>",DoubleLine's Gundlach predicts S&P will post negative return in 2018,"By Jennifer Ablan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - While U.S. stocks are now in an ""accelerating phase,"" billionaire investor Jeffrey Gundlach is predicting that the S&P 500 will post a negative rate of return in 2018.
One of the best investments for 2018 will be commodities, Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital and known on Wall Street as the ""Bond King,"" said on an investor webcast on Tuesday.
The S&P 500 ""may go up 15 percent in the first part of the year, but I believe, when it falls, it will wipe out the entire gain of the first part of the year with a negative sign in front of it,"" Gundlach said.
Gundlach said his bearishness on the S&P and other risk assets including U.S. corporate bonds stems from the notion that the Federal Reserve has begun its era of ""quantitative tightening.""
He said if the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield goes above 2.63 percent, U.S. stocks will be affected. ""If the 10-year goes above 2.63 ... it will accelerate higher and equity markets are going to be spooked and maybe that's the cocktail that is coming our way.""
Gundlach, who manages $119 billion at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine, said investors are ""celebrating the magic moment of stronger economic growth domestically, stronger economic growth globally, stronger earnings."" He said overall he is seeing ""a lot of euphoria out there, a lot of bullishness"" on the equity markets.
Gundlach said the financial markets have not priced in a ""more hawkish"" European Central Bank. ""Maybe that's why the euro has started to rally,"" he said, adding: ""Maybe it will rally further.""
Gundlach said he believes the price on bitcoin has hit its peak. ""The high for bitcoin is in,"" he said. ""It's just a thing that is out there, unproven. I have a theory that bitcoin is very different than what people think. People think that it is tremendously safe and anonymous and get can't be hacked and all that stuff. I have feeling that it is the opposite.

""I do not own bitcoin. This type of investment is very, very different from my conservative DNA,"" Gundlach said.

""U.S. stocks have outperformed and are now close to our year-end price target with limited upside, while the backdrop for European stocks outperformance is intact,"" the U.S. bank's strategists said in a cross-asset note.
They increased their overweight in European equities from 2 percent to 3 percent relative to the benchmark, and cut their U.S. equities overweight to 1 percent from 2 percent.
The S&P 500 (SPX) has shot up more than 9 percent since the start of October 2017, while Europe's STOXX 600 has managed less than a third of that return over the same period. 
The cross-asset strategists kept their preference for equities over bonds, with credit the least favored, in a late cycle environment they said was heading for a ""tricky handoff"" at the end of the first quarter with PMIs likely to peak and inflation potentially rising.

""We think the best 'reflation' plays lie in being overweight energy and financial equities,"" they added.

1485,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Unregulated British firm draws Asian investors,"By Carolyn Cohn, Stanley Carvalho and Kirstin Ridley
LONDON/ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Financial.org, a UK company that describes itself as an education business and sponsors a Formula One team, is managing hundreds of thousands of dollars for Asian investors even though it is not licensed to engage in financial transactions, according to 17 people who say they have invested through the firm.
The 17 people, from China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and the UAE, told Reuters they had each given between $3,000 and $400,000 to Financial.org to invest.
""I have doubled my investments,"" said Azmi Tumpang, a former construction worker from Malaysia outside a gala dinner organized by Financial.org on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in late November.
Most of the people said their money had been invested in U.S. blue-chip stocks and that they had made a profit. Reuters was unable to verify whether the share transactions took place.
Financial.org is not on a publicly available list of companies authorized and regulated by Britain's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), to buy and sell stocks or bonds for clients. Offering investment services without regulatory permission is a criminal offence in Britain.
Financial.org, which has an office in London's Canary Wharf, declined to comment on whether it acted as an investment firm.
The company signed up two years ago with the UK's official company register as a real estate business, according to filings. The UK registrar of companies, Companies House, said it was preparing to strike off the firm on Jan. 23 because it had never filed accounts. If a company is struck off, it cannot continue to trade legally and its assets pass to the state.
UK-registered companies must by law be authorized and regulated by the FCA if they deal in securities such as shares and bonds for clients, even if the investors are outside Britain. Under FCA rules, this applies both to principals - parties investing on behalf of clients, and agents - firms including brokers that arrange for investments to take place.
The FCA declined to comment about whether Financial.org was operating illegally.
The regulator has previously warned of the dangers of investing through firms it has not authorized, as no independent checks have been made on their businesses. It said it had received reports of more than 8,000 cases of unauthorized businesses in the last financial year.
On the home page of its website, Financial.org says it is an education platform, providing ""financial knowledge and skills"". ""We do not deal with securities and receive any financial benefits from financial products and service providers,"" it says. However, elsewhere on its site, it also says it ""helps members to manage and oversee their investments"" and ""provides self-directed investors with brokerage services"".
INVESTOR ALERT
The Monetary Authority of Singapore last March placed Financial.org on an investor alert list of ""unregulated persons who, based on information received by MAS, may have been wrongly perceived as being licensed or authorized by MAS"", its website says. The authority said investors should ""exercise caution"" when dealing with companies on the list.
Malaysia's Securities Commission also placed Financial.org on a list of ""unauthorized websites/investment products/companies/individuals"" last year, according to its website.
The MAS and Malaysian commission both declined to comment on Financial.org and why they had placed it on alert lists.
Financial.org declined to comment on the two regulators' warnings.
The company has been a sponsor of British Formula One team Williams (DE:WGF1G) since May 2016, and its logo appears on the Williams Mercedes FW38 cars and team strips.
Williams declined to comment.
Most of the 17 people who spoke to Reuters said they had come into contact with Financial.org through referrals from acquaintances, often via social media. Six said they had received commissions from Financial.org for referring others.
Five of the people detailed how they made investments. They said they deposited money into the bank account of a third party, usually the person who referred them, who then transferred the funds to a Financial.org investment account.
The investors said they accessed their Financial.org account with a members-only area in Financial.org's website. Thirteen said they had withdrawn money regularly.
Tumpang said he had invested $30,000 through Financial.org over the last two years. Mohamad Mohamed Nordin, another Malaysian investor, said he had invested $400,000.
Vietnamese investor Albert Anthony, a fashion business manager, provided a screenshot of his account page which showed he had invested $100,000. Shella Vinarevi, from Indonesia, said the minimum investment for Financial.org was $3,000, which she had made.

1516,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 06:38AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Saudi Aramco working to raise cheap loans before IPO - banking sources,"By Davide Barbuscia and Tom Arnold
DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco is working to secure billions of dollars in cheap loans from banks seeking to strengthen their ties with the oil giant before its stock listing, banking and export credit agency (ECA) sources said. 
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) (Citi),  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation were advising on the transactions, which two sources said could raise at least $5 billion to $6 billion, all with ECA-backing.
The bid to raise funds is the latest indication of Saudi Arabia's push to ensure what could be the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO) goes ahead in 2018, despite market speculation that sale plans might be delayed or even shelved.
The loans will offer slim returns - probably less than 1 percent a year - but the sources said the banks hoped to position themselves for more work as the kingdom proceeds with selling up to 5 percent of Aramco in an IPO that could value the firm at $2 trillion.
For its part, Aramco wants to leverage its balance sheet before the IPO, after which it could face higher costs because, once listed, it would cease to be a solely state-owned entity benefiting from cheap funds available to sovereign borrowers.
ECAs offer loan guarantees and sometimes financing to help remove political and other risks facing exporters, encouraging trade and lowering the costs of international business.
""There's momentum for Aramco to tap this form of financing. If they did it after the IPO, they'd have to pay more,"" one banker said.
Citi was advising Aramco for loans backed by British and U.S. ECAs, Standard Chartered was advising on ECA funding from continental Europe and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation was advising on transactions backed by Asian ECAs, the sources said.
The bank mandates expire in 2018, one of the sources said.
Citi and Standard Chartered declined to comment. Aramco and Sumitomo Mitsui did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The sources said it was difficult to establish Aramco's precise needs due to its extensive spending plans and because the loans would finance both new and existing contracts.
Aramco has already obtained a $2 billion loan guaranteed by the UK Export Finance agency (UKEF). Citi had a lead role on that transaction.
It was now looking at deals which could involve the South Korean and Japanese ECAs, and at least one more deal that could involve a European ECA, the sources said.
Each of these new loans was likely to be in the range of $2 billion dollars, the sources added.
The ECA-backed loans would typically come with tenors of up to 10 years at interest rates generally below 1 percent a year, two banking sources said.
Such low costs were determined by the credit quality of the borrower, a sovereign entity, and the structure of ECA-backed deals in which the agencies take part of the risk.
But it also indicated the readiness of banks to accept lower returns ahead of the IPO, the sources said.
Saudi Aramco has invited banks pitching for roles in its stock market listing, including Citi and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), to meetings in the kingdom in coming weeks to make their case, banking sources told Reuters this month.

1517,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>",China Officials Are Said to View Treasuries Less Attractive,"(Bloomberg) -- Officials reviewing China’s foreign-exchange holdings have recommended slowing or halting purchases of U.S. Treasuries, according to people familiar with the matter.
China holds the world’s largest foreign-exchange reserves, at $3.1 trillion, and regularly assesses its strategy for investing them. It isn’t clear whether the recommendations of the officials have been adopted.
The market for U.S. government bonds is becoming less attractive relative to other assets, and trade tensions with the U.S. may provide a reason to slow or stop buying American debt, the thinking of these officials goes, according to the people, who asked not to be named as they’re not allowed to discuss the matter publicly. China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange didn’t immediately reply to a fax seeking comment on the matter.
The people didn’t specify why trade tensions would spur a cutback in Treasuries purchases, though foreign holdings of U.S. securities have sometimes been a geopolitical football in the past.
Read here about a 1990s episode regarding Treasuries, with Japan.
The investment strategies discussed in China’s review don’t concern daily purchases and sales, said the people. The officials recommended that China closely watch factors such as the outlook for supply of U.S. government debt, along with political developments including trade disputes between the world’s two biggest economies, when deciding whether to cut some Treasury holdings, the people said.
U.S. Treasuries dropped after Bloomberg reported the discussions, sending benchmark 10-year note yields to 2.58 percent, the highest since March, as of 10:45 a.m. in London. Yields were already climbing this week amid expectations the improving global economy will boost inflation pressures round the world, just as major central banks scale back their asset purchases.
Bond veteran Bill Gross says a bear market has begun, read about that here.
For most of last year, China was adding to its U.S. sovereign debt holdings, monthly Treasury Department data show. The stockpile climbed the most in six years in June, after people familiar with the matter said that month that China was prepared to increase its Treasury investments under the right circumstances. An appreciating currency in 2017 helped the country rebuild its foreign-exchange reserves.
Any reduction in Chinese purchases would come just as the U.S. prepares to boost its supply of debt. The Treasury Department said in its most recent quarterly refunding announcement, in November, that borrowing needs will increase as the Federal Reserve reduces its balance sheet and as fiscal deficits look set to widen.
President Donald Trump’s tax-cut package will reduce federal revenue by more than $1 trillion over the next decade, even after accounting for their beneficial effects on the U.S. economy, according to Congress’s tax scorekeeper.

1520,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Global air freight demand on track for a seven-year high: IATA,"(Reuters) - Demand for global air freight, measured in freight tonne kilometers, rose 8.8 percent in November, compared with a year earlier, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Wednesday.
The rise in November puts the air cargo industry on track for the strongest operational and financial performance since the post-global financial crisis rebound in 2010, IATA said.
The growth in freight demand, coinciding with the traditional period of strong demand seen in the fourth quarter, comes despite indicators pointing to air cargo having passed a cyclical peak, IATA said.
Available capacity rose 4.0 percent in the month, marking the 16th consecutive month of demand growth exceeding capacity growth, which is positive for industry load factors, yields, and financial performance, IATA said. Load factors increased by 2.2 percentage points to 49.1 percent.
""There are several indicators that 2018 will be a good year as well. In particular, buoyant consumer confidence, the growth of international e-commerce and the broad-based global economic upturn are cause for optimism as we head into the New Year"", Alexandre de Juniac, IATA Director General, said.

The recently agreed US tax reform bill may also help to support freight volumes in the period ahead, IATA added.

1524,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>",Ryanair keeps big investors onside after rocky 2017,"By Tom Pfeiffer and Maiya Keidan
LONDON (Reuters) - Several institutional investors are backing Ryanair to bounce back from a pilot rostering mess-up and a decision to recognize unions that jolted confidence in Europe's most profitable airline. 
The mishandling of staff holidays caused thousands of flight cancellations, angered passengers and helped pilots to secure union recognition for the first time in Ryanair's 32-year history, sending the share price down 9 percent in one day in December. [nL8N1OL4RU] 
The holiday rota errors were a rare serious slip-up by Chief Executive Michael O'Leary, whose formula of dirt cheap, no-frills travel has transformed the continent's airline sector and handed his shareholders big returns. 
O'Leary had said hell would freeze over before he would welcome unions into Ryanair. The company now says dialogue with organized labor will help the business. 
Analysts say it will inflate its costs and could reduce the flexibility that helped it steal chunks of business from traditional airlines such as Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF). 
Top shareholder HSBC Global Asset Managers has cut a quarter of its Ryanair stake, according to a filing last month. HSBC declined to comment on the decision. 
But other big Ryanair shareholders are maintaining or adding to their holdings. 
""Because the share price has fallen, it has become, in our opinion, compellingly attractive,"" said Rory Powe, who manages European growth stocks at Man GLG and added to his Ryanair holdings in December. ""I don’t see Ryanair’s cost advantage being eroded by anything more than an immaterial amount."" 
Ryanair's longer-term record as an investment may help explain why top shareholders appear reluctant to drop it. 
The shares are up 150 percent over four years as it tackled a reputation for shoddy services and wooed higher-paying business passengers. Shares in its most successful rival,  Easyjet  (L:EZJ), have barely moved in that time. 
Analysts agree upcoming union negotiations will be crucial, amid questions over whether O'Leary's pugnacious management style is still appropriate for a company that was once an upstart challenger but now dominates European short-haul air travel. 
""A unionized Ryanair will still be profitable, cash generative and value-creating in our view but will be a markedly different company,"" HSBC analysts said last week, rating the shares ""reduce"". 
HSBC believes Ryanair unit costs could rise by 20 percent by 2020, with unionization and the localization of contracts, and that Ryanair's talks with continental unions could be tough, ""...and airline strikes in these markets are commonplace"". 
Bernstein sees a short-term rebound in the stock but believes Ryanair is ""cornered"" - profitability per passenger will fall if it continues to expand at the current pace but a slowdown in expansion will cause earnings to decline. 
""CATEGORY KILLER""
Other big Ryanair institutional investors acknowledge the challenges but believe that, with its cost base still below rivals, it can still make bumper profits as the euro zone economy picks up steam, industry capacity growth eases and prices recover. 
Ryanair has said it does not expect its costs to increase significantly. 
Jonathan Fearon, who runs the Aberdeen Standard European Growth fund, said the market seemed to be pricing in the idea that Ryanair's cost advantage will disappear. 
But he said staff costs were only one of many advantages in Ryanair's broad ""ultra-low-cost"" business model. 
Fearon indicated Ryanair was still a favorite: it was a ""category killer"" in short-haul that stood to gain from Alitalia's troubles and as industry capacity growth slows, boosting fares. 
Tony Gibb, investment director at another Ryanair shareholder, Fidelity, said the company's significant cost advantage, even over EasyJet, was ""sustainable"" and last month's share slump was ""probably overplayed"". 
""There is negative press and the share price has come off quite meaningfully but that is probably more of an opportunity than anything else,"" said Gibb.

1526,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 05:01AM ET</span>",Gross Calls Bond Bear Market as 10-Year Yield Passes 2.5%,"(Bloomberg) -- The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield climbed to the highest level in about 10 months, leading Bill Gross at Janus Henderson Group to declare a bond bear market just as a deluge of debt sales began.
The benchmark U.S. yield rose seven basis points on Tuesday to top 2.55 percent for the first time since March, and the Treasury curve steepened the most in over a year, as a looming glut of bond supply from the U.S., the U.K., Japan and Germany coincided with a surprise cut in purchases of long-dated Japanese government bonds by the Bank of Japan. The securities steadied on Wednesday.
Even though central bank watchers said the BOJ’s actions aren’t interpreted as an imminent shift from ultra-accommodative policy, it’s yet another sign of central banks stepping back from global bond markets -- just as the U.S. Treasury is about to sell the most debt in eight years. Add to that rising market expectations around inflation, and traders are starting to wager that Treasuries are on the verge of a big breakout from their tightest range in a half-century.
“We’re seeing a lot of overseas buyers who would come in every time we’d have a move close to these levels who aren’t coming in anymore,” said Michael Franzese, New York-based head of fixed-income trading at MCAP LLC, a broker-dealer. “That’s kind of scaring me a little bit. One eye is constantly on the exit button.”
The 10-year yield was little changed at 2.5476 percent at 9:24 a.m. London time on Wednesday.
The yield curve from two to 10 years steepened by six basis points on Tuesday, the most since November 2016. DoubleLine Capital chief investment officer Jeffrey Gundlach said markets had not priced in shrinking central bank balance sheets. The billionaire bond manager said after the market closed that the 10-year yield could head higher if it traded past last year’s high of 2.63 percent with 3.25 percent “plausible” some time in 2018.
Gross’s Call
“Bond bear market confirmed,” Gross said in a Twitter posting on Tuesday, noting that 25-year trend lines had been broken in five- and 10-year Treasury maturities. The billionaire fund manager at Janus said last year that 10-year yields persistently above 2.4 percent would signal a bear market, though added in an interview last week that even in such an environment, investors probably won’t lose a lot of money.
Of course, several money managers have been premature in calling the end of the three-decade bull market in Treasuries over the years. And others have a higher yield target. Scott Minerd, who oversees $250 billion as chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners, said in an email Tuesday that the long-term trend for bonds remains in place until the 10-year yield exceeds 3 percent. Even in that scenario, yields may drop one final time, he said.
Semantics of a bear market aside, the more pressing issue for traders is the more than $60 billion in combined bond sales by the U.S., the U.K., Japan and Germany set to take place this week, which may test the appetite of investors for debt at current levels. American companies on Tuesday also issued the most investment-grade debt this year.
Auction Slate
The U.S. saw above-average buyside demand for its $24 billion three-year note sale Tuesday, though some strategists predicted increased appetite since the maturity yields the most in a decade. The next hurdle comes Wednesday, when Treasury auctions $20 billion of 10-year notes.
U.S. sovereign issuance is expected to rise broadly in 2018 on the back of the budget deficit and recently passed tax legislation. Meanwhile, support for lower yields may wane as the Federal Reserve reduces its balance sheet and other central banks contemplate exit strategies.
The Bank of Japan’s decision to trim its regular purchase of longer-dated debt sparked some nervousness among traders and helped spark the move higher in U.S. yields. While investors are right to expect a longer-term shift toward normalization by the BOJ, the most recent move by the central bank doesn’t have any new policy implication, said Junko Nishioka, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in Tokyo and a former BOJ official.
Yields kept rising higher as investors ramped up bets on quicker inflation. The 10-year breakeven rate, a proxy for the annual inflation rate the market expects for the next decade, climbed Tuesday to as high as 2.05 percent, the highest in 10 months. The increase shows traders may be bracing for Friday’s consumer price index data, which some see as the final hurdle to elevated Treasury yields.
Yet even if they keep climbing, the consensus is for 10-year yields to remain below Minerd’s 3 percent line in the sand for a bear market. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey calls for the rate to climb to 2.92 percent at year-end.

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 05:00AM ET</span>",German union IG Metall to step up strike action ahead of wage talks,"By Maria Sheahan
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Powerful German union IG Metall said it would step up industrial action ahead of a round of negotiations with employers as it pushes for higher wages and the right to shorter hours for 3.9 million German workers.
""We have started with warning strikes and will widen them in the coming days,"" IG Metall chief Joerg Hofmann told German daily Passauer Neue Presse in an interview published on Wednesday.
In the state of North Rhine-Westphalia alone, the industrial heartland of Germany, more than 20,000 workers at companies including industrial group Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) and automotive supplier Benteler have been called on to strike on Wednesday, according to a spokesman for IG Metall.
To the south in Bavaria, rallies are planned at firms including engineering group  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn).
Around 80,000 German industrial workers have taken action since the start of last week in support of IG Metall's wage claims, and further walkouts have been announced for Thursday.
With the economy in robust health and unemployment at record lows, the country's biggest union is demanding an inflation-busting 6 percent pay hike this year.
It has also called for a right to reduce weekly hours to 28 from 35 and return to full-time employment after two years for shift workers and those who need to care for children or elderly relatives.
Employers have so far offered 2 percent plus a one-off 200 euro ($239) payment in the first quarter and have rejected demands for a shorter work week unless hours could be increased temporarily as well.
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Under the current proposal, companies would need to hire part-time workers to make up for those who cut their hours, the head of regional employers' group Nordmetall said in an interview.
""Where am I supposed to find them when there's a lack of skilled workers?"" Nico Fickinger asked on German radio station NDR Info.
The union has meanwhile made it clear it is drawing a line in the sand regarding the right to shorter working hours, saying employers had a social responsibility to contribute to issues related to health and family.
Hofmann told Passauer Neue Presse that the additional cost to employers could be around 1 percent of overall wage costs.
Talks between unions and employers' associations are set for Thursday in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, where Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) Porsche, Mercedes-Benz maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and automotive suppliers including Bosch [ROBG.UL] are based.
Next door in Bavaria, home to companies such premium carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG) and truck maker MAN (DE:VOWG_p), negotiations will resume on Jan. 15, and to the north in North Rhine-Westphalia on Jan. 18.

1531,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 03:30AM ET</span>","UK watchdog warns on spreadbetting, knocking shares","(Reuters) - There are ""areas of serious concern"" in Britain's contracts for differences (CFDs) market, the country's financial watchdog said on Wednesday following a review, knocking shares of spreadbetting companies.
Shares in CMC Markets (L:CMCX), IG Group (L:IGG) and Plus500 (L:PLUSP) fell by more than 7 percent, with IG Group the biggest percentage loser in the FTSE Midcap Index (FTMC) in early trade.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it had sent a letter to all providers and distributors of these products to retail customers to ensure they ""pay due regard to the interests of customers and treat them fairly"".
""We believe there is a high risk that firms across the sector are not meeting our rules and expectations when providing and distributing CFDs. As a result, consumers may be at serious risk of harm from poor practices in this sector,"" the FCA said. 
CFDs let investors bet on both the direction a share price, currency or other financial product will move, and the extent of the change in price, and there is no stamp duty.
The industry is regulated by European Union rules which have no caps on leverage. That means investors can take out bets that are far larger than their initial outlay, offering greater potential returns but also running the risk of huge losses.
The European Securities and Markets Authority last month said it was considering restricting the marketing, distribution or sale to retail clients of CFD products.
The British regulator expressed concerns over the way the products were marketed to retail customers and identified flawed due diligence processes, conflicts of interest and poor remuneration practices.
The majority of retail customers who bought CFD products on either an advisory or discretionary basis lost money, the FCA said after it reviewed 34 firms over a 12 month period. 
Shares in leading British spread-betting firms fell last year after the FCA warned it had serious concerns about retail buying of CFD products.
The watchdog on Wednesday said it identified one CFD provider whose arrangements were so poor that it intends to take further action. It also said several providers had said they intend to stop providing CFDs to firms that distribute this product on an advisory or discretionary basis. 
Others have already stopped distributing CFDs on these bases to retail consumers.
The FCA said firms should define their target market precisely and not rely on broad investor descriptions such as 'experienced', 'sophisticated' and 'financially literate'. Firms should also look at how they communicate with clients and due diligence around taking on new distributors, among other measures. 
The regulator said many firms failed to provide satisfactory evidence that they complied with the FCA's remuneration code with some paying staff on a 100 percent variable basis. It also said companies were not properly managing conflicts of interest.
""At some firms, senior staff held several roles; for example, at one firm the CEO was also head of compliance. This amounts to a conflict and so should require the firm to put in place relevant controls,"" it said.
British spread-betting firms IG Group (L:IGG), CMC Markets (L:CMCX) and Plus500 (L:PLUSP) did not respond to requests for immediate comment.

1532,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 03:23AM ET</span>","Bayer, J&J win reversal of $28 million verdict in Xarelto lawsuit","By Nate Raymond and Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - A Pennsylvania state court judge on Tuesday overturned a $27.8 million jury award to an Indiana couple who accused  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) and Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) of failing to warn of internal bleeding risks of their drug Xarelto, the companies said.
Judge Michael Erdos, in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, ruled following a hearing on the drugmakers' motion to reverse the December verdict, which was their first trial loss in litigation over the blood thinner, the companies said.
J&J's Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc unit and Bayer, which jointly developed Xarelto, in separate statements welcomed the decision and said they will continue to defend against the allegations in related litigation.
""Bayer stands behind the safety and efficacy of Xarelto and will continue to vigorously defend it,"" Bayer said in a statement.
The verdict came in a lawsuit by Lynn Hartman, who was prescribed Xarelto to prevent strokes as a result of atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat.
Hartman said that she took the drug for approximately one year and in June 2014 was hospitalized with severe gastrointestinal bleeding, which she blamed on Xarelto. She has since recovered.
Hartman and her husband sued the drugmakers in 2015. A jury in December awarded $1.8 million in compensatory damages and $26 million in punitive damages.
The lawsuit was one of around 21,400 that J&J says are pending in federal and state courts blaming injuries on Xarelto. The trial was the first to result from roughly 1,400 Xarelto cases pending in the Philadelphia court. 
Michael Weinkowitz, a lawyer for the couple, said the decision related to a ""very narrow issue related to Mrs. Hartman's prescribing physician."" He said he looked forward to trying the next series of Xarelto-related cases in Philadelphia.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Xarelto in 2011. It is prescribed for people with atrial fibrillation, a common heart rhythm disorder, and to treat and reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms. 
But plaintiffs contend Xarelto was unreasonably dangerous and that J&J and Bayer failed to warn patients about a serious risk of uncontrollable, irreversible bleeding in emergencies.
Bayer and J&J contend Xarelto's label adequately warns of bleeding risks.

Federal juries have cleared the companies of liability in three previous trials. The latest verdict in the federal litigation came in August in the case of a Mississippi woman.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's Halkbank is looking to secure a syndicated loan and issue foreign currency bonds when conditions are right, it said in a statement to Reuters, after one of its executives was convicted in the United States of evading sanctions on Iran.
The majority state owned lender has allocated some $7.6 billion project financing loans for 63 projects as of this month, as it focuses on lira funding resources to provide loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises.
A U.S. jury this month found Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a Halkbank executive, guilty of helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions. He was convicted on five of six counts he faced, including bank fraud and conspiracy, in Manhattan federal court.
Following the conviction Halkbank said it had adhered to national and international regulations and it was not a party in the U.S. court case.

In the statement to Reuters, the lender also said that it allocated loans as guaranteed in the North Marmara Highway Project, while it said an increase in the loan was not on agenda.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 02:03AM ET</span>",China's top developers poised for strong sales as debt woes linger,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's large developers are tightening their hold on the country's real estate market, capturing an ever-larger share even as sales growth is expected to slow and worries about debt persist.
According to the U.S. investment bank Citi, the top 10 China developers are forecast to achieve close to 35 percent market share this year, up from around 27 percent now. They held just 14.2 percent of the market in 2012.
The number of developers posting more than 50 billion yuan in sales increased to 40 in 2017 from 25 in 2016, with sales growth of 53 percent to 84 percent, real estate developer CREIS said. The number of smaller developers, with sales between 10 billion and 50 billion yuan, fell to 104 from 106.
And although the total number of home transactions is expected to drop about 5 percent, securities firms and rating agency analysts said Hong Kong-listed developers could see 30 percent sales growth on average this year, compared with an average of 40 percent growth in 2017.
But the growth will not be without risk. Ramped-up land purchases mean the developers will add debt, throwing uncertainty into the stated plans of some to deleverage.
China  Evergrande  (HK:3333) and  Sunac  China (HK:1918) had the highest gearing ratios at more than 200 percent in the first half of last year. Both said in October they intended to reduce their debt ratio, but neither halted their buying sprees. 
If there is a market correction, developers' liquidity will be tested. But Standard & Poor director Christopher Yip said even in that scenario, he didn't see a large impact.
""We don't think there'll be a big probability for rated developers to be unable to repay their debt other than very weak ones with poor liquidity and refinancing prospects; others should have secured the financing before they buy land,"" Yip said.
Several major developers told Reuters that they were confident in double-digit sales growth this year. The companies could not be identified as the information is not yet public.
""Last year we sold so many flats, we'll need to replenish; our land acquisition budget has to be larger than last year because our size is also larger,"" said a senior executive of a Shanghai-based developer, who declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media.
A softening but still resilient property market, underpinned by steady prices, would be welcome news for both China's policymakers and developers. Beijing is eager to keep the market stable as the government tackles an alarming build-up in debt.
Many investors are overlooking debt risks and focusing more on revenue, as evidenced by surging share prices.
China property stocks were among the best performers in Hong Kong in 2017, propelled by robust sales, with Evergrande up 480 percent, Sunac jumping 460 percent, and  Country Garden  (HK:2007) climbing 270 percent. Nine other developers saw shares surge more than two-fold. 
Some analysts questioned whether the expansion rate of China's largest developers could be sustained. 
""China's property shares rallied in 2017 thanks to top-line growth, but this momentum will slow in 2018. The growth story this year will be weaker,"" said CLSA analyst Nicole Wong. ""Last year, many sales were from smaller cities, but as liquidity tightens, sales to these cities will be more difficult."" 
The price to earnings ratio of the China property sector rebounded last year after the share rally, but it was still at relatively low levels. 
BUYING SPREE
The larger developers, despite sounding notes of caution, have continued to aggressively pursue growth.
According to data by property researcher CREIS, Evergrande bought a total gross floor area of 16.2 million square meters in the second half of 2017, compared to 9.7 million in the first six months, via both public land auction and mergers and acquisitions. Sunac bought 520,000 square meters in the second half, a slowdown from 1.4 million from January to June.
Country Garden,  China Vanke  (HK:2202) (SZ:000002) and Evergrande breached the 500 billion yuan ($76.93 billion) mark for annual sales for the first time in 2017, according to CREIS.
Top-performing developers spent 40 to 50 percent of their sales revenue on land acquisitions last year, CREIS said, much higher than smaller rivals, which spent 27-36 percent of sales revenue. 
While big companies splurged 74 percent more on land purchases than the previous year, a bigger percentage rise went to smaller cities as tightening policies took hold elsewhere. 
China has imposed measures to crack down on property speculation since early 2016, and China's home price growth is likely to stall in 2018 as the boom in smaller cities is expected to lose steam, while measures to tighten credit and other property curbs constrain the market, a Reuters poll showed.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) said it is considering building a car plant in Southeast Asia with Indonesia and Vietnam possible locations - part of efforts to diversify after a sales slump in China.
The automaker does not have a car manufacturing factory in Southeast Asia, although it has some pure assembly operations in Indonesia and Vietnam where cars are made from ""knock-down"" kits comprised of major component groups.
A diplomatic row between Beijing and Seoul last year over the South Korea's planned deployment of U.S. anti-missile defense system THAAD has hurt Hyundai and other South Korean firms that are highly reliant on the Chinese market.
Hyundai expects its China sales to reach about 900,000 vehicles in 2018, a recovery from levels last year, vice chairman and heir apparent Chung Eui-sun also said on the sidelines of the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, according to a company spokeswoman. 

Hyundai has not disclosed estimates for 2017 China sales but sales of 900,000 would still be far below its production capacity of 1.65 million vehicles in its biggest market. Chung added that Hyundai is planning to enter China's fuel cell electric car market, after the automaker unveiled its new fuel cell electric vehicle, NEXO, with an estimated driving range of 370 miles, at the show.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Nelson Peltz has a message for America's corporate chiefs; when he calls they do not automatically have to fear for their jobs.
Peltz's $13 billion Trian Fund Management is widely regarded as one of the world's most influential activist investment firms, holding board seats at companies from Wendys Co (O:WEN) to  General Electric  Co (N:GE).
Unlike other activists who often unseat CEOs, Peltz, 75, told Reuters Breakingviews on Tuesday that he prefers to work alongside management in making companies like Bank of New York Mellon Corp (N:BK) and  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ), raise sales, cut costs and earn more.
And he worried how rivals' tactics are impacting a sector of the investment world that has attracted newcomers who are eager to cash in on the riches industry veterans like Peltz and Carl Icahn have earned over the last decades.
""The word activist has come to mean a fight, it has come to mean short term,"" Peltz said, adding ""We are really not that concerned about the next quarters numbers because we will be around for the next 28 of them.""
In a wide ranging interview, he called the technical aspects of proxy voting ""busted"", praised President Donald Trump for getting things done, and worried electronic commerce company Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) holds too much sway over prices for the goods it sells.
But mostly he sought distinguish Trian by saying that the firm usually sticks around for seven years and brings an ownership mentality to the board room.
Known for writing white papers full of suggestions, Peltz said he wants to work collaboratively with Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) chief David Taylor where he will join the board in March after a bitter, expensive and long fight for a seat.
""What we do is come with a plan to make a company better. We never come with a plan to throw out the CEO or to embarrass anyone,"" Peltz said.
This is particularly noteworthy as CEOs at companies including  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG),  Buffalo Wild Wings Inc  (O:BWLD) and CSX Corp (O:CSX) exited in 2017 amid pressure from activist investors Bill Ackman, Mick McGuire and Paul Hilal.
Peltz criticized how U.S. investors are required to elect boards, worrying about conflicts of interest at proxy advisory firms and how some big shareholders vote. ""The proxy plumbing is busted,"" he said.
Turning to Trump, Peltz praised him for tax reform. ""I'm a results-oriented guy and I'm happy with what he's done. The markets have been great.""

(Reuters) - Domino's Pizza Inc (N:DPZ) said on Tuesday its chief executive, Patrick Doyle, will leave the biggest U.S. pizza delivery chain in June and would be replaced by Richard Allison, currently president of its international business.
In after-market trading, shares in Domino's fell 2.8 percent to $201 following news of the pending departure of Doyle, who has been CEO since early 2010. He presided over a turnaround that improved the taste of the company's namesake product, invested in online ordering and promotions, and fueled explosive share gains. 
Doyle in a statement said he had accomplished several goals, including making the company No. 1 in its category, but did not elaborate on his plans.
Domino's did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Domino's reworked its U.S. pizza recipe in December 2009, when Doyle was president of the chain, and he is perhaps best known for admitting in commercials and news interviews that the company's pizza simply did not taste good.
The campaign, which included focus group comments comparing Domino's crusts to cardboard and dubbing the product the ""worst excuse for pizza I've ever had,"" was widely seen as a marketing win for Domino's and helped fuel its turnaround. 
Company shares, which traded at $7.75 on Dec. 1, 2009, closed at $206.71 on Tuesday.
Doyle, who is 54 years old, is seen by some industry experts as a potential candidate for the CEO job at  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG). 
Chipotle has struggled to regain its footing after a string of food safety lapses in 2015 and is lagging other chains when it comes to digital efforts and delivery. 
A Chipotle spokesman declined comment on its CEO search.
Allison, who is 50 years old, will become CEO on July 1.

More than half of Domino's roughly 14,400 stores are located outside the United States.

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 08:00PM ET</span>",U.S. grain companies fear harm from new tax law,"By Mark Weinraub and Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The new U.S. tax law is poised to drive more control over the nation's grain supply to farmer-owned cooperatives, provoking concern among ethanol producers and privately run grain handlers that they could be squeezed out of the competition to buy crops.
Until now, the cooperatives, private companies and publicly traded firms had a more even opportunity to handle the grain supply used in everything from loaves of bread in supermarkets to livestock feed.
The changes mean massive grain traders such as Archer Daniels Midland Co, Bunge Ltd and Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) could find it difficult to source corn, soybeans and wheat.
The perceived threat to these companies stems from a provision included in the final stages of the law's passage in December. It gives farmers such a big tax deduction for selling their produce to agricultural cooperatives that private firms fear their grains supply will dry up.
The provision was championed by Republican farm state senators including John Thune of South Dakota and John Hoeven of North Dakota.
Privately held Cargill said on Tuesday it was surprised the provision was added to the bill at the last minute and is evaluating its potential impact. 
Rival ADM, which also produces ethanol, said it too was evaluating the provision and ""various potential solutions"" to it. 
The new tax law allows farmers and ranchers to claim a 20 percent deduction on all payments received on sales to cooperatives.
""It is going to put us out of business as a private if something is not changed right off the bat,"" said Doug Bell, president and general manager of Bell Enterprises Inc, which operates grain elevators in central Illinois.
""There is just no reason whatsoever why a farmer would do business with anyone other than a co-op.""
The deductions could come as a massive boon to cash-strapped U.S. grain farmers, who have struggled for at least four years amid a global grain glut and sluggish commodity prices.
Some farmers seeking to take advantage of the new deduction are already asking about transferring grain they have stored at private elevators and selling it to cooperatives, Bell said. An association that represents cooperatives also has received questions from people who want to open new cooperatives.
The change focuses on a provision in the federal tax code that cuts taxes on proceeds from agricultural products – whether corn and soybeans, or milk and fresh fruit – that farmers and ranchers sell to farm cooperatives such as CHS Inc.
There is no comparable provision for farmers doing the same business with private or investor-owned companies.
""The advantage for the farmer is probably at least five times larger selling to a co-op versus not selling to a co-op,"" said Paul Neiffer, an accountant at CliftonLarsonAllen in Yakima, Washington. 
Neiffer said he has received hundreds of calls and emails from private elevators upset about the law.
Chuck Conner, president and chief executive of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, said his organization had begun to receive calls from people asking questions about starting a co-op to take advantage of the deduction.
""The producer/member deduction is more generous than most of us thought possible a few months ago,"" he said in an email to members.
The number of U.S. farm cooperatives has been steadily shrinking in recent years, as they scramble to consolidate and stay competitive amid the merger frenzy of major seed and chemical companies. 
There were 1,953 farmer, rancher and fishery co-ops in 2016 in the United States, down 4.6 percent from a year earlier, according to the most recent U.S. Department of Agriculture data. They handled $44.3 billion in net sales of grains in 2016, down 33 percent from a $66.3 billion peak in 2013.
CHS, the largest U.S. agricultural cooperative, said the new law ensures that ""that cooperatives continue to be a driver of economic growth in rural America.""

1549,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 07:12PM ET</span>","Toyota, Mazda to build $1.6 billion plant in Alabama: sources","By David Shepardson and Bernie Woodall
(Reuters) - Alabama will be the site of a new $1.6 billion Toyota Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp auto plant, a victory for President Donald Trump who had prodded manufacturers to build new U.S. facilities and threatened tariffs on foreign production, sources said on Tuesday.
The plant, which will employ up to 4,000 people and produce about 300,000 vehicles a year, will be located in Huntsville, Alabama, and is a boon for the state, where Toyota has a large engine plant and an existing network of automotive suppliers.
A formal announcement by company and state officials is expected on Wednesday in Montgomery, sources briefed on the matter said.
The new plant --in a state Trump won by 28 points in 2016 -- could be a political boost to the Republican president, who has urged automakers to build plants in the United States and add jobs. The companies said they expect the plant to open in 2021.
Trump tweeted in March he wanted ""new plants to be built here for cars sold here."" The White House did not immediately comment on Tuesday.
The announcement also comes at a time of declining U.S. auto industry sales, so it could exacerbate overcapacity and add pressure to cut prices. U.S. new vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2017, after hitting an all-time record high in 2016, and are expected to fall further in 2018.
Details of an anticipated tax and incentive package for the investment were not yet known. It has been reported the companies sought at least $1 billion in incentives.
A Toyota spokesman declined to comment, except to say an announcement was expected soon. A Mazda spokeswoman also declined to comment.
In recent months, the companies had narrowed their choices down to sites in Alabama and North Carolina.
Local media last month said the leading site under consideration was in northern Alabama's Limestone County, near Toyota's large engine plant in Huntsville. In September Toyota announced a $106 million technology upgrade for the Huntsville plant. 
A Chamber of Commerce of Huntsville website for the ""Huntsville Mega Site"" touts the fact it has been ""certified as development-ready."" The commerce chamber, local and state officials declined to comment on Tuesday on plans for the plant.
A year ago, President-elect Trump criticized Toyota and threatened hefty tariffs against the Japanese automaker if it built its Corolla sedan for the U.S. market in Mexico.
""Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax,"" Trump posted on Twitter in early 2017.
Toyota and Mazda announced plans for a new plant in August. Toyota said it would shift production of Corollas from Canada to the new venture rather than in Guanajuato, and would build Tacoma pickups in Mexico instead. Mazda plans to build new crossover SUVs at the plant.
Trump praised the joint venture announcement, saying in August on Twitter: ""Toyota & Mazda to build a new $1.6B plant here in the U.S.A. and create 4K new American jobs. A great investment in American manufacturing!""
In October, Toyota said it would scale back investment in a planned plant in Mexico by 30 percent to $700 million and cut planned annual capacity in half to 100,000 vehicles as it shuffles its production plans to meet market demands.
Toyota has 10 U.S. plants in eight states in an arc running from West Virginia through Kentucky, Indiana, Alabama, Mississippi and Texas.Toyota and Mazda announced a capital alliance in August and are exploring joint development of technologies for the basic structure of competitive electric vehicles.
Over the last 30 years Toyota, along with German and Asian automakers, has built a second auto industry in the United States, rivaling the operations of the Detroit Three automakers in size and employment, but with newer, and fewer unionized, plants.
States covet auto assembly plants because they typically pay above-average wages and spin off jobs at suppliers and service companies. Southern U.S. states have the advantage of good transportation infrastructure, business-friendly regulators and generally anti-union politicians.
The Alabama Department of Commerce shows 150 of the large automotive suppliers operate in the state, providing the logistical strength that Kristin Dziczek, a researcher at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan, said helped land the plant. 
Dziczek said that Alabama in 2017 was tied for fifth among U.S. states in auto production, at 9 percent with Tennessee. It was behind Michigan at 19 percent; Indiana at 12 percent, Kentucky at 11 percent; and Ohio at 10 percent.
""The impact of an auto assembly plant extends beyond its immediate economic impact, and that's why states offer robust incentives,"" said Dennis Cuneo, a site-selection consultant and former Toyota executive. ""It creates a halo effect that in turn helps attract other projects.""

Alabama spent an estimated $250 million to woo Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz to put an auto plant in Tuscaloosa two decades ago.

1550,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 05:54PM ET</span>",Icahn demands shake-up at U.S. shale producer SandRidge Energy,"By Taenaz Shakir and Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) -  SandRidge Energy  Inc's (N:SD) biggest shareholder, Carl Icahn, called on Tuesday for the replacement of two directors and the removal of a poison pill barring individual shareholders from accumulating more than 10 percent of the U.S. shale producer's stock.
The move was the latest in the billionaire investor's dispute with the Oklahoma City-based oil and gas firm, after he successfully lobbied the company's board last month to abandon a proposed $746 million purchase of rival  Bonanza Creek Energy Inc  (N:BCEI).
Icahn said in a letter to SandRidge Chairman John Genova that he wanted to nominate one new director, while the other would be determined by other large shareholders. Icahn did not specify which board members he would like removed, nor did he explain why he was not pushing for the entire five-person board to be replaced. Icahn did not respond to a request to comment but he lashed out in his letter at James Bennett, SandRidge's chief executive and director, for his leadership.  ""Your apparent disregard for any semblance of accountability to the owners of SandRidge reminds me of the medieval belief in the divine right of kings,"" Icahn wrote. SandRidge said it expects to meet next week with Icahn and other large investors in the company, adding that it values ""constructive shareholder dialogue."" It defended the poison pill, saying it does not bar shareholders from communicating with one another as long they did not form a group. SandRidge, which emerged from bankruptcy last year, had billed the Bonanza Creek deal as a key growth opportunity in the Denver-Julesburg Basin of Colorado. Icahn, SandRidge's largest shareholder with a 13.5 percent stake in the company, had called the deal ""value-destroying,"" citing the large amount of stock the company would have had to issue to fund it.  Icahn demanded the company change its bylaws so that large transactions require approval from four of the five board members, rather than a simple majority and to withdraw or amend the poison pill. SandRidge shares rose three cents to $21.09 on Tuesday.  Analysts at Coker Palmer Institutional said the muted share reaction was due to a recent run-up and the lack of direction beyond the proposed board shake-up in Icahn's letter.  
Icahn has not always been successful in agitating for change at energy companies. In 2016, his hand-picked director at Chesapeake Energy Corp (N:CHK) resigned in what was widely seen as a tacit admission that the investor's turnaround strategy was not working fast enough.

1551,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 05:53PM ET</span>",Massachusetts hedge fund manager pleads guilty to fraud,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - A Massachusetts hedge fund manager pleaded guilty on Tuesday after prosecutors accused him of misusing millions of dollars from investors to pay for lavish personal expenses like a sports car and to engage in a Ponzi-like scheme.
Yasuna Murakami, who managed Cambridge, Massachusetts-based MC2 Capital Management LLC and another investment advisory firm, pleaded guilty in federal court in Boston to one count of wire fraud.
Murakami was arrested last May. Under a plea agreement, prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence of eight years and one month in prison. Murakami, 44, is scheduled to be sentenced on April 9.
Murakami declined to comment outside after a court hearing. In court, he said that he was engaged in counseling for stress, anxiety and personal issues, matters that he called ""somewhat related to this case.""
According to securities regulators, from 2007 to 2016, Murakami and a business partner operated three hedge funds through two investment advisory businesses, MC2 Capital and MC2 Canada Capital Management LLC.
Prosecutors said Murakami schemed to defraud investors in a hedge fund he set up in 2011 that was managed by MC2 Canada and that allowed U.S. investors to gain exposure to a fund overseen by Toronto-based Donville Kent Asset Management.
After soliciting money from investors for MC2 Capital Canadian Opportunities Fund, Murakami misused investments for personal expenses like international travel and high-end department stores, according to a criminal complaint.
He also used investor funds to make personal investments in the MC2 Canadian fund; to pay for a black Nissan GT-R sports car; and to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors, prosecutors said.
In a related lawsuit, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Murakami and his partner, Avi Chiat, defrauded more than 50 investors in their three funds after raising more than $15 million.
The regulator said both men misled investors about the funds' performance. Murakami also stole more than $8 million and used another $1.3 million to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors by misusing funds from later ones, the SEC said.
The criminal case was filed after Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin brought an administrative action in January 2017 accusing Murakami of operating a Ponzi scheme.
The SEC's case against Chiat remains pending. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
The case is U.S. v. Murakami, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 17-cr-10346.

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>",Road to bitcoin ETF paved with red tape,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The going is getting tough for U.S. companies hoping to win the race to bring a bitcoin exchange-traded fund to market.
Bitcoin's 1,500 percent surge last year has stoked investor demand for any product with exposure to the red-hot asset. A host of companies are jostling to launch exchange-traded funds which would open up the cryptocurrency to a broad retail market.
But regulators are asking tough questions, and five fund managers this week shelved plans to launch ETFs based on bitcoin futures, citing concerns from the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission.
""We can expect the SEC to be increasingly watchful over any companies involved in bitcoin activity,"" said Marc Butler, a director at compliance management firm Intelligize. ""Investors should be warned. If it's too good to be true, then it probably is.""
The SEC has pending applications for at least 14 different bitcoin ETFs or related products, regulatory filings show.
A handful of funds have been knocked back. The SEC in March denied a request to list an ETF from investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, owners of the Gemini bitcoin exchange.
The Winklevoss fund is seeking to invest in bitcoin directly. Other fund firms staked their hopes on recently launched U.S.-listed bitcoin futures contracts, which promised a more stable base for ETFs than the largely unregulated virtual currency spot market. 
But on Monday, Rafferty Asset Management LLC, which manages the Direxion brand and hopes to list leveraged funds that would double bitcoin's daily price moves, disclosed that the SEC was concerned about the ""liquidity and valuation"" of bitcoin futures contracts. It said the regulator told it to withdraw its application until it could address those issues. 
On Tuesday, ProShare Capital Management LLC, Van Eck Associates Corp and First Trust Advisors LP said in filings that SEC staff asked them to shelve plans for bitcoin ETFs.
Direxion, ProShares, VanEck and the SEC declined to comment. First Trust did not immediately respond to an email.
Bitcoin (BTC=BTSP) was last down 1.5 percent at $14,779 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange. 
ENTHUSIASM UNCURBED 
The race to launch bitcoin funds is still likely to charge forward, analysts said, as fund managers rush to address the SEC's concerns and redesign their funds to placate the regulator. 
""This is being driven by retail demand,"" said Axel Merk, founder and chief investment officer of Merk Investments, which launched a physically backed gold ETF in 2014. ""If people are enthusiastic about bitcoin, then people are going to try to market a bitcoin ETF."" 
Merk said he knows of several funds that have examined the criticisms of the past filings and are determined to push through with their bitcoin ETF launches.
Some are also attempting indirect approaches that could provide bitcoin exposure via more traditional assets. 
Five fund managers, for instance, have filed proposals for funds that would invest primarily in stocks with exposure to bitcoin or blockchain, the technology used to record bitcoin transactions.
Thorny questions remain for funds that seek to trade in bitcoin futures, including the level of margin required to trade futures and the potential for bitcoin futures to trade at dramatically different prices than the cryptocurrency itself, according to two people who did not want to be identified revealing discussions they had with the SEC.
Regulatory concerns did not stop the market from opening up by way of futures, though scrutiny of digital currency contracts now appears to be ramping up.
The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission last month allowed CME Group Inc (O:CME) and CBOE Global Markets Inc (O:CBOE) to list bitcoin futures contracts, but recently sought to review its process for listing digital currency futures.
Still, some think that, head-spinning volatility of bitcoin aside, U.S. capital markets risk missing out on a burgeoning technology if they are too cautious.

""If the SEC doesn't start allowing products, the capital markets here in the United States will get left behind by those in Europe and Asia. That's always a concern,"" said Trace Schmeltz, a partner at Barnes & Thornburg in Chicago.

1554,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 05:08PM ET</span>",Target lifts profit forecast after holiday sales jump,"By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) -  Target  Corp (N:TGT) raised its quarterly profit and sales forecasts on Tuesday on the back of surging online sales and customer visits in November and December, putting the U.S. retailer on track for the best quarter in five years. 
The Minneapolis-based chain, whose shares closed up 3 percent at $69.14, raised its fourth-quarter profit forecast to $1.30-$1.40 per share from an earlier range of $1.05-$1.25.
That was well above analysts' average forecast of $1.22 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Target is slated to have poured $1 billion of last year's profits into an effort to boost sales, mainly by investing in online business and delivery options to take on Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
It has hired more staff, remodeled existing stores and focused on building small-format stores to reach more customers in suburbs. 
On Tuesday, the company said same-store sales rose 3.4 percent in November and December and that its online sales growth was on track to report its fourth straight year of more than 25 percent gains. 
""Target's brick-and-mortar customers are growing in their affinity to the Target online interface, pricing on hot products in the fourth quarter and the ability to deliver in time,"" Jim Fosina, chief executive of Fosina Marketing Group, said. 
The lack of strong retail and online players who sell both toys and electronics is likely to have helped the company keep its loyalists away from  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY) or bankrupt Toys R Us, Fosina said. 
Target raised its same-store sales growth forecast for the quarter ending January to 3.4 percent, from a prior forecast of flat to up 2 percent. 
Research firm Retail Metrics' President Ken Perkins said that, if that target were met, it would be the company's strongest quarterly gain since the first quarter of 2012.
Target's is the latest in a run of relatively upbeat holiday sales numbers from brick-and-mortar retailers who have suffered most from the huge gains made by Amazon and other online retailers over the past decade.
Department store chain  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) late on Tuesday reported a 1.2 percent rise in comparable store sales for November and December, helped in part by growth in online sales.
The upscale retailer also lifted the low end of its full-year earnings per share forecast by 5 cents to $2.90, keeping the top end unchanged at $2.95.
Shares of department store chain Kohl's (N:KSS) on Monday surged after it reported a 6.9 percent rise in same-store sales for the same months. 
Target said same-store sales in November and December gained in all five of its core merchandise categories: home, apparel, food & beverage, hardlines and essentials. 
Kitchen items from brands like Threshold, KitchenAid and Keurig, and cordless vacuums from Roomba and Dyson were popular gifting items. 
An exclusive furniture and household goods brand, co-designed by TV personalities Chip and Joanna Gaines, was also a hit after launching in November, the company said. 

Target's fourth-quarter profit forecast includes a 6 cent to 8 cent benefit from the newly approved reduction in Federal corporate tax rates.

BERLIN/HAMBURG (Reuters) - Germany's Continental (DE:CONG) is in talks with banks about a possible structural overhaul of the auto parts and tire maker and aims to flesh out its plans within six months, its finance chief said.
The Hanover-based group said on Tuesday it was in ""early stages"" of talks about possible structural changes to become more nimble as auto manufacturers are spending billions of euros on electric and self-driving technologies, confirming media reports earlier in the day.
""We are looking at the organization of Continental in its entirety,"" finance chief Wolfgang Schaefer said in an interview late on Tuesday after the group released core 2017 earnings.
Growing demand for electrification and driver-assistance technologies drove Continental's sales about 8 percent higher last year to around 44 billion euros, and the company expects a further increase to around 47 billion this year. 
But its adjusted operating margin may ease to around 10.5 percent this year amid spending on new tire-making facilities, after the profitability benchmark rose to a higher-than-expected 10.8 percent last year, it said.
With the auto industry wrapped up in a strategic transition to zero-emission cars and self-driving technology, carmakers and suppliers are repositioning their businesses and spinning off operations to focus more effectively on new technologies.
 Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) has said it may split parts of its business into separate legal entities, which may allow for a partial listing to raise funds to invest in new services such as autonomous and electric cars.
Parts makers such as Delphi (N:DLPH) and Autoliv (N:ALV) have spun off divisions to simplify their corporate structures and react to the changes in technology, moves cheered by investors who believe internal combustion engine cars are a sunset industry. 
Combustion engines are taking a hit from regulators, particularly those in Europe and China, who want to slash greenhouse gas and smog forming emissions on a fast timetable. That risk was exacerbated by VW's diesel emissions scandal.
Continental has said software and electronics products are the biggest drivers of growth at the Hanover-based firm which also makes fuel-injection systems and transmission-control units. It plans to boost total sales to more than 50 billion euros by 2020.
A possible separation of its so-called Powertrain business related to combustion engines is not on the agenda, CFO Schaefer said.
Investment banks have presented various ideas over the last couple of months, but no specific blueprint has emerged so far, a person familiar with the matter said.
""We highlight the pent-up strategic optionality of any potential future spin-offs of individual business units which could unlock value,"" London-based HSBC said in a Jan. 4 note, maintaining its ""Buy"" recommendation on Continental stock.
Shares in the group, which is 46 percent-controlled by the family that owns ball bearings maker Schaeffler (DE:SHA_p), jumped as much as 7.9 percent to a record high of 257.40 euros following the report, and closed 5.4 percent higher at 251.3 euros. 
Continental said a year ago it was reviewing its strategy for its Powertrain division after earnings at the business, whose products include transmission control units and fuel pumps, failed to meet expectations.
But it has also pledged to keep developing new products and systems for combustion-based power trains until at least 2025 when it expects demand for electric vehicles to start taking off on the back of continuing reductions in battery prices.
Bloomberg earlier reported Continental was in exploratory talks with advisers on a major overhaul or even a breakup of its business, citing people familiar with the matter.
It said Continental could create a holding company for its divisions and then list shares of the more profitable units, such as the tire business, or combine some operations with rivals.

""As of today, it is wide open if and which changes could result from these early evaluations,"" Continental said. ""To date, there are no plans which could be submitted for approval.""

US Trade Data, Fed Speakers 
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to show both US export and import prices fell in December to 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. Import prices year-on-year have been rising faster than broader consumer inflation amid an uptick in the price of fuel. 
Investors will also turn attention to a speech by FOMC member Bullard, who said recently that Donald Trump’s $1.5 trillion tax overhaul may spur economic growth but tempered expectation for a faster pace of rate hikes noting the subdued pace of inflation.
Ahead of the duo of reports the dollar, rose 0.16% against its rivals to 92.23.
Energy Information Administration Weekly Inventory Report 
A fresh batch of inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday is expected to show that U.S. crude stockpiles fell for the seventh-straight week.
Analysts forecast crude inventories fell by about 3.89 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 29.
Crude oil futures have made bold start to the week rising to their highest since May 2015 as investors expect the OPEC-led deal to curb output will continue to reduce excess supplies.
UK Manufacturing, Industrial Data 
Investors look to a duo of reports on manufacturing and industrial production for an insight into the progress on UK economic growth amid fresh political uncertainty.
Economists’ forecast manufacturing growth in November rose 0.3% from 0.1% in the previous month, while industrial activity is expected to have risen 0.4%.
The pound has come unstuck in the wake of Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to reshuffle the Cabinet. Some said they expected the Cabinet shuffle to strengthen May’s leadership but the opposite appears to have transpired amid a string of resignations."

(Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes extended the New Year rally to close at record levels on Tuesday on investor optimism ahead of quarterly earnings reports and hopes for easing tensions with North Korea.
Defensive S&P sectors - utilities, real estate and telecommunications - were out of favor, while bank stocks were boosted by rising U.S. 10-year Treasury yields. Healthcare stocks rose with the sector in focus on the second day of an industry conference.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq registered their sixth closing record highs in a row. The Dow also ended at record levels after it had snapped a 3-day run of closing highs in Monday's session.
Some investors were reassured that North and South Korea held their first talks in more than two years, which Washington described as a good first step in solving the North's nuclear missile program crisis. Pyongyang said it would not discuss weapons that were aimed only at the United States.
""The diplomacy taking place between North Korea and South Korea might circumvent some type of military action. Anything that would de-risk the peninsula would be viewed favorably by investors,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 102.8 points, or 0.41 percent, to 25,385.8, the S&P 500 gained 3.58 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,751.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.19 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,163.58.
Profits for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 11.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an 8-percent increase a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""There will be some noise there with tax adjustments, but the forward-looking comments ought to be pretty positive. Investors are buying into that,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
The S&P financial sector ended 0.8 percent higher after yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note hit a 10-month high after the Bank of Japan said it will trim its purchases of Japanese government bonds.
Interest-rate sensitive utilities and real estate sectors ended 1 percent lower while the telecommunications sector fell 1.8 percent.
While investors are hopeful about global economic growth and tax-cut led gains for corporate earnings, they are anxious about whether the tax-overhaul could overheat inflation and lead to a sharper than expected rise in interest rates.
After a lukewarm December jobs report, signs of a pickup in inflation could come in the monthly consumer price report due on Friday, on the same day that big U.S. banks are set to kick off the fourth-quarter earnings season.
The S&P healthcare sector closed 1 percent higher, boosted by a 1.6-percent rise in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), a 5-percent gain in Gilead and a 8.3-percent jump in Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) shares.
Chip stocks dragged on the technology sector, which fell 0.3 percent. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell 2.5 percent after  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) said computers with older Intel chips slowed noticeably after it released security patches. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.41-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 124 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 131 new highs and 24 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.77 billion shares, above the 6.3 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1571,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Uber reaches $3 million settlement with New York drivers over fees,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] agreed to pay up to $3 million to settle a proposed class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of 2,421 drivers in New York who accused the ride-sharing company of docking excessive fees from their fares.
A preliminary settlement was filed on Monday with the federal court in Brooklyn, New York, and requires approval by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis.
Drivers accused Uber of breach of contract for including sales tax and a ""Black Car Fund"" fee, which relates to workers' compensation, in fares when calculating service fees, thereby increasing the amounts owed.
They also accused Uber of false advertising for allegedly offering guaranteed compensation without disclosing the conditions, such as in an ad telling drivers they could ""DRIVE & MAKE $5,000 Guaranteed"" in their first month behind the wheel.
The San Francisco-based company denied all allegations, and settled without admitting wrongdoing to avoid the cost and inconvenience of litigation, according to the settlement.
Uber did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment.
The settlement covers Uber drivers who have used the Uber app to arrange rides in New York since Dec. 29, 2009, and whose claims are not subject to arbitration.
It follows Uber's agreement to pay more than $80 million to roughly 96,000 drivers in New York, after the company admitted in May to having inadvertently underpaid drivers for two-and-a-half years, court papers show.
Monday's settlement also calls for the dismissal of claims that Uber misclassified drivers who used the Uber app as independent contractors.
Lawyers for the drivers may collect fees equal to as much as one-third of the settlement fund.

The case is Ortega et al v Uber Technologies Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 15-07387.

1574,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 04:22PM ET</span>","Toyota expands U.S. Takata air bag recall to 600,000 extra vehicles","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it was expanding its safety recall involving Takata Corp front passenger air bag inflators to cover about 601,300 additional vehicles in the United States. [http://toyota.us/2CV24Wl]
Takata and its U.S. entity TK Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy in June after it said it was recalling more than 100 million of its air bag inflators worldwide through the end of 2019 because they could inflate with too much force and spray metal fragments. 
Air bags with the inflators have been linked to at least 180 injuries and 20 deaths, mostly in the United States including one in Louisiana that was identified last month.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Saturday posted a notice from Takata that said the company would recall another 3.3 million inflators for vehicles from automakers including Toyota, Honda Motor Co, BMW AG,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Tata Motors Jaguar Land Rover unit and Subaru Corp.
NHTSA said in November that 19 automakers had recalled 46 million inflators in 34 million U.S. vehicles -- and by 2019 as many as 70 million U.S. inflators will have been recalled. In June, the agency said only about 35 percent of vehicles recalled have been repaired to date.

In January 2016, Takata agreed to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing and pay $1 billion to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation into the inflator ruptures.

1575,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 03:59PM ET</span>",U.S. pharma executives expect deals to pick up after tax overhaul,"By Caroline Humer and Carl O'Donnell
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Trump administration's tax overhaul should accelerate major acquisitions by drugmakers in 2018 after a slow year for deals in 2017, according to senior executives from some of the largest pharmaceutical manufacturers.
The $1.5-trillion bill, which U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law in December, lowers the income tax rate for U.S. companies to 21 percent from 35 percent, encourages them to repatriate cash, and modifies numerous deductions.
Brent Saunders, chief executive officer of Allergan Inc (NYSE:AGN), expects tax reform to finally clear the decks for big industry consolidation. Such moves will likely materialize over months as companies study the new bill and devise appropriate strategies. 
In the first half of the year, he expects to see more oncology deals like the one  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG) announced on Sunday, a smaller acquisition of cancer drug developer Impact Biomedicines. 
Bigger, transformative deals - like the ones where large-cap pharmaceutical companies consolidate with rivals and biotechnology players - will likely take longer, bankers said. 
""I think the industry ultimately consolidates,"" Saunders said in an interview at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. ""I have a sense, though, in terms of a bigger wave of (mergers), it will either happen in the back half of 2018 or in 2019.""
The U.S. pharmaceutical industry has been consolidating for years even without tax reform. Large companies like Merck (NYSE:MRK) & Co Inc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) regularly buy or do licensing deals with small companies to help maintain a continuous pipeline of new medicines. 
But large-scale deals – like Merck’s $41.1-billion acquisition of Schering Plough in 2009, or  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc's $68-billion purchase of Wyeth – have dried up. 
In early 2016, the Obama administration introduced rules that would punish companies for so-called inversion deals, in which a U.S.-based acquirer bought a smaller firm overseas and moved the combined corporate headquarters abroad to benefit from lower tax rates. The move scuttled Pfizer Inc's proposed $160-billion purchase of Dublin-based Allergan.
Saunders said Allergan would only begin to look at smaller deals in the second half of the year as the company, known for its Botox anti-wrinkle treatment, as it is currently focused on cost cutting.
BRINGING BACK THE CASH
Saunders' comments echo those of healthcare industry bankers, who say that uncertainty around the tax bill, drug pricing and Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare had cooled merger activity in 2017. 
Now that the tax law is in place, these bankers say, it should provide a catalyst to drugmaker deals by allowing them to repatriate billions of dollars in foreign profits held abroad, and by making it easier to agree on a value for their acquisition targets since they have a better idea of the company's tax rate. 
Several drugmakers have already announced plans to bring overseas cash into the United States, including  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Bristol-Myers, incurring some short-term charges.
Horizon Pharma CEO Tim Walbert said that when larger companies benefit from that repatriation of cash, they are likely to lift the whole market.
""To the extent that you see acceleration of large cap deals ... that will bring more confidence in the sector and allow for more strategic opportunities for everyone,"" Walbert said.
Horizon does not have substantial money parked overseas, and expects to continue its current strategy of small- and medium-sized acquisitions for drugs treating rare diseases, its primary focus.
   
DEALS TRENDED LOWER
Drug industry deals have been trending lower for the past two years. Thomson Reuters data shows that in 2017, there were $52 billion worth of pharma and biotech deals, less than 25 percent of 2015's $212 billion in deals and down from 2016's $54 billion. 
Johnson & Johnson Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso said during a conference session that one reason deals were not getting done was that companies needed to borrow money in the United States, and because it was difficult to structure a deal with low enough taxes.
And Eli Lilly & Co CEO Dave Ricks said that among the uses for cash it repatriates - it has $10 billion overseas - would be more business development including the small, early-stage mergers and acquisitions that are typical of the Indianapolis-based drugmaker.
Merck said that tax reform could spur large deals among companies that are focused on general cost savings. However, that is not Merck's deal focus: CFO Robert Davis said the company will continue to seek smaller acquisitions to enhance its portfolio of medicines.
""That being said, getting access now to foreign cash, in a way where you don't have to worry about the location of the cash will improve our flexibility,""  he said.

""We're not planning a large one-time repatriation. We will repatriate in a normal course as we see what the needs are for the business.""

1576,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 03:56PM ET</span>",Tesla says solar roof production has started in Buffalo,"By Nichola Groom
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) said on Tuesday it began manufacturing its premium solar roof tiles at the company's Buffalo, New York factory last month and has started surveying the homes of customers who made a deposit of $1,000 to reserve the product last year.
The solar roof, which generates electricity without the need for traditional rooftop panels, is a cornerstone of the electric vehicle maker's strategy to sell a fossil-fuel-free lifestyle under the luxury Tesla brand. Tesla unveiled the product in October 2016 as it sought to acquire solar installer SolarCity.
At that time, Tesla said the product could be rolled out as soon as the summer of 2017. In November, Tesla founder Elon Musk said the product was going through a six-month testing process, saying ""it just takes a little while to get this behemoth rolling."" 
More than a dozen Tesla employees, including Musk and Chief Technical Officer JB Straubel, had the solar roofs installed on their homes last year as part of an initial pilot program.
Tesla started taking orders for the solar roof tiles in May by asking homeowners to put down a $1,000 deposit via its web site. Tesla would not disclose how many reservations it had received for the solar roof. The product will be installed on some customer rooftops in the coming months.
The company has said its solar roofs would cost between 10 and 15 percent less than an ordinary new roof plus traditional solar panels.
Tesla is collaborating with its longstanding battery partner, Japan's Panasonic Corp, to manufacture solar products at the Buffalo factory. There are about 500 employees working at the site currently, Tesla said.
The companies began production of traditional solar panels at the site last year, but they have not yet been installed on rooftops. The company said it will achieve more than 1 gigawatt of cell and module production in Buffalo, and possibly as much as double that, but gave no timeline for meeting the target.

Tesla said its primary focus is increasing production of its Model 3 sedan. The company said last week it would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s a week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised.

(Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline's (L:GSK) new chief executive said on Tuesday that the British drugmaker would have a look at  Pfizer  Inc's (N:PFE) consumer products business, but would not overpay for the asset.
Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, said last year it was considering strategic alternatives, including a sale or spinoff, of the consumer business, which had sales of about $3.4 billion in 2016 and could cost more than $15 billion to acquire.
""At this stage it would be weird if we didn't look at it,"" GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley said, responding to questions at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.
But she said it is only a look and very early, adding, ""we don't need it and we won't overpay for it."" 
Despite her consumer products background, Walmsley repeatedly said that the company's pharmaceuticals business and pharma research and development is GSK's top priority.
However, Walmsley said GSK has a good track record of integrating large acquisitions and that it's consumer business does have room to grow.
Pfizer's consumer portfolio includes well-known brands such as Advil, Chapstick lip balm and Centrum vitamins.
Walmsley said there are a very small number of assets that would be completely complementary to GSK's existing consumer business, ""and this may be one of them.""

""If we did it, it is cash generating,"" she said.

This was back in 1968, so it turned out to be a pivotal time in the American experience. They had us go around to communities in states like Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland, talking to people about all the issues they faced. It was a real introduction to urban life for a girl who had grown up on a farm surrounded by horses, sheep, cows and pigs.

When I was 11 or 12 I had a job taking care of a toddler in Nashville during the summer. One day, I saw phonograph records on the shelf, so I took some down and played them. One of them I really liked – I think it was Beethoven’s symphonies. When the mother came home and I told her I really enjoyed her music, she got mad at me, because she hadn’t told me I could touch them.
I didn’t say anything to my mother, because I didn’t know what she would think. But when I told one of my favorite aunts what had happened, she told me to stay out of white people’s things, because they would think I was a troublemaker.
What I learned about myself that day, is that I have always been very curious about things – even things I am not supposed to know about. I like to ask questions, and find out stuff that other people think is not my business. Over my career, I ended up going to lots of places I wasn’t supposed to go, and asking questions I wasn’t supposed to ask. And now, every time I listen to Beethoven, I think about that story.

My working life started - and ended - in a Hell's Angels pub in the town of Ayr, in the west of Scotland. The name of the pub was Rabbie’s, in honor of the poet Robert Burns, Ayr’s most famous son.
There was little that was poetic about the denizens of Rabbie’s. They would get off their motorbikes, lumber up to the bar and mutter unintelligible things like: “Pintofheavyandafamousgrouse,” which meant they wanted a pint of McEwan’s Export and a glass of a popular blended Scotch whisky. I would reply 'I beg your pardon?' and they would lean over the bar and grab me by the testicles and say the exact same thing, only louder.
I lasted a week. Nevertheless, I had learned something important, namely that I was constitutionally unsuited to unskilled manual work. I resolved never to do it again.
When I arrived at Oxford, I encountered men whose job it was to sit in book-lined studies with oak panels and mullioned windows and read, write or talk about history. And that was for roughly half the year. The rest of their time was their own to spend in dusty archives or in country houses, as they saw fit.

My uncle used to ask my father periodically: ‘Has Niall got a job yet, or is he still at the college?’ The answer is no, I am still at the college. And I have never been back to Rabbie’s.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Eastman Kodak Co (N:KODK) more than doubled on Tuesday after the one-time leader in photography became the latest company to jump on the cryptocurrency bandwagon.
The storied Rochester, New York-based company said in a statement it is launching a cryptocurrency called ""KODAKCoin"" for photographers, part of ""KODAKOne,"" an image rights management platform in a licensing partnership with WENN Digital.
The platform uses blockchain technology, the backbone of bitcoin and other digital currencies that have surged in recent months and raised fears of a price bubble.
The stock was last up 92 percent at $5.95 in midafternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, off an earlier high at $6.65.
The film pioneer founded over a century ago has struggled to transform itself into an imaging software and technology company. Kodak was a Dow Jones Industrials (DJI) component until April 2004, and its stock has slumped 90 percent since it emerged from bankruptcy in 2013. 
Several other companies in recent weeks have been rewarded with sharp rises in share price after announcing their transformation into cryptocurrency businesses.
""This is getting ridiculous,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. ""From a fundamental point of view, none of this makes sense.""
Riot Blockchain (O:RIOT) shares have tripled since October when the former biotechnology firm changed its name and said it was revising its business focus to bitcoins.
Soft drinks maker Long Island Iced Tea has more than doubled since it said it was shifting its focus to blockchain technology and changing its name to Long Blockchain Corp (O:LBCC).
Also on Tuesday, Inpixon (O:INPX) surged 9 cents or 40 percent to 31 cents per share after the data analytics company announced it would adopt blockchain technology.

WENN Digital belongs to WENN Media, which provides photos to websites and media.

(Reuters) - U.S. states could see revenue growth in 2018 from improving national economics, but difficult demographics and macroeconomic challenges are on the horizon, according to a report released Tuesday from S&P Global Ratings.
States have benefited from continued economic expansion and strong capital markets in recent years, which helped to bring in greater tax revenues. The robust stock market performance in 2017 could also produce windfall capital gains tax revenues to state treasuries in April 2018.
But ominous clouds could be looming on the horizon. Periods of faster revenue growth linked to soaring equity markets, while favorable, lend the potential for revenue instability, S&P reported. 
""Our baseline outlook for the U.S. state sector in 2018 anticipates positive economic and revenue growth, albeit with considerable uncertainty as to whether either will break through the sluggishness of recent years,"" said credit analyst Gabriel Petek.
Years of slow economic and revenue growth have left many states with slim or negative operating margins. 

Looking ahead, states face risks from a potential market correction, increasing stress on state pension systems from more workers retiring and fewer workers getting hired, and a shifting federal-state paradigm that leads to smaller transfers from Washington, especially in the Medicaid program.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's market watchdog suffered another setback on Tuesday in its efforts to bed down sweeping new securities rules that have already been delayed a year.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) unexpectedly delayed until March the publication of data meant to specify which stocks will be subject to limits on trading in ""dark pools"", meaning not on public exchanges.
The regulator said it was forced to delay the restrictions due to insufficient data, pushing back a core element of the bloc's new MiFID II rules that came into force on Jan. 3, a year later than originally planned.
""The current quality and completeness of the data does not allow for a sufficiently meaningful and comprehensive publication of double volume cap calculations,"" ESMA said in a statement, adding that it expected to be able to publish the data in March.
Under the new Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) regime, so-called ""double volume"" caps will require dark pools to suspend trading in stocks for which, on average, more than 8 percent of daily trading was transacted in the dark over the past 12 months.
The aim of the caps is to push more trading onto so-called ""lit"" or fully transparent exchanges where all investors can see the prices at which transactions are being made.
ESMA has been collecting data on dark trading but said the quality and completeness of the data fell short of the rigor it would have expected, and publication could have led to an ""unlevel"" playing field. 
""ESMA realized that the publication would have resulted in a biased picture covering only a very limited number of instruments and markets,"" the watchdog said.
It marks the latest last-minute adjustment made by ESMA and national regulators in a bid to keep MiFID II on track.
Several exchanges have been given temporary relief from competition in clearing.
Market participants have also been given an extra six months to obtain an identifier that is mandatory for reporting trades.
ESMA said it would be able to publish the volume cap data in March after consulting with trading venues and local regulators, and acknowledged that it had given limited time to submit data.
""The time scales were just simply too tight for that volume of data,"" said Toby Bayliss, head of electronic trading for Europe at Bernstein.
The reporting period closed on Dec. 31, and data had to reach ESMA by the close of business on Jan. 5.
Brokers and other market participants have spent months preparing algorithms and trading systems for the introduction of dark pool caps, and were poised to apply the caps on Friday.

""It's not wasted work, but it's perhaps unnecessary pressure that has been put on firms when perhaps there could have been a bit more breathing space,"" said Bernstein's Bayliss.

1591,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 01:46PM ET</span>",Boeing set to top Airbus with record 763 jets in 2017,"By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Tuesday it delivered an industry-record 763 jetliners in 2017, likely beating European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) to retain the title of world's biggest plane maker.
Boeing also booked 912 net new aircraft orders worth $134.8 billion at list prices last year, compared with 668 worth about $94 billion in 2016.
Airbus was on track last month to rack up more than 1,000 gross new orders for the year, excluding cancellations, compared with the 1,053 gross orders Boeing announced on Tuesday. 
The tallies confer more than just bragging rights; they show the companies' ability to run factories smoothly, make sales and generate profit.
Boeing shares were up 2.9 percent at $319.16 on Tuesday afternoon. The stock has nearly doubled in the past year.
Industry sources say Airbus, which will report 2017 orders and deliveries on Jan. 15, met its target of delivering more than 700 jetliners, despite problems with Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) Geared Turbofan engines.
Airbus' total is still unlikely to match Boeing's. The European firm cut its forecast from more than 720 jets in October due to delays in engine deliveries.
Boeing's orders and deliveries confirmed the plane maker's ability to hit rising production rates. This could mean an additional ""$350 million in revenues versus our forecast,"" said Sheila Kahyaoglu, analyst at Jefferies.
Boeing also said airlines likely will need more aircraft in 2018, keeping production rates rising.
The company expects airlines to boost passenger capacity by 5.5 percent to 6 percent this year, Randy Tinseth, Boeing vice president of marketing, said on a conference call. 
With airlines already flying very full airplanes, more aircraft will be needed. ""We're expecting growth to be driven by new deliveries, not by more capability out of the existing fleet,"" he said.
Price targets for Boeing's stock are rising. The median is now $310 a share, up from $293.50 in October. Some targets are as high as $380. Still, 12 analysts rate it a ""hold"" compared with 13 with ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" ratings, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Meanwhile, air cargo traffic is rising, but a sustained gain could arrive too late to rescue Boeing's 747 aircraft.
Boeing has 12 backlogged orders for 747s, about two years' production. Tinseth said air cargo companies are interested. 

""The question is when will they be in a position to buy,"" he said. ""They want to make sure that (demand is) sustained.""

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>","European shares at fresh highs on earning optimism, dealmaking","By Danilo Masoni and Helen Reid
MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose for a fourth straight session on Tuesday, lifted by strength among cyclical stocks and optimism about further growth in company earnings.
Expectations of possible dealmaking in the auto industry and a weaker euro  also helped, pushing the STOXX 600 (STOXX) up 0.4 percent at 400 points, its highest since August 2015 and just a few points below its all-time peak of 414. 
The rise came as a global stock benchmark (MIWD00000PUS) touched another record high with confidence in another strong earning season offsetting worries over valuations becoming too elevated.
""If growth does not disappoint and companies deliver solid earnings, I don't see risk on valuation,"" said Valentin Bissat, equities strategist at Mirabaud Asset Management. 
According to Citi, global earnings revisions were positive for the 14th week in a row, recording the best weekly upgrades since its data started in 2000, led by cyclicals.
Even though high earning revisions are usually seen at the start or end of the economic or market cycle, strategists at the U.S. bank said it was too early to call the end of this cycle.
Top gainer on the STOXX on Tuesday was Altice (AS:ATCA). 
Its shares rose 10.5 percent as investors welcomed a decision to spin off its U.S. unit and simplify the indebted telecoms and cable firm's structure. 
Traders said any move to reduce debt would be well received by the market, and analysts at brokerage Raymond James said the move could also make the Altice European arm a possible acquisition target for rival French telecoms companies. 
Auto stocks (SXAP) cemented their position as the biggest sectoral gainer so far this year, rising 1.4 percent.
Continental (DE:CONG) rose 5.4 percent on expectations of a possible corporate overhaul.
Continental is still looking at its corporate structure as part of a review launched more than a year ago, a source close to the matter said on Tuesday following a media report about a possible breakup of the car parts maker.
 Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) rose to another record high, up 2 percent. Traders cited continued talk the carmaker could look at strategic deals such as spin-offs and disposals in the last year with CEO Sergio Marchionne at the helm at the company.
Commodities also continued their climb, with stronger metals prices helping the STOXX 600 materials index (SXPP) rise 1.2 percent to hit its highest since March 2012.
Financials provided the biggest boost to the STOXX as optimism over Europe's economic growth prevailed.
""In an environment of solid growth and rising long-term yields in Europe, financials and value stocks in general are likely to outperform, as well as energy,"" said Mirabaud's Bissat, who is overweight on financials stocks. 
Elsewhere among cyclicals, Germany's  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) rose 0.5 percent after its industrial production and exports rose more than expected in November. 
Germany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) fell 5.4 percent after the ECB sold its Steinhoff bond at a loss as the company grapples with an accounting scandal.

Morrisons (L:MRW), up 2.4 percent, was among top gainers after the UK retailer reported a stronger than anticipated Christmas trading season. Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) also gained.

A source told Reuters on Tuesday that Continental was continuing to ponder all options for its future corporate structure and kept reviewing its combustion-engine business.
""As of today it is wide open, if and which changes could result from these early evaluations,"" Rolf Woller, head of investor relations said in a written statement after trading hours. ""To date there are no plans which could be submitted for approval.""

Bloomberg News had reported earlier in the day that the firm was in exploratory talks with advisers on a strategic revamp which could result in creating a holding company and listing its more profitable divisions or combining some operations with rivals.

1618,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Boeing shares have more room to fly in 2018: analysts,"By Rachit Vats
(Reuters) - Rising demand for jet sales pushed Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's stock to the top of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2017, and record cash flow to fuel projects, sustain dividends and buy back shares could give it another bumper year, analysts said.
After a resurgence in jet sales driven by a solid global economy and with most of its production issues behind it, Boeing has found itself flush with record free cash flow - a profitability measure widely watched by investors for industrial stocks.
""We believe Boeing shares are still moderately undervalued, particularly if the company can sustain free cash flow margins in the 13-15 percent range,"" Fort Pitt Capital Group founder Charles Smith told Reuters.
""Given our expectations for moderation in capex over the next couple years, along with continued efficiencies on the 787 Dreamliner, we think this can happen,"" said Smith, whose funds held a 0.04 percent stake in Boeing as of Sept. 30, according to Reuters data.
Smith said Boeing's third quarter free cash flow margin was 12.45 percent.
The company has increased its free cash flow from $1.83 billion in 2010 to an estimated $10.5 billion in 2017. That figure would be an increase of 34 percent from 2016.
The surge in cash flow has energized the company's shares, pushing up the stock price by more than 90 percent in 2017. Still, the stock trades at a slight discount to its aerospace peers.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Rajeev Lalwani said if management executes on another year of growth, tax reform materializes and free cash flow multiples catch up with peers, one can expect ""another +50 percent year.""
Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg recently confirmed that the company expects to grow operating cash flow annually through the end of the decade, adding that it remains committed to returning about 100 percent of free cash flow to investors.
Free cash flow points to a company's ability to expand production, develop new products, make acquisitions, pay dividends and reduce debt.
Boeing last month raised its quarterly dividend by 20 percent and replaced its existing $14 billion share buyback plan with a new $18 billion authorization.
Since the end of 2012, the world's biggest airplane producer has pumped back nearly $40 billion to its investors through dividend and share repurchases while still investing substantially in products, services and people.
Fort Pitt's Smith says Boeing's management is doing well allocating capital between new projects, acquisitions and buybacks and predicts a return on shareholder equity of 17-18 percent that gives shares a ""fair value"" estimate for 2018 of $300 to $360.
Boeing's shares were trading up 1 percent at $313.75 on Tuesday.
The company, however, has to overcome near-term challenges like its troubled aerial tanker refueling program and longer term concerns such as macroeconomic issues and possible supply chain problems, Morgan Stanley's Lalwani said.
But for now the stock remains popular among investors, with 13 out of 25 analysts rating it a ""buy"" or ""strong buy"".
""It's a bull market and Boeing is a classic kind of late stage bull market stock - mega cap, high quality, global orientation,"" said Kenneth Fisher, whose asset management firm owned about $70 million of Boeing stock as of Oct. 17.
Boeing said in September it will raise production of 787 Dreamliner jets to 14 a month in 2019 from 12 currently, indicating reviving faith in wide-body demand.

On Tuesday, Boeing said it delivered 763 jetliners in 2017, likely retaining the title of the world's biggest plane maker compared with European rival Airbus SE.

OSLO (Reuters) - The ethics watchdog for Norway's $1 trillion wealth fund will this year identify companies that violate workers' rights when hiring people for jobs in the Middle East, and recommend excluding them from the fund's portfolio.
Companies in the global shipping industry will also face scrutiny and risk being blacklisted if their recycling of obsolete vessels fails to meet certain standards, Johan Andresen, chairman of fund's ethics panel told Reuters on Tuesday.
Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, has been built up from surpluses from the country's oil industry and has stakes in some 9,000 companies, owning 1.4 percent of all listed shares globally.
The Norwegian parliament has set several ethics mandates for the fund, targeting tobacco makers, human rights violations and excessive emissions of climate change gases, among others, as grounds for exclusion from the fund's investment portfolio.
The fund has already excluded dozens of companies for environmental reasons, nuclear arms production and other infringements of its policies, but it has yet to identify candidates in all categories.
""We're actively working on human rights violations in the Middle East, particularly recruitment practices that put vulnerable people in a position where they have no choice,"" Andresen told Reuters on the sidelines of a business conference.
Workers hired from Bangladesh and Nepal were among the ones exposed to such practices, he added.
""This is hardly a novel topic, but not all companies understand that the recruiters also have a responsibility. We've not made recommendations (for exclusion) in this area in the past, but we will this year,"" Andresen said.
Recommendations for exclusion are sent to the board of the Norwegian central bank, which manages the fund and must decide whether to sell all shares in a company, or potentially put it on an observation list.
Andresen said shipping firms engaged in so-called ""beaching"", running old vessels aground to be picked apart by manual labor, were also unacceptable.
""This actually covers two of our criteria, both environmental damage and human rights. We're looking at several companies and a recommendation of exclusion should come in a relatively short time,"" he added.

1633,By Business Insider,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 09:41AM ET</span>",Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway could get a $37 billion windfall from tax cuts,"
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of tax reform in the insurance sector, according to Barclays.
The company's book value could increase by about $37 billion, said Jay Gelb, an insurance analyst at Barclays, in a note on Monday. That's $10 billion more than what he estimated in a November note before the tax plan was finalized and signed.
Gelb estimated this because Berkshire would have a lower deferred tax liability, which represents what the company would owe the federal government if it sold its equity portfolio and took profits.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed by President Trump in December, permanently cuts the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This means Berkshire's deferred tax liability — about $78 billion — would fall because of the lower rate.
""We would view this magnitude of book value increase as favorable for BRK shares since it is generally valued based on price-to-book value,"" Gelb said. He has a price target of $357,000 on Berkshire's A shares, about 19% more than where they opened for trading on Monday.
Berkshire Hathaway could also benefit from tax reform because its biggest investments are in the financials sector. Companies in this sector have historically paid the highest effective tax rate in the S&P 500, according to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC). That could be a boon for some companies in the share of Berkshire's public portfolio — about 40% — that's in in financials."
1634,By Business Insider,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 09:39AM ET</span>",GOLDMAN SACHS: 2 areas of tax reform could throw investors for a loop this earnings season," Fourth-quarter 2017 earnings season is set to kick off at the end of the week and Goldman Sachs is expecting a rocky ride, all thanks to GOP tax reform.
That's not necessarily a bad thing — after all, Goldman estimates that corporate profits will expand by 10% for the period. And since earnings growth has historically been the biggest driver of stock price gains during the 8 1/2-year bull market, that forecast is essentially a call for more record highs.
Goldman's outlook just means that the market may take some unexpected twists and turns along the way. And if you're able to see this potential turbulence coming, you could position yourself to best capitalize on any opportunities that arise.
The firm sees uncertainty stemming from two key areas:
As earnings season beckons, one thing working in the favor of stock investors is favorable analyst sentiment. Goldman points out that analysts have been lagging the market when it comes to pricing in the positive effect of tax reform — implying that expectations could still be recalibrated to the upside.
It's already started to happen, with consensus 2018 earnings-per-share estimates (EPS) rising 2% since the bill was successfully passed. And Goldman thinks that there may be more optimism to come, as evidenced by the 5% total boost it sees EPS getting before all is said and done.
The EPS increase up to this point is simply a ""nascent effort,"" Goldman chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a recent client note.
So with all of that established, which sectors should you be looking at before earnings reports start rolling in? Lucky for you, Goldman has put together a handy guide showing profit growth forecasts by sector.
Energy is expected to be the top performer, which should come as no surprise, given its downtrodden state in past earnings periods, and the boost it's expected to get from deferred tax items. And never one to be deterred, technology is forecast to be third-best, despite potentially hefty taxes from repatriated earnings. Here's the full rundown:"
1635,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>","U.S. mid-market lenders concerned about leverage, loan docs: report","By Leela Parker Deo
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lenders to U.S. mid-sized businesses are increasingly concerned about the higher levels of debt held by middle market companies versus a year ago, as well as what they consider to be less restrictive leveraged loan documents, a survey by Carl Marks Advisors found.
Higher leverage levels and borrower-friendly loan agreements, the result of highly competitive market conditions last year that pushed lenders to make such concessions, could impact loan portfolios if business performance comes under pressure.
Carl Marks, a mid-market focused corporate restructuring and investment banking firm, conducted the national online survey in December 2017 of 190 participants from US middle market lending-related fields, including traditional bank lenders, alternative lenders, legal and accounting advisors, restructuring advisors, private equity and hedge fund investors, and other financial and business consultants.
“This is now the third-longest economic expansion in US history, so it is getting a little bit long-dated. Companies are not necessarily improving and there is a lot of capital - both debt and equity - chasing too few deals,” Patrick Flynn, managing director at Carl Marks, said in an interview ahead of the survey’s release. “But while there is relatively more concern today than a year ago, it is not necessarily a predictor that the next contraction is any closer.”
The survey found that 76% of respondents are more concerned than they were at the beginning of 2017 about leverage levels at US middle market companies.
“In 2017 many a transaction has added debt, but there has not been a lot of value created,” said Joseph D’Angelo, a partner at Carl Marks. “There are not a lot of unencumbered assets left to borrow more money against. If a company doesn’t perform through that, it will likely see a restructuring.”
Leverage on middle market institutional deals increased in 2017 to 5.51x total debt to Ebitda compared to 4.95x in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, is a measure of a company’s operating performance.
Regarding concessions that lenders have offered to borrowers and private equity sponsors in the face of aggressive market conditions, 48% of respondents said they considered loan documents executed in 2017 to be less restrictive for borrowers than those executed immediately prior to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Thirty-five percent said they did not consider documents to be less restrictive, while 17% said they were unsure.
Middle market covenant-lite issuance reached an all-time high of US$25bn in 2017, LPC data show. By comparison, before the financial crisis, 2007 middle market covenant-lite volume totaled US$7.49bn.
“There is a fully functioning credit market and pressure to deploy capital remains robust. It’s hard to predict what will trigger the pendulum back towards lender-friendly terms. Currently it seems that lender pushback is still being solved with price and terms,” Flynn said.
LOOSE DOCS
Loan document concessions resulting in covenant-lite loans or springing covenants with lower triggers are of primary concern for respondents in 2018, followed by the allowance of add backs to Ebitda calculations.
Covenant-lite refers to loans that are stripped of certain lender protections, including financial maintenance tests requiring the borrower to meet monthly or quarterly performance standards. Such tests serve as early warning signs in a potential default scenario. Boosting Ebitda, meanwhile, can increase a company’s financial flexibility with respect to incurring additional debt or setting restricted payments, thereby increasing credit risk and weakening investor protections.
“As long as there are as many different funding sources and they keep raising capital, there are no forces that would influence loan documents to tighten up,” said D’Angelo.
As for types of lenders expected to face the greatest challenges in their loan portfolios this year, 26% of respondents said mezzanine lenders are at the top of the list. Business Development Companies (BDCs) were next in line with 23%, 18% said distressed investors and 14% selected traditional banks. Specialty finance companies and direct lenders were tied at 6.84% each, while bank asset-based lenders and equipment finance companies are ranked least likely to face trouble, at less than 5% each.
“Many BDCs make investments in much smaller companies, which can be more vulnerable to economic contraction. BDCs also have a higher cost of capital relative to regulated banks, which dictates looking to invest in places that justify their cost of capital, which can also translate into added risk,” said Flynn.
Despite heightened concerns about leverage and loan documentation, respondents were notably split regarding technical and payment defaults in 2018. Forty-three percent said deafults would increase and the same share said they would stay the same this year.
“We don’t really expect much difference in 2018. If the economy can continue to grow, we expect to see more sector specific situations. Changes continue to ripple through healthcare with downward pressure on both federal and state budgets,” said D’Angelo. “The bitter chill has given the energy sector a boost. With prices increasing, there is more confidence around the table to do more constructive deals. We could even see some M&A there.”

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 09:02AM ET</span>","Airbus says to boost China assembly, but wins no new jet order","PARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) said it planned to boost the number of planes it makes in China under a deal signed in Beijing on Tuesday to expand co-operation at its Tianjin assembly plant.
The provisional deal was signed during a state visit to China by French President Emmanuel Macron.
Airbus said the latest Tianjin agreement would result in production increasing to six aircraft per month - up from four at present - at the local final assembly line for the Airbus A320-family of jets.
The industrial ramp-up will target five aircraft by early 2019 and six per month by early 2020, it added in a statement.
A Beijing signing ceremony did not, however, include any deal for Airbus to sell aircraft to China, despite earlier expectations of a contract timed to coincide with Macron's visit.
Industry sources had said Airbus was negotiating to sell around 100 planes to China's state purchasing agency, though a deal had not been flagged as part of the diplomatic preparations for the visit.
New orders for Airbus jetliners have historically featured during such state visits by French leaders.
China regularly splits large orders between Europe and the United States to cope with its fast-expanding airline traffic, but the momentum has recently been with rival Boeing (N:BA), which sold 300 jets during a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump last year.
China, however, placed a large order for 140 Airbus jets during a visit to Germany by President Xi Jinping last July.

Some sources say Chinese officials are disappointed about a deal last year for Airbus to buy the CSeries jet project from Bombardier (TO:BBDb), derailing talks with Chinese investors after Ottawa intervened to keep the struggling program in Western hands.

The Advanced Pricing Agreement (APA), now concluded following discussions initiated in 2015, is expected to result in reversal of tax provisions of about $225 million made in the previous periods and boost the company's consolidated basic earnings per share by about $0.10 for quarter ended December 31, the Bengaluru-based company said in a statement. APA is an agreement between a taxpayer and the tax authority defining an appropriate methodology for computing taxable income. The agreement covers financial years from 2011 to 2021 and the company expects to payout about $233 million over the next few quarters due to difference between taxes payable as per APA and the actual amount paid in the prior periods. The APA will enhance predictability of company's tax obligations in respect to U.S. operations, Infosys added.

Shares of the company were down nearly 5 percent at $6.25 in premarket trading, but a far cry from the heavy losses suffered on Monday when it announced plans to exit the drone business, cut jobs and lower its fourth quarter revenue estimate.
After that announcement, the stock crashed 33 percent to a record low of $5.04.
GoPro is battling waning demand for its sports cameras and drones.
""The increasing power and presence of smartphones have negatively impacted sales of GoPro's products, with its pace of innovation unable to offset creeping market saturation,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese wrote in a note.
The global demand for GoPro's products cannot get higher than what it already is and the San Mateo-based company should acknowledge the reality, Dougherty & Co analyst Charles Anderson said in a note.
Wedbush cut the price target on the stock to $6 from $10.50 and Dougherty & Co's Charles Anderson, who has a 4-star rating, trimmed the price target by $3 to $4. GoPro has a median price target of $8.50.
""It isn't clear that they have much of a strategy beyond selling more HERO cameras. I'm not sure investors will warm up to the story until they demonstrate some traction with sales growth,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said.
GoPro's shares closed down 13 percent on Monday, paring the earlier losses after reports that it had hired J.P. Morgan to help it with a sale process. [nL4N1P33YA]

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) will ""seriously consider"" listing in Hong Kong, founder Jack Ma said, potentially providing a powerful boost to the financial hub which is preparing to allow dual-class share listings. 
Ma made the comments at an event in the city on Monday in response to remarks by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam about how she hoped Alibaba would consider returning to Hong Kong to list, an Alibaba spokeswoman said. 
""Daring to speak like this marks a strong commitment so we will definitely seriously consider the Hong Kong market,"" Ma said in response to Lam's speech, according to a transcript provided by Alibaba.
When asked by reporters about his comments after he met President Emmanuel Macron in Beijing on Tuesday, Ma said Alibaba was considering listing subsidiaries in Hong Kong, without elaborating. Macron is on the second leg of a three-day state visit in China.
The Alibaba spokeswoman said there were no further details available on what any Hong Kong listing plan could involve.
Alibaba held its record $25 billion public float in New York in 2014 after Hong Kong, its favored venue, refused to accept its governance structure where a self-selecting group of senior managers control the majority of board appointments.
Hong Kong is now set to allow dual-class shares under rule changes to be proposed by the city's stock exchange as it raises the stakes in its battle against New York for blockbuster Chinese initial public offerings. 
Such shares grant differentiated voting rights and underpin the alternative governance and shareholding structures favored by many owners of new age industries such as technology.
Over $3 billion worth of Alibaba shares were traded on Monday, based on Reuters calculations using NASDAQ data. The stock closed at $190.33, with 16.23 million shares traded. 
That compares with the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd's (HKEX) (HK:0388) average daily securities turnover of HK$88.2 billion ($11.28 billion) in 2017. 
""NEW ECONOMY"" PLATFORM
Shares in HKEX, the city's exchange operator, rose as much as 3.1 percent to HK$270 on Tuesday, their highest level since July 2015.
Analysts said that an Alibaba listing in Hong Kong could help drive more funds from the mainland towards the city and could convince other big firms, in particular technology-related ones, to list in the financial hub. 
""If the trading volume in Hong Kong is even better than that in the U.S., it will send out a signal to other new economy new listings that Hong Kong is a much better place for a listing than the U.S,"" said Steven Leung, sales director at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong. 
For Alibaba, it could provide greater access to investors closer to China who are familiar with its business and allow it to benefit from the Hong Kong government's growing support for financial services innovation, said James Lloyd, Asia-Pacific FinTech leader at consulting firm EY.
The HKEX said in December that it had begun drafting specific rule changes for allowing dual-class shares that will be put up for a formal public consultation in the first three months of 2018.
Under the planned rule changes, ""innovative"" Chinese companies with a market capitalization over HK$10 billion and a primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq or the London Stock Exchange would be able to seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong. The HKEX has not yet defined what ""innovative"" is. 
""We are also creating a new route to secondary listings in Hong Kong to attract companies from emerging and innovative sectors. We are aware that many successful new economy companies already listed in the US and UK would benefit from these reforms,"" wrote Charles Li, chief executive of HKEX, in a blog post last month when the proposed changes were put forward. 
Just 3 per cent of Hong Kong listings in the past decade, by market value, have been so-called ""new economy"" companies, compared with 47 per cent for the New York Stock Exchange, according to a discussion paper published by the HKEX in June.
Some analysts said technical issues and underlying concerns about the dual-class structure still needed to be resolved and fine tuned. 

""The main concern is about the protection to minority investors under the dual structure,"" said Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities.

SEOUL (Reuters) -  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) said it would likely rake in a record fourth-quarter profit but the guidance fell short of consensus estimate, spooking investors already worried that a memory chip boom could be ending sooner rather than later.
Shares of Samsung fell almost 4 percent as the world's biggest chipmaker became one of the first major semiconductor firms to indicate disappointing results could be on the radar at a time when NAND memory chip prices are easing.
Samsung pegged its October-December operating profit at 15.1 trillion won ($14.1 billion), an all-time high and up 64 percent from a year ago but shy of a 15.9 trillion won average estimate from 17 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. It estimated revenue at 66 trillion won, also slightly below expectations.
The Apple Inc (O:AAPL) smartphone rival did not elaborate on its performance. However, two analysts said a strong won and a year-end bonus for staff in the semiconductor business likely dented the South Korean firm's quarterly profit by about 400 billion won and 400-500 billion won, respectively.
Samsung shares ended down 3.1 percent, versus the broader market (KS11) that fell 0.1 percent and shares in rival SK Hynix (KS:000660) that fell 1.7 percent, amid worries over the outlook for smartphones and the so-called chip ""super-cycle"". 
""The currency effect and bonuses appear to be the main reason for (Samsung) missing market forecasts, but smartphone shipments are also likely to be lower than expected,"" said Song Myung-sup, analyst at HI Investment & Securities. 
""Considering Apple and Chinese firms' sales weren't stellar either, overall mobile demand appears to have been sluggish.""
Samsung will disclose detailed results for the fourth quarter on Jan. 31. 
The last time a Samsung guidance statement disappointed the market was in the wake of the embarrassing withdrawal of its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 handsets in October 2016. 
Based on the quarterly guidance, Samsung's 2017 operating profit is likely to come in at 53.6 trillion won, versus previous year's 29.2 trillion won.
""We see potential downside risk to component orders and smartphone sales beyond Q1,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Andrew Choi said in a note on Tuesday, adding the current consensus profit estimate for the first quarter may be adjusted. 
MEMORY AND MOBILE
Samsung likely benefited from higher DRAM chip prices in its latest quarter, analysts said.
But the outlook for semiconductors in 2018 is mixed. Samsung shares have fallen 12 percent from their all-time high in early November as some investors bet on an end to the memory boom. 
NAND flash memory chips, used in things like digital cameras and USB drives, have entered a down-cycle and there is a view among some industry observers that DRAM market conditions also will soften later this year. 
Others however expect DRAM supply to remain tight throughout 2018 as Google (O:GOOGL), Amazon (O:AMZN) and Facebook (O:FB) expand data centers used for cloud storage and computing. 
The outlook for smartphones and other mobile devices, which analysts expect to contribute about 17 percent to Samsung's fourth-quarter earnings, is also uncertain due to competition from Chinese rivals in markets like Europe and Asia.
Tom Kang, research director at data provider Counterpoint, said Samsung's mobile division should show ""moderate"" shipment growth of about 1-2 percent in 2018. 

South Korean exporters like Samsung will be keeping a close eye on the won  in 2018. The currency traded on Monday at its highest in more than three years.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Automakers in China face their weakest year of sales growth in at least two decades as a phasing out of tax cuts on smaller engine cars that began in 2017 looks set to further dampen customer demand in the world's largest car market. 
The incentive roll back is having a bigger than expected impact, with China's automotive manufacturers association expecting auto sales to grow around 3.5 percent in 2017, missing earlier forecasts. They are predicting 3 percent sales growth for this year, according to state media. [nB9N1O700I]
Its impact was reflected in 2017 China vehicle sales numbers for several global automakers. 
General Motors Co (N:GM) said last week that its China sales grew 4.4 percent last year, following a 7.1 percent rise in 2016, while Ford (N:F) said on Tuesday that its sales fell 6 percent after a 11.9 percent rise in 2016. [nB9N1OJ01X][nB9N1OT00X]
Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) sales growth slowed in 2017 compared to 2016. South Korea's  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) and Kia Motors (KS:000270) have cited the tax roll back as a reason for lower 2017 sales. [nB9N1OT00L] [nL4N1OW1CE]
""2018 will start weak - we are projecting basically another flat year in light vehicle sales...The big question is does the government step in with some tax breaks, incentives to keep things rolling?,"" said James Chao, Asia-Pacific chief of consultancy IHS Markit Automotive. 
""I believe you'd have to go sometime before the year 2000,"" he said, when asked when was the last time the market posted flat growth. Two other analysts said annual growth has not been 3 percent or lower in this century. 
Beijing last year began raising the purchase tax on cars with engines of 1.6 liters or less to 7.5 percent this year from a special rate of 5 percent last year, a policy that it originally launched to shore up sales in a weakening economy. It plans to return the rate to 10 percent in 2018.
Such a sales backdrop meant that competition on the ground, especially in the mid-to-high end sector, would stiffen, requiring car makers to respond more quickly to consumers' changing desires, something analysts said local and some Japanese brands could be nimbler at. 
China's Geely Automobile Holdings (HK:0175), owner of the Volvo car brand, said on Tuesday that its 2017 net profit had doubled year-on-year, citing a ""significant increase in sales revenue"". [nFWN1P406R]
Further challenges will come from strict production and sales quotas for new-energy vehicles (NEV) that Beijing wants automakers to implement by 2019. The policy has to date already prompted a flurry of electric car deals and new launches of electric and hybrid models. 
More companies will likely lay out their plans in 2018, said Robin Zhu, Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. 

""However for your typical consumer, besides those living in cities, there's not much buying interest. If everyone is required to manufacture NEVs, who knows who they will sell these NEVs to.""

LONDON (Reuters) - A tweak to the Bank of Japan’s bond-buying program caused the yen to rise on Tuesday, while gains from commodity stocks as oil hit its highest since 2015 helped world shares maintain their flying start to the year.
MSCI’s all-country world stocks index posted another record high as Europe's main markets shrugged off a tech wobble in Asia and instead cheered Christmas trading updates (EU) and more forecast-beating data from Germany.
The yen rose as much as half a percent to 112.50 yen to the dollar after Japan's central bank trimmed its purchases of long-dated government bonds, stoking speculation it could start to wind down its stimulus policy this year [/FRX]. 
Since it adopted its yield-curve-control policy in 2016, the BoJ has occasionally tweaked its buying, but some market players seemed to take Tuesday's move as a signal. 
""It shouldn't be perceived as a monstrous signal of the end of monetary easing but it shows that even the tiniest announcement on a quiet day can have a reaction,"" said Societe Generale's global head of currency strategy Kit Juckes.
""And it shows that when they start turning their ship around from this policy, the yen is going to go miles.""
The dollar, meanwhile, was rising against most other major currencies.
The euro - which last week approached three-year highs - slipped further away from $1.20 to a 10-day low of $1.1941. 
That was despite the biggest increase in German industrial data since September 2009 and suggested investors were becoming more cautious after a rally that has pushed ""long"" euro positions to records.
""I don’t think right now levels substantially above $1.20 are justified,"" Reichelt said. ""I know the market is very optimistic about the euro, but if you look at the data and the central bank, the ECB (European Central Bank) is still on an expansionary path.""
Nevertheless, euro zone bond yields rose, with traders also making room for new supply from three of the bloc's best-rated countries at relatively attractive levels.
The yield on the region's benchmark, German 10-year debt, climbed to 0.44 percent, well above the mid-December level of 0.30 percent. [GVD/EUR]
HOT OIL 
In the major commodity markets, the focus remained on oil. U.S. crude prices hit their highest since 2015 on Tuesday amid OPEC-led production cuts and a dip in American drilling.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $62.16 a barrel at 0951 GMT - 43 cents, or 0.7 percent, above their last settlement. They earlier matched a May 2015 high of $62.56 a barrel.
Beyond equaling that 2015 high, which was a short intra-day spike, Tuesday's high was the strongest for WTI since December, 2014, at the start of the oil market slump.
""Speculators continued to increase their net long in ICE Brent ... According to exchange data, speculators increased their position by 4,175 lots to leave them with a record net long of 565,459 lots,"" ING bank said.
Brent crude futures were at $68.11 a barrel, 33 cents, or 0.5 percent, above their last close. Brent touched $68.27 last week, its highest since May 2015.
Asian trading saw Japan's Nikkei close at its highest since November 1991, catching up to the previous session's gains as markets reopened after a holiday on Monday.
South Korea's share market erased its gains and slipped 0.1 percent, dragged lower by a 3.1 percent drop in shares of Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co.
Samsung's guidance fell short of market expectations despite a forecast for a record fourth-quarter profit, as a strong won and one-off staff bonuses offset surging DRAM prices.

1696,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",GM races to build a formula for profitable electric cars,"By Paul Lienert and Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra has made a bold promise to investors that the Detroit automaker will make money selling electric cars by 2021.
What Barra has not explained in detail is how GM intends to do what, so far, no major automaker has done.
The answer is a big bet on combining proprietary battery technology, a low-cost, flexible vehicle design and high-volume production mainly in China, according to six current and former GM and supplier executives and six industry experts interviewed by Reuters. 
If GM can meet Barra's ambitious profitability target, then it will house two different businesses by the mid-2020s: A traditional focus in North America on trucks, sport utility vehicles and cars fueled with petroleum, and a global electric car company centered in China, branching into pay-per-use services such as robotaxis. 
Barra's promise to turn a profit is a bold claim in a market segment that has been driven more by government policy than consumer demand, and where Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc - the world’s largest electric-vehicle manufacturer - is burning through more than $1 billion in cash each quarter selling premium-priced vehicles.
Barra and GM have invested heavily in the electrification strategy, and worked during the past year to persuade investors that GM can compete with Tesla by building on the success of the automaker's latest electric vehicle, the Chevrolet Bolt EV, and cutting costs along the way. 
A key element of the plan, according to two people familiar with the company’s strategy, is slashing the amount of cobalt in GM's new EMC (NYSE:EMC) 1.0 battery system. The price of cobalt – the single most costly ingredient in current lithium-ion battery cells - has soared in the past two years in expectation of a surge in demand from automakers. Cobalt prices hit a record high this month on the London Metal Exchange.
GM's new battery design increases the amount of nickel, which enables batteries to store and produce more energy, these people told Reuters.
GM engineers are also working on other design and technological advances, according to executives and company patent filings, including more efficient packaging of batteries in vehicles and improved systems for managing energy flow and cooling the battery cells. 
Without providing details, GM has said it expects these changes to cut the cost of battery cells by more than 30 percent, from $145 per kilowatt-hour to less than $100 by 2021. 
Battery experts said the full cost of a GM battery pack, such as the one used now in the Bolt EV, is $10,000-$12,000, or nearly one-third of the car’s $36,000 sticker price.
By 2021, however, that price could drop to $6,000, according to consultant Jon Bereisa, a former GM engineering director who helped develop the Chevrolet Volt hybrid and spearheaded much of the automaker's early lithium-ion battery development.
With improvements in battery chemistry and packaging, Bereisa said, the next-generation Bolt “could deliver a 45-percent increase in range for about the same (battery) pack cost, or the same range at 45 percent less pack cost.”
Pam Fletcher, vice president in charge of GM's global electric vehicle programs, and other GM executives would not comment on specifics of the new battery system, which is slated to be introduced in 2020-2021. 
To be sure, electric vehicles account for only a small fraction of global auto sales. Like other manufacturers, GM is banking not only on reducing its own costs and improving vehicle performance, but also on increased demand driven by higher government-mandated electric vehicle quotas in China that are intended to help reduce pollution and the country's dependence on petroleum.
In addition to improving battery and vehicle design and performance, GM is working with Chinese partner SAIC to reduce the cost of assembling electric cars. Sources said GM and SAIC are designing dedicated electric vehicle factories in China that are far smaller, less complex and more efficient than a conventional car plant. 
BARRA'S BOLD CLAIM
GM has more capital for electric vehicle development because of Barra's decisions to sell money-losing European operations, exit other unprofitable markets and invest in a new generation of highly profitable, petroleum-fueled large pickup trucks, launching later in 2018. 
The automaker now has more than 1,700 engineers, designers and researchers working on batteries and electric vehicles, many of them at the GM Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, where the company opened a dedicated battery research center in 2009, a week after it filed for bankruptcy reorganization. 
Automotive experts say GM's battery and EV group is one of the largest in the world, rivaled only by Toyota Motor Corp in Japan and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) in Germany. 
Toyota has patented more battery technology in recent years than GM, although its focus has been mainly the Prius family of hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles, rather than on pure battery-powered cars like GM's Bolt EV. 
GM was issued 661 U.S. patents on battery technology from 2010 through 2015, the latest that such data is available from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, trailing only Toyota's 762 battery patents among global automakers. 
For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2CHPWnx
In addition to the battery work, GM engineers are developing a new dedicated “plug and play” structure for its next-generation electric vehicles that is flexible and modular, meaning it will be able to accommodate battery systems of different sizes, as well as hydrogen fuel cells, one of the sources said.
In an interview, Mark Reuss, head of global product development, said GM's strategy to reduce battery cost is not tied to a single improvement such as a change in battery chemistry, but rather a series of continuous enhancements in battery technology and packaging.
“There are no silver bullets here,” Reuss said. GM also has not solved all the problems required to achieve its goal, he said. ""It's called 'product development' for a reason,"" he said.
The most recent developments and enhancements in battery technology have not been made public, according to GM's Fletcher.
“There’s a lot of stuff that we choose not to patent because we don’t want to make it visible” before the new technology goes into production, Fletcher told Reuters.
LESSONS OF BOLT
GM's patent history since 2010 shows a focus on improvements in battery technology, packaging and processing, some of them designed to help boost the battery’s energy and extend vehicle range between charges, according to company filings.
GM jointly developed its current battery know-how with Korea’s LG Group, which makes batteries and electronic components for the Bolt. Introduced in October 2016, Bolt was the first mass-produced electric vehicle to go more than 200 miles between charges, and sell at a sticker price of under $40,000. GM sold 23,297 Bolts in 2017. 
Tesla reported producing just 1,770 of its $35,000 Model 3 sedans in 2017, well short of the company's original targets. 
The launch of the Bolt and its warm reception by reviewers, customers and investors was a watershed event for Barra and GM's top management.

“It was a ‘holy shit’ moment that made us rethink what might be possible,” said one GM insider.

1699,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 09:04PM ET</span>",GoPro says open to sale but not actively pursuing,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Laharee Chatterjee
(Reuters) -  GoPro Inc  (O:GPRO) would be willing to partner with a larger sector player but is not actively engaged in a sale, the action camera-maker said on Monday, as its shares partly rebounded from earlier heavy losses.
The comments followed reports by several media outlets, including Reuters, that GoPro had hired J.P. Morgan to help it with a sale process, as the one-time Wall Street favorite battles falling demand for its sports cameras and drones.
The company's shares, which fell as much as 33 percent to a record low of $5.04 on Monday, recouped some of their losses after the sale talks were first reported by CNBC.
""We've always been clear that we are open to any opportunity that will help us scale our mission. JP Morgan is our banker, but there is no active engagement to sell,"" GoPro said in emailed comments to Reuters.
""It is our responsibility to scale the business, so if the right opportunity presented itself, it's something we would consider,"" it added.
J.P. Morgan declined to comment.
Earlier in the day, the company lowered its fourth-quarter revenue forecast, following weak demand for its cameras in the holiday season, and announced a plan to exit the drone business.
The company has suffered a decline in demand for its eponymous cameras and Karma drones - mostly used by sports junkies and travel enthusiasts - for several quarters. 
Furthermore, it forecasts that tough regulatory hurdles in Europe and the United States will likely reduce the market for drones in the years ahead. Its exit from the drone business will take place after selling the existing Karma inventory, it added.
The company cut the price of its latest HERO6 cameras to $399 from $499 this week, a decision that it said would hurt revenue by around $80 million in the fourth quarter.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a research note on Monday that the price cut would make earnings growth difficult in fiscal 2018.
The move followed weak demand for existing camera models.
""Despite significant marketing support, we found consumers were reluctant to purchase HERO5 Black at the same price it launched at one year earlier,"" Chief Executive Nick Woodman said in a statement alongside results.
The company now expects fourth-quarter revenue of $340 million, compared with its November projection of $470 million, plus or minus $10 million. It also said it plans to cut more than 250 jobs as it restructures. GoPro had 1,254 employees as of Sept. 30.
""Cutting costs is a good move, although now it's about if the company can turn this ship around themselves,"" Daniel Ives, analyst at GBH Insights, said.

Woodman will reduce his 2018 cash compensation to $1, the company said.
