Madrid, winners of European soccer’s elite competition for the last three seasons, were firm favorites with bookmakers to progress to the quarter finals after winning the first leg in Amsterdam 2-1 on Feb. 13. But two Ajax goals within the first 18 minutes on Tuesday night left Los Blancos, the world’s richest soccer club, chasing the tie.
Dusan Tadic’s goal in the sixty-second minute meant the game’s richest team was all but out of the tournament, and the match finished 4-1 to Ajax, or 5-3 on aggregate. Ajax have won the tournament previously known as the European Cup four times, but the last victory was in 1995. The club hasn’t reached the quarter final since 2003.
Ajax’s shares jumped 9.5 percent to 16.80 euros at 9:15 a.m. in Amsterdam, giving the company a market value of 307.1 million euros ($347.2 million). The intraday advance of 11 percent was the biggest since March 2017.
A place in the next round is worth an extra 10.5 million euros ($11.9 million) in prize money, with another 31 million euros potentially at stake if clubs progress further. Success in the tournament also tends to bring greater leverage with sponsors."

The latest examples: Marks & Spencer Group (LON:MKS) Plc said it would finance a $1 billion investment with new shares and cut its dividend;  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) Plc issued bonds that will be repaid in stock instead of cash in a few years’ time, sparing balance-sheet damage in the near-term.
One takeaway is intuitive enough. The equity of levered or cyclical companies is in the firing line late as bondholders play defense late in the business cycle.
The harder part is sizing up this brewing shift -- and making money from it. The new-year rally is feeding demand for risky balance sheets. Hedge funds are struggling to find short bets en masse. And what’s good for bondholders can boost equity peers over the long haul.
In short, the tug of war between equity and debt is far from clear-cut.
“The situation for equity investors is getting trickier,” said Roelof Salomons, chief strategist at Kempen Capital Management NV, who’s a fan of equities with strong balance sheets. More treasurers are “running the company for the bondholder and not for the equity holder,” he said.
There are two things market players largely agree on right now. Expect more bad news from cyclical industries with leverage, low growth and margin pressure. And it’s better for treasurers to clean up debts in the good times.
With the memory of the fourth-quarter bloodbath fresh, belated balance-sheet clean-ups could get a company “punished twice,” according to Stephen Repoff, analyst at GW & K Investment Management.
“It makes sense to do some of that dirty work now when expectations are so high,” said Repoff. The market “might give you a pass,” he said.
As M&S Chief Executive Officer Steve Rowe unveiled a plan for a share-dilutive rights issue to fund a joint venture with Ocado (LON:OCDO), he said a foreboding macro climate called for conservative finances.
“We have to make sure our balance sheet is appropriate and our dividend is sustainable,” Rowe said at a press conference last week. “These are uncertain times and we wanted to make sure we had something we could grow on.”
Meanwhile, Vodafone managed to please both shareholders and bondholders, for now. Tuesday it announced a financing package which includes a potential stock buyback as the securities reach maturity in 2021 and 2022.
At Fidelity International, money manager Kristian Atkinson is avoiding tobacco companies faced with higher funding costs that will eat into growth. Retailers with bloated balance sheets are also going to be hard-pressed to meet deleveraging demands as the cycle turns, he said.
Slowing cash flow at Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co., PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc. and  Diageo  (LON:DGE) Plc may prompt dividend cuts at the beverage makers, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kenneth Shea and Duncan Fox.
European names that have taken equity unfriendly actions to placate creditors in recent months include Kier Group Plc, Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and Leoni AG.
“There’s too much leverage and it has to come down as we enter the end of the cycle,” said Georges Gedeon, founder of London hedge fund Antler Capital Partners LLP. He’s on the look-out for capital-structure trades -- like bidding up bonds at the expense of equity -- on speculative-grade retailers and auto-parts companies with rising financing costs.
Such late-cycle trades work best when corporate credit risk rises, Gedeon said.
Indeed, those looking for trades to exploit a deleveraging cycle will need to be patient.
Kevin Muir, a strategist at East West Investment Management Co., also likes trades that short stocks in riskier companies while holding their bonds. The problem is: it may be too soon to put those bets on.
“I still think that this is the story,” Muir said. “But so far, it hasn’t worked. The market has been chasing the levered-up stocks.”
Despite investor concerns about share dilution and leverage, shorting indebted companies in Europe is a losers’ game as companies with weak balance sheets up 16 percent since December lows. What’s more, prospective equity dilutions in recent cases are modest relative to market capitalization while lower stock prices compared to last year’s peak are flattering dividend yields across the board.
The story may play out ever-so gradually. Higher debt-refinancing costs may spur earnings-per-share downgrades in Europe in 2019, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). warned earlier this year.
“The penny hasn’t dropped yet, there needs to be a more aggressive reduction in balance sheets and leverage, and that probably will mean some pain for equity holders,” said Sajiv Vaid, another money manager at Fidelity International in London.
And the interests of shareholders and bondholders may yet align.
Edmund Shing, global head of equity derivative strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA, says dividend cuts can strengthen a company’s finances and give it resources for expansion or strategic turnarounds.
“If the return on these new investments exceeds the cost of capital, then this is a logical step and does not necessarily penalize the equity shareholder, at least in the long-term,” Shing said.

Britain is due to leave the bloc in under four weeks' time but lawmakers could back an extension in a parliamentary vote if Prime Minister Theresa May's exit agreement is voted down, potentially prolonging uncertainty for businesses. 
""If there is a delay of a month or of two months, it will simply be a sort of frustration,"" Mike Flewitt told Reuters during an interview at the Geneva car show. 
""We want to know what the rules are, we want to know how we are going to be trading with the EU partly for selling cars there but probably more significantly is we source a lot of components there,"" he said. 
""If a delay brought a more orderly, managed exit, absolutely fine, then it's worth having a delay."" 

McLaren Automotive sold some 4,800 cars last year made at its southern English factory in Woking.

ATC industrial action, a lack of controllers or other structural issues were responsible for over 75 percent of delays, with the number of EU airline passengers hit up 26 percent on the previous year to 334 million, the industry body said, citing Eurocontrol data.
""Progress on aviation has stalled and we are going backwards,"" Michael O'Leary, Ryanair CEO and A4E Chairman, said in a statement which outlined steps to tackle the issue. 
""The EU must tackle inefficient ATC monopolies through internationalization of airspace, introduction of competition between ATC providers, and quicker delivery and flexible deployment of air traffic controllers.""
Chief executives of A4E members including British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG), easyJet (LON:EZJ), Lufthansa as well as Ryanair met on Wednesday for their annual meeting in Brussels, where they also called for revised regulations on passenger rights and airport charges.
The industry group also pledged to renew efforts on sustainability. A4E said operational issues such as ATC strikes had led to 1 million tonnes of avoidable CO2 emissions since 2014. 
The summit was held a day after a study funded by investors said airlines are doing too little in the fight against global warming, adding more fuel efficient planes and steps to ensure flights are at full capacity would help limit emissions.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China Petroleum and Chemical Corp plans to sign a 20-year liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply agreement with Cheniere Energy once China and the United States end their trade dispute, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.
Cheniere and China Petroleum and Chemical, known as Sinopec, reached a consensus in late-2018 on commercial terms after months of negotiations, but the signing of the deal was held back by the ongoing trade friction between the world's top two economies, one of the sources, who has direct knowledge of the matter, told Reuters. 
""Without the trade spat, the deal should have been signed some time ago,"" the source said, declining to be named because the matter is not public.
In recent weeks, Beijing and Washington appear to have moved closer to a deal to end a bruising eight-month dispute that has seen the countries slap tariffs on billions of dollars worth of the other's good. A resolution is widely expected to include stepped-up Chinese purchase of U.S. goods.
Sinopec intends to buy close to 2 million tonnes a year of LNG from Houston-based Cheniere starting 2023, the two sources added, without giving a deal value.
Cheniere may start delivering some supplies before 2023, said the second of the two sources. 
Based on the delivered cost of U.S.-sourced supplies into east China in January at $8.30 per million British thermal units given by Chinese customs, the 20-year deal would amount to roughly $16 billion. 
Sinopec and Cheniere both declined to comment on the status of a deal.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that as part of a trade deal with the United States, China would buy $18 billion worth of natural gas from Cheniere. Officials from Cheniere visited Beijing in late February, said a third source, who was also familiar with the matter.
Sinopec, a late comer to China's LNG scene compared to domestic rivals China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) and PetroChina, has said it wants to more-than double its receiving capacity over the next six years to around 41 million tonnes annually, by building three new terminals along China's east coast and expanding existing facilities.
China, the world's second-largest LNG buyer after Japan, imported just over 2 million tonnes of the super-chilled fuel in the first nine months of 2018 from the United States, according to Chinese customs.
Imports have since almost dried up after Beijing announced a 10 percent tariff on U.S. LNG in September, with sporadic shipments in November and January, amid an escalation of the tit-for-tat trade war.
In February 2018, before the trade war started, PetroChina's parent company CNPC signed a 20-year deal with Cheniere to buy 1.2 million tonnes of LNG a year through 2043, with a portion of the supply beginning in 2018.
Thanks to its shale boom, the United States is on track to become the world's third-biggest LNG exporter by capacity in 2019, after Australia and Qatar.

Cheniere said last week it planned to make a final investment decision to build a sixth liquefaction train at its Sabine Pass LNG export terminal in Louisiana in the coming months.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are mostly lower in early trading Wednesday, with the latest in a string of money-laundering exposures still weighing on bank stocks, and a profit warning from one of the continent’s biggest auto suppliers casting more gloom over that sector.
At 04:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was inching down 0.12 points, 375.52. The Stoxx Automobiles and Parts index was down 1.1%, while the banks sectoral index was down 0.3%
A new report alleging billions more in illicit transactions out of Russia handled by western banks hit Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank International (DE:RBIV) and Dutch-based ING (AS:INGA) hard Tuesday, and both are still falling this morning. While Raiffeisen figures most prominently in the report, ING is suffering because it’s less than a year since it agreed reached a wide-ranging and expensive settlement with Dutch prosecutors for compliance shortcomings.
However, the impact on  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) appears to be fading, given that Deutsche’s role was again limited to that of a correspondent bank. ABN argues its restructuring since its takeover in 2007 means it’s not liable for any of the business in the report.
Elsewhere, German auto supplier Schaeffler (DE:SHA_p) fell over 7% at the opening after it abandoned its 2020 profit targets due to pressure on its business in Greater China and Europe. It’s regained some of those losses in the meantime, but it has dragged down the whole auto sector.
On a brighter note, Dutch football club AFC Ajax (AS:AJAX) Amsterdam is up 9.2% after a stunning victory in the Champions League over holders Real Madrid, a victory that knocked out the team that has won the trophy four of the last five years. It’s a different story for Borussia Dortmund (DE:BVB), which is down another 2.1% after exiting the competition last night. It’s down over 10% since defeat in the first leg of the tie effectively sealed its fate – and its faltering challenge for the domestic championship is likely to put further pressure on the share price."

9,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 03:16AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Philip Morris paid for India manufacturing despite ban on foreign investment – documents,"By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) has for years paid manufacturing costs to its Indian partner to make its Marlboro cigarettes, circumventing a nine-year-old government ban on foreign direct investment in the industry, internal company documents reviewed by Reuters showed.
The Indian government in 2010 prohibited foreign direct investment (FDI) in cigarette manufacturing, saying the measure would enhance its efforts to curb smoking.
Restricting foreign investment leaves cigarette manufacturing largely in the hands of domestic players, and is supposed to prevent any foreign-funded expansion. A year after the government's decision, Japan Tobacco exited India, citing an ""unsustainable business model"".
Philip Morris, though, stayed in India and used another route, according to company documents dated between May 2009 and January 2018. A year before the FDI ban, it struck an exclusive deal with India's Godfrey Phillips to locally manufacture the world-famous Marlboro cigarettes. 
Ever since then, Godfrey has publicly acted as a contract manufacturer of Marlboro cigarettes in India, while Philip Morris's majority-owned local unit acts as a wholesale trading company and promotes the brand.
But dozens of internal company documents - including invoice bills, legal agreements, e-mails and accounting statements - show Philip Morris has for years indirectly paid costs related to Marlboro cigarette manufacturing in India.
Some former Indian enforcement officials said the practice of indirectly paying for manufacturing-related costs violates regulatory rules. However, some lawyers such as Pratibha Jain, a partner at Nishith Desai Associates, disagreed, pointing out that the federal rules did not explicitly prohibit such payments.
Philip Morris' director for corporate affairs in India, R. Venkatesh, in an e-mail, said the company's ""business arrangements with Godfrey Phillips India comply with Indian Foreign Direct Investment Rules"". He did not elaborate. 
The company did not answer detailed questions for this article and did not offer any executive for interview, despite repeated requests from Reuters over the past month.
MANUFACTURING CHARGES
Six invoices issued by Godfrey showed billing of 45.5 million Indian rupees ($644,200) to Philip Morris between December 2013 and January 2018 for manufacturing-related charges. Philip Morris paid for items ranging from large cigarette-making machines to costs of smaller equipment such as barcode scanners and printers deployed in Godfrey's factories. 
One invoice from January 2018 sent from Godfrey to Philip Morris showed the Indian company had spent 206 million rupees ($3 million) on capital expenditure for Marlboro-related manufacturing activities since 2009, though it was not clear how much of that was paid by Philip Morris. 
Godfrey Phillips' head of corporate affairs, Harmanjit Singh, said in an email that all the commercial arrangements ""are in complete compliance with the extant regulations governing the Indian Foreign Direct Investment and other applicable laws, and, incidentally, all transactions are in Indian Rupees. Also, it is our considered view that no illegality can be impugned to these commercial transactions between the parties.""
Philip Morris' local unit and Godfrey arranged a mechanism for such transfer of funds around the time they struck the 2009 deal. A 94-page ""procurement agreement"" signed between the two sides that year, which is not public but has been reviewed by Reuters, said that Godfrey may acquire new machinery for solely manufacturing Marlboro cigarettes and will then ""invoice PM (Philip Morris) India"" for charges in a phased manner. Philip Morris ""shall pay such invoice by bank transfer"", the agreement said.
The agreement specified Philip Morris would make periodic payments calculated according to the normal depreciation charge of the machinery, plus 10 percent per annum on its net book value.
Other than those regular payments, Philip Morris also signed off on one-time expenses and refurbishment costs incurred by Godfrey on at least two occasions in 2013 and 2014, according to internal e-mails and accounting records. It then accounted those transactions internally under a heading ""Packaging - Research"", accounting records showed.
""THEY ARE CAMOUFLAGING""
Three former officials and one former head of India's main financial crime-fighting agency, the Enforcement Directorate, reviewed the Philip Morris documents for Reuters and said the dealings should be investigated for circumventing India's foreign investment rules. 
One of the former officials said that paying for machines to manufacture cigarettes essentially resulted in the promotion of cigarettes, and the government's intent of banning foreign direct investment in 2010 was to deter that.
Bhure Lal, a former head of India's Enforcement Directorate, said the companies ""should be investigated ... they are camouflaging"". 
The current chief of India's Enforcement Directorate, Sanjay Kumar Mishra, did not respond to a request for comment.
If the Enforcement Directorate investigates a company and finds it to be in violation of the rules, Indian law allows it to impose a penalty of up to three times the amount contravened.
Jain of Nishith Desai Associates, which also advises global companies on foreign investment rules and reviewed the Philip Morris documents for Reuters, said the company was able to circumvent the FDI prohibition in cigarette manufacturing by paying for the machines through invoices. That's because the Indian regulations only restrict direct foreign investments into a company and were silent on such indirect payments for machines, she said.
""The company can argue in its defense that it is only funding the equipment purchases and not investing directly in an Indian cigarette manufacturing company, and they would be technically correct,"" Jain told Reuters.
INDIA CIGARETTE MARKET
The Indian journey of Philip Morris, which is one of the world's largest international tobacco companies, began in the late 1960s when it acquired a majority stake in the London-based parent of Godfrey Phillips. It gradually reduced its stake in Godfrey over the years, in part due to regulatory changes, and currently holds a 25 percent equity stake.
Though India banned foreign investment in cigarette manufacturing in 2010, it still allowed tobacco companies to invest through technology collaboration and licensing agreements. Investments could also be made by forming a trading company. 
Ahead of the 2010 ban, Philip Morris formed a new wholesale trading company with Godfrey. The New Delhi-headquartered local unit, named IPM India Wholesale Trading Pvt. Ltd, is 50.1 percent owned by the global tobacco giant, with the rest owned by Godfrey and an investment firm.
Among the payments outlined in the documents, Godfrey in January 2018 sent an invoice to Philip Morris's local unit for 10.2 million rupees ($144,500), billing for charges for the preceding six-month period, an invoice showed. In August 2017, Godfrey sent an invoice for manufacturing-related charges of 9.5 million rupees ($134,600).
The documents also showed that Philip Morris at times would discuss with Godfrey which type of equipment should be used for Marlboro manufacturing, and then sign off on related payments. 
In July 2016, the head of Philip Morris's India supply chain operations, Nilay Mehta, asked a Godfrey Phillip executive in an e-mail to raise a purchase order for an embossing roller, a type of equipment used in cigarette manufacturing.
Given the equipment had to be used only for Marlboro manufacturing, ""IPM will be picking the cost for this"", Mehta said in an email to a Godfrey executive on July 26, 2016. 
Mehta did not respond to an e-mail from Reuters. 
India has 106 million smokers, second only to China, and a young demographic makes it an attractive market for tobacco companies. 

Philip Morris is a small player in India's estimated $12 billion cigarette market but has seen its market share rise steadily in recent years. That was aided by its marketing activities, such as advertising at roadside kiosks and free distribution of cigarettes at parties. Both tactics were described as illegal by health officials in a Reuters investigation published in 2017. (https://reut.rs/2uy9vOr)

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese online retailers have started discounting iPhones for the second time this year as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) wrestles with a prolonged sales slowdown in the world's largest smartphone market.
Several electronics vendors announced discounts on iPhone devices this week, following mass discounts in January just before Apple reported sinking sales in China.
Gadget retailer Suning.Com Co Ltd said it would slash the price of the iPhone XS by as much as 1,000 yuan ($148.95) from its official price. Suning had lowered the prices of other iPhone models in January along with other retailers, but those cuts excluded the iPhone XS.
Pinduoduo Inc, an e-commerce site best known for selling inexpensive goods, has also said it would sell the 64GB edition of the iPhone XS for 6,999 yuan, a drop of over 1,000 yuan from the official price. 
Online retail giant JD.com Inc said it would offer discounts on a range of Apple products including the iPhone XS and XS Max, with models of the latter device selling at discounts of up to 1,700 yuan. Like Suning, JD.com initially did not discount the iPhone XS upon its first major round of discounts in January.
Apple, JD.com and Pinduoduo did not respond to requests for comment, while Suning could not be reached.
Apple's sales from China declined 20 percent year-on-year, according to its most recent earnings report. Slowing demand for smartphones and increased competition from local brands have chipped at its dominance in the country.
The U.S. company has yet to change the official sticker prices of its devices that it lists on its Chinese website. Yet the company has partnered with Ant Financial, the finance arm of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, and several state-owned banks to let consumers purchase iPhones via interest-free loans.

11,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 01:40AM ET</span>",Factors that have propelled Chinese stocks to nine-month highs,"By Luoyan Liu and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese stocks have staged a robust rebound this year, unexpectedly recouping much of 2018's sharp losses, buoyed by hopes Beijing will roll out more support measures for the slowing economy and signs of progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks.
Adding fuel to the rally is a pick up in the momentum in the A-share market's internationalization process, which drew foreign money into China even as authorities vowed to further open up its financial markets and deepen reforms.
The benchmark Shanghai composite index SSEC gained 17.9 percent in the first two months of 2019, versus an 8.2 percent rise in MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares in the same period. 
(For a graphic on 'Shanghai benchmark VS. MSCI Asia Pacific' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ul6URs)
Growth in the world's second largest economy cooled to a 28-year low in 2018, and authorities have announced a flurry of measures in recent months to reduce the risk of a sharper slowdown. 
China will cut billions of dollars more in taxes and fees, increase infrastructure investment, and step up lending to small firms, Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday. 
In a move to further lower financing costs and spur growth, China's central bank in October announced a steep cut in the level of cash that banks must hold as reserves, its fourth in 2018. 
There have been signs of credit easing. China's banks made the most new loans on record in January - totaling 3.23 trillion yuan ($482.58 billion), as policymakers try to jumpstart sluggish investment. 
Proposed subsidies on items such as appliances have helped push up China's consumer firms, which have long been liked by foreigners, with the CSI consumer staples index having gained nearly 30 percent this year.

Market participants were also encouraged by the developments in Sino-U.S. trade talks.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday he thought the United States and China were ""on the cusp"" of a deal to end their trade war, adding to positive signs about negotiations from both sides of the Pacific.
Analysts say a trade deal would be no panacea for China's ailing economy, but it would relieve some pressure on its exporters and manufacturers and help business confidence. 
TECH TOPS
At the forefront of the rebound, technology firms soared as Beijing continues its push to reduce dependence on foreign technology and to upgrade its industries. 
China has finalised regulations for a new tech board that promises to smooth the way for Chinese technology IPOs and, if successful, could raise Shanghai's profile as a capital-raising competitor to Hong Kong and New York. 
As of March 4, the CSI information technology index had surged nearly 40 percent so far this year, while an index tracking major telecoms firms had also advanced more than 30 percent. 
The tech-heavy start-up board ChiNextp shot up 30 percent so far this year, up to Monday. 
Financial firms also shone, with the CSI300 financials index up nearly 30 percent this year, as investors cheered Beijing's plan to deepen supply-side reforms in the sector, counting finance as a key part of its core competitiveness. 
(For a graphic on 'China's tech firms lead charge' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2C3jnlK)
INFLOWS
Also powering the rally is a surge in foreign inflows, a not yet dominant though increasingly significant force in the A-share market, just as the country further deregulates its capital markets.
Net flows into the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets via the Stock Connect scheme as of end February topped 120 billion yuan, nearly four times that in the first two months of 2018. 
In late January, China said it would ease foreign institutions' access by combining two inbound investment schemes, while broadening their investment scope to include derivatives, bond repurchases and private funds. 
Global index provider MSCI said it will quadruple the weighting of Chinese mainland shares in its global benchmarks later this year, potentially drawing more than $80 billion of fresh foreign inflows to the world's second-biggest economy.

14,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 06, 2019 12:50AM ET</span>",Huawei's Meng Wanzhou Prepares for Extradition Court Battle,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou begins her battle Wednesday against extradition to the U.S. to face fraud charges, aided by a phalanx of lawyers gearing up for a full-blown legal offensive.
The Supreme Court of British Columbia in Vancouver is expected to set the date of her first extradition hearing -- the start of a politically explosive proceeding that could take years and has entwined the fate of two Canadians detained in China. Meng has been under house arrest at her Vancouver mansion since she was arrested Dec. 1 while en route to Mexico.
China has accused Canada of abetting ""a political persecution"" against its biggest technology company and has demanded the release of Meng, daughter of billionaire Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei. History shows that if Canada follows the letter of its law, Meng will likely be extradited. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has muddied the legal waters with conflicting statements on whether he might try to intervene in what’s supposed to be an independent law enforcement operation in order to boost a China trade deal.
In an escalation of the dispute, the Chinese technology giant intends to file a lawsuit this week claiming the U.S. government is overstepping by banning Huawei equipment from certain networks. That complaint would come just days after Meng sued Canada’s government and border service for allegedly trampling her constitutional rights in an effort to discredit the extradition case against her.
Prisoner in Vancouver: Huawei CFO Awaits Fate in Splendor
U.S. prosecutors in New York accuse Meng of fraud, alleging she lied to banks including  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) to trick them into processing transactions for Huawei that potentially violated Iran trade sanctions. She faces multiple criminal charges, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years imprisonment, according to court documents.
Since her December release on C$10 million ($7.5 million) bail, she’s been living with her husband and youngest daughter in one of the family’s two luxury homes in Vancouver, a city where they’d often spent their summer holidays.
At least five law firms in Vancouver, Toronto and New York are working on her defense. Her bail hearings in December had drawn crowds: supporters calling for her release, Huawei and Chinese consular officials, and a group of lawyers and aides who’d occupied two rows of seats in the public gallery.
Her legal team moved onto the offensive on Friday, filing a lawsuit against the Canadian government, the border services agency and a police officer. In it, she claims officers failed to immediately arrest her at the Vancouver airport and instead detained her under the guise of a routine custom check to “unlawfully compel her to provide evidence and information.”
Chinese Arrests Are All Too Familiar for Past Canadian Detainees
While Meng awaits her hearing, two Canadians who were detained in China nine days after Meng’s arrest remain in captivity. Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig will soon mark three months in secret jails, where they’ve had a total of seven consular visits combined and have yet to see a lawyer. After Canada last Friday formally moved Meng’s case toward extradition proceedings, China responded swiftly, accusing Kovrig on Monday of spying and alleging that Spavor supplied him with intelligence.
Black Jails
In China, Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on leave from the foreign service, was working for a Brussels-based non-profit research group, while Spavor was a North Korea travel guide based in the Chinese border town of Dandong. They were whisked away by China’s state security to extrajudicial detention centers known as ""black jails.""
Kovrig and Spavor are being held in isolation, questioned multiple times a day in cells where the lights can’t be turned off, according to a person familiar with the situation. Kovrig has also been questioned on his activities as a diplomat. Canadian officials believe that’s a violation of the Vienna Convention -- to which China is a signatory -- conferring ongoing immunity for that period in his life.
China’s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission announced Monday that Kovrig had “severely” violated Chinese law by spying and stealing state secrets while working for the International Crisis Group and said that Spavor was his primary contact. Also in January, a third Canadian, Robert Schellenberg, saw his sentence in a drug case increased to the death penalty rather than a prison term in a one-day trial at a Chinese court.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday said it approved a Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) nasal spray antidepressant for people resistant to other treatments but placed restrictions on use of the drug, which it warned could be misused and abused.
The approval of nasal spray esketamine marks the first new type of treatment for depression in more than 30 years and has raised hopes for its relatively fast action and ability to treat some otherwise unreachable patients.
Esketamine would be sold under the brand name Spravato and is a chemical mirror image of anesthetic ketamine, which is also abused as a recreational party drug and goes by the street nickname ""Special K"". To prevent abuse, patients must take the drug in a doctor's office or medical facility and cannot take it home.
Currently available anti-depressants such as Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co's Prozac work on neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine, but most drugs take at least four weeks to show effect and fail to produce an adequate response in about 30 percent to 40 percent of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).
""Spravato has the potential to change the treatment paradigm and offer new hope to the estimated one-third of people with major depressive disorder who have not responded to existing therapies,"" said Mathai Mammen, global head of J&J's Janssen Research & Development.
Spravato has been touted as an asset with blockbuster potential and is expected to improve investor sentiment toward the growth prospects of J&J's pharma unit Janssen, as its top-selling rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade faces increased competition from cheaper biosimilars.
The treatment carries a boxed warning - FDA's harshest - flagging the risk for sedation and difficulty with attention, judgment and thinking, abuse and misuse, and suicidal thoughts after administration of the drug.
Spravato is absorbed by the lining of the nasal passages and into the blood stream and will be used along with a newly prescribed oral antidepressant, Johnson & Johnson said in a statement http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/htmlnews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541&u= 
During clinical trials, Spravato was found to relieve depression symptoms within 24 hours in some patients, said Janssen spokesman Greg Panico.
The approval comes after an FDA advisory panel in February voted heavily in favor of the drug esketamine, saying its benefits outweighed the risks.
However, the panel members echoed concerns raised by FDA staffers regarding the increased risk of sedation, dissociation and higher blood pressure observed in the study.
The drug is also being tested in patients with depression who are at a high risk of committing suicide.

Recent research shows that depression involves deterioration of the quality and number of nerve cell connections in areas of the brain related to mood. J&J's drug helps restore these nerve cell connections in the brain, leading to an improvement in depression symptoms, according to the company. Over 300 million people globally live with major depressive disorders, and the incidence of attempted suicide in people with this condition is about 20-fold higher than that among those without the disorder.

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc is not criminally liable in a March 2018 crash in Tempe, Arizona, in which one of the company's self-driving cars struck and killed a pedestrian, prosecutors said on Tuesday.
The Yavapai County Attorney said in a letter made public that there was ""no basis for criminal liability"" for Uber, but that the back-up driver, Rafaela Vasquez, should be referred to the Tempe police for additional investigation. 
Prosecutors' decision not to pursue criminal charges removes one potential headache for the ride-hailing company as the company's executives try to resolve a long list of federal investigations, lawsuits and other legal risks ahead of a hotly anticipated initial public offering this year.
The crash involved a Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle that Uber was using to test self-driving technology. The fatal accident was a setback from which the company has yet to recover; its autonomous vehicle testing remains dramatically reduced. 
The accident was also a blow to the entire autonomous vehicle industry and led other companies to temporarily halt their testing. Scrutiny has mounted on the nascent technology, which presents fatal risks but has minimal oversight from regulators. 
Vasquez, the Uber back-up driver, could face charges of vehicular manslaughter, according to a police report in June. Vasquez has not previously commented and could not immediately be reached on Tuesday.
Based on a video taken inside the car, records collected from online entertainment streaming service Hulu and other evidence, police said last year that Vasquez was looking down and streaming an episode of the television show ""The Voice"" on a phone until about the time of the crash. The driver looked up a half-second before hitting Elaine Herzberg, 49, who died from her injuries.
Police called the incident ""entirely avoidable."" 
Yavapai County Attorney's Office, which examined the case at the request of Maricopa County where the accident occurred, did not explain the reasoning for not finding criminal liability against Uber. Yavapai sent the case back to Maricopa, calling for further expert analysis of the video to determine what the driver should have seen that night.
An Uber spokeswoman declined to comment on the letter.
The National Transportation Safety Board and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are still investigating.
The Maricopa County Attorney's Office did not immediately comment on Tuesday. 
Uber in December filed confidentially for an initial public offering and is expected to seek a valuation of up to $120 billion. Its self-driving program, which costs hundreds of millions of dollars and does not generate revenue yet, is likely to come under scrutiny by investors. 
The ride-hailing company, which last year lost about $3.3 billion, is betting on a transition to self-driving cars to eliminate the need to pay drivers. 
At an autonomous vehicles conference in Silicon Valley last week, industry leaders lamented the loss of confidence from the public, regulators and investors that lingers a year after the Uber crash. There is no consensus on safety standards for the industry.
In March 2018, authorities in Arizona suspended Uber’s ability to test its self-driving cars. Uber also voluntarily halted its entire autonomous car testing program and left Arizona. 
In December, Uber resumed limited self-driving car testing in Pittsburgh, restricting the cars to a small loop they can drive only in good weather. The company is now testing with two people in the front seat and more strictly monitors safety drivers. The company also said last year it made improvements to the vehicles’ self-driving software.
Uber has not resumed testing in San Francisco or Toronto, where it previously had programs.

Overnight in the U.S., most major indices slipped but the losses were relatively mild with the S&P 500 closing down 0.11%, the Dow 30 down just 0.05% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq virtually flat.
In Asia, with no significant news on the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China and the Chinese government focused on the meeting of the National People’s Congress, movements were generally constrained.
The Shanghai Composite Index was up just 0.05% by 9:15 AM ET (2:25 AM GMT) to 3,055 while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.45% to 9,553.
In Hong Kong Tuesday morning, the Hang Seng Index was up 0.19% at mid-morning to 29,019.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.71% to 21,571 and the Kospi in Korea was trading down 0.36% to 2,175.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.49% to 6,229.
On Tuesday, China’s National People’s Congress opened its annual meeting and policymakers lowered the target for economic growth in the country to between 6% and 6.5% for 2019, providing a target “band” rather than the more specific goal of around 6.5% for 2018. Regulators also announced cuts to the value added tax (VAT), including a 3% to the top bracket, in a move that could help support manufacturing. The tax could add up to as much as CNY800 billion, according to figures from Morgan Stanley quoted by Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, trade negotiations between the U.S. and China are progressing and a deal could be reached as early as this month, according to reports by the Wall Street Journal over the weekend. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the media that the trade dispute between the two countries could be resolved soon.
“We’re trying to get that rectified, get that fixed, make it fair and reciprocal and I think we’re on the cusp of doing that and I hope all those tariffs will go away, all those barriers,” Pompeo said in comments reported by CNBC.

21,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 07:55PM ET</span>",FDA chief tough on e-cigs steps down in surprise resignation,"By Yasmeen Abutaleb
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on Tuesday that he plans to step down next month, a sudden resignation that calls into question how the agency will handle issues such as surging e-cigarette use among teens and efforts to increase competition in prescription drugs. 
Gottlieb was well regarded by public health advocates and won bipartisan support for his efforts to curb use of flavored e-cigarettes by youths, speed approval times for cheap generic medicines to increase competition and bring down drug prices, and boost the use of cheaper versions of expensive biotech medicines called biosimilars.
Unlike his predecessors, who said drug pricing was not the purview of the FDA, Gottlieb waded into the intensifying debate about the high cost of medicines for U.S. consumers and had the agency actively looking into possible solutions. 
""Scott's leadership inspired historic results from the FDA team, which delivered record approvals of both innovative treatments and affordable generic drugs, while advancing important policies to confront opioid addiction, tobacco and youth e-cigarette use,"" Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement. 
Gottlieb, who said he wanted to spend more time with his wife and three young children in Connecticut, was nominated by President Donald Trump in part to aid in Trump's anti-regulation agenda. But Gottlieb took an aggressive stance toward e-cigarette makers, such as Juul Labs Inc.
On Monday, he confronted 15 retailers including Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, for illegally selling tobacco products to children. In early February, the FDA pursued enforcement actions against some Walgreen and Circle K locations. 
But Gottlieb ran into fierce opposition from anti-regulation groups, such as Americans for Tax Reform, and former FDA officials, who said the agency's regulatory efforts would destroy thousands of jobs. 
A coalition of these groups wrote Trump last month asking him to ""immediately halt the Food and Drug Administration's aggressive regulatory assault"" on e-cigarette businesses. 
Following news of Gottlieb's resignation, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index turned negative.
It closed down 0.5 percent as shares of  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) erased gains and  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD) shares fell further. Shares of  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) Plc rose after the news on Gottlieb, who had signaled his intention to also go after menthol and other flavored cigarette products.
“He made proposals that were unprecedented in their breadth, scope and, if they were adopted, likely impact,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. “But they were just proposals."" 
E-CIG 'EPIDEMIC' 
Gottlieb's campaign against flavored e-cigarettes followed preliminary federal data showing teenage use had surged by more than 75 percent since last year, which the FDA described as an ""epidemic."" 
Under Gottlieb, the FDA proposed a ban on the sale of fruit- and candy-flavored electronic cigarettes in convenience stores and gas stations. The FDA also proposed stricter age-verification requirements for online sales of e-cigarettes. 
""Scott has helped us to lower drug prices, get a record number of generic drugs approved and onto the market, and so many other things. He and his talents will be greatly missed!"" Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday.
Trump picked Gottlieb to lead the agency in March 2017 and he was confirmed by the Senate in May of that year. 
The Washington Post first reported on Tuesday that Gottlieb planned to resign. 
""There's perhaps nothing that could pull me away from this role other than the challenge of being apart from my family for these past two years,"" Gottlieb wrote in a note to FDA staff.
In his resignation letter, Gottlieb touted several agency initiatives, including efforts to curb tobacco use, decrease the rate of opioid addiction, speed up approval of generic drugs and streamline the process to bring to market novel medical technologies, such as gene therapy.
Gottlieb, 46, a conservative and former physician, was deputy FDA commissioner under Republican President George W. Bush. Before taking over at FDA, he was a healthcare investor and consultant who sat on multiple company boards.
He surprised critics who worried about his ties to the pharmaceutical industry by speaking out about rising drug prices and drug company tactics to keep competitors off the market.
“In all my years of public service, I’ve never worked with a more talented, forthright, and effective agency leader than Dr. Scott Gottlieb,"" Republican Congressman Greg Walden said in a statement. ""He worked effectively with Congress to find solutions and to improve the quality of life for all of us.""
Gottlieb often touted that the agency had approved more than 1,000 generic drugs as evidence that it was helping to curb prescription drug prices, a priority of Trump's administration.
Among those seen as possible successors, according to the Wall Street Journal, are Norman Sharpless, director of the National Cancer Institute, and Brett Giroir, assistant secretary at HHS. Giroir has been the senior adviser to Azar for HHS efforts to fight the opioid crisis.
In January, Gottlieb said in a tweet that he did not plan to leave the agency after speculation that he was preparing to step down. ""We've got a lot of important policy we'll advance this year,"" he wrote in the January tweet.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration called on Congress to modernize rules for cosmetics safety on Tuesday after it issued an alert warning consumers not to use three cosmetics products sold by Claire's Stores Inc because they tested positive for asbestos, a known carcinogen.
The FDA said it would work with Congress to update the regulatory framework that the agency has been operating under for more than 80 years for cosmetics. It said there are currently no legal requirements for any cosmetic manufacturer selling goods to American consumers to test their products for safety.
In its safety alert, the FDA identified the products as Claire's eye shadows, contour palette and compact powder and cited the talc used in the products.
Claire’s disputed the FDA test results, saying they “show significant errors” and have “mischaracterized fibers in the products as asbestos.”
The retailer, which emerged from bankruptcy in October, said, “There is no evidence that any products sold by Claire’s are unsafe.” However, out of an abundance of caution, it said it removed the three products in question from stores as well as “any remaining talc based cosmetic products.”
The FDA has come under intensifying pressure from lawmakers and consumer advocates to investigate possible asbestos contamination of talc following a report published by Reuters on Dec. 14 about talc in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) powders. The Reuters report detailed that J&J knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s. J&J did not disclose its test results to regulators or consumers.
The alleged presence of asbestos in talc products is at issue in thousands of lawsuits filed against J&J. Last month, J&J said it had received federal subpoenas for the first time related to the asbestos litigation and said it is cooperating with the inquiries.
J&J and its talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, have said numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown their talc to be safe and asbestos-free.
In response to the FDA’s call on Tuesday for new rules, J&J said it supports the agency’s efforts to “reaffirm the safety of cosmetic talc products.” The company said it has backed previous legislative efforts to modernize FDA’s regulatory authority over cosmetics.
J&J also reiterated Tuesday that “for decades global independent laboratories and health authorities have tested Johnson’s Baby Powder and have never found asbestos.” 
""SHIFT THE SAFETY PARADIGM""
The FDA on Tuesday said it would investigate cosmetics manufacturers' sources for talc and what steps they take to test the raw material or their finished products. The agency did not name specific companies.
""We also want to know how many cosmetics products contain talc and whether manufacturers have received adverse event reports associated with talc-containing products,"" the FDA said.
In a joint statement on Tuesday, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who separately announced his resignation, and the director of the agency's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Susan Mayne, said federal rules have not keep pace with the cosmetic industry's substantial growth and a global supply chain.
""To significantly shift the safety paradigm of cosmetics in the U.S., we would need to work with stakeholders, including Congress, to modernize the outdated regulatory framework that the FDA has been operating under for more than 80 years when it comes to cosmetics,"" they said in the statement.
The FDA said the new rules for cosmetics manufacturers may require companies to report adverse events, provide access to consumer complaints during routine inspections and disclose known allergens on a product’s label.
In the meantime, U.S. regulators are asking cosmetics firms to voluntarily register their products and a list of ingredients, including talc, with the FDA.
Asbestos is a mineral often found near talc, a common ingredient in many cosmetics, and if steps are not taken to purify raw talc sufficiently the talc put in consumer products may be contaminated with asbestos, the FDA said.
Talc may be used in cosmetics, for example, to prevent caking or to make facial makeup opaque.
In 2017, the FDA said it became aware of reports of asbestos contamination in several cosmetics sold by Claire's and another retailer, Justice, which is owned by Ascena Retail Group Inc. The two retailers subsequently removed certain products, such as glitter creams, eye shadows and make-up sets.
The FDA then ordered independent tests and the results received in late February confirmed asbestos in three Claire's products and one from Justice. The Justice product had already been recalled from the market. 
In a statement on Tuesday, Justice said it “quickly and responsibly issued a voluntary recall in 2017 out of an abundance of caution.”
The FDA said Claire's had refused to comply with its request to recall the products that tested positive for asbestos. The FDA said it does not have the authority to mandate a recall, so it issued the safety alert. 
The United States Public Interest Research Group last May reported the health and safety regulator for the Netherlands ordered Claire's to remove several makeup products from Dutch shops after a study by U.S. PIRG showed contamination with asbestos.
Claire's in March 2018, in a statement, questioned the accuracy of asbestos testing by Dutch authorities. It said its own testing at independent laboratories in the European Union and the United States labs found that Claire's products were “compliant with all relevant cosmetic safety regulations.” 
Claire's, based in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, operated 2,471 stores in North America and Europe as of August 2018. 

The FDA said the warning pertains to: Claire’s Eye Shadows – Batch No/Lot No: 08/17; Claire’s Compact Powder – Batch No/Lot No: 07/15; and Claire’s Contour Palette – Batch No/Lot No: 04/17.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Opposition leader Juan Guaido has asked Citibank to delay by 120 days Venezuela's scheduled repurchase of gold that President Nicolas Maduro's government put up as collateral for a loan in 2015, three members of the team advising Guaido said. 
Advisers to Guaido, who has been recognized by most Western nations as Venezuela's legitimate head of state, have met with Citibank officials to ask them to hold off claiming the gold that Maduro's cash-strapped government committed to give up if it failed to pay off the loan by its March due date.
One of the sources told Reuters that Citibank has not yet informed them whether or not it will agree to the request. A Citibank spokesperson declined to comment. Venezuela's Information Ministry and the central bank did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the loan and its own discussions with Citibank, if any.
The request is part of the opposition's strategy to safeguard Venezuela's foreign assets and prevent the socialist Maduro government from selling off gold reserves to raise hard currency amid tightening sanctions. 
Guaido, who invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency in January, accuses Maduro of being illegitimate; Maduro says he is victim of a U.S.-led economic war to force him from power.
The U.S. government has recognized Guaido as Venezuela's leader and anchored that decision by ordering all U.S. companies buying crude from state oil company PDVSA to make payments into bank accounts controlled by Guaido's government.
Maduro's government began to use gold swap deals some four years ago in order to obtain financing as oil income plummeted in the face of sanctions. Under such agreements, if the borrower does not pay back the loan on time, the financial institution keeps the gold.
Venezuela allowed a similar gold swap arrangement to expire in 2017, a legislator said at the time.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy/venezuela-allows-1-7-billion-gold-swap-with-deutsche-to-lapse-legislator-idUSKBN1CS2CD
In a public report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in February, Citibank said the Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) had agreed to repurchase an undisclosed amount of gold in March as part of an agreement signed by both institutions in 2015. The report did not give an exact date for the agreement.
In the deal, the BCV had sold $1.6 billion of gold to a British unit of Citibank, to be held at the Bank of England, according to the report filed to the U.S. market regulator.
The sources did not specify whether repurchasing the gold would cost more or less than the original $1.6 billion.
""The next such date will be in March 2019 at which time the BCV will be required to purchase a significant amount of gold from Citi under terms of the Agreements,"" it said in the report.
Guaido has asked British authorities to prevent Maduro from gaining access to any gold reserves held in the Bank of England, which holds around $1.2 billion in bullion for Maduro's government.

The Bank of England has said it does not comment on client operations.

28,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 05:58PM ET</span>","GE's CEO warns of negative industrial cash flow in 2019, shares drop","By Alwyn Scott and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's chief executive surprised investors on Tuesday by forecasting a net cash outflow from its industrial businesses this year mainly due to its ailing power-plant unit, a gloomy outlook that sent shares and bonds tumbling.
""Industrial free cash flow will be (in) negative territory,"" compared with a positive $4.5 billion last year, CEO Larry Culp said in a webcast interview with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Stephen Tusa, a longtime GE bear. 
The shock remark dealt a fresh blow to GE investors who have watched the Boston-based conglomerate slash its dividend as it took massive asset write-downs and huge insurance charges last year. The stock is up nearly 36 percent this year but is still worth less than a third of its value in mid-2016.
""I don't want to sugarcoat"" the problems in GE's power business, Culp said, adding the unit likely will lose more cash in 2019 than the $2.7 billion in free cash flow it lost in 2018.
The cash forecast shows ""demand for GE's (power) turbines is half what the company forecast two years ago, and this is likely to persist into 2020,"" said Jim Corridore, an analyst at CFRA, who rates GE a ""buy.""
The stock swiftly fell below $10, the company's biggest intraday percentage drop in more than three months, which knocked more than $4 billion off GE's market value. The shares closed 4.7 percent lower at $9.89 on Tuesday after falling as much as 7.6 percent.
GE's bonds also declined, with GE Capital bonds the hardest hit. A $2.25 billion issue at 4.5 percent coming due in March 2044 was down 1.65 percent. 
""The risk of additional debt ratings downgrades has now increased,"" said John Inch, an analyst at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors, who rates GE ""underperform.""
GE's bonds are rated three notches above junk and it is selling assets to reduce its high level of debt.
Culp's comments went well beyond his January warning that industrial free cash flow, which excludes GE Capital dividends and cash from asset sales, would weaken in 2019. Investors are looking closely at GE's cash because of the gap between cash and earnings. 
Profits collapsed at GE's power unit in mid-2017 as sales fell and the company failed to deliver on promises to increase margins after a $10 billion acquisition of  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) of France. 
Since then, GE has blamed the power unit's losses, which totaled $22 billion last year, on its own poor management and a shift toward new wind and solar power plants.
The power unit is spending at least $480 million to fix thousands of turbine blades that are at risk after blades broke in 2015 and 2018, causing serious damage to power turbines and coinciding with a drop in GE's market share.
GE also has poured billions of dollars into its insurance business, which includes thousands of money-losing long-term care policies written more than a decade ago. Some experts said GE may have to spend billions more to cover claims. 
Culp said the power business would face headwinds for ""a couple of years,"" would not resolve problems with breaking power turbine blades for ""a while"" and promised to step up restructuring in the business and elsewhere. GE declined to provide restructuring cost estimates. The company is due to publish a financial forecast on March 14.
Culp said on Tuesday that GE would continue to provide cash to its GE Capital unit for the foreseeable future, though probably not as much as the $4 billion it provided last year. 

GE Capital used to pay dividends to the parent company, but that stopped after losses mounted at GE's reinsurance business in the second half of 2017.

31,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 05:28PM ET</span>",Brazil minister calls Vale 'important' even as prosecutors probe miner,"By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Brazil's mining minister on Tuesday defended iron ore miner Vale SA as vital to the country's economy, even after prosecutors accused the company of pressuring auditors to suppress evidence that its Brumadinho dam was unstable, months before the dam collapsed in January, killing hundreds.
Minister of Mines and Energy Bento Albuquerque said Vale executives are likely to learn from the disaster, which killed more than 300 and sparked an outcry for tighter mining regulations. 
The January disaster was the second deadly burst in less than four years in Brazil at a Vale-controlled tailings dam, a type of dam that stores the muddy detritus of the mining process. 
Albuquerque told Reuters the world's largest iron ore miner plays an important role in Brazil's economic development. The country's National Mining Agency, the industry's main regulator, is linked to the ministry. 
""The company is very important for Brazil, for the economy of many states in Brazil, and we consider them to have an important role in our development,"" Albuquerque said on the sidelines of the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada mining conference in Toronto.
On Friday, Brazilian prosecutors alleged that Vale fired an inspection firm months before the disaster because it refused to certify one of its dams as safe. Albuquerque acknowledged the severity of the allegations. 
""If the certification by any means, was adulterated, then they can be accused of collusion, or obstruction,"" said Albuquerque, a former admiral in Brazil's navy who was appointed earlier this year.
Still, Albuquerque's praise of Vale, despite a storm of criticism over what many called a preventable disaster, indicates how the company's clout as one of Brazil's top exporters may prompt some politicians to oppose tougher regulations.
""I think they will learn the lessons and they will succeed in overcoming this situation,"" Albuquerque said.
Brazil has banned the type of tailings dam used at the Brumadinho facility, and Vale's chief executive officer temporarily stepped down last week. The disaster has prompted hand-wringing throughout the global mining industry, with rival CEOs vowing to set stricter standards for tailings dams.
Still, the world is hungry for Vale's iron ore, a point of pride across Latin America's largest economy, especially in the pro-development administration of new President Jair Bolsonaro. Vale has more than 100,000 employees in Brazil. 
Albuquerque said his ministry has started an inspection of every tailings dam in Brazil and should finish by year end. The ministry expects to finalize changes to the tailings dam certification process by June, he said. 
Brazil's federal government and Vale have always had ""good communication,"" which should continue under the company's new leadership, Albuquerque said. It was not yet clear if Vale's new management will be made permanent.
Shares of Vale trading in New York rose 1.9 percent on Tuesday to $12.66.

32,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 05:00PM ET</span>",China's Worst Banking Stock Last Year Is the Best Performer This Year,"(Bloomberg) -- Ping An Bank Co., China’s worst banking stock last year, is now the best performer as investors bet that the lender’s strength in retail banking will shelter it from the nation’s economic slowdown.
Shares of Ping An Bank rose 39 percent in 2019, the biggest gain on the CSI 300 Banks Index, erasing last year’s 29 percent loss. The rally stoked demand for its 26 billion yuan ($3.9 billion) convertible bond sale, which received orders for nearly 1,400 times the amount on offer. Analysts say the bull run may yet continue.
While Chinese banks are benefiting across the board from policy makers’ pledge for capital and regulatory support, Ping An Bank and China Merchants Bank Co. are being particularly rewarded for their focus on retail banking. The Shenzhen-based lenders dominate the sector, where competition is less fierce and returns higher than those in corporate lending.
“Investors are willing to pay a premium to retail banking especially in the economic downturn because it’s less cyclical than wholesale banking,” said Liao Chenkai, a Shanghai-based analyst at Capital Securities Ltd. “Ping An and China Merchants Bank have a lot in common. But the latter trades at a much higher premium, which I believe reflects its fair value, so that means Ping An shares can go up more.”
China Merchants Bank, known as the nation’s king of retail-banking, traded at 1.6 times its forecast price to book, compared with about 1 for Ping An Bank and the banking gauge’s average level of 0.8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tianfeng Securities Co. estimates that return on risk-weighted assets for China Merchants Bank’s retail operation was 3.7 percent, compared with 2.6 percent for the overall business.
Ping An Bank began transitioning from corporate to consumer banking in late 2016, years later than China Merchants Bank, when retail contributed just 41 percent of its profit. The share rose to 68 percent by September 2018, and Ping An Bank’s bad-loan ratio of its retail operations stood at 1.05 percent, lower than the 2.49 percent for corporate lending. Yet, Ping An Bank’s return on equity, a key measure of profitability, is 11 percent, below the sector’s average of 13.3 percent, as it continues the transition.
“By providing earnings stability and being less capital consuming, retail banking is the bright spot,” Tianfeng analysts led by Liao Zhiming wrote in a recent note.

Speculation has circled that JetBlue, the sixth-largest U.S. airline, could announce a transatlantic launch at an April 10 event with employees. 
Speaking at a J.P. Morgan conference in New York, St. George said the success of its Mint premium class product has ""emboldened"" the company about its ability to capture premium revenue but it was aware of different cost structures for international flying. 

Under consideration is whether the Airbus A321 aircraft will offer better returns flying to Europe or domestically, and whether JetBlue could gain access to London's Heathrow airport, St. George said.

35,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 04:30PM ET</span>",One Investor Makes $211 Million EM Bet in ETF's Top 2019 Trade,"(Bloomberg) -- One investor just placed a huge bet on emerging markets at a time when some of the largest banks are signaling threats to this year’s rally.
A trade of about $211 million, or 5 million shares, of the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF was recorded at 11:45 a.m. in New York on Tuesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the largest trade for the exchange-traded fund in 2019, and another $51 million of shares crossed the tape just hours later. The ETF climbed for a third day.
The purchase comes amid bank warnings that a China growth slowdown, a stronger dollar and uncertain trade talks could upend the best start to a year for emerging-market equities since 2012. One of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management’s biggest mutual funds reduced its stock exposure last month, while  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). advised clients to be selective. UBS Wealth Management said it took profits on some of its developing-world wagers in late January.
“I guess someone is buying the dip,” said Whitney Baker, the founder of New York-based Totem Macro, which advises funds holding more than $3 trillion in assets. “Our conviction in the broad theme of EM outperformance at the end of the developed-market cycle hasn’t changed.”
Other investors seem convinced. BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:EEM) also saw two large trades on Tuesday worth about $150 million in total, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Money could be coming into emerging markets and other global assets from short-dated U.S. bond funds, according to Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs at WallachBeth Capital. More than $344 million worth of shares in a Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ETF traded at 10:27 a.m. in New York, while another $210 million of the PIMCO Enhanced Short Maturity Active ETF traded shortly after.
“Because of the prints being back-to-back in correlated instruments, it looks like one investor may be moving money out of cash-parking investments like bond funds and into international ETFs,” Bajaj said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.05%. The S&P 500 lost 0.11%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.02%.
General Electric (NYSE:GE) tumbled as much as 7.7% before late buying trimmed the loss to 4.7%. The fall came after CEO Larry Culp said Tuesday free cash flow from the company's industrial segment is likely to remain negative this year amid ongoing struggles in its power business.
General Electric's pullback weighed on industrials, keeping a lid on gains in the broader market amid a rally in retailers thanks to above-consensus results from  Target  and Kohl's.
Target (NYSE:TGT) reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.53 a share, handily beating estimates from Investing.com for earnings of $1.52 a share. But revenue for the quarter missed estimates.
Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) posted mixed fourth-quarter results as earnings beat on the bottom line, but missed on top line as strength in children's and men's apparel were offset by women's classics and juniors.
The SPDR S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT) ETF ended the day 0.8% higher.
Communication services stocks, meanwhile, were also in favor, led by gains in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which together make up about 49% of the sector's market cap, following an upbeat Wall Street note.
""Both Alphabet and Facebook have growth drivers that could result in better performance in 2019 compared to 2018, including opportunities to increase online ad revenue,"" said CFRA, an independent research provider.
On the economic front, upbeat economic data showing a rebound in U.S. services and housing activity allayed some fears of a slowdown in the U.S. economy, supporting sentiment on stocks.
But global growth fears remained front and center after China said it would target growth in 2019 of 6.0% to 6.5%, down from the 6.6% gross domestic product growth reported last year, owing to the U.S. trade war, a slowing global economy and plans to reduce debt.
Falling energy stocks also played a role in the directionless trading day on Wall Street after oil prices settled roughly flat as investor attention shifted to a petroleum inventory report from the Energy Information Administration due at 10:30 a.m. ET (15:30 GMT) Wednesday.
In other corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 3.1% adding to a 3.2% loss on Monday and a 7.8% loss on Friday, despite the company confirming it had reached a resolution with Chinese customs, after authorities had delayed shipments of the company’s Model 3 sedans into the country, citing misprinted vehicles labels.

39,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 04:00PM ET</span>",Even Talk of a Rate Cut in Turkey Would Be Too Much for Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s central bank will have to choose its words carefully as it charts its course back toward interest-rate cuts.
With annual inflation just below 20 percent and the lira under pressure again, a reduction is unlikely to be on the table when the Monetary Policy Committee gathers on Wednesday for the last meeting before local elections. Instead, the market is focused on two hawkish sentences that have remained unchanged in the statements that accompanied the past couple of decisions to hold rates.
“Any change in these sentences could make the market nervous,” said Yarkin Cebeci, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)., who expects the rhetoric to stay the same. “We believe any reference to easing could hurt credibility.”
The unease has played out in the market, with investors anticipating the Turkish currency will remain among the world’s most unstable. The gauge of expected price swings over a one-month period as implied by options extended a surge to more 300 basis points on Monday, before trimming its advance a day later. The cost of insuring against a default by Turkey’s government on its debt for five years climbed to more than 313 basis points on Tuesday.
No longer hounded by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who’s previously insisted that high borrowing costs cause inflation, the central bank has zeroed in on price stability, increasing rates by 625 basis points last September to halt a plunge in the currency. Facing bellwether municipal elections in less than four weeks, the government has resorted to battling price pressures directly, cracking down on hoarding and selling discounted food.
After the March 31 vote, Turkey isn’t scheduled to hold another ballot for the next four years.
Economists now predict the central bank won’t resume rate cuts before the next quarter and will deliver 4.75 percentage points of monetary easing by the end of the year. The benchmark rate will be kept at 24 percent for a fourth straight meeting on Wednesday, according to all 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Governor Murat Cetinkaya is waiting for what he’s called a “convincing” deceleration in price growth before resuming monetary easing. Headline inflation in February slowed to an annual 19.7 percent from 20.4 percent in the previous month.
Before last month’s decision to lower the amount of cash lenders are required to hold in reserves, Cetinkaya said any steps to free up liquidity wouldn’t necessarily mark a shift in monetary policy.
The question is how long Erdogan will give the central bank free rein.
The economy is sinking into its first recession in a decade as Turkish companies endure higher borrowing costs and loan growth remains sluggish. The lira is another concern. It’s depreciated against the dollar for four straight weeks, losing about 3 percent in one of the worst performances in emerging markets.
Policy makers should wait at least until June to start a “gradual easing cycle,” according to economists at Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS.
“High levels of trend inflation and sticky inflation expectations should still be the main concern for Turkey’s central bank,” analysts led by Adem Ileri said in an emailed report.

40,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 02:47PM ET</span>",Wall Street treads water as key market level eyed,"By Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - Wall Street's main stock indexes moved in and out of positive territory on Tuesday as investors digested positive retailer earnings and economic data and eyed a key level for the benchmark S&P 500 index.
Concerns over U.S.-China trade relations also hovered over the market, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said President Donald Trump would reject a trade deal that was not perfect, but the United States would still keep working on an agreement.
Optimism over a U.S.-China trade deal and over the Federal Reserve being less aggressive in raising interest rates has helped boost the S&P 500 by 11 percent this year, but the index has struggled to move above 2,800.
“When you are here at that important level in the S&P 500, it’s healthier to see the market slow down, pause, take account of the micro and the macro and absorb the good news,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
“To see the market pause right now, as opposed to a deep sell off, is encouraging,” Krosby said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 19.77 points, or 0.08 percent, to 25,839.42, the S&P 500 lost 0.47 points, or 0.02 percent, to 2,792.34 and the Nasdaq Composite added 11.28 points, or 0.15 percent, to 7,588.84.
Communication services led gains among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, while energy lagged.
The consumer discretionary sector rose 0.5 percent, led by a 7.8 percent gain in Kohl's and 5.3 percent gain for  Target  (NYSE:TGT) following those retailers' respective earnings reports.
Target forecast 2019 profit above Wall Street estimates as investments to draw more shoppers online and in stores drove a jump in holiday sales, while Kohl's forecast full-year profit above Wall Street estimates.
In other corporate news,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) shares dropped 5.3 percent as the conglomerate forecast an outright fall in free cash flow from its industrial business this year on the back of continuing weakness in its power unit.
In economic news, sales of new U.S. single-family homes rose to a seven-month high in December, but November's outsized jump was revised lower, pointing to continued weakness in the housing market. Other data showed a rebound in growth in the vast services sector in February amid a surge in new orders.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 33 new highs and 30 new lows.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - German carmaker BMW, which is building its first plant in Mexico, is looking for clear signs from the new government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador that would guarantee stability to invest in the country, a top executive said.
To plan its future the company needs ""robust premises in terms of how the government is making decisions, what are its priorities, its international stance, how the budget is handled,"" Alexander Wehr, president and CEO of BMW Group Mexico, Latin America and the Caribbean, told Reuters in an interview on Friday.
Wehr said that BMW was keeping a close watch on Mexico's sovereign rating and domestic sales of cars.
Ratings agency S&P last week put Mexico's sovereign debt on a negative outlook and said there was a one-in-three chance of a sovereign downgrade in the coming year, although not yet to junk.
Moody's Investors Service said in a report on Tuesday that intensifying violence and crime in Mexico raised concerns about security-related credit risks for companies and economic risks for states and municipalities.
Lopez Obrador came to power on a platform vowing to fight entrenched corruption, crime, inequality and poverty, which are major scourges that he says cost the Mexican treasury billions of dollars every year.
He acknowledges the nation's need for healthy private investment as well as public spending. 
But some of his early moves, such as canceling a partially built Mexico City airport and attempts to undermine the autonomy of regulatory bodies, have spooked investors.

BMW's plant in San Luis Potosi will start operations in mid-2019 and will have a production capacity of up to 175,000 units per year. It will only produce the Series 3 model and not the other brands in the group, such as Mini, Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) and Motorrad.

42,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 02:41PM ET</span>",JPMorgan backs away from private prison finance,"By David Henry and Imani Moise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) has decided to stop financing private operators of prisons and detention centers, which have become targets of protests over Trump administration immigration policies.
""We will no longer bank the private prison industry,"" a company spokesman told Reuters. The decision is a result of the bank's ongoing evaluations of the costs and benefits of serving different industries, he said.
JPMorgan is one of several banks that have underwritten bonds or syndicated loans for CoreCivic Inc and GEO Group Inc, the two major private prison operators in the United States. In 2018, banks, including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, raised roughly $1.8 billion in debt over three deals for CoreCivic and GEO Group, according to Refinitiv data.
Wells Fargo said in January it was reducing its relationship with the prison industry as part of its ""environmental and social risk management"" process.
""Our credit exposure to private prison companies has significantly decreased and is expected to continue to decline, and we are not actively marketing to that sector,"" Wells Fargo said in its ""Business Standards Report"" for 2018. 
Prison finance is a small business for JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the United States by assets. JPMorgan was a leader in 1,153 loan deals worth $354 billion across all industries, according to Refinitiv data.
Prison companies account for about 10 percent of federal and state prison beds, according to Moody's Investors Service. But about two-thirds of people held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement are in private detention centers, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings estimated last year.
Moody's and S&P Global have speculative grade, or junk, credit ratings on CoreCivic and GEO Group partly because their revenues are at risk to changes in government policy and public scrutiny of companies profiting from detention. (https://reut.rs/2H4JOf5)
After the Obama administration in August 2016 directed the Bureau of Prisons to phase out federal use of private prisons, shares of both companies plunged more than 40 percent. One month after Donald Trump became president, the order was rescinded and the stocks rebounded.
Activism against the financing of private prisons heated up after revelations that undocumented minors were being separated from their adult parents.
TRUMP REVERSES POLICY
The Trump administration reversed its separation policy after a public outcry.
CoreCivic spokesman Steven Owen called JPMorgan's decision ""disappointing."" He said in an email that ""decisions like this are being based on false information spread by politically motivated special interests, who completely mischaracterize our company.""
None of CoreCivic's immigration facilities house children who are not under the supervision of a parent, Owen said.
A GEO Group spokesman said in an email that the company ""has never managed facilities that house unaccompanied minors."" He added, ""We welcome the opportunity to have an open dialogue with all financial institutions to address the common mischaracterizations of our company’s role and record as a government services provider.""
CoreCivic changed its name from Corrections Corporation of America in October 2016. It said the rebranding was to highlight its strategy to transform its business ""from largely corrections and detentions centers to a wider range of government services.""
In 2018 prisons and detention centers still accounted for 87 percent of CoreCivic's net operating income, according to a recent presentation from the company to investors. It had 72,833 beds in prisons and detention centers.
JPMorgan's move away from the industry comes after activists have challenged Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon at the bank's last two annual meetings over its financing of prison companies.
Protest groups have also appeared regularly outside of Dimon's Manhattan apartment. On Valentine's Day, a group appeared with a mariachi band and signs that begged the executive to ""break up with prisons.""
At the May 2017 annual meeting, Dimon promised to look in to prison finance. In June, Dimon and the Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs that he chairs, issued public statements calling for immigration reform and an end to the Trump administration policy of separating minors from their parents.
JPMorgan’s move could prove mostly symbolic if other lenders or investors in prison companies do not take similar steps. Activists learned that lesson last year after they pressured financiers of gunmakers in the wake of a shooting at a Florida high school. 

Bank of America Corp,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world’s largest asset manager, last year said they were limiting business with gunmakers in various ways. But others, including Wells Fargo, declined to follow suit and filings show firearms companies retain access to a wide range of financing options. (https://reut.rs/2Evd3nn)

43,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 02:35PM ET</span>",Jeans maker Diesel USA files for bankruptcy,"(Reuters) - Diesel USA Inc, the denim and accessory brand known for its jeans, filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday, blaming mounting losses, a sales plunge, expensive leases and cyber fraud.
The New York-based unit of Italy's Diesel SpA filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Delaware. Its parent is not part of the filing.
Diesel USA said it has been the sole distributor of Diesel products in the United States since its 1995 launch.
But it said it has not been spared in the recent downturn in the retail sector, having lost money for six straight years as annual sales plunged 53 percent, to $104 million. Theft and cyber fraud cost $1.2 million over three years, it added.
In a court filing, Chief Restructuring Officer Mark Samson said Diesel USA has no plans to close, but intends to exit some of its 28 stores, where landlords' refusal to offer lease concessions has led to heavy losses.
He said the company's three-year business plan contemplates focusing on more profitable stores, improving its product lines and working with social media ""influencers"" to attract Millennials, ""Generation Z"" and other new customers.
A successful reorganization would enable Diesel USA to operate as an ""iconic and profitable brand,"" Samson said.
Many other retailers have gone bankrupt in recent years as more consumers shop online.
Recent victims have included shoe chain Payless Inc, which said last month it will close its roughly 2,500 stores.
The Diesel USA bankruptcy followed a Feb. 13 announcement by Levi Strauss & Co, which invented blue jeans in 1873, that it plans to return to the U.S. stock market after a 34-year hiatus, through an initial public offering.
Diesel USA said it has $50 million to $100 million of assets, and $10 million to $50 million of liabilities.

The case is In re Diesel USA Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 19-10432.

BENGALURU/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said on Tuesday that China's customs authorities have accepted the electric carmaker's plan to resolve problems with the clearance of its Model 3 sedans that centered around misprinting of labels.
Shares in Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk's company fell more than 5 percent in early trading after Chinese media reported Shanghai customs had suspended clearance for a batch of Tesla's cars. They were last down 1.3 percent at $281.73. 
""We have already reached a resolution with Chinese customs, and we are working closely with them to resume clearance procedures on these vehicles,"" a Tesla spokesperson said in a statement. 
""Sales of Model 3 in the country are not impacted, and we continue to deliver Model 3 vehicles that have already been processed."" 
Making inroads into China, the world's largest electric vehicle market, is crucial for the Tesla as it seeks to offset softening demand in the United States and convince investors of its ability to become consistently profitable.
""Selling into China has clear hurdles and this is a reminder of the pitfalls when betting on growth in the region,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said. 
Musk has played up the support Tesla is getting from Chinese authorities as the company invests in the country's first wholly foreign-owned car plant in Shanghai, due to come online later this year.
Until then, Tesla has to import U.S.-made cars with substantial customs duties, putting it at a disadvantage against locally-made, government-subsidized electric vehicles from rivals such as Nio Inc, Byton and XPeng Motors.
Financial publication Caixin had first reported about China's customs authorities blocking the cars. 
A total of 1,171 Model 3 sedans arrived at north China's Tianjin Port, after 84 such cars were imported via the port in February, China's state news agency Xinhua reported http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-03/05/c_137871117.htm on Tuesday.
The first shipment of Model 3 cars arrived in Shanghai on Feb. 22, and deliveries started at the end of the month, according to media http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1140712.shtml reports. 
Tesla's Shanghai factory, made possible by raising funds from local banks at low interest rates, plans to start making Model 3s at the end of this year and eventually produce cars at a rate of 10,000 per week. 
Tesla has cut prices in China several times in the last few months to make its cars ""more affordable"" and revive sales hit by Sino-U.S. trade tensions.

To cut costs and support its drive to generate profit, Tesla last week launched a $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan and said its global sales would now be online-only.

51,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 02:09PM ET</span>","Chevron, Exxon take turns wooing investors with shale boasts","By Jennifer Hiller and John Benny
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The two biggest U.S. oil companies tried to outdo each other on Tuesday, boasting about their prowess in shale to lure investors to their side.
 Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) released dueling Permian Basin projections that, if realized, would cement the rivals as the dominant players in the West Texas and New Mexico field, with one-third of Permian production potentially under their control within five years.
Chevron expects shale production from the basin to reach 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) by the end of next year, 59 percent above current production, and 900,000 bpd by the end of 2023, it said at its annual meeting with equity analysts in New York.
The stakes are such that Exxon on Tuesday forecast shale production of 1 million barrels per day in the Permian as early as 2024, grabbing the spotlight on the day Chevron was making a case in its oil growth. 
""Our investors don't need to wait several years for the story to come together,"" Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an apparent dig at Exxon, which has been investing heavily in the Permian to reverse production declines. ""We’re delivering now.""
The Permian Basin pumps around 4 million barrels per day now and IHS Markit expects it to hit 5.4 mbd in 2023, more than the total production of any OPEC country other than Saudi Arabia.
Wirth said at a press conference that he had been ""busy"" and had not seen Exxon's Permian goal, which was released while he was speaking to analysts. He said, however, that Chevron's production could exceed 900,000 barrels daily if the company decided to increase drilling rigs from the 20 currently in operation. 
""It’s a decision we haven’t taken yet but we certainly have it under active consideration,"" Wirth said. ""It’s a good story that could get even better.""
Oil companies are trying to win back investors after years of underperforming other industrial sectors and the S&P 500. The weighting of energy shares in the S&P 500 index fell to 6 percent in 2018, from 8.4 percent four years earlier. 
Like Exxon, Chevron has begun to emphasize achieving faster payoffs from investments in shale rather than the megaprojects of the past. 
""The key driver of cash flow growth over the medium term remains the Permian, which continues to perform ahead of expectations,"" said Biraj Borkhataria of RBC Europe Limited. 
Chevron said it expects global production to rise 3 percent to 4 percent annually through 2023.
Executives said the company would return more cash to investors this year through dividends and $4 billion in share buybacks aiming to achieve a 6 percent shareholder return.
The company also raised its estimate of its reserves in the Permian, in Texas and New Mexico, to 16.2 billion barrels of recoverable resources from 9 billion.
The San Ramon, California-based company expects to sell assets worth $5 billion to $10 billion https:// between 2018 and 2020, including production assets in Denmark, Azerbaijan and Britain's North Sea. 
The company's annual capital expenditure is expected to be in the range of $19 billion to $22 billion between 2021 and 2023.
Chevron expects to spend $3.6 billion in the Permian Basin and another $1.6 billion in other shale fields. Chevron’s other shale holdings include the Marcellus in the Northeastern U.S., the Duvernay in Alberta, Canada and the Vaca Muerta in Argentina.
Wirth also touched on Venezuela, where Chevron, the largest U.S. oil company still in operation there, is under pressure from U.S. sanctions. He said Chevron's employees are safe and its operations are ""in good shape,"" and that it has taken ""the long view"" on the country. Wirth said he continues to talk with U.S. government officials.

""We’re trying to be sure that we understand the policy objectives of the government and the government understands the ramifications of policy actions they might take,"" Wirth said.

54,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 02:03PM ET</span>",Retail stocks set to bypass tariff woes but face aftershock risk,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. retail and consumer goods companies appear set to emerge largely unscathed from the trade dispute between the United States and China.
But the conflict could leave behind negative effects on the supply chains of some companies in the industry, which could narrow their profit margins and eventually weigh on their stock prices.
The current U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports were scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent if a trade deal were not reached by March 1. Last week U.S. President Donald Trump announced an extension of that deadline, and the United States and China have reportedly moved close to a deal that would roll back the tariffs altogether.
Only certain categories of consumer goods, such as furniture and accessories like handbags and luggage, are subject to the 10 percent tariffs. Apparel and footwear, for now, are excluded.
So far this year, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index, which includes shares of retail and consumer goods companies as well as restaurants and leisure companies, has reflected optimism on trade as data have pointed to the overall strength of the U.S. economy. The index has risen 11.2 percent, slightly ahead of the 10.6 percent rise for the S&P 500 as a whole.
""Companies continue to do well from a (consumer) discretionary perspective,"" said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors in New York. ""Once President Trump said he was extending the deadline for the tariff jump, the overhang over the market was lifted.""
A significant portion of U.S. consumer goods, including 72 percent of footwear and 84 percent of accessories, originate from China, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association.
Yet companies have made preparations to blunt the effects of current and possible future tariffs. In conference calls, companies including footwear maker Steven Madden Ltd, furniture retailer RH and Rubbermaid housewares maker Newell Brands have said they have offset cost increases by moving some manufacturing to other countries or negotiating discounts for their production in China.
""Companies have been incorporating tariffs in their guidance for a year,"" said Charles East, equity strategy analyst at SunTrust Private Wealth Management, who covers retailers. ""It's a known quantity.""
Yet even with a rollback of tariffs, lingering effects on the production, shipment and storage of goods could eventually weigh on consumer stocks.
Retailers have ramped up shipments of imported items in anticipation of potential increases in U.S. tariffs. According to the National Retail Federation, major U.S. ports handled 1.97 million containers in December, a 13.9 percent year-over-year increase. For the first half of 2019, U.S. ports are forecast to handle 10.7 million containers, a 4.1 percent increase from the first half of 2018. 
The advance shipments could lead to an uptick in warehousing costs, cutting into companies' profit margins, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation in Washington.
If retail sales were to soften, retailers could be stuck with excess inventory. Data from the U.S. Commerce Department for December showed retail sales posting their biggest drop in more than nine years and warehouse inventories increasing by the most in more than five years.
Department stores such as Macy's Inc have already been grappling with inventory issues, said Simeon Siegel, senior equity analyst at Nomura Instinet in New York. Macy's shares plunged 17.7 percent on Jan. 10 when the retailer cut its fiscal 2018 forecast and have not recovered those losses despite rising last week after the company announced a restructuring.
In its earnings conference call last Wednesday, TJX Companies Inc (NYSE:TJX) hinted at the potential for an uptick in discounted goods, saying that disruptions resulting from changes in shipments and production could lead to opportunities for the company.
The shift in production away from China could also lead to price increases as demand grows for factories in countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, said Rick Helfenbein, president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association in Washington. In December, Calvin Klein parent company PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH) warned of such an adverse impact during an earnings conference call.
""When you get that bump, factories will raise the prices,"" Helfenbein said. ""It's going to happen throughout the supply chain.""
Likewise, shoe company Crocs Inc stated in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Thursday that ""it may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes."" 
Such risks could catch equity investors off guard, market watchers said, given the sanguine outlook on trade.

""They've priced in a trade deal,"" said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York. ""All the risks are to the downside now.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) said on Tuesday that it is relaxing the dress code for all its employees, a move once considered unimaginable for the Wall Street firm's leagues of monk-shoed partners and bankers in bespoke suits. 
The new ""firm wide flexible dress code"" was announced in an internal memo, which said the shift was due to ""the changing nature of workplaces generally in favor of a more casual environment.""
The memo sent to the bank's some 36,000 employees was penned by Chief Executive Officer David Solomon, a former investment banker who took the role in October, along with Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr and Chief Operating Officer John Waldron. 
Historically known as a white-shoe investment bank, Goldman Sachs traditionally required formal business attire. But since 2017, the bank began relaxing its dress code for employees in the technology division and other new digital businesses. This created a divide in the workforce as clear as denim versus pinstripes.
Like other Wall Street banks, Goldman has been competing to secure the best employees. Large technology firms and hedge funds often have more relaxed offices and perks.
Tuesday's announcement was also meant to bring the bank's traditional policies up to date for its younger workforce. More than 75 percent of Goldman employees are members of the Millennial or Gen Z generations--people born after 1981.
The memo did not specify which clothes are or are not appropriate.
""All of us know what is and is not appropriate for the workplace,"" the memo reads. 

The memo also reminded employees to dress ""in a manner that is consistent"" with clients' expectations. ""Of course, casual dress is not appropriate every day and for every interaction and we trust you will consistently exercise good judgment in this regard.""

In the four weeks ended Feb. 23, sales fell 15%, adding to the 9% decline over the last 12 months, Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink said, citing Nielsen data.
Shares of Revlon (NYSE:REV) fell nearly 20% and are now down more than 15% on the year. However, sharp moves on material updates are not uncommon as the stock is illiquid, with only about 5% to 10% in the public float.
The update comes just months after the company's third-quarter results beat estimates from Investing.com. But the results did flag a decline in sales of the Revlon brand, which makes up about half of total revenues, owing to lower net sales of Revlon color cosmetics.
The company also launched an optimization program to streamline operations and cut annual costs cost by about $125 million to $150 million.
Following the downturn, rumors swirled that longtime and majority Revlon shareholder Ron Perelman may be tempted to scoop up additional shares with a view to taking Revlon private.
But some said this was unlikely, as Perelman has previously expressed support for the company's turnaround program and pledged to cap his stake in the company at 90%. He owns about 80% of Revlon.
The weakness in Revlon sparked a downturn in other rivals as ELF Beauty (NYSE:ELF) and Coty (NYSE:COTY) turned negative.
Revlon is expected to release its fourth-quarter report on March 21."

(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is planning to replace one-third of its mainline fleet in the next five years and looks to grow internationally but has yet to decide whether or not to invest in struggling Italian carrier Alitalia, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on Tuesday.
Delta's decision on its fleet replacements, which it said would not change its capex guidance, will pit U.S. manufacturer Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co against its European rival Airbus SE.
Further out, Delta also needs to replace almost 200 Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft, a category that  Boeing Co  is targeting with a potential new midsize plane, known as the NMA.
Speaking at a J.P. Morgan conference, Bastian said Delta is ""very interested"" in the NMA and was in preliminary discussions with Boeing on it.
Boeing is weighing whether or not to launch the new program next year.
""Hopefully they'll decide to go,"" Bastian said.
Airbus is also targeting that category with a spruced up version of its A321. 
Delta shares were up 1.4 percent at $49.48 in midday trading.
ALITALIA INVESTMENT?
Bastian said it was too early to decide whether or not to invest in Alitalia and said that the numbers being thrown around so far are ""pretty large"" and ""not the kind of numbers that we're considering, just to quell any concerns.""
Italy's state-controlled railway Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) said last month it would start negotiations with Delta and easyJet (LON:EZJ) to draft a rescue plan for the struggling airline. 
Alitalia was put under special administration in 2017 after workers rejected the latest in a long line of rescue plans, leaving the government once again seeking a buyer to save the airline. It will be the third rescue in a decade.
EasyJet confirmed last month that it was in discussions with FS and Delta about forming a consortium to explore options for the future of Alitalia, but added that there was ""no certainty at this stage that any transaction will proceed."" Delta has submitted a ""general and non-binding letter of interest"" to Ferrovie dello Stato.
Bastian said the Italian market is important for U.S. consumers and a great travel destination, so it makes sense to consider an investment there. 
Delta's global growth over time will skew toward international rather than domestic markets, which are more congested, he said. That growth could come through direct investments in overseas carriers.

""You can't actually own partner carriers so you have to find ways to influence them beyond just a commercial contract as a partner, and what we have found is that by making an investment into these businesses we can get actually inside the board room and help to start shape the strategy.""

Supplies of fuel in the southern African nation have been intermittent since September, which has seen motorists spending hours in queues at service stations.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa in January announced a 150 percent hike in the price of fuel, sparking violent protests in major towns, which were met by a brutal security crackdown. 
""Cabinet has given a green light to large companies such as those in the mining sector, transport sector, commerce to use their funds to import fuel for their use,"" Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa told reporters after a weekly cabinet meeting.
The world's top two platinum producers  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Platinum and Impala Platinum Holdings are some of the big mining companies operating in Zimbabwe, which will be able to buy their own fuel.
Zimbabwe's central bank provides between $80 and $100 million a month in scarce dollars to fuel companies to import the commodity. By allowing companies to buy their own fuel, the government expects to ease pressure on demand for dollars.
Long queues that resurfaced last week after a brief lull continued on Tuesday and Mutsvangwa said the government had been forced to take 8 million liters of diesel from the country's strategic reserve to supply the market.

Despite previous promises by the central bank and energy minister to end the fuel shortages, Zimbabwean motorists have got used to queuing for hours for the scarce resource.

French authorities are looking into whether French cement maker Lafarge, which was taken over by Swiss rival  Holcim  (SIX:LHN) in 2015, paid the Islamic State in 2013 and 2014 to keep its factories running in areas held by the terrorist group.
Prosecutors opened an investigation into suspected funding of terrorism in June 2017. They are looking into payments possibly made by Lafarge through intermediaries to armed groups, including Islamic State, and into possible purchases of raw materials from intermediaries related to these groups.
Eight former Lafarge executives were put ""under formal investigation"" for suspected terrorism financing, including Olsen and Bruno Lafont, who was Lafarge's CEO at the time.
The investigating magistrates decided to exclude Olsen from the process as they considered that he wasn't involved in the alleged acts that may constitute terrorism financing, Olsen's lawyer Pierre Cornut-Gentille said on Tuesday.
""This decision saves my honor and will allow me to resume with my career after fighting for several months to contribute to establishing the truth,"" Olsen said in a statement.

The case prompted Olsen, the first CEO after the merger, to step down and it remains a headache for LafargeHolcim, which has struggled to make the merger work and is cutting costs under the leadership of a new chief executive.

A production line making Qashqai sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and Leaf electric cars may have its number of daily shifts reduced to two from three, Sky said, adding that Nissan described this as ""rumour or speculation"".
Earlier on Tuesday, Germany's BMW said it could move some production of engines and its Mini model out of Britain if the country does not secure an orderly departure from the European Union.

Nissan recently canceled plans to build a new version of its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland.

MADRID/LONDON/ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Private equity firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) is ahead of other contenders to buy a 30 percent stake in Spain's Cepsa for up to 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion), just four months after owner Mubadala shelved a listing of the energy company, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Carlyle, whose energy and natural resources division includes funds such as Neptune Energy, could reach an agreement within weeks, one of the sources said.
Cepsa and Carlyle declined to comment.
Other investment firms including CVC, Apollo and Macquarie had expressed interest in buying a stake in the Spanish oil major, which is owned by Abu Dhabi wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company, sources previously told Reuters.
However, Carlyle has emerged as the favorite bidder in the process which is led by Rothschild, the sources said, although no deal has been finalised or agreed.
In October, Mubadala backed out of a plan to list 25 percent of Cepsa on the Madrid stock exchange citing uncertainty in international capital markets and lackluster appetite among international investors.
Cepsa reported a 15 percent fall in annual adjusted net (CCS) profit to 754 million euros last year. 
Political uncertainty in Europe, U.S. political tensions and a global economic slowdown, topped off by the U.S.-China trade war and sanctions against Iran and Russia, deterred a series of initial public offerings (IPO) in the past few months.
Proceeds from global IPOs fell by 83 percent to $2.6 billion in January compared with the same month last year, Refinitiv data shows, while proceeds from European listings dropped 97 percent in the first two months of the year.
In the energy sector, Saudi Aramco was among the most high-profile listings that were halted in 2018.
At the smaller end of the scale, oil trader Vitol pulled its IPO of Varo Energy and sources said Kazakhstan has deferred the IPO of national oil firm KazMunayGaz to beyond 2019.
Conversely, a recovery in the oil price to its current level of around $65 a barrel, from $30 in 2016, coupled with attractive asset valuations, has driven a surge in M&A activity by private equity firms in the energy sector.
In 2013 Carlyle launched a $2.5 billion euro energy fund - Carlyle International Energy Partners (CIEP) - and has since then made a number of high profile acquisitions.
In 2017, it teamed up with CVC to buy the oil and gas assets of French utility Engie.
Carlyle's Neptune Energy fund is currently bidding for the oil and gas assets being sold by EDF's Italian unit Edison, according to sources.

68,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 11:03AM ET</span>",Ousted Nissan boss Ghosn to leave prison after court rejects prosecutors' appeal,"By Naomi Tajitsu and Maki Shiraki
TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese court on Tuesday rejected a last-minute attempt by prosecutors to keep former Nissan Motor Chairman Carlos Ghosn in prison, ruling that the once-feted executive could be released on $8.9 million bail after more than 100 days in detention.
The Tokyo District Court, which had earlier granted Ghosn bail, said it had rejected an appeal by prosecutors who had sought to keep him in prison, pending his trial for financial misconduct.
The decision paves the way for Ghosn's release as early as Wednesday and marks a victory for his new legal team, brought in last month and spearheaded by a lawyer known as ""the Razor"" for his success in several high-profile cases.
On what was Ghosn's third bail request, the court accepted defense lawyers' assurances that he would submit to extensive surveillance.
The release would allow Ghosn - the architect of Nissan's automaking partnership with France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) and one of the industry's most celebrated executives - to meet his lawyers frequently and build a defense ahead of his trial.
Ghosn faces charges of aggravated breach of trust and under-reporting his compensation to the tune of $82 million at Nissan for nearly a decade.
If convicted on all the charges, he faces up to a decade in jail. The ex-chairman of Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors has denied wrongdoing and late on Tuesday reiterated his position.
""I am extremely grateful for my family and friends who have stood by me throughout this terrible ordeal,"" Ghosn said in a statement.
""I am innocent and totally committed to vigorously defending myself in a fair trial against these meritless and unsubstantiated accusations.""
Nissan declined to comment on the bail decision, which comes a day after the head of Ghosn's new legal team said he was optimistic the executive would be released with a promise to submit to surveillance.
The case has cast a harsh light on Japan's criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defense lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.
Public opinion is likely to have played a role in the court's bail decision, said Shin Ushijima, a former prosecutor and lawyer.
""The court was partly influenced by the opinion of the entire world,"" Ushijima said. ""People in general thought (the detention period) is too long. This will change Japan's criminal procedures.""
$9 MLN BAIL
There was a heavy media presence earlier on Tuesday outside the Tokyo detention center where Ghosn is being held, with throngs of reporters setting up ladders to gain a clear view over the tall fence. A helicopter briefly buzzed overhead.
While Ghosn's 1 billion yen ($9 million) bail would rank among the highest in Japan, it is half the amount paid in 2005 by Mitsuru Asada, a businessman who was later convicted of defrauding the government through a beef buyback program.
Ghosn, who turns 65 on Saturday, has spent more than 100 days in a 4.8 square meter (52 sq ft) cell. In his only court appearance, in January, he said he looked forward to his trial to ""finally have the opportunity to defend myself"".
In an interview later with Japan's Nikkei newspaper, Ghosn said that Nissan executives opposed to his plans for closer ties with Renault were behind the allegations against him.
The appointment last month of lawyer Junichiro Hironaka, who earned his nickname for his combative style, was widely seen as a move to adopt a more aggressive legal strategy with Ghosn's defense.
Hironaka has argued that the allegations should have been resolved as an internal company matter and blasted the judicial system for keeping his client in jail.
Ghosn's France-based lawyers on Monday said that they had complained to the United Nations that their client's rights had been violated during his detention in Japan.
Though the granting of bail represents a significant development, Ghosn still faces a criminal justice system in which only three of every 100 defendants who plead not guilty are acquitted.
There is also no plea-bargaining mechanism that would allow Ghosn to agree to lesser charges for a lighter sentence.

LONDON (Reuters) - Brexit talks have made a ""shocking"" lack of progress which will hurt Britain's economy over the coming months, the chief executive of British Airways' owner, IAG (LON:ICAG), said in the company's annual report on Tuesday.
Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29, but Prime Minister Theresa May has not yet secured a deal that Britain's parliament will accept.
IAG chief executive Willie Walsh said this uncertainty was bad for the British economy.
""I think it is inevitable that Brexit will have a greater impact in the months ahead. It has been quite shocking to get so far in the political process without having any real clarity about the future,"" Walsh said in the firm's annual report.
""All the credible forecasts I've seen predict that Brexit will have a negative economic impact in the short to medium term that is likely to damage consumer confidence and act as a further drag on business investment.""
However, IAG judged that even in a no-deal scenario, ""Brexit will have no significant long-term impact on the group.""
IAG Chairman Antonio Vazquez said the firm was confident it would be able to comply with relevant ownership and control rules after Brexit.
IAG, which owns Spanish airlines Iberia and Vueling and Ireland's Aer Lingus in addition to British Airways, has faced questions of how its shareholder structure will comply with EU rules after Brexit.
After Brexit, British shareholders will no longer count toward an EU requirement that airlines must be majority-owned by EU nationals in order to fly between two locations within the bloc.

The EU has proposed a provisional arrangement to mitigate the impact of a no-deal Brexit on airlines, allowing a six-month window to fully meet ownership requirements.

The company said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday it would co-operate with Schnatter to find a mutually acceptable independent director, who would not be affiliated with Schnatter or hedge fund investor Starboard Value LP, which owns a nearly 10 percent stake.
Schnatter, who owns about 30 percent of the company's shares, would resign from the board if the independent director is appointed before the annual stockholder meeting slated in May, Papa John's said.
The deal comes after the founder stepped down as chairman last summer, following reports he had used a racial slur on a media training conference call.
Schnatter has filed several lawsuits against the company in a bid to regain control. In January, he claimed a victory when a court ordered the board to give him some internal documents, including text messages related to his firing, which Papa John's had until then refused to share.
As part of the agreement, Papa John's has agreed to share with Schnatter all of the company's records, giving him the option to sue if those documents revealed wrongdoing by the company, Schnatter said in a statement.
Schnatter, in return, has agreed to dismiss two lawsuits.
""(I am) thankful that I've been able to resolve these important issues, and that we can all focus on the Company’s business without the need for additional litigation,"" Schnatter said.
The company also said it would remove an ""acting in concert"" provision of a ""poison pill"" adopted by the board to thwart previous takeover attempts by Schnatter, suggesting that the founder could engage with bidders that had expressed interest in speaking with him.
Still, the bad press has taken a toll on the pizza chain, which said last week North America same-restaurant sales fell 7.3 percent in 2018 and that sales would lag into the first half of 2019.

Its shares were up about 3 percent in morning trade on Tuesday.

The firm had been publishing recommendations on Canopy Growth and Tilray, and is now also writing research on Cronos Group and Aurora Cannabis.
The four Canadian cannabis producers were listed in the US last year, prompting investors, especially younger ones, to pour money into the industry. On Robinhood, a free-trading app popular among millennials, Aurora has outranked all other stocks in terms of the number of users who own shares.
Also in the last year, a wave of recreational-marijuana legalization — including in Canada and the state of Michigan — has triggered companies in other fields, such as  beverage maker Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) and  tobacco giant Altria (NYSE:MO) to enter the space. Constellation Brands and Altria invested in Canopy and Cronos respectively. 
Driven by the strong demand for insight into marijuana stocks, Cowen's Vivien Azer became the first Wall Street senior analyst to cover the emerging cannabis sector, and leads the marijuana research team at the firm.

GENEVA (Reuters) - BMW could move some production of engines and its Mini model out of Britain if the country does not secure an orderly departure from the European Union, the German carmaker said on Tuesday, in the latest Brexit warning from the auto industry.
Britain, the world's fifth-largest economy, is due to leave the EU on March 29 but an agreement between London and Brussels has been rejected by UK lawmakers leaving open the possibility of a chaotic exit that could hit trade.
One risk of a no-deal Brexit is that British-made engines will no longer be counted as EU content, pushing the total level in some cars below the threshold of around 55 to 60 percent required in many international trade agreements. 
""We have some flexibility on the engine side with Steyr in Austria,"" Peter Schwarzenbauer, the head of BMW's Mini brand, told Reuters at the Geneva car show, referring to another BMW plant. ""We would need to make some adjustments toward Steyr."" 
""We are preparing to be able to do it. Like we are preparing warehouses in the UK to produce cars,"" Schwarzenbauer said.
A final decision on whether to transfer some production of engines from Hams Hall in central England, where BMW built over 375,000 engines last year, to Austria has not yet been taken, Schwarzenbauer added.
Asked by Sky News if BMW could move Mini production out of its Oxford plant in southern England in the event of a chaotic Brexit, Schwarzenbauer said: ""We at least have to consider it.""
Britain's once booming car industry is already recording drops in sales, investment and output, with Japan's Honda delivering the biggest blow so far by announcing plans to close its UK factory.
SHORT DELAY 'EVEN WORSE'
The industry, which employs about 850,000 people and is largely owned by foreign firms, has been rushing out plans to cope with a potential no-deal Brexit, such as building stocks and in some cases organizing plant closures around Brexit day. 
But Prime Minister Theresa May said last week that if UK lawmakers again rejected her Brexit deal, she would offer them a series of votes that could lead her to ask Brussels for a delay. 
BMW said in September it was moving the annual maintenance shutdown for its Oxford Mini plant to April in case of Brexit disruption. The Goodwood plant of its luxury Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) Motor Cars brand in southern England has made similar plans. 
Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes, the CEO of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, told Reuters a short Brexit delay ""would make it even worse ... because then all the prep measurements, in terms of pulling the shutdown forward and so on, would be immediately eroded.""
""If a delay is necessary, then it should at least continue for some time.""
BMW CEO Harald Krueger said earlier that if Brexit was delayed the company could postpone some contingency plans, but that the maintenance shutdown at Oxford remained set for April.
BMW made 234,183 cars in Britain last year, out of the country's total production of about 1.5 million. 
'FUTURE IN DOUBT'
Japanese carmaker Toyota also called for clarity on Brexit. 
""Frankly speaking, we would just like to get certainty as quickly as possible,"" Johan van Zyl, president and CEO of Toyota Europe said at an event late Monday, echoing recent comments from UK luxury sports car maker Aston Martin.
Zyl said Brexit planning had come at a ""huge cost"" and warned Britain needed to secure a frictionless trade deal with the EU.
""If anything happens between the EU and UK that will have a negative impact on competitiveness of the UK operations, it will put the future in doubt,"" he said, referring to the entire UK car industry. 
Toyota made 129,070 cars at its Burnaston plant in central England in 2018 and is currently ramping up production of its new Corolla model.

Carlos Tavares, CEO of Peugeot and Citroen maker PSA Group, was more relaxed about a potential Brexit delay, saying he was in favor if the time was used to find a deal. 
Daimler boss Dieter Zetsche, meanwhile, was hopeful a deal could be reached. 
""It's a game of poker. I am an optimistic person, and I hope that a no-deal Brexit is not realistic,"" he said.

PARIS (Reuters) - French seed maker Vilmorin (PA:VILM), said on Tuesday it was continuing some exports to Iran with the backing of a French bank, and will participate in efforts to implement a European scheme to avoid U.S. sanctions targeting trade with Tehran.
Vilmorin, one of the world's largest suppliers of seeds for grain and vegetable crops, has cited the U.S. sanctions against Iran as among the short-term risks to its activities in emerging markets, along with currency volatility.
Food and agricultural goods are not directly targeted by U.S. sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program, but restrictions on dollar-based transactions have impeded trade.
Vilmorin is working with a banking partner that is not one of the big French lenders to finance deals with Iranian clients able to pay in euros, Chief Financial Officer Vincent Supiot said at a presentation of the company's first-half results.
""We have done a few transactions since the start of the financial year,"" he told reporters.
""We are going to have lower sales (to Iran) than before,"" he said, adding they should amount to ""several million euros"".
He declined to name the bank working with Vilmorin but said it was much smaller than the major French lenders that have U.S. activities and massive dollar flows.
Vilmorin had previously reported annual sales of around 10 million euros ($11.33 million) in Iran.
While this was small compared with group sales of 1.35 billion euros in its 2017/18 year to June 30, disruption of Iranian trade could trim short-term growth prospects and was also a setback given strong seed demand in Iran, the world's fifth-largest vegetable grower, Supiot said.
To maintain exports to Iran, Vilmorin was also exploring the potential for new local customers with access to foreign currency, and the possibility for customers to set up outlets in third countries that would then ship goods on to Iran.
The seed maker is also considering taking part in a proposed European scheme, known as INSTEX, to conduct non-dollar trade with Iran via a barter system that would avert U.S. penalties.
Vilmorin is among some 70 French food, farming and pharmaceutical firms invited to a briefing at the French finance ministry with the head of INSTEX on Thursday.
""We consider that we'll be able to conduct sales (to Iran) this financial year with the help of our banking partner, we'll have to see for the other scheme,"" Supiot said.
France, Germany and Britain legally set up the entity in January, but it is expected to take several months before it becomes operational. The European powers must first establish a budget for INSTEX and define its rules. Iran must also set up a mirror company.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc have been sued by investors in the United States over their alleged roles in a conspiracy among eight banks to rig prices in the $9.4 trillion European government bond market.
The proposed class-action complaint accusing the banks of violating federal antitrust law was filed on Monday night in U.S. District Court in New Haven, Connecticut.
It followed a Jan. 31 announcement by the European Union's antitrust authority accusing the eight banks of being part of a cartel to distort bond prices from 2007 to 2012.
In a ""Statement of Objections,"" the European Commission said it believed bond traders may have illegally shared commercially sensitive information and coordinated trading strategies, mainly through online chatrooms.
While the commission did not identify the eight banks, media reports said Bank of America and RBS are among them.
Bank of America spokesman Bill Halldin declined to comment on Tuesday. RBS also declined to comment.
According to the complaint, banks profited at investors' expense by conspiring to widen the bid-asked spreads they quoted, thereby increasing the prices that investors paid for bonds and decreasing the prices at which they sold bonds.
The banks' tactics were ""strikingly similar"" to those used in the foreign exchange market, the complaint said, where banks paid more than $10 billion in fines to settle enforcement claims in several countries. Several banks also entered guilty pleas.
Suspected cartel members that have yet to be publicly named were identified as ""John Doe"" defendants in the complaint.
A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment. The plaintiffs are led by the Electrical Workers Pension Fund Local 103 I.B.E.W. in Boston.
U.S. courts are home to a wide array of private litigation accusing banks of conspiring to rig various financial markets, interest rate benchmarks and commodities.

However, he said in a Bloomberg TV interview that he won’t be discussing Barrick’s bid for his company, but rather Newmont’s proposal for a joint venture around the two companies’ assets in Nevada.
Goldberg said he heard from Bristow earlier and that “I’m looking forward to catching up with him later today here in New York. This will be the discussion on the joint venture with what we proposed yesterday.’’
Barrick spokeswoman Kathy du Plessis didn’t immediately have a comment.
In the past week, leaders at the two companies have disparaged their counterparts as inept managers who have squandered assets and destroyed shareholder value. And that’s before a formal offer is even on the table.
At stake is a potential $17.8 billion deal that would create the world’s largest gold producer. Newmont kicked off the fighting talk, with Goldberg calling Barrick’s proposal to buy the company “desperate and bizarre” even before Barrick publicly presented its terms on Feb. 25. Bristow responded in kind, saying he could run Newmont’s assets better than Goldberg does.
The bid by Toronto-based Barrick includes no premium. Newmont’s board rejected the offer on Monday, saying its shareholders would be better off completing a pending purchase of Goldcorp Inc. But Goldberg also offered a concession, saying his company would be willing to negotiate a friendly joint venture with Barrick at their Nevada operations that would give Barrick the greater share -- in addition to pushing forward with the Goldcorp deal.
Barrick has said it is keen to talk as well. But how such negotiations could ever be friendly is hard to imagine, given the company’s history and comments made over the past week.
War of Words
The war of words started immediately after Barrick confirmed it was contemplating a bid. Goldberg quickly questioned whether Barrick’s management team is capable of running a combined Newmont-Barrick company, saying, “they haven’t delivered.’’
Later Goldberg got a bit more personal, targeting Bristow by name. “Mark has never run a global portfolio,’’ Goldberg said. “In fact, I’d say none of his team have run a global portfolio like what we have in place.’’
In a March 4 presentation, Goldberg seemed to damn Bristow with faint praise. Sure, “there is no doubt that Mark has been successful as an explorer and a geologist,’’ Goldberg said. But “as an operator, he has not created shareholder value and he has yet to prove that he can successfully manage or integrate a global portfolio.’’
Goldberg also didn’t spare Barrick Chairman John Thornton, a former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). president who joined the gold industry in 2012. In the presentation, Goldberg accused Thornton of “numerous missteps’’ and “value destruction.’’
Underperformed
Newmont’s slide presentation said that since Thornton arrived at the company, it has underperformed Newmont by more than $12 billion, “while pocketing over $65M from Barrick shareholders.”
For his part, Bristow has been less personal, though no less direct, saying he could do a better job managing gold fields in Nevada, where Barrick has long wanted to combine its fields with Newmont’s. Bristow also suggested that because Goldberg is scheduled to leave as CEO at the end of the year, Newmont is in an unstable situation. And he’s said Newmont’s play for Goldcorp would destroy shareholder value.
Newmont’s suggestion that Barrick could take the larger stake in a JV seemed to calm the waters today -- but suspicions on both sides remain high. Bristow says Newmont’s JV pitch may be just a “smoke screen” to block its hostile bid. Meanwhile, Newmont has said all along that Barrick’s hostile is really about derailing its play for Goldcorp.

""We have a strong independent future, but if there is a partnership, a relationship or a merger which strengthens that future I will look at that,"" Manley told reporters at the Geneva car show.
Asked whether he would consider selling Maserati to China's Geely Automobile Holdings, as suggested by recent media reports, Manley said: ""Maserati is one of our really beautiful brands and it has an incredibly bright future... No.""
FCA is often cited as a possible merger candidate. Bloomberg said this week that the Italian-American carmaker was attractive to France's PSA Group given its exposure to the U.S. market and its popular Jeep brand.
Manley, who took over after the death of Sergio Marchionne, said he currently had no news on possible deals. 
Manley also said the world's seventh-largest carmaker, which is lagging rivals in developing hybrid and electric vehicles, would take the least costly approach to comply with increasingly more stringent European emissions regulations. 
""There are three options. You can sell enough electrified vehicles to balance your fleet. Two: You can be part of a pooling scheme. Three is to pay the fines,"" he said. 
""I don't see a scenario when (carmakers) continue to subsidize technologies ... indefinitely.""
The carmaker had said last June it would invest 9 billion euros ($10.19 billion) over the next five years to introduce hybrid and electric cars across all regions to be fully compliant with emissions regulations.
Asked about a 5 billion-euro investment plan for Italy FCA announced in November but then put under review, Manley said the plan had been confirmed as originally presented. 

The plan was examined earlier this year after Rome approved new taxes on the purchase of larger gasoline and diesel cars.

(Reuters) -  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) forecast 2019 profit above Wall Street estimates on Tuesday as strong online sales and higher footfall at stores drove better-than-expected holiday sales, sending its shares up 6 percent.
Target upped its delivery offerings in the highly competitive holiday shopping season in a bid to get an edge over online behemoth Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and brick-and-mortar rivals like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.
The Minneapolis-based retailer offered free two-day shipping on hundreds of thousands of items and it said spruced up ""buy online and pick up at store"" options accounted for three quarters of online sales.
""We have been driving an ambitious agenda to transform our company, evolve with our guests and drive strong growth,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said. ""On every count we've been successful."" 
The company's comparable online sales grew 31 percent in the quarter. In-store traffic grew 4.5 percent in the quarter.
""Target's strategic initiatives ...are clearly bearing fruit, with its online push continuing to generate impressive gains,"" Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea said.
Target's comparable sales, that include both in-store and digital sales, rose 5.3 percent, beating analysts estimate of 5.08 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Online contributed 2.4 percentage points to these sales, while the retailer also recorded market share gains across all five of its core merchandise categories that include home and apparel.
These investments have, however, hurt Target's margins. In the quarter gross profit margin fell to 25.7 percent from 26.1 percent, a year earlier.
The company forecast 2019 adjusted profit between $5.75 and $6.05 per share, above analysts expectations of $5.61 per share.
Target also expects comparable sales to clock in a low- to mid-single digit increase, while analysts were expecting it to grow at 2.54 percent. 
Excluding certain items, the company earned $1.53 per share, a cent above analysts' expectations.
The company's total revenue fell marginally to $22.98 billion in the quarter ended Feb. 2, edging past analysts estimate of $22.96 billion.

Target's shares were up 6.21 percent at $77.20 in early trading on Tuesday. The stock is up nearly 10 percent this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares stalled near a five-month high on Tuesday as China cut its growth targets to a 30-year low but added more stimulus, and a revived dollar headed for a fifth day of gains in the currency markets.
Brighter German and French data had initially lifted Europe's STOXX 600 index, though with Italy also confirmed back in recession and new money laundering woes weighing on the banking sector, there was little in the way of fresh energy. 
Wall Street futures were just about holding in positive territory but after a near 20 percent rally for the S&P 500 since late December and trade, political and monetary policy uncertainty in plentiful supply, traders were eyeing a rest.
Asia had also struggled overnight after Beijing took the widely expected step to lower its growth target to 6 to 6.5 percent from last year's 6.5 percent at the National People's Congress.
Japan's Nikkei and South Korea's Kopsi both reversed despite weaker domestic currencies, though Chinese stocks actually made ground as Premier Li Keqiang announced nearly 2 trillion yuan ($298.31 billion) of cuts in taxes and company fees.
Authorities in Beijing also said they were stepping up efforts to encourage big banks to lend more.
""You have had positive news on trade and positive news on the Federal Reserve (pausing rate hikes), so you have had less to worry about, but what hasn't really gone away is this slowdown in global growth,"" JP Morgan Asset Management strategist Mike Bell said.
In currency markets, the dollar continued its recent return to form just as other major central banks have turned more cautious about lifting interest rates again, similar to the way the Federal Reserve did at the start of the year. 
The euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.1330 , amid expectations the European Central Bank will prepare the ground for more ultra-cheap long-term funding at its policy meeting on Thursday.
The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 111.93 yen to stay near Friday's 10-week high of 112.08, while the Canadian dollar slid to near six-week lows after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was hit by cabinet resignations and bets Canada's central bank is also about to change tack.
""The Bank of Canada are probably at the place where they are starting to feel concerned,"" Charles St Arnaud, a senior investment strategist at Lombard Odier, said.
BREATHER 
Britain's pound was stuck back below $1.32 despite better than expected services sector data. Australia's dollar fell 0.2 percent to $0.7072 after weak exports figures suggested its economy came close to stalling last quarter.
Wall Street's major indexes were poised for a mostly steady start after falling modestly on Monday - which traders had put down to an unexpected decline in U.S. construction spending, data that normally attracts little attention.
Fatigue is clearly playing a role, though. MSCI's All Country World Index ,which covers 47 economies and thousands of individual stocks, has now risen 16 percent from its near two-year low on Dec. 26.
It was barely budging on Tuesday in the various cross currents, but the index is now trading at 14.6 times expected earnings, on par with levels back in early October when a global bear market began to take hold.
(Graphic: Global stock valuations link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2VHHkGL).
Eoin Murray, Head of Investment at Hermes Investment Management, said the range-bound moves of recent days showed markets were now ""in no-man's land"" and in need of fresh direction after their early year spurt. 
A media report on Monday had said that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could reach a formal trade deal at a summit around March 27, but Murray's expectation is that tariffs will be maintained at current levels - not increased but not removed as some economists hoped.
Trump looked to have already opened a new front on Monday with plans to end preferential trade treatment for Turkey and India. India's current arrangement allows duty-free entry for up to $5.6 billion worth of its exports to the U.S.
Turkey's lira and India's rupee didn't really react but on the U.S.-China hopes, Hermes' Murray added the issues being worked toward are ""just the pinnacle of a very large iceberg."" 
Commodity markets were also in flux after a strong start to 2019.
Gold was on course for a fifth straight day of declines, putting it at $1,285 an ounce, marking its worst run since November, while oil drifted down before perking back up before U.S. trading. 

U.S. crude futures, which are up a third since the end of last year, stood at $56.74 per barrel, while international benchmark Brent futures were 0.2 percent better off at $65.83 per barrel.

Some Investors Eye Dubai Instead,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabian stocks are about to join major emerging-markets benchmarks, gaining the attention of many money managers for the first time. But some investors familiar with markets in the Gulf say that Dubai offers bigger potential gains.
That’s because the biggest stocks in Riyadh have been rallying in anticipation of their inclusion in the gauges, compiled by FTSE Russell and MSCI Inc., in several tranches starting this month. Dubai’s market, on the other hand, has been battered in the past year by concerns mostly tied to its real estate market, a pillar of its economy.
Saudi shares have historically traded at a premium to Dubai’s, in terms of estimated price-to-earnings. But the gap between them reached the widest since 2010 in February. The Dubai Financial Market General Index was the worst-performer globally last year among major gauges tracked by Bloomberg, while the Saudi peer was among the 10 best. Dubai’s main index lost 0.3 percent on Tuesday, while the gauge in Saudi Arabia fell less than 0.1 percent.
“We think the U.A.E. has reached the bottom of its real estate cycle,” said James Johnstone, the London-based co-head of emerging and frontier markets at RWC Partners LLC, which oversees $15 billion. “We have been using that opportunity to reduce some of our Saudi holdings and reallocate it back into the U.A.E. property stocks that are very cheap and attractively priced.”

91,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>",U.S. insurers seek renewal of federal 'backstop' against acts of terrorism,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - U.S. insurers are pushing for the extension of a federal terrorism risk insurance program, hoping to fend off a possible gap that would leave their clients scrambling for alternate coverage. 
The program, which expires at the end of 2020, was created by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. The law was passed after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when insurers suffered steep losses and some stopped offering terrorism risk insurance on commercial buildings.
The program requires insurers to offer certain types coverage for losses caused by an event that the U.S. government has officially designated as terrorism. If losses from an attack exceed a set amount, a federal backstop kicks in to offset insurers' payouts.
The program, which has never been triggered, is used by big businesses, owners of sports stadiums and other groups that insure against attacks that are deemed terrorism. 
A timely renewal of the program is a top priority for the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the trade group's chief executive officer, David Sampson, said in a recent interview. Sampson also wants Congress to make the program permanent and provide more clarity about coverage for cyber terrorism.
But the possibility that U.S. lawmakers may not extend the program promptly is already spurring insurers and brokers to discuss alternatives with commercial customers, who are beginning the process of policy renewal for next year.
""I'm not surprised that the industry is already thinking of it,"" said Howard Mills, global insurance regulatory leader for Deloitte. ""It has always been a big question for the market because Congress doesn't focus on it until the expiration date is right on top of them.""
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act was signed into law by President George W. Bush in November 2002. Congress extended the program in 2005 and has unauthorized it twice since then.
MEMORIES OF MADNESS
Memories of a brief lapse in the program after 2014, when some conservative lawmakers called for the private sector to pay more terror-related losses before federal government funding kicks in, are still fresh to the industry.
""What we experienced during that two-week period was basically insanity,"" Jennifer Rubin, who heads the terrorism, war, and political violence products line for insurer Hiscox Ltd, said in a recent interview. Hiscox was ""deluged"" with requests for terrorism policies that were not tied to the federal program, she said.
Policies that are not backed by the program, known as standalone coverage, tend to be costlier in high-risk areas, such as New York, Washington and San Francisco, insurers and brokers said. 
But many customers in risky areas prefer them because they have fewer restrictions than the government-backed program, which requires a U.S. declaration that an international terrorism act took place, they said. 
GEARING UP
Brokers Aon (NYSE:AON) Plc and Marsh, a Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (NYSE:MMC) unit, said they have begun telling customers about alternatives to the government-backed program, such as a contingency policy that activates if it does not renew on time.
Many clients in high-risk areas, such as New York, are already looking into buying two-year standalone policies, which will insure them through 2021, regardless of what happens with the government program, said Christof Bentele, global head of crisis management, at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Corporate & Specialty, a unit of Allianz SE.
As commercial customers buy up standalone coverage, those who may also need this type of coverage at the last minute - if the government-backed program lapses - may not be able to obtain it or may have to pay extra, insurers said. 
Many insurance professionals believe that a timely renewal is more likely next year than in 2014. They point to the recent takeover of the U.S. House of Representatives by Democrats, with some Democrats saying that renewal of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act should be a priority. Also, at least one key Republican, U.S. Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho, said on Jan. 29 that renewing the terrorism program is a priority. Crapo is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.
Still, the Banking Committee will consider possible changes, such as boosting coinsurance and increasing amounts the U.S. government may recoup through policyholder surcharges, Crapo said at the time. 
As the battle unfolds, some customers that already have the government-backed insurance may decide to roll the dice and risk going bare if the program lapses, Bentele said. 

That could make more sense for a shop owner in Alabama than a building-owner in Manhattan, Bentele said. ""If you don't have coverage in New York City, I'd feel really uncomfortable,"" Bentele said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Two of Europe's best-selling cars, the  Renault  (PA:RENA) Clio and Peugeot 208, go head-to-head at the Geneva motor show on Tuesday, as the auto market they dominate faces transformative pressures on its future profits and jobs.
As industry executives gather to discuss trade-tariff threats, new emissions rules and fines, or waning ambitions for autonomous driving, the two staple subcompacts will be wheeled out in apparent defiance of the profound changes underway.
In other ways, though, they show an industry fast adapting. Both models are poised to abandon what remains of their French production, completing a once controversial shift to lower-cost plants in Turkey, eastern Europe and Morocco. Both will also introduce electric and hybrid drivetrain options - which themselves pose a further challenge to supplier jobs https://reut.rs/2wrsoPT.
""There’s an ongoing need for compact, efficient urban models,” said Jean-Philippe Imparato, head of the Peugeot brand. “The market is robust.”
Small certainties are welcome in an industry facing hard-to-quantify strains including Britain's planned exit from the European Union, a U.S.-led assault on trade liberalization and the many billions spent developing a new generation of electric vehicles for which mass demand remains largely unproven.
Major auto markets are now in decline or stagnating, and hopes for a lucrative self-driving car boom have also receded as costs and technical hurdles stay stubbornly high.
While higher-riding SUVs are on a relative upswing, compact hatchbacks such as the Clio and 208 are still Europe's biggest vehicle category by volume, accounting for 3.5 million annual sales for an 18 percent market share.
“There’s plenty of room for both” cars and SUVs in Europe’s small-car market, said Denis Schemoul, an auto production analyst with forecaster IHS Markit. “The small hatch remains an excellent compromise in terms of size and versatility.”
LOWER STANCE
Both the 208 and the Clio, which has notched up 15 million vehicle sales since its 1990 debut, deliberately shun modish bulk in their latest incarnations, for a lower, more aerodynamic stance that can only help fuel-economy.
Carmakers risk hundreds of millions of euros in fines for missing the EU's 2020-21 emissions goal averaging 95 grammes of carbon dioxide per kilometer. The bloc's parliament and member states have agreed on a further 37.5 percent cut by 2030. According to new industry data published on the eve of the show, European new-car CO2 emissions actually rose in 2018 for a second consecutive year, as sales of relatively efficient diesels continued to collapse.
“Instead of moving forwards, the industry is regressing at a time when emissions targets are getting tougher,” said analyst Felipe Munoz of consulting firm JATO, which compiled the data.
PSA Group’s Peugeot and Citroen line-ups came in below 108 grammes of average CO2 emissions last year – just behind hybrid leader Toyota’s 99.9 grammes – while the Opel division acquired from General Motors (NYSE:GM) in 2017 topped 125 grammes. Fourth-placed Renault averaged 109.1 grammes.
Strong sales of the new 208 will not be enough to avoid the early retirement of some Opel models before the new rules take effect, a PSA source told Reuters. “Expect some announcements later this year.”
With its lower, wider, longer 208, Peugeot has adopted the lighting signature and other design cues from its 3008 and 5008 SUV siblings, whose runaway success has lifted pricing power and driven PSA Group to record profits.
JOBS SHIFT
Assembly of the 208 will end at the group’s Poissy plant west of Paris, which had handled overflow production of the current model built mainly in Trnava, Slovakia. The new vehicle will also be produced in Kenitra, Morocco, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.
Renault’s Flins plant is similarly unlikely to keep the Clio as the model upgrades, industry sources said. The factory now has a growing output of Zoe electric cars and alliance partner Nissan’s Micra to keep its lines humming and unions happy.
A new affordable Renault hybrid drivetrain will launch in the Clio next year, as Peugeot debuts its pure-electric 208 – both part of the industry's scramble to electrify, cut emissions and avoid fines.
But the abrupt shift from combustion engines to batteries, which can account for 40 percent of the final price of a car, has sparked fears and warnings about the fallout for jobs in Europe, which lacks battery makers to compete with Chinese, South Korean and Japanese groups.
To avoid ""ruinous"" fines, PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in an interview with Le Figaro on Monday that carmakers were forced to ""reserve battery volumes with Asian suppliers who only are happy to see us coming"" and extract high prices.

""The European Parliament's decision is quite simply forcing the auto sector to export 40 percent of its vehicles' value to Asia,"" he said.

94,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 06:10AM ET</span>","Moody’s Scolds New York City on Amazon, Then Gives It a Pat","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Last Friday afternoon, as U.S. financial markets were winding down for the week, Moody’s Investors Service pushed out an upgrade on New York City’s $38 billion of general obligation bonds. Normally this would be a big deal for the $3.8 trillion U.S. municipal-bond market. After all, it’s one of the largest borrowers in an otherwise highly diffuse market comprising villages, towns, local park districts and school systems.
Yet in some ways, this Moody’s upgrade was a surprise. As recently as December, the company’s outlook on New York’s Aa2 rating was stable, generally an indication that analysts are comfortable with its current rank (in this case, the third-highest investment grade). The outlook never moved to positive.(1) The new Aa1 grade is one step higher than S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings and Fitch Ratings, which kept theirs at AA, the equivalent of Moody’s previous score. 
But perhaps the most jarring detail is just two weeks earlier, Moody’s practically dressed down New York for driving away Amazon.com Inc. and its promise of 25,000 jobs at a new corporate campus in Queens. Here’s a passage from a report originally published on Feb. 15 about Amazon’s decision:
“The announcement is credit negative for New York City and highlights how politics and anti-business sentiment can combine to derail economic development despite competitive strengths. New York City has advantages in an educated workforce and mass transit that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was seeking, and Amazon's investment would have accelerated growth in those areas. High-tech employment will also grow more slowly without the 25,000 new jobs Amazon's arrival was expected to create.”
As far as credit-rating language goes, that’s pretty harsh. Nicholas Samuels, the lead analyst, did go on to say that the city’s economy will be strong, even without Amazon, citing companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). that have expanded. Amazon or not, the diversification away from Wall Street appeared to be the driving force behind the upgrade. Here’s the first paragraph explaining it:
“The upgrade to the general obligation rating reflects continued strengthening and diversification of New York City's economy, reducing its reliance on volatile financial services. The city's competitive advantages include a young and highly skilled labor pool, access to higher education and medical centers, strong domestic and international transportation links, and low crime rates. Those fundamentals position New York City for strong future growth, especially in media, medical research, and technology, while maintaining its deep strength in financial services.”
That may all be true, but it’s nevertheless a puzzling timeline. It could be that New York had done enough to earn an upgrade before Amazon’s mid-February decision, and Moody’s decided the loss of HQ2 wasn’t enough to change that. Moody’s cites the growth in technology jobs, noting that the city’s population is “attractive to companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, and others.” At the end of that same paragraph, it mentions political opposition to Amazon “may make firms that want government incentives think twice about it as a location. However, the trajectory of the fundamentals that attracted Amazon in the first place are unchanged.”
To be sure, a “credit negative” just reflects the directional impact of a distinct event, which often isn’t enough to shift an entire outlook. Joe Mielenhausen, a Moody’s spokesman, told Bloomberg News’s Martin Z. Braun that the firm upgrades issuers from a stable outlook “all the time,” even without some sort of new financial information, like audited financials or a surprise increase in tax revenue. “In this instance, the upgrade was a culmination of various credit positive trends our team has been observing for some time,” he said. It’s mostly semantics, but that sounds deserving of a positive outlook to me.
Mayor Bill de Blasio, predictably, lauded the move, saying that New York’s current rating is the highest ever from Moody’s. “For the last five years, we’ve used the city’s budget to improve the lives of New Yorkers,” he said in a statement. “Moody’s credit rating is validation of what we’ve always known: that you can be both a progressive and a strong fiscal manager.”
Investors are already clamoring for the city’s bonds. Yield spreads reached an all-time low last week, fueled by demand for triple tax-exempt debt as a shelter from the new federal limit on state and local tax deductions. In a block trade of at least $5 million on Monday, some New York bonds maturing in 2024 changed hands at a yield just 11 basis points above top-rated munis, the smallest spread in 10 months. That’s welcome news for New York taxpayers as the city prepares to issue about $1 billion of debt this week.
On top of it all, it’s anyone’s guess if the city’s Amazon saga is even over. Governor Andrew Cuomo said he’s had many conversations with the company and hopes they reconsider. The New York Times reported that he’s gone so far as to connect with Jeff Bezos to make a personal pitch over the past two weeks. An open letter that ran as a full-page ad in the newspaper urged a second chance.
Confronted with “anti-business sentiment” and derailed economic development, Moody’s ended up deciding Amazon wasn’t a big loss; New York is strong enough as is. Armed with an even-better credit rating and record-low borrowing costs, it may only get stronger.
(1) It's true that upgrades from a stable outlook have happened before. Moody's pointed to five such examples in 2018: San Francisco;Florida;Chicago Public Schools;Washington, D.C.; and the Great Lakes Water Authority.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks were higher on Tuesday as investors bought consumer staples and other stocks considered safer during economic strife after China pledged more stimulus to stabilize slowing growth in the world's No.2 economy.
The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.2 percent at 0946 GMT, recovering from brief early pressure to extend a three-day rally that saw the index hit five-month highs a day earlier amid hopes of a truce to the protracted U.S.-China trade spat. 
Tobacco, healthcare and consumer staples, considered havens during political and economic turmoil, led the gains amid broader gloom about the global economy.  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS), Anheuser Busch and  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) were up between 1.2 percent and 2.1 percent.
Equities also perked up after euro-zone data showed business activity accelerated more than expected last month, helping offset downbeat news from China.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang cut the government's 2019 growth target to 6.0-6.5 percent, as expected, and promised more stimulus, including cuts in taxes, increases in infrastructure investment, and lending to small firms.
While the cut underlined the strain that has slowed growth and roiled global markets, stimulus steps reassured investors that Beijing was serious about steadying the economy.
""I think we all saw it coming. The growth trend was going to be cut and they're saying the right things about stimulus. They have plenty of policy levers to pull if needed,"" said Peel Hunt economics and strategy research analyst Ian Williams (NYSE:WMB).
Still, autos and suppliers, which rely on Chinese demand, were under pressure, with Continental and Daimler among the biggest fallers in Frankfurt.

Among individual movers, Evonik shares were close to four-month highs after the German chemicals group reported a slight rise in profits thanks to its coating additives and engineering plastics division. 
 Vodafone  (LON:VOD) added 2.3 percent after announcing plans to issue 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) worth of convertible bonds to help finance its takeover of some Liberty assets.
Elsewhere in the UK, British product testing company Intertek was the biggest faller in London, with a dealer attributing the drop to profit taking after largely in line full-year results. 
Eurofins fell 6.6 percent to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after the food and biopharma product testing firm said it would curb its M&A activity in a bid to shore up margins and cash flow.
BBA Aviation was on track for its worst day in three months after its full-year results.
Luxury goods companies Richemont and Moncler were each down more than 3 percent after downgrades.

100,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 04:22AM ET</span>",Cathay Pacific in talks to buy stake in HNA's HK Express Airways,"By Donny Kwok and Jamie Freed
HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Hong Kong flagship carrier Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd said on Tuesday it is in ""active discussions"" about an acquisition involving budget airline Hong Kong Express Airways Ltd, although an agreement has yet to be reached. 
Such a deal would give Cathay exposure to the growing budget-travel market at a time when a lack of slots at Hong Kong International Airport has constrained its ability to follow peers like Singapore Airlines Ltd and Qantas Airways Ltd and set up its own budget brand.
The Hong Kong carrier has instead shifted some destinations from its main brand to its regional carrier, Cathay Dragon, as part of a transformation plan designed to cut costs and increase revenue. It has ordered 32 Airbus SE A321neos for Cathay Dragon.
Cathay said it had decided to go public about the discussions in response to media reports suggesting it may be in talks to acquire shares in Hong Kong Express Airways Ltd and full-service sister carrier Hong Kong Airlines Ltd from cash-strapped Chinese conglomerate HNA Group Co Ltd.
It did not detail the potential value of the transaction, nor the size of the stake it would hold. It said it would issue an additional statement when appropriate.
An analyst last year estimated to Reuters that HK Express could be worth about $300 million.
HK Express in a statement said shareholders have held initial discussions with strategic investors about a potential acquisition but no details had been confirmed and there was not yet any agreement.
A person with knowledge of the matter said the companies appeared close to reaching an agreement and noted Cathay's parent Swire Pacific Ltd had historically taken majority stakes when making investments.
Cathay is not interested in Hong Kong Airlines because it has both similar routes and full-service positioning, the person said.
A second person with knowledge of the matter said Cathay had signed an exclusivity period for discussion but other parties remained interested in HK Express if a deal could not be reached.
Both sources spoke on the condition of anonymity as discussions are confidential.
ANTITRUST
Given Cathay's dominance of Hong Kong's aviation market, a deal could attract scrutiny from the competition regulator.
Some analysts have also expressed doubts about the likely benefits of any deal. Daiwa analyst Kelvin Lau said he did not see much value from the acquisition as the two airlines flew similar routes, but also because Cathay would need to undertake significant reform to add a budget wing.
Jefferies analyst Andrew Lee however said in a note to clients it would be ""positive for Cathay Pacific"" as it would give the airline greater access to a different passenger segment in the low-cost market.
FLYING HIGH
News of Cathay's interest in HK Express comes just weeks after Hong Kong's flagship carrier projected its annual profit at more than double analyst estimates, sending its shares surging nearly 9 percent. 
Shares of Cathay have risen more than 19 percent so far this year, compared with an 8 percent fall in 2018. The airline's shares jumped more than 3 percent on Tuesday morning.
Cathay has faced repeated questions from investors over the last few years about its failure to set up a budget carrier.
Chief Executive Rupert Hogg has said it would be difficult to do so until a third runway was completed at Hong Kong International Airport in 2024, opening up more slots.
""Our home-based airport is full at the moment, or largely full, and so it's not a perfect place to develop a model from scratch,"" he told CAPA Centre for Aviation last May.
HK Express operates a fleet of 25 A320 family aircraft to regional destinations around Asia, according to plane tracking website FlightRadar24.

Embattled HNA Group is more than a year into the process of unwinding a $50 billion acquisition spree that at its peak netted the company stakes in banks, fund managers, hotels, property and airlines, among other assets.

Works council chief Bernd Osterloh said production programs had been changed and shifts re-allocated as part of a reorganization of all plants. 
""It is only fair that the staff gets its share of success,"" he was quoted as saying in the newsletter.
The size of the payment should not be read as an indicator of operating profits at the Volkswagen passenger car brand because commercial vehicles were also included in the scheme, and the number of workers on part time contracts who receive less must be taken into account, the newsletter said.

105,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 03:25AM ET</span>",Airlines stall in tackling climate change: investor group,"By Alister Doyle, Environment Correspondent
OSLO (Reuters) - Airlines are doing too little in the fight against global warming, a study funded by investors with $13 trillion of assets under management said on Tuesday.
The fast-growing sector accounts for two percent of world greenhouse gas emissions and should do more to manage risks of climate change, the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) said in a review of 20 of the world's biggest listed airlines.
It rated Delta, Lufthansa, United Airlines and ANA Holdings as the best performers at managing the business risks and opportunities of climate change. But all could do more.
""Investors have a clear message to the aviation sector: When it comes to carbon performance they must be in it for the long haul,"" said Faith Ward, co-chair of the TPI on behalf of the British Environment Agency Pension Fund.
""Investors do care ... it's about encouraging disclosure so we can make informed decisions,"" she told Reuters.
TPI, which seeks to assess the performance of businesses in cutting carbon, groups 40 investors with $13 trillion under management, including  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and Legal & General Investment Management. Its research is by the London School of Economics' Grantham Research Institute.
More fuel-efficient planes, wider use of biofuels and ensuring that planes fly at full capacity would help to limit emissions. 
TPI separately said easyJet (LON:EZJ) and Alaska Air now had the most efficient fleets among the top 20 listed airlines, judged by their emissions per passenger kilometer flown.
At the other end of that scale, ANA, Japan Airlines, Korean Air and Singapore Airlines have the highest emissions intensities, it said.
Lead author Professor Simon Dietz of the Grantham Research Institute said some airlines had adopted broad industry goals to cap net carbon emissions at 2020 levels, or to halve net emissions by 2050 from 2005 levels. 
But that focus on net emissions often meant airlines could buy permits to emit carbon dioxide, rather than make cuts themselves.
""The issue is that we don't know how much they are going to reduce their own flight emissions compared to buying offsets,"" he told Reuters.
Dietz also said there were other effects of aviation apart from carbon dioxide that need more research. Contrails, for instance, may can cause high-level clouds that trap heat.

Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, almost 200 governments agreed to cut emissions to help avert more floods, droughts and rising sea levels. They promised to ""enhance public and private sector participation"" in cutting emissions.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese footwear retailer Belle International has hired Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merill Lynch (BAML) to help prepare for a Hong Kong listing of its sportswear business this year, said people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The firm aims for a valuation of at least HK$20 billion ($2.55 billion) to HK$25 billion for the unit, which distributes brands such as  Nike  and Adidas, said two of the people.
The divestiture comes nearly two years after BAML advised a consortium led by Hillhouse Capital Group and CDH Investments to take Belle private in a $6.8 billion deal completed in July 2017, as traditional retailers battled online competition.
The Shenzhen-based firm invited a group of investment banks to pitch for the listing late last year, said two of the people, who declined to be identified as the information was private.
Belle did not respond to an emailed request for comment and did not answer phone calls. BAML, Hillhouse and CDH declined to comment.
The initial public offering (IPO) plan comes as the value of China's sportswear market is set to grow to $58 billion in 2023 from $40 billion last year, estimated market researcher Euromonitor.
Belle controlled a 6.7 percent share of China's apparel and footwear specialist retailer segment, with Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN) being the top two sportswear companies in China last year, Euromonitor data showed.
Established in 1991 as one of China's earliest shoe retailers, Belle produces shoes under own brands such as Belle and Staccato, and distributes foreign labels such as from Puma SE, Moussy and Converse.
The retailer experienced ""unprecedented challenges"", particularly from e-commerce and shopping malls that competed with its main sales channels in department stores, it said in an April 2017 filing when announcing the buyout https://reut.rs/2tOssdK.
Hillhouse, which has invested in Chinese technology firms including Tencent Holdings Ltd and JD.com Inc, owned 57.6 percent of Belle after the buyout, with CDH holding 11.9 percent, Belle said in July 2017. A group of Belle managers owned the remaining 30.5 percent.
Belle has for years hoped to boost competitiveness in e-commerce as Chinese consumers increasingly shop online.
It directly managed 20,716 retail outlets in China at the end of February 2017, including 13,062 footwear and 7,654 sportswear and apparel outlets.

Chocolate makers are grappling with saturated European and U.S. markets and a trend towards healthier snacking, but Lindt is growing faster than peers as it taps new markets in Asia and Africa and expands its own retail network.
It is, however, taking more time to turn around its Russell Stover business it had bought to boost its position in the United States, and had to trim its mid-term guidance to 5-7 percent organic sales growth in January when it released 2018 sales figures.
The maker of Lindor chocolate balls said it had made substantial investments in North America ""to lay the foundation for profitable sales growth"", but did not say whether it expected improvements starting this year. 
Net profit rose 7.6 percent to 487.1 million Swiss francs ($487 million) in 2018, in line with expectations in an Infront Data poll, the company known for its gold foil-wrapped Easter bunnies said in a statement. 
It proposed to pay out a dividend of 1,000 Swiss francs per registered share, an increase of 7.5 percent over last year, and also in line with forecasts. It had already reported a 5.1 percent increase in organic sales in January.
Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said the group margin was slightly below consensus dragged down by a 240 basis point decline in North America. ""Lindt is clearly still in the middle of repositioning Russell Stover,"" he said.

After solid gains on Monday, most bourses across Asia opened the day in the red. Overnight Monday, shares plunged in U.S. markets, giving up early gains and closing in the red, after concerns arose about the lack of details around any potential trade deal between the U.S. and China and how it would affect global growth.
Asian shares followed U.S. shares down in the morning session but recouped some losses. Chinese shares in particular made some gains.
The Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.24% by 1:13 AM ET (6:13 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component build on morning gains and was up 1.15% early into the afternoon session. Chinese shares have enjoyed significant gains this year. The Shanghai Composite is up around 18% from the beginning of 2019 and Shenzhen is up about 25%.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index recouped some morning losses and moved between mild gains and mild losses. It was down just 0.04% by 1:15 AM ET (6:16 AM GMT).
Most other major stock markets around the region remained in the red in the afternoon.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.53% to 21,705 and the Kospi in Korea was trading down 0.70% to 2,175. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.29% to 6,199.
The gains in China followed comments in the morning at the opening of the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress. In his work report, Premier Li Keqiang announced a target for economic growth to between 6% and 6.5% for 2019.
Regulators also announced cuts to the value added tax (VAT), including a 3% to the top bracket, in a move that could help support manufacturing. The tax could add up to as much as CNY800 billion, according to figures from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) quoted by Bloomberg.

109,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 01:05AM ET</span>",China says Canadian stole secrets; Huawei to sue U.S.,"By Ben Blanchard and David Ljunggren
BEIJING/OTTAWA (Reuters) - China's government and its leading smartphone maker, Huawei Technologies Ltd, stepped up pressure on Monday on the U.S. and Canadian governments in a dispute over trade and telecoms technology that has ensnared Huawei's CFO, who faces U.S. criminal charges. 
China on Monday accused detained Canadian citizen Michael Kovrig of stealing state secrets passed on to him from another detained Canadian, businessman Michael Spavor, in a move likely to increase tension between Ottawa and Beijing.
The telecom gear maker is also preparing a lawsuit against the U.S. government over a law that restricts its market access.
It was the latest escalation of an unprecedented crisis for Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker and No. 2 manufacturer of smartphones, as Washington calls on governments around the world to stop using its gear, particularly in the next generation of telecommunication networks, known as 5G. 
Spavor, a business consultant with deep ties to Pyongyang, had been trying to drum up international interest in investing in North Korean economic projects. He and Kovrig, a former diplomat, were picked up in December, shortly after Canada arrested Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, who faces extradition to the United States.
The Communist Party's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission said Kovrig had often entered China using an ordinary passport and business visas, ""stealing and spying on sensitive Chinese information and intelligence via a contact in China.""
“We are obviously very concerned with this position that China has taken,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said about the accusations on Monday. ""We’ve been engaging and standing up for the two Canadians who have been arbitrarily detained by China from the very beginning."" 
Lawyers for Meng are suing the Canadian government, its border agency and federal police, alleging their client was detained, searched and interrogated for three hours in violation of her constitutional rights.
Canada arrested Meng in Vancouver on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States, which has charged her with bank and wire fraud to violate American sanctions against Iran by doing business through a subsidiary it tried to hide. 
HUAWEI TO SUE
In another escalation of the trans-Pacific dispute, Huawei plans to announce a lawsuit against the U.S. government on Thursday on grounds related to a defense bill, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
Huawei will challenge an addition to the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) signed last year, which controlled U.S. government contracts with Chinese companies and strengthened the role of the panel that reviews foreign investment proposals. Beijing has condemned the NDAA act as targeting China.
Trump last year signed the law that limits Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763) Corp's access to U.S. government and military contracts. That is part of an all-out U.S. effort to close the two companies' access to not only the U.S. market but major telecoms markets around the world where 5G networks are being designed and built.
U.S. lawmakers introduced bills earlier this year that would ban the sale of U.S. chips or other components to Chinese telecommunications companies that violate U.S. sanctions or export control laws.
U.S. officials have alleged Chinese telecom manufacturers are producing equipment that allows their government to spy on users abroad, including Western researchers working on leading-edge technologies. Beijing and the Chinese companies have repeatedly denied such allegations.
Trump is considering declaring a national emergency that would bar U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by Huawei and ZTE, three sources familiar with the situation told Reuters in December.
The Justice Department has also charged Huawei with stealing robotic technology from T-Mobile US Inc.
Trump said in February he may or may not include Huawei and ZTE in the trade deal being negotiated with China. Trump told reporters at the White House that U.S. officials were not talking about dropping charges against Huawei.
Also on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he thought his country and China were ""on the cusp"" of a deal to end their trade war.
HUAWEI CFO IN LIMBO
Meng, who is out on bail, is due to appear in a Vancouver court on Wednesday, when a date will be set for her extradition hearing. Ottawa rejects Chinese calls to release Meng, saying it cannot interfere with the judiciary.
The Canadian government approved her extradition proceedings on Friday. China, whose relations with Canada have deteriorated badly over the affair, denounced the decision and repeated previous demands for Meng's release.
It could be years before Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, is sent to the United States since Canada's slow-moving justice system allows many decisions to be appealed.
A final decision will likely come down to the federal justice minister, who will face the choice of angering the United States by rejecting the extradition bid, or China by accepting it.

111,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 05, 2019 12:40AM ET</span>",$1.6 Trillion of Trade Means China Pain Is Asia's: Taking Stock,"(Bloomberg) -- Judging by the market reaction in Asia to China’s latest economic-growth target, a detente with the U.S. on trade can’t come soon enough.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.4 percent to halt a two-day advance as major equity gauges across the region slipped. Stock benchmarks of key trade partners Japan and South Korea led the losses, putting pressure on the rally that restored $3 trillion in Asian equities this year. Chinese stocks fluctuated between gains and losses ahead of the mid-day trading break, while U.S. equity-index futures ticked lower.
China lowered the country’s goal for gross domestic product to a range of 6 percent to 6.5 percent in 2019, released in Premier Li Keqiang’s annual work report ahead of his speech to kick off the National People’s Congress. The lower bound of the target would be the slowest pace of expansion in almost three decades. In an effort to support the economy, Li also announced tax cuts worth 2 trillion yuan ($298 billion) for the year.
A slowing China puts into stark relief just how dependent many of the biggest export-driven countries in the region have become on the world’s second-largest economy, if Tuesday’s moves in Asia stocks are any indication. Total trade with China across Asia was worth some $1.6 trillion in 2017, according to the latest data compiled by Bloomberg, led by Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong -- all markets either flat or in the red now.
Now, it’s not all doom and gloom for China.
Investors have already given the market a vote of confidence this year, pushing $1.5 trillion in value into the stock market so far. As China moves past the trade war, investors will look for more clarity on the longer-term structural issues underpinning its economy and policy makers’ attempts to address those concerns.
Jefferies Financial Group Inc. equity analysts including Laban Yu and Patrick Yuan just returned from a tour of European clients and found that many were “quite receptive” to more bullish views on China, according to a March 4 report.
“Investor consensus appeared to be that China was ready to stimulate and that the economy had or will soon bottom out,” they said. “We pointed out that we had seen the supposed collapse of China’s economic growth at least four times in the last two decades. This time around is the least concerning on record.”
The biggest internal pressure point on China’s economy -- deleveraging after years of debt-fueled growth -- is “healthy, chosen, self-induced and entirely reversible,” while external pressures including the trade war and Federal Reserve tightening have either a limited impact or already fixed themselves, the analysts said.
“Least scary China collapse ever” was their conclusion.
Asia stocks investors are counting on it.

The Bill C-76, which was passed in December, requires online platforms to keep a registry of all political and partisan advertisements they directly or indirectly publish.
""For the duration of the 2019 federal election campaign, Google will not accept advertising regulated by Bill C-76,"" Colin McKay, Google Canada's head of public policy, said in a statement. 
""We're focusing our efforts on supporting Canadian news literacy programs and connecting people to useful and relevant election-related information.""
Election is due in October in Canada. 
Google will modify its ad policies and systems to block advertisers from running ads that fall under the purview of the definitions set out in Bill C-76.
Other Google services such as enhanced search results and platforms, including YouTube, will still be available during the campaign period.

This was first reported by the Globe and Mail.

Overnight Monday, shares plunged in U.S. markets giving up early gains with markets reacting to the lack of details around any potential trade deal between the U.S. and China and the potential of any deal having limited impact on global growth.
Chinese shares took a breather on Tuesday morning.
The Shanghai Composite Index was down 0.36% by 9:25 AM ET (2:25 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component offered an exception to the downbeat performances by rising 0.53%. Chinese shares have enjoyed significant gains this year. The Shanghai Composite is up around 18% from the beginning of 2019 and Shenzhen is up about 25%.
In Hong Kong Tuesday morning, the Hang Seng Index was down 0.55% at mid-morning to 28,797.
Most other major stock markets around the region were also in the red.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.62% to 21,676 and the Kospi in Korea was trading down 0.71% to 2,175. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.37% to 6,196.
The losses on Tuesday marked a significant turn-around in the mood of investors who, on Monday, had powered indexes to substantial gains on expectations of a quick trade deal between China and the U.S. While those expectations remain, few details of any agreement have come to light.
At the same time, China’s National People’s Congress opened its annual meeting on Tuesday. Policy makers have lowered the target for economic growth in the country to between 6% and 6.5% for this year. The target “band” rather than a specific target gives regulators more room to maneuver.
“It’s good news for the market in the short term; bad news for China is the medium term as more leverage will need to be piled up,” Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis SA, told Bloomberg.
Regulators also announced cuts to the value-added tax (VAT), including a 3% to the top bracket, in a move that could help support manufacturing. The tax could add up to as much as CNY800 billion, according to figures from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) quoted by Bloomberg.

The partner will use VW's so-called MEB production system to ""bring e-vehicles to market that complement Volkswagen's model offering,"" the carmaker said in a statement. 
A specific vehicle has yet to be decided on jointly, it added.
The VW brand's strategy chief Michael Jost said in a newspaper interview in January the group was in advanced talks with competitors over opening its modular EV production platform to rivals.
The platform seeks the cost advantages of large production numbers by standardizing as much as possible even across very different models.
Volkswagen in January said it was exploring joint development of e-vehicles with Ford, under a wide-ranging partnership. 
The German group plans to invest 30 billion euros ($34 billion) in e-mobility until 2023, it said in a statement on the eve of the Geneva car show. 
The carmaker's electric-vehicle investment budget outstrips that of its closest competitors, in pursuit of profitable mass-production of electric vehicles, something that no carmaker has come close to achieving.
E.GO Mobile helped develop a delivery van that is being produced by a subsidiary of postal services group  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn).
Among e.GO's other projects, it aims to bring an electric minibus to market in a joint venture with German autos supplier ZF Friedrichshafen.

SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian iron ore miner Vale fired an inspection firm because the company refused to certify one of its dams as safe, months before the barrier collapsed and killed hundreds, prosecutors said in a document filed this week, as they explained why they wanted top Vale executives ousted. 
After the thumbs down from inspection firm Tractebel, a subsidiary of France's Engie, Vale said it would no longer ask the auditor to perform regular inspections of the dam. It cited ""divergences in the criteria utilized to evaluate geotechnological safety,"" prosecutors said, citing unnamed witnesses' testimony.
Instead, Vale relied on Germany's TÜV SÜD , which signed off on the dam that burst and killed hundreds in January, despite evidence from its own readings that the structure was ""way below"" the recommended safety level, the prosecutors said.
Neither Vale nor Tractebel had any immediate comment. 
TÜV SÜD officials could not be reached for comment. Last month, the firm said it would halt providing certifications for Vale's tailings dams, which hold back mining waste. The company has hired two external law firms to look into its auditing practices.
Vale’s senior executives have apologized for the disaster but have not accepted responsibility, saying the installations met the highest industry standards.
Prosecutors now allege that it was a ""recurrent practice"" at Vale to pressure inspectors to sign off on reviews even if they ""violated the required technical specifications.""
The replacement of a firm reluctant to sign off on the dam's safety by one willing to do so was one of several such moves by the company's geotechnical unit, according to the prosecutors. Vale created the unit to improve safety after another deadly dam collapse in 2015. 
The prosecutors alleged the unit ""acted in a systematic form to certify as stable dams which didn't meet the legal parameters stipulated by the company itself, so much so that on more than one occasion the geotechnical area replaced external auditors who refused to make spurious declarations.""
They added this was part of a ""policy at Vale SA to obtain positive safety reviews in an improper way."" Even senior executives were regularly provided with information about the safety of the dams and other ""structures,"" the prosecutors alleged.
The allegations were contained in a document given to Vale on Friday recommending the immediate ""temporary removal"" of then CEO Fabio Schvartsman as well as Ferrous Metals Chief Peter Poppinga and other executives.
The prosecutors' allegations were previously reported by Folha de S. Paulo newspaper and the Wall Street Journal.
Vale's board agreed to the temporary removal on Saturday of Schvartsman, Poppinga and other executives. 

The company said on Saturday that its board was aiming for a ""transparent and productive relationship"" with Brazilian authorities aimed at clarifying the facts of the case and ""appropriate reparations for damages.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) will receive the first payment toward the installation a $15 billion missile defense system in Saudi Arabia as part of a $110 billion arms package the Trump administration said it negotiated with the Kingdom in 2017, the Pentagon said on Monday.
The Pentagon awarded Lockheed a $946 million payment for the foreign military sale.
In November, the Saudis and U.S. officials signed the letters of offer and acceptance formalizing terms for Saudi's purchase of 44 THAAD launchers, missiles and related equipment.
As a part of the scope of work outlined by the Pentagon, obsolete systems currently in place will be updated to prepare the current Saudi missile defense infrastructure for the new Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) technology.
The contract also allows Lockheed to pay for materials, tooling and engineering development among other work. 
The Pentagon announced the payment as an ""undefinitized contract action,"" a partial payment that will go to Lockheed Martin and prevent major delays in production of the new missile defense system in Saudi Arabia.

Last fall, the Trump administration and the U.S. defense industry worked to save the few actual deals in the much-touted $110 billion arms package for Saudi Arabia amid rising concerns about the role of the kingdom's leadership in the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi critic.

CBA in 2018 agreed to a civil penalty of A$700 million ($496.23 million) to settle charges bought by Australia's financial intelligence agency.
CBA admitted in part to failing to identify, monitor and report money transfers over A$10,000 ($7,566), in contravention of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism laws.
Without citing any sources, the AFR said the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) had accelerated a separate investigation, with plans in place to interview CBA's chairman, Catherine Livingstone, and former chief executive, Ian Narev.
It was not clear whether either Narev or Livingstone had been interviewed yet.
A spokeswoman for CBA declined to comment on the specific details of the report.
""CBA continues to engage with ASIC regarding a number of matters and responds to requests made by the regulator. We won't be commenting on any individual matter,"" said the spokeswoman.
ASIC declined to confirm or deny the report.
""ASIC never comments on operational issues and that includes whether we are interviewing certain individuals,"" said Matthew Abbott, a spokesman for ASIC.
The report comes just weeks after the release of a special government-appointed inquiry that excoriated Australia's financial sector for misconduct.
Two dozen cases were referred to regulators for possible legal action.

1. Services Sector in Focus
A surprise drop in construction spending sapped the optimism from stocks in early trading today, and traders might be nervous that the latest measure of services sector activity may also throw a wrench in the works.
The Institute of Supply Management will release its February non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
The services PMI is expected to rise to 57.3 for last month, according to economist forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
A similar survey of the manufacturing sector released on Friday showed that U.S. factory activity fell to a two-year low as demand softened.
At 9:45 AM ET, Markit will release its composite PMI and services PMI for February.
2. Salesforce Struggles; Retailers Report
The tech sector could see some weakness tomorrow after software-as-a-service giant Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) fell after hours following weak earnings and revenue guidance.
Shares were down about 3% postmarket.
Retailers dominate the earnings calendar tomorrow.
Among earnings scheduled ahead of trading,  Target  (NYSE:TGT) is expected to report a profit of $1.52 a share, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com, up from $1.37 a year ago. The consensus forecast on revenue is $22.92 billion, up 1.7% from a year ago.
Kohls (NYSE:KSS), the discount clothier, is expected to report earnings of $2.18 a share, up 16.5% from a year ago. The consensus revenue forecast is $6.66 billion, down from $6.74 billion a year ago.
Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), is expected to earn $1.13 a share, and revenue is forecast at $4.05 billion. And Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) is expected to earn 79 cents a share with revenue forecast at $1.14 billion.
Also on the calendar is Armstrong Flooring (NYSE:AFI). The forecast is for a loss of 20 cents a share. Revenue is projected at $265.9 million.
And advertising company Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (NYSE:CCO) is expected to show a loss of 1 cent a share in the fourth quarter, according to analysts polled by Investing.com, with revenue projected at $738.6 million.
3. API Crude Data Coming
Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute due Tuesday after data last week showed a sizable draw in crude inventories.
The American Petroleum Institute reported crude oil stockpiles fell by 4.2 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 22.
Crude oil futures gained 1.4% to settle at $56.59 a barrel today amid continued production cuts from OPEC and its partners, OPEC+, while growing hopes the U.S. and China are close to reaching a deal as soon as this month also boosted sentiment.
But analysts have flagged concerns that a U.S.-China trade deal may not immediately reverse the fortunes of the slowing global economy, potentially keeping oil demand on the back foot.
""While (oil) prices have been trending higher since December 2018 lows, we believe upside is ultimately limited by the modest prospects for global economic growth,"" Rob Haworth at US Bank Wealth Management said."
122,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 05:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive: OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma exploring bankruptcy - sources,"By Mike Spector, Jessica DiNapoli and Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP is exploring filing for bankruptcy to address potentially significant liabilities from roughly 2,000 lawsuits alleging the drugmaker contributed to the deadly opioid crisis sweeping the United States, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. 
The potential move shows how Purdue and its wealthy owners, the Sackler family, are under pressure to respond to mounting litigation accusing the company of misleading doctors and patients about risks associated with prolonged use of its prescription opioids.
Purdue denies the allegations, arguing that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved labels for its opioids carried warnings about the risk of abuse and misuse associated with the pain treatments.
Filing for Chapter 11 protection would halt the lawsuits and allow Purdue to negotiate legal claims with plaintiffs under the supervision of a U.S. bankruptcy judge, the sources said. 
Shares of Endo International Plc and Insys Therapeutics Inc, two companies that like Purdue have been named in lawsuits related to the U.S. opioid epidemic, closed down 17 percent and more than 2 percent, respectively, on Monday. 
More than 1,600 lawsuits accusing Purdue and other opioid manufacturers of using deceptive practices to push addictive drugs that led to fatal overdoses are consolidated in an Ohio federal court. Purdue has held discussions to resolve the litigation with plaintiffs' lawyers, who have often compared the cases to widespread lawsuits against the tobacco industry that resulted in a $246 billion settlement in 1998.
""We will oppose any attempt to avoid our claims, and will continue to vigorously and aggressively pursue our claims against Purdue and the Sackler family,"" Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said. Connecticut has a case against Purdue and the Sacklers.
BANKRUPTCY FILING NOT CERTAIN 
A Purdue bankruptcy filing is not certain, the sources said. The Stamford, Connecticut-based company has not made any final decisions and could instead continue fighting the lawsuits, they said. 
""As a privately-held company, it has been Purdue Pharma’s longstanding policy not to comment on our financial or legal strategy,"" Purdue said in a statement. 
""We are, however, committed to ensuring that our business remains strong and sustainable. We have ample liquidity and remain committed to meeting our obligations to the patients who benefit from our medicines, our suppliers and other business partners.""
Purdue faces a May trial in a case brought by Oklahoma's attorney general that, like others, accuses the company of contributing to a wave of fatal overdoses by flooding the market with highly addictive opioids while falsely claiming the drugs were safe. 
Last year, U.S. President Donald Trump also said he would like to sue drug companies over the nation's opioid crisis.
Opioids, including prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, were involved in 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017, a sixfold increase from 1999, according to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Purdue hired law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP for restructuring advice, Reuters reported in August, fueling concerns among litigants, including Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, that the company might seek bankruptcy protection before the trial. 
Companies facing widespread lawsuits sometimes seek bankruptcy protection to address liabilities in one court even when their financial condition is not dire. California utility PG&E Corp filed for bankruptcy earlier this year after deadly wildfires raised the prospect of large legal bills even though its stock remained worth billions of dollars. 
DECEPTIVE MARKETING
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey in June became the first attorney general to sue not just Purdue but Sackler family members. Records in her case, which Purdue has asked a judge to dismiss, accused Sackler family members of directing deceptive marketing of opioids for years while enriching themselves to the tune of $4.2 billion. 
Some other states have since also sued the Sacklers. The Sacklers are currently discussing creating a nonprofit backed by family financial contributions to combat addiction and drug abuse, a person familiar with their deliberations said. 
The drugmaker downplayed the possibility of a bankruptcy filing in a Feb. 22 court filing in the Oklahoma case. ""Purdue is still here - ready, willing and eager to prove in this Court that the State's claims are baseless,"" the company said in court papers. 
Sales of OxyContin and other opioids have fallen amid public concern about their addictive nature, and as restrictions on opioid prescribing have been enacted. OxyContin generated $1.74 billion in sales in 2017, down from $2.6 billion five years earlier, according to the most recent data compiled by Symphony Health Solutions.
Purdue Chief Executive Officer Craig Landau has cut hundreds of jobs, stopped marketing opioids to physicians and moved the company toward developing medications for sleep disorders and cancer since taking the helm in 2017. 
In July, Purdue appointed a new board chairman, Steve Miller, a restructuring veteran who previously held leadership positions at troubled companies including auto-parts giant Delphi and the once-teetering insurer American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG).
Mortimer D.A. Sackler no longer sits on Purdue's board, according to a filing the company made with the Connecticut secretary of state late Monday.
The Oklahoma case and other lawsuits seek damages from Purdue and other pharmaceutical companies accused of fueling the opioid crisis. In addition to lawsuits consolidated in an Ohio federal court, more than 300 cases are pending in state courts, and dozens of state attorneys general have sued manufacturers, including Purdue. 
Settlement discussions have not yet resulted in a deal. 

Purdue and three executives in 2007 pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the misbranding of OxyContin and agreed to pay a total of $634.5 million in penalties, according to court records.

Tesla also said last week its global sales would now be online-only, in a bid to cut overhead costs.

124,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 05:05PM ET</span>",Will $14.5 billion plug GE's long-term care insurance hole? Some experts say 'No',"By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co is setting aside one of the largest amounts ever to cover potential losses on policies that provide long-term care in nursing facilities and patients' homes. But insurance experts are concerned that may not be enough.
GE shocked investors last year when it took a $6.2 billion after-tax charge and said it planned to set aside $15 billion over seven years to cover claims on some 300,000 long-term care policies written more than a decade ago, when actuaries did not yet know how costly the claims would become. 
The costs, which far exceeded GE's estimates, sent its shares tumbling, spurred an investor lawsuit and prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate.
Last week, GE provided new details about its insurance and scheduled a ""teach in"" for Thursday to give more information.
GE's new reserves amount to about $55,000 per policy, in line with those of other long-term care insurers, according to an analysis for Reuters by Audit Analytics, an independent research company based in Massachusetts. 
For comparison,  Humana Inc  (NYSE:HUM) has set aside $77,282 per policy, while  Unum Group  (NYSE:UNM) has set aside $10,614, Audit Analytics said.
For a graphic, click: https://tmsnrt.rs/2EEXWt1
Those amounts are less than the cost of one year's stay in a private nursing-home room, which averages $92,376 in the United States, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said. 
GE has since cut $500 million from the $15 billion in reserves it plans to make for the policies through 2024. Its latest loss recognition test required only a $65 million after-tax charge, a sign, it said, that its estimates are on track.
But GE's disclosures and reserves have not eliminated fears that insurance could bring more pain to GE and its investors.
""I think it is impossible to know whether the $15 billion is enough,"" Joseph Belth, professor emeritus of insurance at Indiana University, who has written extensively about long-term care policies, told Reuters after reviewing GE's disclosures.
Long-term care coverage, which typically pays for in-home, assisted living or skilled nursing care, has required many insurers to boost reserves in recent years. In one rare case, regulators in 2017 placed Penn Treaty American Corp, a U.S. insurer that wrote such policies, in liquidation due to losses.
Unlike, say, fire insurance on a home, which is unlikely to pay out, most long-term care policies do pay claims eventually. Policies can be imprecise about what is covered, leaving room for legal battles that make costs hard for insurers to estimate, experts said. And policy holders or family members usually decide when and where to seek care, which made it tricky for insurers in the early days to set premiums that cover costs over time. 
""A VERY RISKY PRODUCT""
""It's very hard to put your arms around the risk,"" said Bruno Caron, a credit analyst at A.M. Best, a New Jersey-based credit rating agency that specializes in insurance companies. 
Increasing reserves generally reduces the risk of future losses, but ""sometimes reserves signal a deficiency in a block of policies that reoccurs in the same block,"" Caron said. ""We view long-term care insurance as a very risky product.""
GE said it set reserves based on assumptions that reflect its ""emerging experience"" with long-term care policies. 
Several analysts said GE is being overly optimistic. GE would need another $12 billion in reserves if it stopped assuming that generally better health means fewer people will seek care, known as ""morbidity improvement,"" and changed other favorable assumptions as some rivals have, said John Inch, an analyst at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors.
Others noted GE lost out on premium increases that rivals got by moving quickly when long-term care costs became apparent.
""They (GE) were very slow in reacting to emerging experience relative to peers,"" said Douglas Meyer, a long-term care insurance specialist and managing director at Fitch Ratings. Now GE has ""significantly less repricing flexibility"" because it cannot make up for past premium increases others received.
Two GE subsidiaries hold its long-term care insurance: Employers Reassurance Corp and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Co. Both are reinsurers, which means GE must pay out on policies that others wrote and is prevented from seeking premium rate increases directly from state insurance commissions, experts said. It is unclear how many companies that wrote the coverage have sought increase for policies in GE's portfolio, they added. 

GE said that it is working with insurers to obtain increases. Its reserve calculation anticipates about $1.7 billion in premium increases or benefit reductions, but those include increases that are not yet approved by regulators and requests for increases that have not yet been filed.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.79%. The S&P 500 lost 0.39%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.23%. The Dow had been off as many as 415 points before bargain hunters came into the market.
After months of uncertainty, the U.S. and China are close reaching a détente as soon as this month. But early investor euphoria quickly turned sour, sending stocks sharply lower, as investors questioned whether a trade deal would revive global growth as many headwinds loom, including Brexit, a potential U.S.-Europe trade war and an economic slowdown in China.
Some have argued that while a resolution to the trade war would boost global markets and prop up Chinese equities, it would do little to address some of Beijing's main economic woes. These have more to do with a rapidly modernizing economy than weakness in global trade.
Trade-sensitive stocks were mixed as Boeing (NYSE:BA) slipped 1.8%, but  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) ended the day higher.
Beyond trade, stocks were also pressured by weakness in financials and health care companies. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) was the Dow's biggest loser, off 4.1%.
Banks fell as government bond yields, which trade inversely to prices, declined amid a flight to safety.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:NYSE:C) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:NYSE:MS) fell more than 1% as 10-Year Treasury yields ended the day lower.
Falling Treasury yields are seen as a headwind for banks, reducing their net interest margin, the difference between the interest income generated by operations and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.
In tech, FAANG names proved resilient, helping to limit losses in the broader sector, led by gains in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). But Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was the odd one out, ending the day lower.
In other corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 3.2% even after the EV company said it would detail specs of its new Model Y crossover SUV next week. The Model Y would fetch a higher price tag and have ""slightly less"" range than the Model 3, Tesla's mass market vehicle, CEO Elon Musk said in a tweet on Sunday.
On the economic front, there was little to cheer as construction spending for December undershot economists' forecasts, adding to concerns about a slowdown in the economy amid a string of downbeat data seen in recent weeks.
December’s report capped a year in which ""total outlays grew 4.1% and ""(r)esidential spending increased just 3.3% for the year, the slowest pace since 2011 amid sluggish home-building activity,"" Wells Fargo said.

127,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 04:30PM ET</span>","Wall Street drops after weak data, healthcare slump","By Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes fell on Monday, weighed down by a weak U.S. construction spending report and declines in healthcare shares, as an initial rally on optimism over a U.S.-China trade deal faded.
U.S. construction spending unexpectedly fell in December as investment in both private and public projects dropped, leading economists to expect that the government will trim its economic growth estimate for the fourth quarter.
Before turning negative, stocks had climbed following a report that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could reach a formal trade deal at a summit around March 27.
Optimism over the world's two largest economies reaching a trade truce already has been a significant factor fuelling the market's rally since late December, along with investors' belief that the Federal Reserve will not be aggressive in raising interest rates. The S&P 500 remains up more than 11 percent in 2019.
""There has been a pricing in of this expectation throughout the early months of 2019, which is partly why you have had such a bullish market,” said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York.
""The market expects a trade deal with China, so there is a little bit of sell on the news here,"" added Levine, who said stocks ultimately could still move higher on a trade deal.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 206.67 points, or 0.79 percent, to 25,819.65, the S&P 500 lost 10.88 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,792.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 17.79 points, or 0.23 percent, to 7,577.57.
Levine and other market watchers also pointed to the 2,800 level for the S&P 500 as a key technical level. The benchmark index rose as high as 2,816.88 during the session.
“You’d have to point the finger (for the market's drop) at the China trade negotiations and the fact that we hit technical resistance again at 2,800 on the S&P 500,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
Healthcare, which has underperformed this year, was the biggest declining major S&P 500 sector, sinking 1.3 percent. Shares of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) fell 4.1 percent, weighing on the Dow, while shares of other health insurers also fell sharply.
In healthcare news, Reuters reported that OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP is exploring filing for bankruptcy to address potentially significant liabilities from lawsuits alleging the company contributed to the opioid crisis, sending shares of some publicly-traded sellers of opioid pain treatments lower.
Still, indexes finished above their session lows. Materials rose 0.44 percent, the most among the S&P 500 sectors.
In corporate news, AT&T (NYSE:T) shares fell 2.7 percent as the company is restructuring its WarnerMedia business, according to a memo sent to employees on Monday and seen by Reuters.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.62-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 83 new highs and 32 new lows.

About 7.9 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 7.3 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

128,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 04:30PM ET</span>","Barrick CEO Brushes Aside Newmont Rebuff, Says He'll Make Offer","(Bloomberg) -- Barrick Gold Corp. plans to proceed with a formal takeover offer for  Newmont Mining  Corp (NYSE:NEM)., undeterred by Monday’s rejection by the target company’s board.
Newmont’s board unanimously rejected Barrick’s $17.8 billion unsolicited proposal, saying it would not be better than Newmont’s previously announced takeover of Goldcorp Inc. Instead, Newmont submitted a joint venture proposal to Barrick that would encompass the two companies’ Nevada operations.
Barrick is “definitely not” going to withdraw the hostile bid, Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow said in a telephone interview. Barrick will take its offer to Newmont shareholders, and at same time will try to advance talks about the Nevada joint venture, according to Bristow. “Time is of the essence,” adding that Barrick plans top speak to Newmont “ASAP,” he said.
Omar Jabara, a spokesman for Newmont, said by email that “we look forward to hearing back from Barrick on our letter and joint venture proposal.”
Newmont had raised serious doubts about Toronto-based Barrick’s full merger proposal -- a hostile all-share no-premium bid -- from the day it was made public Feb. 25. Newmont said its previously announced agreement to take over Goldcorp offered better benefits, and Goldberg called Barrick’s takeover offer “desperate” and “bizarre.”
“We can deliver the value from the Goldcorp transaction and we can work with Barrick to deliver the value from the synergy potential in Nevada,” Tom Palmer, who will succeed Gary Goldberg as the next Newmont chief executive officer, said on an investor call.
‘Relevant Metrics’
“The combination with Goldcorp is significantly more accretive to Newmont’s shareholders on all relevant metrics compared to Barrick’s proposal, even when factoring in Barrick’s own synergy estimates,” Goldberg said in the statement.
Barrick has no intention of raising its offer, a person familiar with the matter said last week.
The top end of the gold industry has been in a state of transformation -- in September, industry leader Barrick agreed to buy  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) Ltd. for $5.4 billion. Three months later, Newmont announced its plan to purchase for $10 billion, which would leapfrog it into the leading gold-producer spot.
Barrick said that a joint venture between the company and Newmont in Nevada wouldn’t accomplish the benefits that come with combining the two biggest gold producers.
‘Better Job’
“Barrick’s experience with Newmont as a joint venture partner suggests that is not a transaction that would maximize value for either party,” Barrick said in its updated presentation on its website. “As a result, negotiations with Newmont over the years have not been fruitful and do not give us confidence that a suitable JV or similar transaction can be implemented.”
Under its agreement with Goldcorp, Newmont is barred from engaging with Barrick on its takeover bid after the board has determined that it’s not a “superior proposal,” Newmont said in its statement.
‘Getting Both’
Asked if Newmont would consider a higher bid by Barrick for a full merger, Goldberg said in a phone interview Monday after the conference call that Newmont prefers to push forward with both the Goldcorp deal and a possible Barrick JV in Nevada instead.
“We believe getting both is the best for our shareholders,” he said.
Bristow said in a statement Monday afternoon that Newmont’s proposal “reinforced the frustration Barrick has experienced in its efforts to unlock the value in the two companies’ assets in Nevada.”
“Newmont’s latest proposal is essentially based on the stale and convoluted process that foundered previously,” Bristow said. “As usual, it comes with unrealistic preconditions including swapping the chairmanship and the leadership of the JV. Experience has shown us that JVs only work well when the majority owner is also the operator.”
Newmont shares rose 2 percent to $34.49 at 3:59 p.m. in New York, while Barrick gained 1.9 percent to $12.55.
‘Poor Record’
“Since previous merger discussions terminated in 2014, Newmont has significantly outperformed Barrick on almost every metric,” Goldberg said in a letter Monday to Bristow and Barrick Executive Chairman John Thornton. “Our management team has a consistent, long-standing track record of delivering superior execution,” he wrote. “In contrast, Barrick’s underperformance highlights its ineffective operating model, poor record on delivering stockholder returns, and significant jurisdictional risk.”
“Mark has never run a global portfolio,” Goldberg said in a Feb. 25 interview, referring to Barrick CEO Mark Bristow, who until Jan. 1 ran Africa-focused Randgold. “In fact, I’d say none of his team have run a global portfolio like what we have in place.”
On the same day, Bristow said his team could do a better job running his rival.
“I have spent a lot of time in Nevada, and I have no doubt that I can do a better job than Newmont,” Bristow said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.

129,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 04:10PM ET</span>","As Wall Street Frets, Mom and Pop Dip Toes Back Into Stocks","(Bloomberg) -- Trade hopes. Fed doves. Earnings growth. Whatever the reason, investors on Main Street appear ready to go where many on Wall Street still fear to tread.
The latest data from TD Ameritrade suggest mom and pop increased their exposure to U.S. equity indexes for the first time in five months in February. They continued to move away from single stock exposure, even as share-picking strategies outperformed in the late cycle environment.
The signal is weak -- retail investors remained net equity sellers overall -- but suggests emerging confidence that the broad rally may have room to run. That’s a stark contrast to the actions of the so-called fast money, which has remained stubbornly contemptuous of the 2019 gains.
“They think the market’s going higher, but because of the uncertainty of tariffs, they don’t necessarily want to pick individual winners and losers,” Joe “JJ” Kinahan, the chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said by phone. “They’re much bigger buyers of the overall market than they are of the individual equities.”
The positioning shift is all the more notable because the S&P 500 Index averaged 2,752.33 in February, the highest since October. The gauge fell to 2,786.42 as of 2:49 p.m. in New York, erasing almost all of Friday’s gain.
After years of outflows from active funds and inflows to passive investment vehicles, evidence earlier this year had showed investors increasingly turning to stock picking. But the TD Ameritrade data isn’t the only sign of a return to the norm: In the week ended Feb. 22, Bank of America’s private clients sold single stocks for the first time in 2019, while buying exchange-traded funds.
As TD Ameritrade’s Investor Movement Index posted the first monthly gain since September, data also showed users of the brokerage platform scooped up popular broad equity market ETFs such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (AX:SPY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1, according to Kinahan. Clients also bought fixed-income products, the firm said in a statement.
“With earnings season at our backs, it will be interesting to see how economic data, geopolitical events and headline news impacts the momentum we started seeing in February,” Kinahan wrote."

131,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 03:21PM ET</span>","Newmont rejects Barrick's buyout offer, proposes Nevada JV","(Reuters) -  Newmont Mining  Corp (NYSE:NEM) rejected rival Barrick Gold Corp's $18 billion buyout offer on Monday, but proposed a joint venture in Nevada instead, a deal worth billions that would create a major operator in the largest U.S. gold-producing region.
Both the buyout rejection and the JV proposal were expected.
""Barrick's egocentric proposal is designed to transfer value from Newmont's shareholders to Barrick,"" Newmont's chief executive, Gary Goldberg, said on an investor call.
In a statement later on Monday, Barrick CEO Mark Bristow said the JV proposal was ""stale and convoluted"" and that both companies' Nevada assets would be better run by a single company. 
""We know we can do that more efficiently than Newmont and that it will be worth a lot more to both Newmont and Barrick shareholders under that scenario,"" Bristow said. He did not directly respond to Newmont's rejection of the buyout offer.
The proposed Barrick deal would combine two of the biggest gold producers in the world at a time when both companies are trying to bolster shrinking gold reserves to boost growth as well as take advantage of rising prices.
Newmont said its Canadian rival's all-stock offer was not in the best interest of its shareholders as it was offered at a discount.
Barrick's offer of 2.5694 common shares for each Newmont share was equivalent to about $33 per share, which represented a discount of $3.48 to Newmont's closing price on Feb. 22, the last trading day before the offer was announced.
Newmont shares have fallen about 6 percent since Barrick's offer.
Newmont on Monday reiterated its plans to go ahead with its deal to buy smaller rival Goldcorp Inc, which it said is significantly more accretive to its shareholders compared with Barrick's proposal.
""Barrick has described their proposal as an unprecedented value-creation opportunity, yet it is inferior to the Newmont-Goldcorp transaction,"" Goldberg said. Bristow ""has yet to prove he can successfully manage"" a global mining company, he added. 
Bristow joined Barrick two months ago, after it bought Africa-focused  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS). That deal set off a fresh wave of bids in the mining industry, including Newmont's offer for smaller miner Goldcorp, which put the Colorado-based firm on track to become the world's biggest gold producer, ahead of Barrick. 
NEVADA JOINT VENTURE
Newmont has 19 mines and processing facilities in Nevada, which are adjacent to Barrick's operations. The logic of combining the companies' Nevada assets seems clear to both sides, but the sticking point is control.
Bristow in an interview last week said he is frustrated that Barrick has to ""drive trucks past ... processing plants in Nevada because Gary won't share with me,"" calling it a waste of money that would be saved if the assets were combined.
Under Newmont's JV proposal, Barrick would hold a 55 percent stake in the new entity, while both companies would have equal representation in the management and technical committees to make operational and financial decisions.
That proposal sets ""unrealistic preconditions,"" Bristow said on Monday, saying that ""experience has shown us that JVs only work well when the majority owner is also the operator.""
Neither side seems to agree on the full value of the Nevada assets. Newmont's JV proposal uses publicly available materials to estimate value, as neither side has sat down to formally hash out how a JV could work.

Barrick's shares were up about 1 percent at C$16.55 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Newmont's shares rose less than 1 percent to $34.06 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Investing.com - If you're a follower of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, you have to like the index's 10%-plus gain this year.
But watch the biggest driver of the Dow's run-up, Boeing (NYSE:BA). The aerospace giant closed Friday at $440.62, but was down 2.4% Monday afternoon. The Dow was slumping as well.
As of Friday, Boeing was up 36.6% for the year. The next-closest performer was  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), up 22%. But there's a difference. Boeing hit nine 52-week highs in the month of February alone. IBM is still trading 14% below its 52-week high.
A break in Boeing makes the Dow vulnerable to a nasty pullback because the Dow is a price-weighted index. The higher the price, the bigger its impact. Boeing's 2.4% decline Monday knocked 72 points out of the Dow -- 21% of the total. The biggest percentage loser, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), off more than 4%, cost the Dow 60 points.
In fact, Boeing's gain 2019 gain through Friday represented 30% of the Dow's 11.6% rise. Take Boeing out and the Dow was up only 8.1%.
At current levels, Boeing is looking pricey, according to technical measures.
And analysts surveyed by Investing.com have a price target on the stock of $443.75, barely a blip above Friday's close. Nineteen of 24 analysts surveyed believe the stock will outperform, which it already has in spades this year.
True, Boeing has a lot of good things going for it. It's tops in passenger-aircraft manufacturing. China hasn't targeted Boeing for higher tariffs and demand for air transportation in China is expected to be solid for the next 20 years.
Europe's Airbus Group (PA:AIR) is reeling after orders for its huge A380 jet have nearly disappeared. And Boeing has a huge defense business.
But Boeing's stock price is an issue for Dow watchers. Keep an eye on it."

138,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 02:15PM ET</span>",GM set to end production at Ohio plant Wednesday,"(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Monday it expects to end production of the Chevrolet Cruze at its Lordstown, Ohio assembly plant on Wednesday, the first of five plants it is idling this year in North America.
A GM spokesman said the company is ""ahead of the production schedule"" and added that production had been scheduled to end Friday ""but now it looks like it will finish up Cruze production on Wednesday.""
Last week, the United Auto Workers union sued GM over its decision to end production and eliminate thousands of jobs U.S. auto plants, saying it violated a 2015 collective bargaining agreement.
The UAW has asked a federal judge to order GM to rescind its November decision to close three plants in Michigan, Ohio and Maryland, and award damages to employees for losses from what the UAW calls GM’s breach of contract.
GM said last week that its decisions to halt production “do not violate the provisions of the UAW-GM National Agreement. We continue to work with the UAW on solutions to our business challenges.""
GM said in November it was cutting up to 15,000 jobs and ending production at five plants in North America, including one in Canada. Last month, GM said it extended production at its Detroit Hamtramck plant until January 2020, after earlier saying it planned to discontinue production in June.
The job cuts have angered U.S. President Donald Trump, who has demanded GM find a replacement product for its Lordstown plant and threatened to cut GM subsidies.

The UAW said GM will end production at its White Marsh plant in Maryland on May 3 and at its Warren Transmission plant in Michigan on Aug. 1. GM's Oshawa assembly plant in Canada's Ontario province is set to end production by the end of the year.

142,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 02:00PM ET</span>",French grid operator readies hard Brexit day-ahead power auction plan,"PARIS (Reuters) - French electricity grid operator RTE has prepared an auction mechanism which would permit continuity in day-ahead electricity auctions between Britain and France in case there is no deal for Britain to leave the European Union on March 29. 
RTE said in a note to power market participants it had submitted market terms and conditions to the French energy market regulator CRE, and would be able to implement the new terms of the auction from March 30.
It added that a no-deal Brexit would have no impact on yearly, monthly and intraday France-England power capacity auctions because the auctions are carried out on a bilateral platform dedicated to the French-English border.
Day-ahead delivery auctions, would be impacted however, the grid operator said.
A hard Brexit risks pushing Britain's day-ahead electricity price higher because it would lose access to a wider European power market where it can source cheap power produced elsewhere from any of the 28-member states in the bloc.
The European Commission said in April last year electricity market operators based in Britain will become third country operators and will no longer be entitled to carry out market coupling services in the EU.
The market coupling service allows Britain to buy electricity produced from any of the 28 member states. 

Britain warned operators of electrical power links with Europe in October they will need to set up alternative trading arrangements if it leaves the EU with no exit deal.

143,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 01:35PM ET</span>",BlackRock makes case to own more U.S. TIPS,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, on Monday recommended investors hold more U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) as the Federal Reserve is expected to refrain from raising short-term interest rates in the coming months.
The U.S. central bank also signaled it is open to allowing inflation to rise above its 2 percent goal to compensate for years that it has missed that desired target level, the company's global chief investment strategist Richard Turnill said.
""The Fed has confirmed its intent to be patient with its next rate move and may let inflation temporarily breach its 2 percent target,"" Turnill wrote in a research note. ""Along with a slowing but growing economy, we believe this makes TIPS an attractive alternative to nominal bonds.""
So far in 2019, TIPS have produced a total return of 1.08 percent, compared with a 0.06 percent loss among regular Treasury bonds, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
Inflation expectations, as measured by the difference between the yields of TIPS and regular Treasuries known as breakeven rate, have recovered from their dramatic drop in late 2018, as investors lost confidence about the economy due to trade tensions between China and the United States.
Investors had also grown worries about further rate hikes from the Fed before policy-makers took a dovish shift at their policy meeting in late January.
The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate fell to 1.69 percent at the start of the year before touching 1.96 percent last Friday, which was its highest level in nearly three months, Tradeweb data showed.
To be sure, TIPS would lose their relative attractiveness to regular Treasuries if the U.S. economy slips into a recession and the Federal Reserve were to begin cutting interest rates, which Turnill said were unlikely to happen in 2019.
Investors have shifted $430 million back into TIPS-focused funds so far this year after withdrawing some $4.8 billion from them in the final quarter of 2018, according to data firm Lipper.

""We see potential for TIPS to play a valuable role in portfolios in the near term,"" Turnill wrote.

144,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>",Bill Gross Is Right That It’s Tougher to Outperform,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Bill Gross, the former bond king, may be officially retired, but he had one final warning for those still managing money: You’ll never outperform the way he did in his heyday at Pacific Investment Management Co.
To be clear, this isn’t his ego talking. In a conversation with Bloomberg News’s Erik Schatzker, Gross said that markets have changed, becoming so much more efficient that virtually no wagers are surefire ways to get ahead and generate so-called alpha. Here are a few ways he said he outperformed both his benchmark and his peers over the years, without necessarily any “brilliance” on his part:
Gross says he used to pounce when banks introduced new credit products because they inevitably were poorly understood and traded at discounts to intrinsic value. The first few years of mortgage bonds in the 1970s are an example.
“Investors basically wouldn’t touch them,” he said. “Our accounting department, they didn’t know how to segregate the principal and the interest, and there were complaints aplenty. I said, ‘Come on, get over it!’ because these things were so cheap. We got in early.”
Similarly, Pimco was a big buyer of Treasury futures in the 1980s. Clients heard “futures” and asked, “Is this like soybeans? Are you trading corn?” Gross recalled. As a result, the spreads between the cash and futures markets were unusually wide and created a “sort of riskless arbitrage.”
Gross said those opportunities are gone now, for a few reasons. First, the era of easy money from global central banks has suppressed interest rates, yield spreads and volatility, making any dislocations few and far between. Banks had already pushed the envelope on derivatives and other structured products, and in a post-crisis world have little incentive to innovate much further. And the rise in high-speed quantitative strategies has made riskless arbitrage largely a thing of the past — though the data-crunching computers do occasionally suffer from the same weaknesses as humans.
All of this makes sense intutively (no one assumes futures are limited to agricultural commodities anymore). But is it true that alpha is getting harder to come by?
A report from Morningstar Inc. suggests the answer is yes. In its semiannual “Active/Passive Barometer”(1) released last month, the research firm found that “actively managed funds have failed to survive and beat their benchmarks, especially over longer time horizons.” In 2018 specifically, their success rate fell relative to 2017 in 16 of 20 asset classes. Overall, just 35 percent of active managers outperformed.
In the fixed-income market, a mere 29 percent of corporate-bond and high-yield funds were deemed successful in 2018, dropping off from their 2017 success rate by more than just about any other asset class. Their 10-year track records show they beat a composite of passive funds more than 50 percent of the time. Morningstar noted that “active bond funds have been buoyed by bets on riskier corporate bonds, which had performed well in recent years but faltered in 2018.”
Indeed, some of the top managers of “unconstrained funds” like the one Gross ran at Janus Henderson Group Plc simply loaded up on riskier debt and coasted to lofty returns as yield spreads tightened. Mike Swell, who co-manages the Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Strategic Income Fund, once told me that “a lot of people have gotten rich being lazy long in credit.” His fund didn’t, instead taking bets on differentials in currencies and interest rates. It trailed most peers for years. This year, it’s beating 79 percent of them, Bloomberg data show.
At the same time, such wild swings in performance don’t exactly inspire confidence among investors. Gross knows this firsthand, given the massive withdrawals from his unconstrained fund last year. He told Schatzker that he “became a risk taker, but not necessarily measured,” when he shifted away from a total-return strategy.
But if active bond managers just add more higher-yielding debt than their benchmarks, that doesn’t feel sustainable either. The sharp underperformance in 2018 proves that. Last year’s sell-off wasn’t even that large by historical standards: The yield spread on an index of high-yield bonds reached a peak of 531 basis points on Dec. 27. By comparison, the spread reached 839 basis points in February 2016, 876 basis points in October 2011 and 1,971 basis points in December 2008.
That’s not to say passive funds fare much better in times of market stress. But in general, they’re expected to hold more liquid, benchmark securities that could hold up better. And, more important, they have much smaller management costs. The narrative has shifted so far in favor of low-fee products as investors learn how much a few extra basis points can cost in the long run. I’ve written before about the grim outlook for active managers because of this trend, which Moody’s Investors Service said is like the migration to mobile phones from landlines. 
Interestingly, Morningstar’s report found that the cheapest 20 percent of active funds succeeded about twice as often as the most expensive 20 percent over the past 10 years, showing both the benefit of lower fees and that more cost-efficient funds survived the decade. “Cost matters. Fees are the one of the best predictors of future fund performance,” the authors of the report said.
Active managers will hate to hear it, but in a market devoid of alpha-generating opportunities, the easiest, most risk-free way to juice returns is probably continuing to chip away at fees. 
(1) For those interested in the methodology, this is from Morningstar: ""Our `benchmark' for measuring success is different than others'.We measure active managers’ success relative to investable passive alternatives in the same Morningstar Category. ... We believe that this is a better benchmark because it reflects the performance of actual investable options and not an index."""

The company said it does not expect to report any material changes to its 2018 financial results that were previously reported on Feb. 13, but needs to carry out further evaluation of its internal controls over both its revenue recording procedures and for measuring the fair value of Level 3's assets and liabilities.
Shares fell 9.5%.
The downbeat day for CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) adds to losses sustained following the release of mixed fourth-quarter results in February. The company beat on earnings, but revenue missed estimates from Investing.com as its legacy consumer business, which accounts for about a fifth of total revenues, continued to weigh. CenturyLink also slashed its dividend.
""While we see the dividend cut as necessary, the announcement came much sooner than expected given management's assurances on the prior earnings call,"" CFRA, an independent research provider, said following the dividend cut.
CenturyLink acquired Level 3 in Nov. 2017 for $34 billion to expand its reach in the business communications market and compete against AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). But synergies from the acquisition have been slow to take shape.
This was not unexpected, with CenturyLink highlighting, at time of completing the acquisition, a number of risks that could delay the anticipated benefits from the tie-up, including higher-than-expected costs to integrate Level 3, rising competition and lower demand for CenturyLink's legacy offerings."

While the Chinese e-commerce giant has inked deals with U.S. companies including Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co to sell products in China through its online marketplace Tmall.com, the deal with Office Depot marks Alibaba.com's first business-to-business collaboration with a major U.S. company.
The partnership would give Alibaba access to Office Depot's 10 million customers and 1,800 sales agents.
Alibaba would also be able to take advantage of Office Depot's distribution network that offers next day delivery in the United States, the companies said in a joint statement.
Office Depot's customers will also get access to Alibaba's global network of over 150,000 suppliers to find more product options or a reputed manufacturer to produce their goods.
For instance, a cutlery maker with a special design can find a factory to make it, which can be sold to restaurants or retailers across the world using Alibaba.com platform, John Caplan, head of North America B2B at Alibaba Group, said in an interview with Reuters.
The deal is aimed at shortening delivery time, besides giving small and medium U.S. businesses opportunities to sell beyond the United States through Alibaba.com.
""This is a great catalyst for growth for small and medium businesses in the United States. We believe it is going to save them time, it is going to save them money,"" Office Depot Chief Executive Officer Gerry Smith told Reuters.
The partnership comes as Office Depot struggles to boost sales amid severe competition from e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). It is now focusing on selling business services to their customers, rather than relying on its traditional business of selling office supplies. 
Office Depot's business-to-business sales have grown to become its largest revenue generator in 2018, while its retail sales have declined in the last two years.

Shares of Office Depot were up about 1 percent, while shares of Alibaba were up 1.4 percent.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union regulators are studying how the car repairs market works following demands from customers for more competition, but have not opened a case, the bloc's antitrust chief said on Monday.
The study will look at carmakers including  Renault  (PA:RENA), Jaguar Land Rover, Peugeot and software vendor Accenture (NYSE:ACN), European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told reporters.
She said interest was triggered by car owners who want more competition and the opportunity to be able to use other repairers or garages than those certified for their cars.
""It is not an investigation, it is not a case but it is sort of part of our market supervision also in this area. We want to get a sense of this market again because this is very much about data. You can access the data to service the car,"" she said.
Renault, Jaguar Land Rover, Peugeot and other carmakers have increased revenues by more than $1 billion in the past decade by using sophisticated pricing software, sales presentations prepared by Accenture and other documents filed in a court case have shown.
The software works by identifying which spare parts in a manufacturer's range customers would be content to pay more for, how much to raise prices by and which prices should not be hiked, Accenture told prospective clients.
Accenture has denied its software was unfair to motorists and said its focus was on increasing efficiency for its clients.
Renault, Jaguar Land Rover and Peugeot said their pricing strategies for spare parts were legal, did not take advantage of car owners and were focused on efficiency and ensuring availability for motorists.

France's competition regulator said last year it had examined the software and did not see a reason to open a full antitrust investigation, without explaining its thinking.

LONDON (Reuters) - Top  Barclays  (LON:BARC) executives worried that investors in the bank's 2008 emergency fundraising would go ""nuts"" if Qatar was given a better deal unfairly, a London court heard on Monday. 
Richard Boath, one of four former Barclays bosses on trial over fraud charges, told the bank's former Middle East head Roger Jenkins that they had to be careful to ensure the legality of a plan to pay Qatar extra fees it was demanding in the form of a separate advisory agreement.
""We can't do a capital markets transaction in which we give one set of fees to one set of investors, and a different set of economics for another set of investors because if they found out they'd go nuts,"" Boath said he told Jenkins in a recording of a 2014 interview with Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) played to the jury.
An unfairly preferential deal could also have risked trouble for the executives who planned it, Boath said he told Jenkins.
""He said well fuck that I am not taking a hit to save John and Bob's jobs,"" Boath reported Jenkins as replying, referring to Barclays' former chief executive John Varley and former investment banking chief Bob Diamond.
The SFO contends that Boath, Jenkins, Varley and former head of wealth management Tom Kalaris misled shareholders and other investors by not disclosing that Barclays paid an extra 322 million pounds ($424 million) to Qatar through so-called ""advisory service agreements"" (ASAs) at the height of the credit crisis.
All four men, the most senior to face a criminal trial over crisis-era conduct, deny wrongdoing. Qatar has not been accused of any misconduct. Diamond is not involved in the trial.
The agreements were entirely legal and authorized by the bank's internal and external lawyers, board and compliance department, Kalaris said last week in a prepared statement read out to the jury by prosecutors.
Boath likewise on Monday said in recorded statements played to jurors that, after raising concerns about the ASAs, he became comfortable that they were legal and approved by the relevant authorities within the bank.
The prosecution alleges that concerns about the deal expressed by the defendants show they thought or knew what they were doing was wrong. Whereas the bankers say it just shows they were being careful to remain within the rules. 
China Development bank and Singapore's Temasek were among the other investors in the eventual deals in 2008 that meant Barclays avoided a state bailout, unlike rivals Lloyds (LON:LLOY) and Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS).
The trial continues this week.

157,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 11:15AM ET</span>",Rating appeal casts harsh light on Romania decision-making,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - To its critics, Romania's bid to overturn an expected cut in the S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) outlook on its prized investment grade rating suggests it rushed into major tax reforms without fully considering the impact on its reputation with markets.
To its admirers, the appeal is a laudable initiative to avoid a downgrade that would be damaging to the country.
Whatever the truth, an appeal against ratings rulings is a rarely-tried tactic by governments these days, and experts say Romania's decision to take that path raises questions about how the government got itself into a predicament that could easily have been avoided.
Romania lodged its appeal on the basis that its budget plans, which include controversial bank and energy sector taxes that have riled markets and could have a negative impact on its central bank, are still to be finalised.
The prime minister's economic adviser and former finance minister, Darius Valcov, called it a ""good move"" to make the appeal which buys it two weeks of time. It certainly will be if it turns out to be one of the roughly 1-in-3 of issuers who succeed in their appeals. 
But it also raises questions about how things got this far, whether it could have been avoided and how much the picture can really change in S&P's eyes in the next two weeks.
European Union rules introduced back in 2014 mean that rating agencies now have to tell governments at the start of each year exactly when they will carry out their reviews. 
That means it is harder for finance ministries to claim relevant information has been ignored and is one of the main reasons why there have only been a handful of appeals in the last five years since the rules were brought in.
""If the decision is upheld, not only would the sovereign face a downgrade, but it would also be known publicly that it failed in its appeal,"" said S&P's former head of sovereign ratings Moritz Kraemer.
The last ones to have tried to appeal have been Liechtenstein, Cape Verde and Guernsey, S&P says.
Romania's situation is somewhat unusual though. It has been hounded for its tax plans which the government had said were intended to help improve living standards and lower borrowing costs. 
BORROWING COSTS
Bucharest's stock market, heavy on banks and energy firms, plunged almost 20 percent though after their announcement in December and the European Central Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development both voiced their criticism.
However, just days before S&P's announcement was due and when the decision was already likely to have been made by its rating 'committee', Romania's Finance Minister, Eugen Teodorovici, said publicly that there could be some key changes to tax plans.
It may have been that possibility that saw S&P accept the appeal which has given the government two weeks' breathing space.
S&P's presumed move would have been to cut the country's outlook to negative from stable. While it is not a full downgrade, Romania's position on the bottom rung of investment grade leaves it vulnerable. 
Statistically, rating firms say 1-in-3 of the negative outlooks they apply end up turning into a downgrade and that can be painful.
A 2016 World Bank study, found that being cut to 'junk' by at least two of the major ratings agencies increases a country’s short term borrowing costs by almost 200 basis points on average. 
A big portion of that move tends to happen with the first cut too, as big investment and mutual funds that only buy investment grade quality bonds tend to sell anything that is at getting close to being downgraded.
""In our view they (tax plans) should just be repealed completely,"" said the Franklin Templeton's Romania CEO Johan Meyer, who manages Fondul Proprietatea, a listed closed-end fund which has stakes in many state-owned firms. 

""It is the most damaging issue we have seen in Romania for a while.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Laura Hirsch of Keller Texas had to find a rehabilitation center to help her father recover from a difficult surgery in September, the caregiving service Cariloop saved her a whole day.
A case manager at Cariloop, based in Richardson, Texas, sorted through more than a dozen rehab facility options, then armed Hirsch with the right questions to ask when choosing among the final contenders. 
Hirsch, 55, saved time, and was also grateful to be relieved of the emotional burden of visiting subpar facilities to cross them off the list. 
""She saved me all of that,"" said Hirsch, a private customer who pays $600 a year to Cariloop. The benefit of such a service is now starting to draw many companies to offer caregiving services to employees. 
In addition to Cariloop, companies such as Wellthy and Torchlight provide caregiving coordination and support. Others offer short-term backup care for both children and adults, including Care.com's Care@Work program. 
 Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) signed up with Care@Work after an in-house survey showed the thing employees wanted most was flexibility to care for sick loved ones. 
The Care@Work platform gives workers access to backup care from Care.com's vetted providers, along with a senior care concierge service. The employer typically covers the subscription cost and subsidizes per-use care cost, said Sheila Marcelo, founder and CEO of Care.com.
Best Buy also implemented paid caregiver leave of up to four weeks for loved ones. Last week, the Richfield, Minnesota based company announced it is rolling out paid time off for part-time workers. 
""People are able to spend the final days of a parent's life with them, and they wouldn't have been able to do that otherwise,"" said Melanie Moriarty, a senior director in human resources at Best Buy. ""We hear so many heartwarming stories.""
CONCIERGE HELP
At News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA)., backup childcare is provided by Bright Horizons, which also includes an eldercare component. 
Because that benefit was limited to just the caregiving, the company added access to Wellthy this year for a concierge caregiving approach. 
""One of the hardest parts is logistics. If you are suddenly in a position to figure out schedules, doctors, pharmacy and transportation needs - most of it is out of the skill set of the individual,"" said Marco Diaz, senior vice president, global head of benefits at  News Corp.  
A service like Wellthy will step in and help a family coordinate caregiving. While an employee can call up with something as simple as finding an allergist, the biggest impact is dealing with complex care situations like dementia, said Wellthy founder and CEO Lindsay Jurist-Rosner. 
Much of the coordination is app based, with a shared dashboard family members can access to see things like dosages, appointment times and test results. 
Wellthy has been serving corporate customers since 2016 and reaches about 200,000 employees collectively. Private pay costs $300 for six months. An independent care manager can run about $150 per hour, by contrast. 
MEASURING RESULTS
Torchlight, based in Burlington, Massachusetts, assesses its value to 100 or so corporate clients in costs saved through efficiency. Clients include Alameda Health System, Dell, TripAdvisor and AmGen, with the service accessible to more than 1 million employees in the United States. About 10 to 12 percent of employees open a case, the company said.
Case managers can steer clients toward services in the public domain for special needs children, for example, and deal with insurance coverage, said Adam Golderg, Torchlight's founder and CEO. One financial services company estimated it saved about $400,000 in cost offsets, Goldberg added. 
Cariloop measures its impact through the time it saves for clients, which they could then use to be more productive at work. 
""If it takes us one hour to do something, it would take the client four,"" said Cariloop CEO Michael Walsh. 
So if you have an employee making $75,000 a year and you save them 48 hours of time over six months, that's nearly $2,000. If you are a law firm with partners earning $500 an hour, the cost savings would go way up, Walsh said. 
For a family, the emotional help can offer the greatest value. Hirsch is about to go on a cruise, one week she takes every year with friends. 

""If something happens with my father, my daughter can step in, and she can pull up all this information - his will, powers of attorney, medications, anything that is important to him,"" Hirsch said. ""It's huge.""

A report by The New Yorker out Monday said that Trump told Gary Cohn, then the Director of the National Economic Council, to ""intervene"" in the deal in a meeting in 2017.
Cohn reportedly stormed out of the meeting. 
In the summer of 2017 the president reportedly called Cohn in for an Oval Office meeting with newly-appointed chief of staff John Kelly, who has also since left the administration.
An unnamed source told the publication that Trump said in exasperation to Kelly ""I’ve been telling Cohn to get this lawsuit filed and nothing’s happened!
""I’ve mentioned it fifty times. And nothing’s happened. I want to make sure it’s filed. I want that deal blocked!’”
New Yorker writer Jane Mayer said Cohn, a former president of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), understood that it would be ""highly improper"" for the president to undermine two of the most powerful companies in the US ""as a reward for a competing news organization that boosted him.""
Mayer noted that News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) owner Rupert Murdoch opposed the Time Warner-AT&T merger as ""a matter of shrewd business.""
She continued: ""Trump also opposed the deal, but many people suspected that his objection was a matter of petty retaliation against CNN.""
The source told the New Yorker that Cohn stormed out of the meeting, telling Kelly ""Don’t you f---ing dare call the Justice Department. We are not going to do business that way.”
Despite the president’s reported hostility to the deal, a federal judge last June approved AT&T's $85 billion merger with Time Warner, which owns CNN among a range of other media brands.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) is restructuring its WarnerMedia business, according to a memo sent to employees on Monday and seen by Reuters, as it girds for a streaming video battle with Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. 
The restructuring comes ahead of an anticipated round of significant layoffs and cost cuts and right after the resignation of two high-profile executives - Richard Plepler, the head of HBO and David Levy, president of Turner Broadcasting.
AT&T, which cleared its last regulatory hurdle last week after winning an appeals court decision challenging its $85 billion deal to buy Time Warner, aims to reinvest savings into its programming businesses. It will launch an early version of its HBO-led subscription video streaming service late this year.
Traditional media companies are playing catch-up to Netflix, which has built a 150-million subscriber, global direct-to-consumer video streaming service by spending heavily on Hollywood television and movie talent.
Disney, which paid $71 billion to buy Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's film and television assets, is also set to launch its Disney+ streaming service by the end of 2019.
AT&T shares opened down 1.2 percent at $30.44 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
""At a time when we must shift our investment focus to develop more content for specific and demanding audiences on emerging platforms, we can't sustain a model where we invest one dollar more than necessary in the administrative aspects of running our business,"" WarnerMedia Chief Executive Officer John Stankey said in the memo. ""Put simply, our priority is to direct resources to product development and innovation."" 
Robert Greenblatt, a former executive at Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp's NBCUniversal unit, will oversee premium cable network HBO, cable channels TNT, TBS, Tru TV and the upcoming video streaming service as chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment.
CNN chief Jeff Zucker will add oversight of sports programming across the company as chairman of News and Sports. 
Kevin Tsujihara will continue to run Warner Bros Hollywood and TV studios and add two new businesses to his responsibilities, including a newly created kids and young adult group.
The overhaul will bring together kids programming from across the company, including storied franchises Hanna-Barbera and Loony Tunes. Tsujihara will also oversee the licensed consumer products business across the company. 

WarnerMedia has also consolidated advertising sales and affiliate sales under one division to be run by Gerhard Zeiler, newly appointed chief revenue officer. Zeiler was president of Turner International.

165,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 09:35AM ET</span>",Berlin arms policy risks 'German-free' European defense projects,"By Andrea Shalal
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's latest restrictions on arms exports risk making Berlin a pariah in Europe's defense industry, threatening future collaboration on weapons development and its own ambitions to foster a common European defense policy.
Germany's decision to unilaterally halt all shipments of military equipment to Saudi Arabia in November after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi has brought long-standing differences between Berlin and its European partners over arms controls to a tipping point.
The move has put a question mark over billions of euros of military orders, including a 10 billion pound deal to sell 48 Eurofighter Typhoon jets to Riyadh, and has prompted some firms such as Airbus to strip German components from some of their products.
With British defense contractor BAE Systems (LON:BAES), the company behind the Eurofighter Typhoon, warning that the German embargo would weigh on its financial performance, London and Paris are racing to convince Berlin to lift it.
The Social Democrats (SPD), junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, want to keep the arms freeze against Saudi Arabia in place and reach agreement on a more restrictive export policy, keen to avoid further losses among German voters who are cautious on arms sales.
Merkel's conservatives, keen to smooth the rift with France and Britain, are piling pressure on the SPD by accusing them of jeopardizing German industry and jobs.
But the SPD notes that the coalition parties agreed last year to halt future arms sales to any countries involved in the Yemen conflict, which includes Saudi Arabia.
Paralyzed by domestic political squabbling, Berlin on Friday put off a decision about extending the embargo beyond its current March 9 deadline till the end of the month, fuelling concerns among European allies and industry.
""We see no way to resolve the issue at this point,"" said one European industry official. ""There's a complete stalemate.""
PARTNERSHIP WITH FRANCE
Germany, which has tightened controls on arms sales in recent years, accounts for just under 2 percent of total Saudi arms imports. But its role in making components for other countries' exports means that Berlin can still derail lucrative European projects.
In addition to the Eurofighter Typhoon contract, Germany's Saudi arms ban is also holding up shipments of Meteor air-to-air missiles to Saudi Arabia by MBDA, which is jointly owned by Airbus, BAE Systems and Italy's Leonardo, since the missiles' propulsion system and warheads are built in Germany.
Two sources familiar with coalition discussions said the parties could agree to a partial lifting of the freeze for a number of patrol boats being built for Saudi Arabia by privately-held Luerssen, and the Meteor missiles, since neither system is being used in the Yemen war. However nothing was decided, and the Eurofighter sale was still in question.
Agreements covering the Eurofighter and the Meteor missile were meant to prevent any country unilaterally halting exports but they were framed as memorandums of understanding to safeguard confidentiality, not binding formal treaties. 
Berlin's failure to abide by these agreements and its lack of coordination with France on the Saudi arms embargo have Paris convinced it needs a binding agreement before moving ahead on joint weapons programs with Germany valued at tens of billions of euros over the next decades.
Paris and Berlin have drafted a bilateral paper spelling out that the two countries will only block each other's exports when ""direct interests or national security are compromised"", excluding something like the Khashoggi case.
But discord within Germany's ruling coalition has stalled its completion, according to two sources familiar with the issue. It also remains unclear if the bilateral pact needs German parliamentary approval.
The SPD had no immediate new comment on the issue, but party leader Andrea Nahles last month said her party would insist on agreement on tighter German export guidelines before moving forward on other issues such as Franco-German defense ties.
Eric Trappier, chief executive of Rafale-maker Dassault Aviation, said last week it was watching the process closely. ""It is obvious that if we are really going to launch a Franco-German fighter program, the export rules need to be defined as soon as possible,"" he told reporters.
Dirk Hoke, head of Airbus Defence and Space, told Reuters an agreement was imperative before the two countries could move ahead on the new warplane, or sign a contract as expected by year's end for joint work on a new European drone.
""This will harm Germany's partnership with France in the longer-term if no serious, long-term solutions are found,"" he said.
The spat over arms also impedes German and French efforts to more closely integrate European defense procurement and programs, and ultimately build a European army. Exports are critical to ensuring the success of any jointly developed programs because they make them more economical. 
""Germany's export policies are the main reason behind France's decision to develop a successor to the Franco-German anti-tank weapon of the 1970s,"" said Matthias Wachter, a senior official with the BDI Federation of German Industry.
""We in industry have the impression that the German government is paralyzed when it comes to military procurement and export.""
Asked whether Berlin's policy was isolating it in Europe, Germany government spokesman Steffen Seibert said: ""We know that this issue is a topic for several of our most important allies and that a decision is required. That is why we are carrying on intensive discussions inside the German government, and will make decisions in March.""
""GERMAN-FREE"" 
The issue of how to accommodate differing views on arms controls in Europe is not new.
The 1972 Franco-German Debre-Schmidt accord called for consultation over arms exports, preventing one side from banning the exports of the other. But divergent public attitudes strained the compromise over time, and a spate of new projects has prompted calls for a new look.
What is different this time round, is the action companies are taking to rid themselves of their German suppliers.
While it would be nearly impossible to remove the German content - about a third - from the Eurofighter, Airbus has begun redesigning its C295 military transporter to replace German-built navigational lamps that account for 4 percent of the plane, company sources told Reuters last week.
It is also looking for alternatives to German parts that account for about 15 percent of the content on the A330-based MRTT tanker that it has sold to 12 countries including Saudi Arabia, one of the sources said.
Similar moves are underway in France, where German curbs on arms exports to other countries have already caused one smaller company, PME Nicolas Industrie, to announce dozens of layoffs.
France is also developing on its own a successor to the MILAN anti-tank guided missile it built with Germany in the 1970s, and French truck maker Arquus has begun marketing a truck for export to the Middle East as ""German-free"", sources said.
Germany's credibility and autonomy are at stake, said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, former adviser to the German president and director of the German Marshall Fund (GMF) in Berlin.
""The long-term consequence of the current export policy could be that there will no longer be a defense industry in Germany,"" he said. 
Germany's defense industry employs about 80,000 people and generated sales of about 25 billion euros in 2014, a fraction of the 1 million jobs and 370 billion euros in sales reported by the German car industry in the same year, a study commissioned by the German Economy Ministry shows.
Any moves to replace German parts in weapons systems could take 2-3 years to implement, and even longer to undo, said one source involved in the issue. ""Once you've switched to German-free production, it will take years to go back.""

The U.S. satellite industry is still feeling the brunt of strict U.S. export rules known as International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), whose implementation fueled the rise of ""ITAR-free"" satellite production in Europe and cost U.S. firms billions of dollars of potential orders.

166,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 09:21AM ET</span>",Newmont Board Rejects Barrick's $17.8 Billion Hostile Offer,"(Bloomberg) -- Newmont Mining Corp. rejected Barrick Gold Corp.’s $17.8 billion unsolicited takeover bid, a deal that would’ve created the world’s largest gold producer.
The board unanimously rejected the proposal, saying it would not be better than Newmont’s previously announced takeover of Goldcorp Inc., the Colorado-based company said in a statement Monday. Instead, Newmont submitted a joint venture proposal to Barrick that would encompass the two companies’ Nevada operations.
Newmont had raised serious doubts about Toronto-based Barrick’s proposal -- a hostile all-share no-premium bid -- from the day it was publicly announced Feb. 25. Newmont said its previously announced agreement to take over Goldcorp offered better benefits, and Chief Executive Officer Gary Goldberg called Barrick’s takeover offer “desperate” and “bizarre.”
“The combination with Goldcorp is significantly more accretive to Newmont’s shareholders on all relevant metrics compared to Barrick’s proposal, even when factoring in Barrick’s own synergy estimates,” Goldberg said in the statement.
Barrick has no intention of raising its offer, a person familiar with the matter said last week. The top end of the gold industry has been in a state of transformation -- in September, industry leader Barrick agreed to buy Randgold Resources Ltd. for $5.4 billion. Three months later, Newmont announced its plan to purchase Goldcorp Inc. for $10 billion, which would leapfrog it into the leading gold-producer spot.
‘Better Job’
Newmont’s shares rose 1.3 percent to $33.39 at 7:49 a.m., before the start of regular trading in New York. Barrick was little changed. A spokeswoman for Barrick had no immediate comment on the rejection.
“Since previous merger discussions terminated in 2014, Newmont has significantly outperformed Barrick on almost every metric,” Goldberg said in a letter Monday to Bristow and Barrick Executive Chairman John Thornton. “Our management team has a consistent, long-standing track record of delivering superior execution,” he wrote. “In contrast, Barrick’s underperformance highlights its ineffective operating model, poor record on delivering stockholder returns, and significant jurisdictional risk.”
“Mark has never run a global portfolio,” Goldberg said in a Feb. 25 interview, referring to Barrick CEO Mark Bristow, who until Jan. 1 ran Africa-focused Randgold. “In fact, I’d say none of his team have run a global portfolio like what we have in place.”
On the same day, Bristow said his team could do a better job running his rival.
“I have spent a lot of time in Nevada, and I have no doubt that I can do a better job than Newmont,” Bristow said in aninterview with Bloomberg Television."

""An inconsistent economic outlook for international markets has resulted in lower purchase plans worldwide from fleet managers when compared with a year ago,"" said Heath Patrick, president, Americas aftermarket, Honeywell Aerospace.
Honeywell said while the demand for helicopters was seen improving in North America, a slowdown is expected in Europe, Asia and Latin America.
Purchase plans have risen by five percentage points from a year earlier in North America, which is home to more than 40 percent of the world's helicopter fleet, while declining 26 percentage points in Latin America, seven points in Europe and five points in Asia.

New helicopter purchase plans were stable in China and about 21 percent of the country's fleet would be replaced or expanded over the next five years, the company said.

The Financial Times reported earlier that talks between Kale and Rolls-Royce ran into problems last year because of a dispute about the sharing of intellectual property and the involvement of a Qatari-Turkish company.

(Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc on Monday kicks off a patent challenge to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), capping off a two-year legal strategy to put pressure on the iPhone maker before a major antitrust lawsuit between the two goes to trial in April.
Qualcomm, the world's biggest maker of mobile chips, alleges in federal court in San Diego that Apple violated three of its patents, and is asking for tens of millions of dollars or more in damages.
The patent case is part of a two-year series of lawsuits around the world between the companies. Apple has alleged that Qualcomm engaged in illegal patent practices to protect a dominant position in the chip market, and Qualcomm has accused Apple of using its technology without compensation.
The legal saga will reach a crescendo in April, when an antitrust case filed by Apple in early 2017 heads to trial and challenges the foundation of Qualcomm's business model.
Since then, Qualcomm has filed a series of patent actions timed to conclude before the antitrust trial and rack up smaller victories against Apple. So far, Qualcomm has won a preliminary finding of infringement by U.S. trade regulators and partial iPhone sales bans in China and Germany, although the Chinese ban has not yet been enforced and Apple has resumed shipping phones in Germany after making changes.
U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw will open an eight-day trial on Monday to determine whether Apple violated Qualcomm patents around helping phones turn on more quickly and save battery life during tasks such as playing video games. Qualcomm alleges that phones with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) modem chips, which connect phones to wireless data networks, violated the patents.
Apple has responded in court papers that it does not believe the patents are valid and that it does not infringe them. Apple has been found to infringe one of the patents in the suit during an unrelated case before the U.S. International Trade Commission, but that decision is not final and does not bind the court in San Diego. Apple also told trade regulators it believed it had a software solution to avoid the patent.

Qualcomm is asking for up to $1.41 in damages per infringing iPhone sold between mid-2017 and the autumn of 2018. The exact number of iPhones at stake has not been disclosed because Apple has never said how many of its phones contain Intel chips. Analysts believe that half of iPhones during that period contained Intel chips.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Shares in Nordea, the Nordic region's biggest bank, tumbled on Monday after Finnish public broadcaster Yle announced it would air a program later in the day containing allegations of money-laundering through the bank.
Yle said a large data leak showed that hundreds of millions of euros from suspicious sources had moved through Nordea, without giving any specific details.
Nordea shares fell almost 7 percent on Monday before recovering some of their losses to trade down 3.7 percent at 1115 GMT. The bank was one of the worst performing stocks of the European STXE 600 index, which was up 0.3 percent.
The bank's Nordic peers Swedbank and Danske Bank have both faced allegations relating to a money-laundering scandal in the Baltic nation of Estonia.
The TV program will be made available online at 1500 GMT. Danish newspaper Berlingske, which has worked with Yle on the subject, will also publish a report on its website.
Nordea said it was aware of the upcoming report and has been in dialogue with both Yle and Berlingske.
""We have not yet seen the program or article,"" it said in a statement.
""Based on what we have been invited to comment on, these are all issues that we have seen and commented on before and are therefore in line with previous statements made on AML (anti money laundering) issues,"" 
RIPPLE EFFECT
Nordea CEO Casper von Koskull is scheduled to be interviewed by Finnish TV after the program, at 1900 GMT, together with Pekka Vasara, the head of money-laundering investigations at the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation.
The Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority could not be immediately reached for comment.
""Another day, another bank, new allegations,"" investment bank KBW said in a note to clients. KBW has an Underperform rating on Nordea stock.
Shares in DNB, Norway's largest bank, were also down on the news of the upcoming media report.
DNB's operation in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which dates back to 2006, merged in 2017 with Nordea's business in the region, creating the third-largest Baltic bank under the name Luminor, with assets of 15 billion euros. Last September, Nordea and DNB agreed to sell a 60-percent stake in Luminor to a Blackstone (NYSE:BX) private equity consortium for 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), and said the deal was expected to close during the first half of 2019.
DNB declined to provide an immediate comment on the fall in its shares. The Norwegian financial regulator was not immediately available to comment.
Nordic financial watchdogs said in October they had received documents from Bill Browder's Hermitage Capital Management, alleging Nordea had breached its responsibilities under anti-money laundering laws. The bank said it was working closely with authorities and had reported all suspicious transactions.
Danske, Denmark's largest lender, is being investigated in five countries over some 200 billion euros ($226 billion) of suspicious payments from Russia, ex-Soviet states and elsewhere that were found to have flowed through its Estonian branch. 

Swedbank is under investigation from both Estonian and Swedish regulators after a television report last month alleged that money laundering could have occurred in relation to at least 40 billion Swedish crowns ($4.30 billion) transferred between Baltics accounts at Swedbank and Danske between 2007 and 2015.

175,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 06:35AM ET</span>",Volvo to limit car speeds in bid for zero deaths,"PARIS (Reuters) - Volvo Cars said on Monday it will introduce a 180 km per hour (112 mph) speed limiter on all new vehicles as the Swedish automaker seeks to burnish its safety credentials and meet a pledge to eliminate passenger fatalities by 2020.
While Volvo, whose XC90 flagship SUV currently has a top speed of 212 km/h, has made progress on its so-called ""Vision 2020"" target of zero deaths or serious injuries, Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said it is unlikely to meet the goal without additional measures to address driver behavior.
""We've realized that to close the gap we have to focus more on the human factors,"" Samuelsson told Reuters. Volvo did not elaborate on the data but said its passenger fatalities were already well below the industry average before the goal was announced in 2007.
In addition to the speed cap, Volvo plans to deploy technology using cameras that monitor the driver's state and attentiveness to prevent people driving while distracted or intoxicated, two other big factors in accidents, Samuelsson said.
The company is also looking at lower geo-fenced speed limits to slow cars around sensitive pedestrian areas such as schools, while seeking to ""start a conversation"" among automakers and regulators about how technology can be used to improve safety.
Volvo, which is owned by China's Geely, announced the new speed limitation policy on the eve of the Geneva auto show, where its new Polestar performance electric-car brand is showcasing its second model, the Polestar 2.
While Volvo buyers often choose the brand for its safety, Samuelsson conceded that the speed cap could be a turn-off for a few in markets such as Germany, where drivers routinely travel at 200 km/h or more on unrestricted autobahns.
""We cannot please everybody, but we think we will attract new customers,"" the CEO said, recalling that the roll-out of three-point seat belts pioneered by Volvo in 1959 had initially been criticized by some as intrusive.

""I think Volvo customers in Germany will appreciate that we're doing something about safety,"" he said.

177,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 05:35AM ET</span>","Aviva, eyeing strategy change, picks Tulloch as CEO","By Pamela Barbaglia and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) -  Aviva  (LON:AV) Plc on Monday appointed internal candidate Maurice Tulloch as its new chief executive officer after a lengthy selection process, a choice which analysts say could herald change at Britain's second biggest insurer.
Tulloch, who will take over with immediate effect, is expected to sharpen Aviva's focus on the home market and some analysts say he may decide to put some overseas units under review, including some of its Asian businesses.
Other possible changes include the sale of some of its portfolio of life insurance policies closed to new customers, they added. 
Aviva, which traces its roots back to 1696, sells everything from life to car insurance, an unwieldy and expensive model which has failed to deliver the same results as more focused rivals like  Prudential  (LON:PRU) and Legal and General.
""We must focus on the fundamentals of insurance and giving our customers the best possible experience,"" Tulloch, who joined Aviva in 1992, said in a statement, adding that there was ""more to do to improve returns for shareholders"".
Most recently based in Canada, where he headed Aviva's international business, Tulloch was seen as one of the front runners for the post along with fellow internal candidate Andy Briggs, head of the firm's UK business, its biggest revenue earner.
Aviva's shares were up one percent at 436.6 pence at 1020 GMT, outperforming the broader FTSE 100 index. 
UNANIMOUS DECISION 
Chairman Adrian Montague, who had temporarily stepped in as CEO following Mark Wilson's ouster last October amid concerns about a struggling share price, will revert to his role as non-executive chairman. 
Montague said in a statement that the decision, which an Aviva spokesman said was taken by the board on Sunday night, was unanimous. External and internal candidates were considered, he added.
Possible external candidates included former Old Mutual CEO Bruce Hemphill and ex-Lloyd's of London CEO Inga Beale, Reuters reported last month.
""We believe the protracted process of bringing in a new CEO and the rumors of external candidates shows the board's desire to see change within the group,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said in a note, reiterating their overweight rating on the stock. 
Meanwhile, Panmure Gordon analyst Barrie Cornes said Tulloch ""will make changes where needed and shouldn't be underestimated"".
However, one Aviva shareholder said the choice of an internal candidate was unlikely to signal ""a radical plan - with more upheaval"".
Under Wilson's leadership, Aviva clinched one of the biggest insurance takeovers in a decade by buying Friends Life in 2015.
But despite improving profitability, Wilson failed to turn Aviva's share price performance around, with the company's stock up 25 percent during his tenure against a 61 percent return for the insurance sector within the FTSE-100.
In attempts to stay nimble and competitive, former Anglo-South African financial services business Old Mutual split its business in four last year, while Prudential is preparing to list its UK business separately.

178,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 05:30AM ET</span>",U.S. seeks to cut dialysis costs with more home care versus clinics,"By Caroline Copley and Caroline Humer
(Reuters) - The Trump administration is working on a new payment approach for treating kidney disease that favors lower cost care at home and transplants, a change that would upend a dialysis industry that provides care in thousands of clinics nationwide.
The goal is to reduce the $114 billion paid by the U.S. government each year to treat chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease, a top area of spending.
The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which provides Medicare health benefits to more than 55 million Americans, is looking at a trial payment design that would improve care in the early stages of kidney disease, increase access to kidney transplants and favor home dialysis over clinic-based treatment, CMS head Seema Verma told Reuters in an interview. 
""A lot of the way the program has been set up, it creates a lot of perverse incentives to actually keep people in an institutional setting,"" said Verma, who first signaled in a speech this year that CMS wanted to curb costs and improve quality of life for kidney disease patients through a new payment structure.
Indeed, consultants say home dialysis has been slow to take off because doctors prefer to send patients to clinics.
The changes pose a particular risk to DaVita Inc and Fresenius Medical Care AG, which operate more than 5,000 U.S. dialysis clinics and control around 70 percent of the market. 
Shares in Fresenius Medical Care were down 3 percent at 0817 GMT after the Reuters report.
They could also provide an opening for new rivals, including CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), which seeks to offer lower-cost home dialysis, and startups Cricket Health and Somatus, which focus on early intervention to slow progression to kidney failure.
""We have to be open to what I'm hearing coming out of (CMS), that they want to look at different ways for us being paid and how can we really try to create more opportunities for these patients to be better served,"" Fresenius Medical Care Chief Executive Rice Powell told analysts.
The company is expanding in home dialysis with its $2 billion purchase of NxStage, a U.S. maker of home-use dialysis machines. Fresenius Medical Care said it plans to convert some dialysis clinics into ""transitional care units"" to train people for care at home. It aims to boost the percentage of its U.S. customers using home dialysis to more than 15 percent by 2022 from around 12 percent currently.
DaVita recently launched new technology, including remote monitoring and telehealth, to improve the patient experience at home and ""champions"" home dialysis, a company spokeswoman said.
KIDNEY DISEASE ON THE RISE
Nearly 15 percent of the U.S. adult population was suffering from chronic kidney disease in 2018, fueled by growing rates of diabetes and hypertension, according to the government's U.S. Renal Data System.
In 2016, more than 720,000 people were estimated to have progressed to kidney failure. That is forecast to climb as high as 1.26 million people by 2030.
Without a transplant, patients with end-stage kidney disease require dialysis to clear their blood of waste and excess fluid, which involves spending three-to-five hours hooked up to a machine three times a week. 
Home dialysis would not only be cheaper, since it would not require nursing assistance once a patient is properly trained, but could be done at night, freeing people for a regular work schedule.
DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care offer two forms of home dialysis: hemodialysis, which requires a machine and special filter much like in clinics, and peritoneal dialysis, which utilizes the lining of the abdomen to filter waste from the blood.
CMS is considering the benefits of peritoneal dialysis, which is used more widely outside the United States. Peritoneal dialysis machines are around the size of a desktop printer, smaller than home hemodialysis machines.
DaVita believes home dialysis could eventually account for up to 25 percent of treatments if physicians are educated on its merits, and it plans to build fewer new clinics.
Meanwhile, U.S. pharmacy chain CVS is preparing to enter the dialysis business and has more retail outlets than Fresenius Medical Care and DaVita clinics combined, as well as deep enough pockets to drive disruption. 
CVS said last April its kidney care plans involve a program to identify the disease early and delay the need for dialysis. It will also seek regulatory approval for its own home dialysis device. 
CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo, in an interview, said it wants a home care solution ""which is going to be more patient friendly and we believe lower cost than the therapies that exist today.” 
Medicare pays for home dialysis, but adoption has been slow. Only around 8 percent of end-stage renal disease patients were on home dialysis in 2016. 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees CMS, is also seeking to increase the number of kidney transplants through proposals it hopes will expedite access to organs. More than 20,000 people received kidney transplants in the United States in 2018, a fraction of the more than 100,000 people on the waiting list. 
CMS has also finalized new rules that beginning next year will offer financial incentives for new drugs to treat kidney failure.
'KILLER GAP'
Proponents of home care say more frequent dialysis can improve patient outcomes by avoiding the so-called ""killer gap"" – a two-day wait between clinic sessions associated with increased hospitalization and death. Hospitalization accounts for about 40 percent of Medicare spending on dialysis patients.
""Imagine if we could keep patients out of the hospital by dealing with this killer gap ... giving them the tools to treat themselves,"" said John Milad, CEO of Britain-based Quanta Dialysis Technologies, which is working on a simpler dialysis machine for home use. ""The savings that are available there are as big as everything that is being spent on dialysis.""
CVS is working on its home hemodialysis device with DEKA Research & Development Corp, a New Hampshire-based company owned by Segway scooter inventor Dean Kamen, according to sources familiar with the arrangement.
Startups including Quanta, France's Physidia and California-based Outset Medical, are working on user-friendly dialysis machines for home use.
U.S.-based Cricket Health and Somatus use data analysis to detect high-risk chronic kidney disease patients earlier, educate them on treatment options and provide home dialysis services. 
Cricket CEO Arvind Rajan said the government could save money via a flat fee to manage patients earlier in the disease and reward providers who keep costs down. 

""The most profitable thing you can do is keep a patient from kidney failure and the least profitable thing you can do is have the patient on in-center dialysis,” he said.

179,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 05:06AM ET</span>",Huawei CFO suing Canada over December arrest,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - The lawyers for Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou are suing the Canadian government, its border agency and federal police, alleging their client was detained, searched and interrogated for three hours in violation of her constitutional rights.
Canada arrested Meng in Vancouver on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States, which has brought sweeping charges against her and China's Huawei Technologies Co that portray the company as a threat to U.S. national security. Meng was charged with bank and wire fraud to violate American sanctions against Iran.
In a civil lawsuit filed in the British Columbia Supreme Court on Friday, Meng's lawyers said the manner in which officers obtained evidence and information from Meng constituted serious violations of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Meng is the daughter of Huawei's founder.
It added that Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers deliberately delayed the immediate execution of an arrest warrant and unlawfully subjected Meng to detention, search and interrogation to extract evidence from her before she was arrested.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police - Canada's federal police - only exercised its arrest warrant three hours after Meng's ""unlawful"" detention at the airport, the lawsuit added.
There was no immediate response from Canada's justice ministry or the RCMP. The CBSA said it did not comment on matters before the courts.
Meng, who is out on bail, is due to appear in a Vancouver court at 10 a.m. PST (1800 GMT) on Wednesday, when a date will be set for her extradition hearing. The Canadian government approved her extradition proceedings on Friday.
China, whose relations with Canada have deteriorated over the affair, denounced Canada's decision on Friday and repeated previous demands for Meng's release.
The lawsuit further alleged that Meng was directed to surrender all her electronic devices, computers and passwords and that CBSA officers then unlawfully opened and viewed the contents of the seized devices in violation of her right to privacy.

CBSA officers also searched Meng's luggage in violation of the right to privacy, the lawsuit said. ""The CBSA Officers knew or were recklessly indifferent to the fact that they had no authority to conduct such a search, which search was performed under the false pretense of a routine customs or immigration related examination,"" according to the lawsuit.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The lawyer of ousted Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn on Monday said he was optimistic the detained executive could win bail with a promise to submit to surveillance, and that he would pursue a fresh strategy to defend against financial misconduct charges.
Junichiro Hironaka, known as ""the Razor"" for his successful defense of high-profile cases, told a briefing that his three-person legal team appointed last month would not be bound by the strategy of Ghosn's previous lawyers, whose rebuttal of the charges failed to secure the executive's bail.
Ghosn has been in custody since his initial arrest in late November over allegations he under-reported his compensation at Nissan Motor Co Ltd for nearly a decade through 2018. He also has been charged with aggravated breach of trust.
The ex-chairman of Nissan, Mitsubishi Motors Corp and France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) has denied wrongdoing.
""I believe it's possible he could be released in the near future,"" Hironaka said in a more optimistic outlook than former lead lawyer and one-time chief prosecutor Motonari Otsuru, who had suggested Ghosn could remain in custody in Japan for months.
""We haven't known each other for long but I hope to build up a relationship of trust,"" said Hironaka, who acknowledged a language barrier with his client but added that he had read books authored by Ghosn to get to know his client better.
Ghosn and his legal team are currently waiting for the Tokyo court to decide whether to grant his third request for bail submitted late last week.
This time, Ghosn has said he is willing to submit to severe restrictions including video surveillance and communications monitoring to secure freedom before his trial, Hironaka said. His previous offer to hire security guards and wear an ankle monitoring bracelet failed to convince judges who cited a risk of evidence tampering when they rejected two previous bail applications.
Meanwhile, the defense team has begun holding pre-trial discovery meetings with prosecutors and judges to review evidence and submit lists of witnesses to be presented at trial, Hironaka said, a process which could take several months.
RAZOR SHARP
The appointment of Hironaka, nicknamed for his combative style, is widely seen as move to adopt a more aggressive legal strategy.
""I am now 73 years old, but I want to test how sharp my razor still is,"" Hironaka told reporters, without revealing details of the legal strategy he and is colleagues will pursue.
Since taking over Ghosn's defense team, Hironaka has argued the allegations should have been resolved as an internal company matter without the involvement of prosecutors, and blasted the judicial system for keeping his client in jail.
The former Nissan boss faces a criminal justice system where only three of every hundred defendants pleading not guilty are acquitted. In Japan, there is no plea deal mechanism that would allow Ghosn to agree to lesser charges for a lighter sentence.
The executive, credited with reviving Nissan in the early 2000s, was one of the auto industry's most powerful figures as head of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance, whose combined vehicle sales rank it as one of the world's biggest automakers.
Ghosn had been seeking a full merger, an idea many Nissan executives opposed. However, his arrest has since muddied the outlook for the alliance, which is based on a web of cross-shareholding and operational integration.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares rose on Monday amid growing optimism the United States and China will reach a trade agreement as soon as this month.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping might seal a formal trade deal around March 27, given progress in talks between the two countries, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.
The two nations have imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each others' goods, roiling financial markets, disrupting manufacturing supply chains and shrinking U.S. farm exports.
A source briefed on the negotiations told Reuters the two countries appear close to a deal that would roll back U.S. tariffs on at least $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
Stock markets welcomed the news, with European markets following their Asian counterparts higher. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.4 percent. 
MSCI's All Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent on the day. 
""The key question is - will all tariffs will be removed instantly, or will they be gradually dialled back?"" wrote Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. 
""While the renewed risk appetite is seen boosting European and U.S. stocks, investors should consider how much upside is left, given that markets have been actively pricing in the possible resolution to the trade saga.""
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 index of U.S. stocks were up 0.3 percent in London.
In Asia, Chinese shares were the biggest gainers, with the blue-chip index up as much as 3 percent. The CSI300 index rallied last week after index provider MSCI quadrupled its weighting for mainland shares in its global benchmarks.
Australian shares rose 0.4 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index added 0.7 percent.
That left MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan with gains of 0.3 percent. The index has risen almost 10 percent so far this year.
Japan's Nikkei strengthened more than 1 percent.
POLICY EASING?
March is expected to be a crucial month for global markets. Britain's parliament will vote on an agreement to leave the European Union, the U.S. Federal Reserve will hold a policy meeting that could yield clues on its plans for interest rates and balance sheet reduction, and the European Central Bank will hold its scheduled policy meeting this week.
""While it will take time for economic data to stabilise from the current slowdown, policy shifts by central banks and governments, especially in the U.S. and China, should help support investor confidence for now,"" said Tai Hui, Asia-Pacific chief market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
Surveys last week highlighted manufacturers' pain, particularly those exposed to China's slowdown, and added to expectations that central banks are finished tightening policy .
In the United States, manufacturing activity dropped in February to its lowest since November 2016, consumer confidence fell short of forecasts, inflation was tame and U.S. personal income fell in January for the first time in more than three years.
The modest inflation lends support to the Fed's patient posture on raising U.S. interest rates, analysts said.
Greece's benchmark 10-year government bond yields dropped to their lowest since 2006 on Monday after Moody's raised its rating late last week, bolstering investor optimism towards the euro zone's most indebted country. 
Moody's on Friday lifted Greece's issuer ratings to B1 from B3, citing the effectiveness of the country's reform programme.
The dollar index rose against a basket of major currencies to its highest in a week. It was last higher 0.1 percent at 96.604. 
Speculators have ramped up long dollar bets, with the latest positioning data showing net positions rising to $27.24 billion for the week ending March 1. Most of those bets are positioned to take advantage of higher U.S. interest rates.
The euro fell to its lowest in a week, down 0.25 percent on the day at $1.1339.
The Australian dollar, a liquid proxy for risk hedges, gained, but disappointing domestic data curbed the gains. The currency was last at $0.7076, after earlier rising as high as $0.7118.
Elsewhere, oil prices gained on Monday with Brent futures up 0.7 percent at $65.53 a barrel. U.S. crude rose 0.6 percent to $56.12.

(Reuters) - Ray Kelvin, founder and chief executive of British fashion retailer Ted Baker Plc, resigned on Monday following misconduct allegations related to his hugging of business colleagues. 
Ted Baker had announced an independent investigation into misconduct claims against Kelvin in December in response to an online campaign claiming to represent over 200 employees asking to end ""forced hugging"" and ""a culture that leaves harassment unchallenged.""
""Kelvin has denied all allegations of misconduct. He has, however, today agreed to resign with immediate effect from his position as chief executive officer and as a director of Ted Baker,"" the company said in a statement on Monday.
The retailer said the investigation would continue until the end of the first quarter or early in the second with the focus turning to Ted Baker's policies, procedures and handling of complaints.
Ted Baker shares fell 4.8 percent in initial trade before making up some ground to trade 1.4 percent lower at 0830 GMT. 
""I've decided that the right thing to do is to step away from Ted and allow the business to focus on being the outstanding brand it is so it can face 2019 with fresh energy and renewed spirit,"" Kelvin, 63, said in a statement. 
Kelvin, who is top shareholder with a stake of about 35 percent and has been CEO since its launch in 1988, went on a leave of absence a few days after the investigation began.
Ted Baker opened its first store in Glasgow in 1988 with quirky details on suits, shirts and dresses helping the company stand out from rivals. 
Kelvin was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2011 for services to the fashion industry.
LEARNING LESSONS
Acting Chief Executive Officer Lindsay Page has agreed he would continue in the role while David Bernstein will act as executive chairman, the company said.
""We are determined to learn lessons from what has happened and from what our employees have told us and to ensure that, while the many positive and unique aspects of Ted's culture are maintained, appropriate changes are made,"" Bernstein said. 
Bernstein has indicated he will continue in the position until no later than Nov. 30, 2020, by which time a successor will be appointed, the company said. 
""There's always concerns around whether a founder-led brand loses some of its DNA when the founder leaves,"" said Peel Hunt analyst John Stevenson.
""Kelvin was no longer critical in terms of the day-to-day running of the business, but there is a question of how important his influence was on the direction of the brand,"" he added.
Ted Baker has more than 500 stores and concessions globally. 
Kelvin's resignation comes after Ted Baker's shares plunged last week as the retailer said 2018-19 earnings would miss forecasts due to volatile exchange rates, higher costs and a writedown on inventory.

The threat of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China appears to be lifting, after the Wall Street Journal reported overnight that the two sides are closing in on a deal that would reduce most tariffs for U.S. goods entering China, guarantee higher volumes of U.S. exports to China – notably in agricultural and chemical products. European chemicals is the only sector in the red this morning in, partly on fears that the U.S. deal will make life more difficult for it.
The deal will reportedly also make at least some progress on safeguarding intellectual property rights.
In addition, the risk of a ‘Hard Brexit’ also seems much less than a couple of weeks ago. While the political direction is uncertain, Brexiteers appear to be softening their opposition to the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May. And in the last two weeks, regulators on both sides of the channel have signed off on plans to let cross-border finance operate pretty much as it does now, at least for a transitional period.
That not only has direct consequences for keeping financial markets functioning smoothly, it also encourages hopes that other sectors such as air transport and trade in food and medicines will also find a way to avoid worst-case scenarios.

188,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 01:11AM ET</span>","As Trade Details Emerge, China $7 Trillion Is Next: Taking Stock","(Bloomberg) -- News that the U.S. and China are near a trade deal that could lift most or all American tariffs did little to bring out the animal spirits from Asia stock traders. But when China said “substantial progress” was made, that appeared to do the trick.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index spiked up around 11:24 a.m. in Hong Kong, with shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen taking their gains to more than 2.6 percent before the trading break. The gauges were up 2.6 percent and 3 percent, respectively shortly before 2 p.m.
Chinese stocks have gained $1.1 trillion since the start of February, with their value sitting at $6.78 trillion as of Friday’s close. If the rally endures, you’d be looking at $7 trillion at the end of Monday.
One sticking point in the negotiations -- intellectual property -- seems to be getting addressed, with a new Chinese foreign-investment law to strengthen its protection.
Trade talks have been a constant focus of investors’ minds as the war between the U.S. and China has shown its damage. A pair of ugly factory survey prints from Taiwan and South Korea earlier Monday is just the latest sign of how it’s affected not only China, but many export-heavy economies in the region -- meaning that a resolution could be a big win for all.
There’s more coming that may influence the mood as Chinese leaders meet in Beijing this week to detail the nation’s priorities for the year and goals for the economic expansion. And remember that beginning in May, MSCI Inc. will start the process of increasing exposure in its gauges to the so-called A shares, meaning that China will have a bigger impact on the region’s equity benchmark.
Asian markets have already priced in plenty of benefit to the trade negotiation, with the 8.2 percent rally in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index through the first two months of the year being its best beginning since 2012. As Nick Twidale, the chief operating officer at Rakuten Securities Australia Pty, says, “we seem to be in a much better place than a week ago.” And now what the market wants to keep going is details.
“No market ever plateaus and goes and collapses, so there’s no immediate retracement in sight,” said Stirling Larkin, chief investment officer with Australian Standfirst Asset Management, said on Bloomberg Television. “What that means by implication is we will see a spike, we will see a rally in equity markets and then possibly a retracement from there. So you stay in mainland equity bourses, you stay in the S&P 500 if you believe there’s steam, if not you start pivoting now.”
As Bloomberg Macro Strategist Mark Cudmore notes in Monday’s Markets Live question of the day, the MSCI All-Country World Index needs to climb another 8 percent to hit a fresh record. Is a signed trade deal worth that much? We shall see.

190,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 04, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>",China Stocks Jump to Eight-Month High as Trade Optimism Grows,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese stocks surged to their highest level since June as signs of progress in trade talks and the breaking of a key resistance level supercharged confidence.
The Shanghai Composite Index rallied 2.6 percent as of the midday break, smashing through the 3,000 level that had capped gains all last week. Technology, telecom and financial companies led the advance as only 19 stocks fell on the gauge. The index has now climbed 25 percent since its Jan. 3 low, helping add some $1.5 trillion in value to China’s stock market.
Momentum in China’s stock market hasn’t been this strong since the peak of the bubble in 2015. The Shanghai Composite’s relative-strength index is nearing the highest levels seen that year. Almost all of its 1500-odd members are above their long-term moving averages, showing the rally is also the broadest since 2015. Turnover has surged after falling to a four-year low in December.
""The market’s gone crazy,"" said Chen Weining, a fund manager at Miyuan Investments in Beijing. ""Technical levels are bullish but we need to make sure we don’t repeat the mistakes of 2015.""
The newfound euphoria is a sharp contrast to the mood that persisted last year, when concern about U.S. tariffs and a slowing economy sent the Shanghai index plunging 25 percent. Since then Chinese authorities have loosened curbs on equity trading imposed in the wake of the 2015 stock market collapse and taken steps to stimulate growth, while improving ties with the U.S. have added to the upbeat tone.
The U.S. and China are close to a trade deal that could end most or all American tariffs, according to two people familiar with the discussions. National People’s Congress spokesman Zhang Yesui said substantial progress has been made in the talks. Some 3,000 of the most powerful officials in China are gathering in Beijing for the annual parliamentary meeting, where Premier Li Keqiang will deliver overall growth targets.
The yuan extended its lead over Asian peers this year, strengthening 0.3 percent to 6.6916 per dollar. The currency has jumped 2.8 percent in 2019, the most in the region, after slumping more than 5 percent last year. Bonds were little changed, with the yield on 10-year debt rising 1 basis point to 3.2 percent.
The small-cap ChiNext Index jumped 4.7 percent, taking its year-to-date surge to 31 percent. Insurers were among the biggest contributors to the Shanghai gauge, which last traded at 3,073.03.
""We need to see whether this level can be sustained -- that’s the most crucial thing,"" said Ronald Wan, chief executive of Partners Capital International Ltd. ""The government definitely wants to sustain the level and for investors, confidence seems to be stronger. But a lot of companies are still facing liquidity issues and they may choose to cash out.""
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index climbed 1.2 percent, while a measure of mainland companies traded in the city rose 1.9 percent."

192,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 03, 2019 09:50PM ET</span>",Global Stocks Could See 10% Trade Discount Narrow on Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Global stocks are currently trading at a 10 percent discount thanks to the trade war -- a gap which could eventually close if reports the U.S. and China are close to a deal are accurate.
Strategists at UBS Group AG including Yianos Kontopoulos isolated the impact of equity moves on “trade shock” days to show the MSCI AC World Index has been hit by almost 10 percentage points since the dispute started. European stocks have been most hit with the Stoxx 600 Index showing a near 13 percentage point impact, and Australian stocks the least with just a 0.4 percent hit.
“On our estimates, equities are still pricing relatively large trade discounts,” the strategists wrote. “The probability of a near-term resolution is rising, and even if our model somewhat overstates the discount priced into equities, room remains for equities to rise on a further reduction in tensions.”
The U.S. and China are close to a trade deal that could lift most or all U.S. tariffs as long as Beijing follows through on pledges ranging from better protecting intellectual-property rights to buying a significant amount of American products, according to people familiar. One of the remaining sticking points is whether the tariffs would be lifted immediately or over a period of time to allow the U.S. to monitor whether China is meeting its obligations, they said.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) strategists said in a note last month U.S. stocks could hit a new record high should a “real deal” with China be struck, while JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). strategists led by Marko Kolanovic estimated in June that market reactions to trade headlines had yanked $1.25 trillion in value from American shares.
Still, not everyone is as bullish. A trade deal between the U.S. and China will put an end to the rally in risk assets that’s been in place since late December, said Hondius Capital Management LP’s Shawn Matthews in a Bloomberg TV interview in February.

Chinese shares, in particular, stuck with what has become an impressive bull run this year. The Shanghai Composite Index was up 1.4% by 9:17 PM ET (2:17 AM GMT) 3,035 while the Shenzhen Component climbed 2.56% to 9,403.
The Shanghai Composite is up around 18% from the beginning of 2019 while the Shenzhen Component has notched gains of 24%, putting it solidly in bull run territory.
By contrast, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was flat Monday morning, shifting between mild gains and mild losses in early trading and down 0.01%. Still, Hong Kong’s main index is up around 13% so far this year.
Most main stock markets around the region also posted gains.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.79% to 21,777 while the KOSPI in South Korea gained 0.35% to 2,203 by mid-morning.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.51% to 6,224.
The upbeat mood was driven by news that the U.S. is poised to lift most or even all tariffs on Chinese imports and that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could sign a deal as early as this month, the Wall Street Journal reported.
On Friday, Trump asked China to eliminate all tariffs on agricultural products. He pointed to the steady progress in trade talks in making the request.
The recovery in Chinese shares so far this year is not happening on a bubble. Asian stocks have generally done well. MSCI’s index for Asian shares ex-Japan has risen about 10% this year.
Investors have seemed to shrug off signs of a slowdown in China in February.
“While it will take time for economic data to stabilize from the current slowdown, policy shifts by central banks and governments, especially in the U.S. and China, should help support investor confidence for now,” said Tai Hui, Asia Pacific Chief Market Strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in comments quoted by Reuters.

194,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2019 09:10PM ET</span>",German taxpayer may be left with hefty unpaid Airbus loan: report,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German taxpayers could be left more than 600 million euros ($680 million) out of pocket in outstanding credit to Airbus for developing the A380 superjumbo, the Funke Mediengruppe will report on Monday citing an economy ministry statement, excerpts approved for release showed.
Berlin loaned Airbus 942 million euros in 2002 in connection with the A380's development, of which only a third has been repaid, the media group cited the statement as saying.
The ministry issued the statement in reply to a parliamentary question from the opposition liberal party (FDP), it said.
Airbus last month said it would scrap the A380, producing and delivering only 17 more by 2021, because customers preferred smaller and nimbler jets.
This came after Emirates - the largest A380 customer - was forced to reduce its orders for the superjumbo after an engine dispute and a broader fleet review.
Repayments are due successively once planes are delivered, meaning the premature end of the production pipeline will leave some parts of the loan unpaid, the media group reported.
Deputy economy minister Ulrich Nussbaum was quoted as saying the handling of the loan issues was still being analyzed and would then be discussed with the company.

195,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2019 02:55PM ET</span>",Investors spooked by Brazilian Vale's surprise CEO shake-up,"By Gram Slattery and Paula Laier
RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Investors were skeptical on Sunday about the surprise decision by Brazil's Vale SA to remove its high-profile chief executive in the wake of a deadly January accident at one of the world's largest iron ore miner's facilities.
Vale's board dismissed CEO Fabio Schvartsman, as well as three other executives including chief of coal and ferrous metals Peter Poppinga, on a ""temporary"" basis on Saturday night, after state and federal prosecutors recommended their exit. 
Investors and analysts raised questions about his replacement, the head of the firm's base metals division Eduardo Bartolomeo, who is a little-known quantity in the markets, unlike Schvartsman.
""My worry is that dismissing the top executives leaves the company leaderless or with less experienced leadership and simply adds to the turmoil,"" said John Tumazos of John Tumazos Very Independent Research, which focuses on mining, metals and forest products.
One analyst at a major investment bank, who requested anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to the media, said many clients had reached out to him with concerns since Schvartsman's dismissal.
He called the change a ""relevant loss"" for the company given Schvartsman's ""high caliber and proximity to markets.""
While Bartolomeo had often been floated as a possible successor, the analyst said, he is more focused on Vale's physical mining operations than its finances. Bartolomeo's mandate has been to turn around Vale's nickel business but the results have so far been mixed, the analyst said.
More than 300 people are likely to have died when a tailings dam burst at Vale's Corrego do Feijao mine in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, releasing massive amounts of toxic sludge. The disaster was the second deadly burst at a Vale-linked tailings dam in Minas Gerais in four years.
Prosecutors are looking into what happened at Corrego do Feijao. While it is not yet clear the extent to which executives knew of the dangers at the mine, documents have emerged in recent weeks showing that some at the firm knew the dam had an elevated risk of rupture.
Newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported earlier in the week that a manager told executives of the deteriorating state of the dam. Vale has vigorously denied the report.
Some observers said Schvartsman's ouster could offer a fresh start for Vale.
They said his removal was in keeping with changes in Brazil, where the powerful rarely felt serious repercussions for mistakes and misdeeds until recently.

""I think it's prudent and necessary,"" said Frederico Mesnik, founding partner of Trígono Capital in Sao Paulo. ""Being part of the old Brazil, the land of impunity, doesn't work anymore.""

196,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2019 02:30PM ET</span>",Head of French carmaker PSA says Europe's CO2 cuts will threaten jobs: Le Figaro,"PARIS (Reuters) - The EU's plans to slash carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from vehicles and push carmakers to go electric will threaten 13 million jobs in Europe's auto industry and benefit Asia, the head of French carmaker PSA told Le Figaro. 
The European Parliament and EU countries struck an agreement in December to cut emissions from cars by 37.5 percent by 2030, compared with 2021, and by 31 percent from vans.
""This jeopardizes the jobs of 13 million people in the industry and could destabilize some of our European societies,"" PSA's CEO Carlos Tavares, who also heads the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), said in an interview with Le Figaro newspaper published on Sunday.
Tavares welcomed Franco-German plans to boost Europe's electric car battery industry and to reduce EU carmakers' reliance on Asian rivals by building two new battery factories. 
However, he said that big players like Bosch have studied the project and considered it was not profitable. He said PSA had also looked into it, but the initial capital costs were huge and localizing the battery industry may be difficult within current European Union regulatory constraints. 
""If European carmakers do not sell enough electric vehicles by 2020, 2025 and 2030, they will be ruined by fines. This forces us to reserve significant volumes of batteries with Asian suppliers, who are awaiting us with a big smile,"" he said. 
Tavares said that when he arrived at PSA in 2013, the Chinese market was seen as the company's last hope, but in fact the carmaker now does 80 percent of its sales in Europe. 
China is a very difficult market for PSA, Tavares said, adding that the company is struggling to understand the market, client expectations and the way of thinking of its state-owned partners. 

""The decision mechanisms in our joint ventures are intolerably slow,"" he said.

A company spokesman said Porsche had ""already responded to possibly anticipated tax payments via safety surcharges and lump sum payments.""
The Bild am Sonntag (BamS) newspaper said on Sunday enforcement officers visited Porsche premises late last year.
The paper said they were investigating paperwork related to parties, private travel by managers on company planes and chauffeured cars, as well as shortfalls in payments to tax authorities due on salaries collected by former employees on early retirement schemes.
The paper also said costs incurred for a birthday party held by former chief executive Matthias Mueller who ran the firm between 2015 and 2018 had required retroactive tax declarations and the late settlement of outstanding liabilities.
In a statement, Porsche said the company had paid significant outstanding sums in question. 
It had handed over all documentation regarding possible tax liabilities for the employees in early retirement, it said.
The payments queried by the authorities related to 2009 to 2017, and prompted an onsite search at Porsche headquarters in June 2018, it said.
Porsche had further responded to queries over its tax liabilities by launching internal tax compliance measures and processes, aided by external consultants, the statement added. 
It declined to comment further on details while the investigation was still underway.

199,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2019 12:22PM ET</span>",Wall Street weekahead: U.S. stock reign may not last over other regions,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock prices are outpacing those in most other regions to start 2019, but the gap is narrow and some investors are eyeing potential catalysts to tip the scales to the rest of the world.
Investors say several factors could sway performance in favor of other developed or emerging markets, including slowing U.S. profit growth, a weaker U.S. dollar, improving economies in China and Europe and resolution of global trade tensions.
The 11 percent gain this year for the S&P 500 is helping the U.S. benchmark index expand its global edge since the U.S. equities bull run began a decade ago.
U.S. stocks are near 70-year highs relative to other global developed markets, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
""For the most part, it has been a pretty consistent trend that U.S. outperforms non U.S.,"" said Nathan Thooft, head of asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management in Boston. ""The reality is, though, it can’t go on forever.""
U.S. corporate earnings are expected to climb 5.3 percent this year after rising 24.4 percent in 2018, according to global markets research at FTSE Russell.
European companies, excluding the UK, are expected to see profits rise 9.1 percent this year, while profits for emerging market companies are projected to rise 13.9 percent.
Moreover, the S&P 500 is trading at 16.4 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, more expensive than the 13.4 times for Europe's STOXX and 11.5 times for the MSCI emerging markets index, according to Refinitiv data. Moreover, the S&P 500's valuation gap over those indexes is wider than it has been historically.
""People are willing to pay a very hefty premium for the U.S. stock market,"" said Lance Humphrey, a portfolio manager with USAA Asset Management. ""It’s our view that the fundamentals in the U.S. don’t necessarily justify the degree of that premium.""
That valuation difference has been one attraction in particular for emerging markets, which was the ""most crowded trade"" in a BAML fund manager survey last month.
The strength of the U.S. dollar is another factor for emerging markets, many of which have debt denominated in the greenback. For U.S. investors, a strong dollar also requires a costly currency translation for investments in international funds.
Investors say the dollar has held up surprisingly well this year, given the more dovish stance by the Federal Reserve, but any weakening in the U.S. currency could be a boon for stocks outside the country.
Resolution of the trade dispute between the United States and China could provide another boost, as investors have become optimistic about a deal between the world's two largest economies.
“If China and the U.S. can reach a good agreement, that will actually propel emerging markets and have a bigger impact on emerging markets than on the U.S. market,"" said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank. ""All the emerging markets are somewhat dependent on China because that’s their largest trading partner for the most part.”
The potential for a positive trade resolution has helped fuel the 22 percent run this year for China's Shanghai Composite index, which has outperformed both U.S. and other major world indices.
Europe's STOXX has climbed 10 percent this year. A weak economic outlook - the Euro Zone economy is expected to expand 1.3 percent this year, just over half the U.S. rate - along with political uncertainty in Britain and elsewhere have pressured equities.
Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management, last week issued a report saying European equities should top U.S. equities, noting that ""modest economic growth forecasts look achievable.""
“The best thing going for Europe right now is no one has expectations,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. ""What that means is a little bit of good news could go a long way.""
One factor driving U.S. outperformance this year is the heavy weight of technology stocks in the country's indexes. Nearly one-quarter of MSCI's U.S. index is tech companies, compared with 15 percent in financials. By contrast, MSCI's European Union index has a 19 percent weighting in financials and 6 percent in tech.
Tech and other high-growth stocks have been in favor, but some investors anticipate a shift toward financials and other value stocks, so Europe could see a relative boost.
Of course, not everyone agrees. Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, doubts that financials will lead this year, which is one reason he prefers the S&P 500 over indexes for other global regions.
Indeed, Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird, says geographic diversification away from the U.S. market has hurt returns, so investors ""are going to be a little bit gun shy"" to allocate to the rest of the world.

As it stands, Manulife's Thooft said, “there is no doubt that U.S. assets are over-owned.""

204,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2019 06:50AM ET</span>","Vale's CEO, other executives, to step down after Brazil dam burst","By Marta Nogueira and Gram Slattery
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian iron ore miner Vale SA Chief Executive Fabio Schvartsman and several other senior executives resigned on Saturday in what the company described as a temporary move, after one of its mining dams burst in January, killing hundreds.
Vale said Schvartsman offered his resignation, which the board ""immediately accepted"" after state and federal prosecutors recommended their removal late on Friday.
The move comes slightly over a month after a tailings dam broke at Vale's Corrego do Feijao mine in the interior Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, likely killing over 300 people and releasing massive amounts of toxic sludge.
It was the second deadly burst at a Vale-linked tailings dam in Minas Gerais in four years.
The resignations came after documents emerged in recent weeks showing that Vale knew it had an elevated risk of rupture and that inspectors felt they were under pressure to certify the structure as safe.
Earlier this week, newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported that a Vale manager had told executives the integrity of the structure had worsened, though the company vigorously denied the report. 
The company said it had appointed Eduardo Bartolomeo, executive director of base metals, as the new head of the firm.
Also resigning were Vale's head of ferrous minerals and coal, Peter Poppinga, planning director Lucio Flavio Gallon Cavalli and Silmar Magalhaes Silva, the head of a geographic division at Vale.
Vale said its board met on Friday night and Saturday morning following the prosecutors' recommendation.
In a letter sent to the board by Schvartsman and published by newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, in which he asked to be removed from the position of CEO on a ""temporary"" basis, the executive vigorously defended his conduct.
""I am absolutely convinced that the way I have acted personally, as well as the rest of our executive board ... has been absolutely appropriate, correct, and, mainly, loyal to our non-negotiable values of upholding operational security as a company,"" the letter read, according to Folha.
Vale did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Bartolomeo, the incoming chief executive, was previously the executive director of marketing and of fertilizer and coal operations, according to Vale's website. He has also served on Vale's board of directors as well as its compliance and risk committee and financial committee.
According to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile, he worked as executive director at Vale for 8 years until 2012, after which he worked as CEO of Brazil Hospitality Group then as CEO of Nova Transportadora do Sudeste, a gas pipeline company. He rejoined Vale in January of 2018.
He holds MBAs from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Katholieke Universiteit in Belgium, the website says.

The executives' departure was made public on Saturday evening during Brazil's Carnival (NYSE:CCL) holiday weekend. The country's main stock exchange will be closed on Monday and Tuesday although Vale's ADRs will reopen in New York on Monday.

206,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2019 07:12PM ET</span>",U.S. agency probing two fatal Tesla crashes in Florida since Sunday,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities are investigating a fatal Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Model S crash in Florida last Sunday that killed the driver and caused a massive fire, the second fatal Tesla crash in the state this week being probed, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Saturday.
The agency and the National Transportation Safety Board said late on Friday they were sending teams to investigate the other fatal crash Friday in Delray Beach, Florida of a 2018 Model 3 that crashed into a semi-trailer.
A NHTSA spokesman confirmed Saturday the agency has an ""ongoing investigation"" into the Sunday Tesla crash in Davie, Florida, and ""will take additional actions if appropriate.""
Tesla did not immediately comment Saturday.
The South Florida Sun Sentinel reported Monday the 2016 Tesla Model S caught fire and burned the 48-year-old driver beyond recognition. The newspaper said the Tesla battery repeatedly caught fire after being transported to a towing facility.
NHTSA, the auto safety regulator, can demand a recall if it believes a defect poses an unreasonable safety risk, while the NTSB makes safety recommendations.
NHTSA and NTSB are investigating a number of crashes since 2017 that focus on two primary issues: the role of Tesla's driver assistance technology Autopilot in accidents and some significant battery fires in the electric vehicles after crashes, including cases of batteries reigniting.
A report on Friday's crash released by the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Department did not indicate if Autopilot was engaged in the crash that killed the 50-year-old Tesla Model 3 owner.
The report said the Tesla struck a tractor trailer and the roof was sheared off as it passed underneath the trailer and stopped three-tenths of a mile south of the collision. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene.
NTSB is sending a team of three to conduct a safety investigation, while NHTSA is sending a field team.
Some Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid putting their hands on the wheel for extended periods when using Autopilot, while Tesla advises drivers that they must keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention while using Autopilot.
NHTSA is also probing the January 2018 crash of a Tesla vehicle apparently traveling in Autopilot that struck a fire truck in Culver City, California, a May 2018 crash in Utah of a Tesla in Autopilot mode and a May 2018 Tesla accident in Florida that killed two teenagers and injured another but was not in Autopilot.
The NTSB is investigating three earlier Tesla incidents being reviewed by NHTSA, as well as an August 2017 Tesla battery fire in California, in which an owner ran into his garage.
Friday's crash is similar to the first fatal Tesla crash linked to Autopilot.
In May 2016, a Tesla Model S driver was killed near Williston, Florida, using Autopilot when he slammed into a tractor trailer that also sheared off the vehicle roof.
The NTSB said in 2017 Tesla lacked proper safeguards allowing the driver “to use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed and the system gave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention.""
In January 2017, NHTSA said its review found no evidence of defects in the 2016 fatal Autopilot crash that would require a recall.
Tesla says its Autopilot software reduces a driver's ""overall workload"" and will ""steer, accelerate and brake for you within almost any lane. It will also automatically change lanes on most highways to overtake other cars or navigate to interchanges and exits.""

Tesla says the feature ""should not be used on highways that have very sharp turns or lane markings that are absent, faded, or ambiguous.""

Many Iranian banks are under pressure because of years of poor management and economic difficulties, caused by decades of international sanctions and the reimposition of U.S. sanctions last year.
The merger would create ""a stable and more efficient single bank to provide better services to the families of the armed forces and the general public"", the central bank said in a statement quoted by state news agency IRNA.
Ansar, Mehr Eqtesad, Qavamin, and Hekmat banks and the Kosar credit institution will be merged with state-run Bank Sepah, set up in 1925 by an army pension fund as Iran's first bank, the central bank statement said. It gave no further details of the merger or the institutions involved.
President Donald Trump reimposed U.S. sanctions last May after pulling out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The sanctions have shaken the economy and pushed the currency to record lows, disrupting foreign trade and helping boost annual inflation fourfold to nearly 40 percent in November. 
The weak currency and spiraling prices have been among complaints in sporadic street protests since late 2017.
Besides banks, Iran's armed forces and particularly the elite Revolutionary Guards control numerous companies. 

After the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, the Guards became heavily involved in reconstruction, with interests subsequently expanding to take in a vast network of businesses ranging from oil and gas projects to construction and telecommunications.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2019 07:09AM ET</span>",Tesla's store-shuttering strategy may pull the rug out of solar,"By Alexandria Sage
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's sudden decision to shutter the bulk of its stores around the world raises a red flag over the future of its solar branch, a declining business it paid $2.6 billion for in a controversial 2016 deal. 
Chief Executive Elon Musk's announcement on Thursday that the electric vehicle maker would close ""many"" of its stores around the world to sell cars online-only removes the only retail outlet for solar sales since Musk pulled the plug on a partnership with  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) last June.
""Solar is now the stepchild at Tesla. They've made two decisions in a row that deal crippling blows to the solar business and they may be regretting the Home Depot idea,"" said Frank Gillett, principal analyst at Forrester Research. 
""It doesn't feel thoughtfully done, it's rushed. Basically it will hurt them from a brand and marketing point of view,"" Gillett said.
When Tesla made its offer for SolarCity - a debt-laden solar-panel sales and installation company founded by two of Musk's cousins - its stock price was down 70 percent from its all-time high. Musk cast the deal as a ""no-brainer"" rife with synergies, in which customers could be sold both cars and solar energy systems.
That has not yet proven to be the case, and Tesla's solar business has been shrinking as selling the Model 3 sedan became Tesla's priority. As part of company-wide layoffs last June, Tesla closed about a dozen solar installation facilities. 
Tesla said all sales for its energy and solar products around the world would now be online only, too. The company says that roughly 75 percent of its current solar sales volume is generated outside of its retail stores via the web or referrals.
""The majority of our residential solar and Powerwall orders are already placed outside our retail stores, including online or via referral, and we believe this shift to online sales, paired with a dedicated energy adviser from our support team, will result in the best, most seamless customer experience in the industry,"" a Tesla spokesman told Reuters.
Tesla cited a cut in prices of its residential solar systems by as much as 25 percent in November, representing savings of between $3,000-$5,000 on average, helped by streamlining its sales operations, and said the shift to online sales would unlock additional cost efficiencies. 
Ending the deal with Home Depot, whose stores generate high foot traffic, took a huge bite out of Tesla solar sales. In the fourth quarter, the company deployed 73 megawatts of retrofit solar systems, down 21 percent from the prior quarter and well below SolarCity's more than 200 megawatts a quarter in early 2016. Total energy generation and storage revenue fell 7 percent from the prior quarter to $371.5 million. 
Besides selling private-label and third-party solar panels, Tesla sells energy storage systems for home and business use, so-called Powerwalls and Powerpacks. Tesla has said nearly all Powerwall-only orders are placed via the web or certain third-party solar installers.
Installations of the solar roof tiles unveiled by Musk in 2016 are at a ""slow pace,"" Tesla said in its 2018 annual report, due to design changes. Progress at Tesla's solar factory in Buffalo, New York, where the tiles are to be manufactured, meanwhile, has been stalled by assembly-line problems. 
One former solar seller laid off in January told Reuters that 70 percent of leads on solar had come from Home Depot. Upper management at Tesla ""didn't appreciate the significance"" of the deal with the big-box retailer, the source said.
""If you want to go mass volume, you have to go after the customers,"" the source said. ""Solar isn't sexy enough to have the customer come to you.""
Musk said Tesla will still keep open a small number of stores in high-traffic locations as galleries and information centers, where details about energy products will also be offered.
When customers order a car on Tesla's website, they are alerted during the configuration process to the possibility of ordering solar or other energy products.
In January, Tesla said it was ""still in the process of transitioning our sales channel from former partners to our Tesla stores and training our sales team to sell solar systems in addition to vehicles.""
But former solar salespeople told Reuters that Tesla had already put solar on the back burner, with Tesla-branded panels not even available for installations in the latter half of 2018. 

""They'd tell us the focus of the company is the Model 3,"" said one former seller, who left the company in January. ""The Model 3 has to be successful or there's no company.""

210,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 02, 2019 02:32AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. The Canary in the Housing Coalmine
It was a tough week for the housing market.
December housing starts plunged more than 11% to a level not seen since September 2016, according to a government report released this week.
The S&P Case-Shiller home price index rose less than expected, while  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) missed on profit expectations and forecast slowing sales.
But investors may have missed an even more ominous sign. The Economic Cycle Research Institute said this week its leading measure of home prices -- which it says “nailed” the 2006 housing bust in real time -- indicates now “there is a real risk prices will actually fall.”
The graph of growth of the ECRI’s U.S. leading home price index was already pointing down when it was last publicly released in October and indicated the worst home price outlook since 2009.
The “downturn was already quite dramatic (in October), and since then it has fallen off a cliff,” the ECRI said. “If home prices do fall nationally -- joining recent drops on the west coast and a handful of other states -- the ramifications for the economy at large could be serious.”
2. Delinquent Farm Loans at 9-Year High
As the stock market hangs on every word about the U.S.-China trade war, the impact of the battle is surfacing in the U.S. economy.
The latest figures from the Agriculture Department’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) -- a lender of last resort to riskier agricultural borrowers -- showed the delinquency for FSA direct loans rose to 19.4% in January from 16.5% a year earlier. That's the highest default rate in at least eight years.
At the heart of the problem is falling crop prices. President Donald Trump's trade war with China has not been the root of the demise, but it has accelerated the decline.
U.S. farmers, considered a Trump political stronghold, found themselves in China's crosshairs as the trade war intensified last year.
Exports to China have fallen more than 90% in the 2018-2019 crop year, according to USDA data, prompting more famers to turn to banks for financial lifelines in the form of short-term loans and debt refinancing.
The amount of debt held by America’s farmers has risen to $409 billion from $385 billion last year, levels not seen since the 1980s, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said on Wednesday.
But many have suggested that steady farmland real estate prices remain the key to keeping farmer debt-to-asset levels managable, warning that a drop in land prices would push more farmers to the brink of bankruptcy.
So far, there's little to a suggest such a decline.
“You still see high-quality farmland selling for higher prices ... Just like the farm bankruptcies, (the) farmland price story is similar: Some states have seen an increase, some see a decrease,” USDA Chief Economist Robert Johansson said.
3. Mall Shoppers Cutting Back on Burgers 
The death of the American shopping mall has been almost an annual prediction in the financial markets and the theory has only gained momentum in the face of increasing dominance by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
While dwindling in numbers, malls have shown resilience, though, especially mega-malls like the Mall of America in Minnesota or the King of Prussia Mall in Pennsylvania.
And the latest data showed that the number of empty spaces in malls may be stabilizing.
Mall vacancies were up in the fourth quarter, but by just 10.2%, confounding forecasts for a surge in the wake of closures from Sears (OTC:SHLDQ) and Kmart.
“(T)he doomsday prognostications proved to be overblown,” commercial real estate research provider Reis said in its report.
But  Red Robin Gourmet  Burgers' (NASDAQ:RRGB) earnings report this week raised a red flag about any confidence in a strong mall resurgence.
The fast-casual chain singled out malls as a specific weakness in its latest quarter and 2018.
“2018 was a very challenging sales year and the fourth quarter continued that trend, buoyed somewhat by better than expected growth in our new catering business, but dragged down by weakness at in-line mall locations,” the company said.
What may be particularly worrying for landlords is that the progression of the mall from money-losing legacy stores like Sears and Toys ‘R’ Us was expected to happen with franchises that resonate more like Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK). But Red Robin, which would seem to fit into that new category, can't find any traction there.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said they are sending teams to investigate a fatal crash in Florida on Friday involving a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc car and a semi-trailer.
The two agencies are investigating several crashes involving the use of Tesla's driver assistance system Autopilot including a fatal crash in California in March 2018. NHTSA, the auto safety regulator, can demand a recall if it believes a defect poses an unreasonable risk, while the NTSB makes safety recommendations.
A spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Department that oversees NHTSA said late on Friday that ""NHTSA’s Crash Investigation Division assigned a Special Crash Investigation team to investigate the crash"", while the NTSB said it is sending a team of three ""to conduct a safety investigation"".
A report on Friday's crash released by the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Department did not indicate if Autopilot was engaged at the time of the crash that killed the 50-year-old Tesla Model 3 owner.
The report said the Tesla struck a tractor trailer and the roof was sheared off as it passed underneath the trailer and came to a rest three-tenths of a mile south of the collision. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene.

The NTSB said in September 2017 Tesla lacked proper safeguards that allowed the driver “to use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed and the system gave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention.”

In January 2017, NHTSA said its review found no evidence of defects in the 2016 fatal Autopilot crash that would require a recall.

The stock market regulator late on Friday published the rules for the tech board after considering opinions from the public on draft regulations that were introduced on Jan. 30. They took effect immediately.
Listings on the new board will be done according to a registration system that limits official powers to control the timing of IPOs. In addition, some companies that are not yet profitable will be allowed to go public.
Those provisions alleviate two major impediments to companies seeking to tap existing equity capital markets in China.
China has long wanted its tech champions to list closer to home, but many of the best-known Chinese technology firms, including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Co Ltd and Tencent Holdings, chose to raise funds in international markets.
New York and Hong Kong accounted for nearly 70 percent of the money raised through Chinese IPOs last year.
In another sign plans for the new board are progressing, the financial news website Caixin reported that the Shanghai Stock Exchange had completed recruiting employees for the board and they were slated to start work in mid-March.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - PG&E Corp investor BlueMountain Capital Management LLC on Friday named 13 people it hopes to install as directors at the embattled power utility weeks after the company filed for bankruptcy in the wake of California's catastrophic wildfires. 
The hedge fund's group of director nominees includes an expert in resolving victim claims, a former treasurer of the state of California, a prominent hedge fund manager, and people with banking and energy industry expertise.
BlueMountain, which owns roughly 8 million PG&E shares, in January announced plans for a proxy contest, criticizing the company for filing for Chapter 11 protection, a move it called unnecessary and harmful to investors.
The company and the hedge fund have been talking and last week agreed to extended the deadline to nominate directors to Friday. 
PG&E said on Friday it has had a ""constructive dialogue"" with shareholders and stakeholders. 
PG&E previously promised to make board changes, saying that only five of its current directors would stand for re-election at the May 21 annual meeting.
By offering to refresh its own board, PG&E could be trying to curry favor with big investors who may not be ready to back the hedge fund's slate, analysts said.
BlueMountain's slate includes former California Treasurer Phil Angelides who chaired the U.S. Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission to uncover the causes of the financial crisis and lawyer Kenneth Feinberg, known for administering compensation to victims including those of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Christopher Hart, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, Jeffrey Ubben, who founded $15 billion San Francisco-based hedge fund ValueAct Capital and is now focusing on sustainability, and clean energy expert David Crane, a former chief executive at NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG), are also on the list. 
California business and civic leaders Marjorie Bowen, a former Houlihan Lokey banker, and Alvaro Aguirre, a former banker and lawyer who has managed several corporate turnarounds, were also named. 
The group also includes Fred Buckman, Donald Chappel, Tanuja Dehne, Dick Rosenblum, Mark Lerdal and Barbara Lloyd. 
With a new board and fresh oversight, the hedge fund forecasted that the company's share price could trade at $50 in the future. It closed at $17.03 on Thursday.
PG&E faces crushing liabilities related to deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that killed dozens of people and destroyed thousands of homes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration filed another salvo at the World Trade Organization on Friday, saying U.S. trade policy was not going to be dictated by the international body and defending its use of tariffs to pressure China and other trade partners.
A report drawn up by the U.S. Trade Representative outlining the White House's trade agenda for 2019 said the United States will continue to use the Switzerland-based WTO to challenge what it sees as unfair practices.
However, ""the United States remains an independent nation, and our trade policy will be made here – not in Geneva. We will not allow the WTO Appellate Body and dispute settlement system to force the United States into a straitjacket of obligations to which we never agreed,"" the report said.
The United States has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports to press its demands for changes to what Washington sees as China's unfair policies on intellectual property protections, technology transfers, industrial subsidies and domestic market access. 
China has challenged the Trump administration's tariffs in the WTO, arguing that they violate its agreed rules. The case is likely to be ultimately decided by the WTO's Appellate Body, the world's top trade court.
The United States must be allowed the ""policy space"" to address trade problems, the report said.
""That policy space must include the ability to use tariffs or other forms of leverage to persuade other countries to take our concerns seriously,"" it said.
The report was not explicit about how the United States would respond to a ruling against it on the issue.
The report was published a day after a WTO adjudication panel handed Washington a major victory over China, ruling that China's domestic price supports for wheat and rice constituted an excessive subsidy and violated WTO obligations.
APPELLATE JUDGES
The United States has argued for years that WTO judges have routinely broken with procedures and exceeded their mandates, imposing new obligations on members. 
In an effort to force reforms, Washington has routinely blocked the appointment of judges to its Appellate Body, a process that requires consensus among member states. If continued, the tactic will render the body inoperable by December, when terms end for two of the remaining three judges. WTO rules require three judges to hear appeals.
While Trump's complaints have found some sympathy among other WTO members, blocking new appointments is widely opposed as it risks crippling a guardian of international law. Friday's report did not mention U.S. actions to block judges. 
The report defended U.S. actions to impose steel and aluminum tariffs on national security grounds, adding that national security exceptions have long been recognized at the WTO and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

If the WTO were to overrule the U.S. determination that the tariffs were essential to national security, it ""would threaten serious damage to the multilateral trading system,"" it said.

215,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 08:08PM ET</span>",Wall St. Week Ahead: U.S. stock reign may not last over other regions,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock prices are outpacing those in most other regions to start 2019, but the gap is narrow and some investors are eyeing potential catalysts to tip the scales to the rest of the world.
Investors say several factors could sway performance in favor of other developed or emerging markets, including slowing U.S. profit growth, a weaker U.S. dollar, improving economies in China and Europe and resolution of global trade tensions.
The 11 percent gain this year for the S&P 500 is helping the U.S. benchmark index expand its global edge since the U.S. equities bull run began a decade ago.
U.S. stocks are near 70-year highs relative to other global developed markets, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
""For the most part, it has been a pretty consistent trend that U.S. outperforms non U.S.,"" said Nathan Thooft, head of asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management in Boston. ""The reality is, though, it can’t go on forever.""
U.S. corporate earnings are expected to climb 5.3 percent this year after rising 24.4 percent in 2018, according to global markets research at FTSE Russell.
European companies, excluding the UK, are expected to see profits rise 9.1 percent this year, while profits for emerging market companies are projected to rise 13.9 percent.
Moreover, the S&P 500 is trading at 16.4 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, more expensive than the 13.4 times for Europe's STOXX and 11.5 times for the MSCI emerging markets index, according to Refinitiv data. Moreover, the S&P 500's valuation gap over those indexes is wider than it has been historically.
""People are willing to pay a very hefty premium for the U.S. stock market,"" said Lance Humphrey, a portfolio manager with USAA Asset Management. ""It’s our view that the fundamentals in the U.S. don’t necessarily justify the degree of that premium.""
That valuation difference has been one attraction in particular for emerging markets, which was the ""most crowded trade"" in a BAML fund manager survey last month.
The strength of the U.S. dollar is another factor for emerging markets, many of which have debt denominated in the greenback. For U.S. investors, a strong dollar also requires a costly currency translation for investments in international funds.
Investors say the dollar has held up surprisingly well this year, given the more dovish stance by the Federal Reserve, but any weakening in the U.S. currency could be a boon for stocks outside the country.
Resolution of the trade dispute between the United States and China could provide another boost, as investors have become optimistic about a deal between the world's two largest economies.
“If China and the U.S. can reach a good agreement, that will actually propel emerging markets and have a bigger impact on emerging markets than on the U.S. market,"" said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank. ""All the emerging markets are somewhat dependent on China because that’s their largest trading partner for the most part.”
The potential for a positive trade resolution has helped fuel the 22 percent run this year for China's Shanghai Composite index, which has outperformed both U.S. and other major world indices.
Europe's STOXX has climbed 10 percent this year. A weak economic outlook - the Euro Zone economy is expected to expand 1.3 percent this year, just over half the U.S. rate - along with political uncertainty in Britain and elsewhere have pressured equities.
Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management, last week issued a report saying European equities should top U.S. equities, noting that ""modest economic growth forecasts look achievable.""
“The best thing going for Europe right now is no one has expectations,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. ""What that means is a little bit of good news could go a long way.""
One factor driving U.S. outperformance this year is the heavy weight of technology stocks in the country's indexes. Nearly one-quarter of MSCI's U.S. index is tech companies, compared with 15 percent in financials. By contrast, MSCI's European Union index has a 19 percent weighting in financials and 6 percent in tech.
Tech and other high-growth stocks have been in favor, but some investors anticipate a shift toward financials and other value stocks, so Europe could see a relative boost.
Of course, not everyone agrees. Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, doubts that financials will lead this year, which is one reason he prefers the S&P 500 over indexes for other global regions.
Indeed, Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird, says geographic diversification away from the U.S. market has hurt returns, so investors ""are going to be a little bit gun shy"" to allocate to the rest of the world.

As it stands, Manulife's Thooft said, “there is no doubt that U.S. assets are over-owned.""

216,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 07:56PM ET</span>","Canada approves Huawei extradition proceedings, China seethes","By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian government, as expected, on Friday approved extradition proceedings against the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, prompting a furious reaction from China.
Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was detained in Vancouver last December and is under house arrest. In late January the U.S. Justice Department charged Meng and Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.
Meng is due to appear in a Vancouver court at 10 a.m. Pacific time (1800 GMT) on March 6, when a date will be set for her extradition hearing.
""Today, department of Justice Canada officials issued an authority to proceed, formally commencing an extradition process in the case of Ms. Meng Wanzhou,"" the government said in a statement.
China, whose relations with Canada have deteriorated badly over the affair, denounced the decision and repeated previous demands for Meng's release.
U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said Washington thanked the Canadian government for its assistance. ""We greatly appreciate Canada's steadfast commitment to the rule of law,"" she said in a statement.
Legal experts had predicted the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would give the go-ahead for extradition proceedings, given the close judicial relationship between Canada and the United States.
But it could be years before Meng is sent to the United States, since Canada's slow-moving justice system allows many decisions to be appealed.
A final decision will likely come down to the federal justice minister, who will face the choice of angering the United States by rejecting the extradition bid, or China by accepting it.
Professor Wesley Wark of the University of Ottawa's Graduate School of Public and International Affairs said ""the Canadians will take a beating throughout this whole process"" from China.
""I suspect the Trudeau government is desperately hoping that the Americans reach a deal with the Chinese,"" he said by phone.
U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters in December he would intervene if it served national security interests or helped close a trade deal with China, prompting Ottawa to stress the extradition process should not be politicized. Last week Trump played down the idea of dropping the charges.
After Meng's detention, China arrested two Canadians on national security grounds, and a Chinese court later sentenced to death a Canadian man who previously had only been jailed for drug smuggling.
Brock University professor Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat who served two postings in China, said Beijing was likely to retaliate further.
""They're not going to take this lying down ... one shudders to think what the consequences could be,"" he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp, saying Beijing might crack down on Canadian canola shipments or stop Chinese students from going to Canada.
Ottawa rejects Chinese calls to release Meng, saying it cannot interfere with the judiciary.
""The Chinese side is utterly dissatisfied with and firmly opposes the issuance of (the) authority to proceed,"" the embassy in Ottawa said in a statement. 
Beijing had earlier questioned the state of judicial independence in Canada, noting the government faces accusations that it tried to intervene to stop a corruption trial.
Canadian Justice Minister David Lametti declined to comment.
Huawei was not immediately available for comment.

Meng's lawyers said they were disappointed and described the U.S. charges as politically motivated.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman pocketed at least $567.8 million in 2018 dividends and compensation, making him yet again the private equity industry's highest earner, a regulatory filing showed on Friday.
The was below the roughly $786 million Schwarzman, 72, took home in 2017. His net worth is pegged by Forbes at $13.2 billion. 
The private equity veteran received $69.1 million in compensation from Blackstone in 2018, largely due to investment gains. 
Blackstone no longer discloses the dividend payment to the class of stock Schwarzman owns, but based on the $2.15 per common unit payout, he received almost $500 million in dividends. The dividend for Schwarzman's class of stock has historically been higher than for common units. 
Schwarzman last year elevated Jonathan Gray, 49, who turned Blackstone into the world's biggest real estate investor, to president and chief operating officer, setting him up as his successor as CEO. 
In 2018, Gray received total compensation of $87.8 million. His bonus was $10 million, down from $25.8 million a year earlier. This is due to Gray opting to receive $30 million in stock which will vest over the course of 5-and-a-half years. 
Schwarzman earned much more than other co-founders of private equity firms. Apollo Global Management LP CEO Leon Black received $252,617 in compensation and $169.7 million from dividends in 2018. 
 Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) LP's three co-founders, David Rubenstein, William Conway and Daniel D'Aniello, combined took home roughly $180 million, with the vast majority of earnings from dividend payments.

KKR & Co LP co-founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts received $99.5 million and $103.9 million, respectively. This was more evenly distributed between compensation and dividends.

218,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 06:30PM ET</span>",Cultural clash overshadowing Barrick's Newmont bid,"By John Tilak and Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - Conflicting cultures and management styles are overshadowing Barrick Gold Corp's $18 billion bid for rival  Newmont Mining  Corp (NYSE:NEM), becoming factors just as important to the deal's success as whether or not the pair's lucrative assets in Nevada and elsewhere fit well together.
Mudslinging started almost as soon as the hostile all-stock, no-premium bid was announced on Monday. One rival executive compared the tension between Barrick Chief Executive Mark Bristow and Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg to the Hatfields and McCoys, two 19th Century U.S. families whose members held a grudge for generations.
""Newmont shareholders shouldn't risk what they have and need for what they don't have and don't need,"" Goldberg told Reuters on Friday. 
Newmont's board continues to evaluate Barrick's offer, Goldberg said. He reiterated what he had said earlier in the week that all options were on the table, including a Newmont bid for Barrick.
Bristow was not available for an interview on Friday.
At the heart of the debate is Nevada, where Barrick and Newmont have owned neighboring mines since the 1980s. Newmont said it prefers a joint venture in the state, a plan which Barrick says would be too complicated and not financially beneficial to all shareholders.
The logic of combining the company's Nevada assets seems clear to both sides, but the sticking point is control. 
""If those fences and armed guards were removed, you'd have trucks from Barrick's mine not drive hours to get to the crusher and roaster, but they would have to go two miles to Newmont's,"" said an person familiar with Barrick's thinking.
Bristow and Goldberg were emailing each other as recently as late January about a potential Nevada venture before Bristow stopped responding, Goldberg said. 
""I was hopeful that Mark, as another miner, would be able to sit down and do a (Nevada joint venture) deal as a point of logic,"" said Goldberg. ""But then he dropped a hostile, no-premium bid.""
Bristow, for his part, said in an interview earlier this week that Goldberg did not show up for recently planned meetings to discuss Nevada.
'FIGHT TO THE DEATH'
Barrick, which two months ago closed a $6.1 billion buyout of  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS), has encouraged Newmont to ditch a previously announced $10 billion takeover of Canada's Goldcorp Inc. 
Barrick has historically relied on acquisitions for growth, amassing billions of dollars of debt that it has been working to pay down. Newmont in recent years has focused on organic growth and financial discipline, although the Goldcorp bid breaks with past practice.
Those divergent strategies would be hard to meld even in a friendly proposal, but become that much more difficult amid the culture clash, according to multiple investors and bankers, with the acrimony threatening to scuttle the deal as it did when the companies last tried to combine in 2014. 
""Newmont will fight to the death to stay independent,"" a banking source said.
Newmont's shares have gained 39 percent in the past five years, compared to a 26 percent drop for Barrick's stock and a 3 percent drop in gold prices. 
Some Newmont shareholders question Barrick's claim that the deal will generate more than $7 billion in synergies. 
""We have no reason to have confidence in (Bristow's) ability to manage such a vastly more-complicated company,"" said James Rasteh of Coast Capital Management LP, which said it holds more than 100,000 Newmont shares.
Bristow said in an interview earlier this week that his record at Africa-focused Randgold speaks for itself. Some investors agree.
""Newmont is a company in need of a shakeup,"" said John Ing of Maison Placements, which declined to say how many Barrick shares it holds. 
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), a top-three investor in both companies, declined to comment. Flossbach Von Storch, a large investor in both companies, has said it supports a friendly deal but could not be reached for comment on Friday.
Newmont would have to pay Goldcorp a $650 million break-up fee if it pulls its offer. Ironically, that would be the only cash that would change hands were the Barrick-Newmont deal to move forward, irking some Newmont shareholders. 

Antitrust experts do not expect any deal to face regulatory pressure.

219,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 06:22PM ET</span>",U.S. companies adapt to 'endless' China tariffs,"By Timothy Aeppel and Chris Prentice
(Reuters) - U.S. manufacturers are accelerating their shift out of China, coming to terms with a new reality: the Trump administration's tariffs will not go away any time soon.
President Donald Trump’s lead trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, warned lawmakers on Wednesday that the United States would need to keep the threat of stiff tariffs on China in place for years, even if a trade deal is inked, as part of an enforcement mechanism that would include frequent reviews of whether China was abiding by any agreement.
That confirms what many companies have already concluded. Even if the hot phase of this trade war passes, tensions will linger and continue to reshape the economic relationship between the world’s two largest economies.
""As you look at the way these negotiations are shaping up, you must certainly think: not only will it take a while for the talks to reach their full conclusion, but there's going to be enforcement mechanisms,"" said Steve Lamar, executive vice president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. ""I would imagine punitive tariffs are going to be with us for a while.""
Apparel and footwear manufacturers have been shifting their production mix to factories in other countries like Vietnam, Indonesia and Egypt for much of the past decade, but the push has intensified due to the trade war, Lamar said. The United States has not hit most finished apparel and footwear with punitive tariffs, but ""even if the threat (of more tariffs) never materializes and it’s always out there, who wants to live with that threat?"" he said.
It will take years, however, for large manufacturers and retailers to build new supply networks. Many companies have held off raising prices to offset tariffs, in hope that they would go away.
As it becomes clear that the risk of tariffs will linger, more companies are taking steps to mitigate them and accepting trade conflict with China as a new fact of life, according to businesses and trade groups interviewed by Reuters.
'BURNING PLATFORM'
One company already moving some production out of China is Bissell Inc., the vacuum maker. CEO Mark Bissell said long before tariffs, he was looking for alternatives due to rising costs in China. 
Tariffs, he said, are the “burning platform” forcing him to jump. Bissell expects to have some of the company's China production shifted to Vietnam, Malaysia and Mexico by the end of the year, and said Lighthizer’s comments confirm what he was already doing.
“The geopolitical issues between the two countries will continue to be large and with so much at stake, the relationship will be touchy going forward,” Bissell said in an email. “Diversifying the supply chain makes continued sense and I don’t see a reversal of course.”
Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council in Beijing, said even in the event of a trade deal, it was possible the persistent threat of tariffs would continue to push U.S. companies’ supply chains out of the country. Similarly, Chinese firms are likely reconsidering their reliance on U.S. companies, he told Reuters.
It remains unclear whether the United States will prevail in its trade war against China. Lighthizer, testifying to the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, said a great deal of work remains to hammer out a deal, including agreeing on how it would be enforced.
Many companies are stuck in a wait-and-see mode, but the realization that there will not be a quick fix is growing.
""The longer it goes on, the more likely (the China trade battle) becomes more permanent,"" said Todd Stucke, senior vice president of marketing, product support and strategic projects at Kubota Tractor Corp., the U.S. arm of Japanese tractor maker Kubota Corp. ""I’m hoping it doesn’t.""
NO EASY SHIFT
Shifting supply chains is no small task for companies that have spent years investing in countries like China, said the apparel and footwear group's Lamar.
On Thursday, shoemaker Crocs Inc highlighted the threat of the Trump Administration's trade policy changes, especially the tariffs.
""It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes,"" the company said.
Some companies are resorting to the price hikes they have been delaying. Kubota held off raising prices until now in hopes that the costs associated with tariffs - including higher prices for imported parts from China - would be short-lived. Kubota has 10 U.S. factories, with seven in Kansas. Its business has been hammered by retaliatory tariffs on U.S. farmers, said Stucke. 

“We held out as long as we could,” he said. The company is implementing across-the-board price increases of 1 to 5 percent, depending on the item, as of Friday.

220,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 06:15PM ET</span>","Lyft's IPO filing shows surging revenue, widening losses","By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Lyft Inc inched closer to becoming the first ride-hailing company to make a stock market debut by releasing its filing for an initial public offering on Friday, revealing to the public a detailed look at its financial performance.
Fast-growing but money-losing Lyft expects to be valued at up to $25 billion in its IPO, sources have said. It is now all but certain to go public before larger but also unprofitable rival Uber Technologies Inc in a test of how investors value the ride-hailing industry.
The 220-page document provides a picture of a company with high growth and improving economics but widening losses. 
Lyft now has nearly 40 percent of the U.S. ride-sharing market, but warned further growth could come at the expense of yet more losses for a company already deep in the red, according to the filing.
The company has managed to grab market share from better-funded Uber, but the filing failed to provide answers to how it will sustain growth or achieve profitability. 
""We will see how they perform as they have to start filing quarterly and managing shareholder expectations,"" said Alex Castelli, managing partner of emerging markets for advisory and accounting firm CohnReznick. 
""Can you achieve the growth expectations? Can you continue to grow at the rate that you've been growing? That's going to be the real measurement stick over time.""
Lyft's revenue was $2.16 billion for 2018, double the previous year and up 528 percent from $343 million in 2016. 
Gross bookings, or the total value of the rides Lyft sells before driver pay is deducted, reached $8.05 billion last year, 76 percent above the prior year and 323 percent above 2016. 
But Lyft posted a loss of $911 million for 2018, which climbed from $688 million in 2017 and $682 million in 2016, according to the filing.
Losses could mount, Lyft cautioned, as it continues to invest and eye a broader international expansion. And even now, seven years after it launched, Lyft subsidizes rides to attract passengers and offers bonuses to enlist drivers.
Still, Lyft has improved its contribution margin to 43 percent in 2018 from 38 percent in 2017, a sign the business is getting more efficient.
Uber in 2018 lost $1.8 billion before taxes, depreciation and other expenses. Its revenue for the year was $11.3 billion and ride bookings were $50 billion. Unlike Lyft, Uber for the last few quarters has shared selected financial data with the public.
Lyft's IPO is being led by JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG and Jefferies Financial Group Inc.
GROWING RIDERSHIP
San Francisco-based Lyft is positioned to become the first IPO from a group of highly valued, venture-backed companies including Pinterest and Slack expected go public this year. 
Lyft expects to be valued at between $20 billion and $25 billion, up from its current $15 billion valuation, sources have told Reuters. Lyft plans to launch its two-week roadshow to pitch potential investors the week of March 18, setting up the company for an early April debut.
At a $25 billion valuation, Lyft would be trading at nearly 12 times its annual revenue. The same multiple would suggest a roughly $135 billion valuation for Uber, whose IPO is likely still several weeks out.
Both Lyft and Uber filed confidentially for an IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in December, a process that gives privately held companies more time to keep their financials secret and reduce their exposure to market fluctuations. 
Companies must release the formal version of the filing before their roadshow.
Lyft has been eager to emphasize its growth to investors over its total revenue. Lyft said that as of December it held 39 percent of the U.S. ride-hailing market, up from 22 percent at the end of 2016.
The company had 30.7 million riders and 1.9 million drivers in more than 300 U.S. and Canadian cities last year. 
Lyft earned on average $36.04 from each of its 18.6 million active riders during the fourth quarter, a 32 percent increase in earnings and 47 percent increase in riders over the same period in 2017.
REVENUE FROM BIKES, SCOOTERS NOT MATERIAL
Lyft does not expect to make much in the near future on its expansion into bike and scooter renting. 
Both Uber and Lyft have invested heavily in bikes and scooters as alternatives to car rides for short trips, hopeful that a transportation option that does not involve paying drivers will prove profitable.
But Lyft's acquisition of bike-sharing company Motivate for $250.9 million last year is not expected to materially increase revenue in the short term. Revenue from Lyft's scooter business was also not material.
The company's IPO includes a dual-class stock structure, with one class of shareholders getting 20 votes per share and another getting just one vote per share. 
Dual-class share structures are increasingly common among technology companies, although Uber got rid of its dual-class stock as part of a broader governance reform. 
Lyft will offer cash bonuses of up to $10,000 to some of its most active drivers with the option to purchase shares in the IPO, a bid to improve relations with drivers. Reuters reported the plan on Thursday. 
Lyft co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer each own about 1.2 million shares. The company's largest shareholder is Rakuten Inc, a Japanese internet company that invested in Lyft in 2015 and made several subsequent investments, and owns a more than 13 percent stake. 
As a private company, Lyft raised nearly $5 billion from investors. Other top shareholders include General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Fidelity Investments, with just under 8 percent stakes each; venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which owns more than 6 percent; and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, with more than 5 percent of shares.

The bond, which matured on Friday, had a $359.87 conversion price, but the electric carmaker's shares closed down 8 percent at $294.79, forcing the company to settle its largest ever debt payment in cash.
Convertible issues give bondholders the right to trade their debt for equity after shares rise over a certain price, allowing holders to benefit from a rising share price, while also offering bond-like protection if it falls.
Friday's payout will make a significant dent in the $3.7 billion in cash Tesla had on hand at the end of 2018. 
Although the carmaker's business is cash-intensive and has historically struggled to remain cash flow positive, Musk has said previously that he would not tap equity markets in the near future. 
Wall Street analysts, however, have predicted Tesla may need to add to its $9.4 billion debt pile if its cash needs remain significant.

Tesla on Thursday offered for the first time a $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan and said its global sales would now be online-only.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co executives and directors have reached a $240 million settlement with U.S. shareholders over the creation by bank employees of millions of unauthorized customer accounts.
The settlement was filed late Thursday with the federal court in San Francisco, and requires a judge's approval.
It resolves claims that the officials breached their fiduciary duties by knowing about or consciously disregarding the bogus accounts, and failing to stop their creation.
Insurers for 20 current and former Wells Fargo executives and directors, including Chief Executive Tim Sloan and his predecessor John Stumpf, will pay the $240 million to the bank. The officials denied wrongdoing.
Wells Fargo spokesman Peter Gilchrist declined to comment on Friday.
The San Francisco-based bank has been beset by scandals over its sales practices since agreeing in September 2016 to pay $190 million to settle government claims that it created the customer accounts without permission.
Outrage over the settlement and the bank's handling of the fallout led to Stumpf's departure. Other sales abuses later surfaced, including Wells Fargo's charging for unnecessary auto insurance and imposing excessive mortgage fees.
The shareholders in Thursday's settlement were led by pension plans in Alabama and Colorado.
Their lawyers called the accord the largest insurer-funded cash settlement in a U.S. shareholder derivative lawsuit, surpassing News Corp's $139 million accord in 2013 over its handling of a phone hacking scandal in Britain.
Shareholders bring derivative lawsuits on behalf of companies, typically when the defendants are corporate officers or board members, with proceeds going to the companies.
Last May, Wells Fargo reached a $480 million settlement of a securities fraud lawsuit brought by shareholders over the unauthorized accounts.
On Wednesday, Wells Fargo said it might have to pay up to $2.7 billion more than it had set aside as of Dec. 31 to resolve legal matters, up from $2.2 billion three months earlier.
In January, Wells Fargo issued a report saying it had improved risk oversight and accountability, including by eliminating sales goals and clawing back compensation from executives.
Sloan nonetheless remains under pressure, and faces calls from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat running in the 2020 presidential campaign, for his ouster.

The case is In re Wells Fargo & Co Shareholder Derivative Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-05541.

Amazon is also exploring a strategy of strengthening its new supermarket brand by purchasing regional grocery chains that operate at least a dozen stores, according to the report.
Shares of grocers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) were down 0.99 percent while Costco (NASDAQ:COST) traded up 0.21 percent up. Kroger (NYSE:KR) traded down over 4 percent. Amazon was up 1.68 percent.
Amazon, which bought the upscale Whole Foods chain for $13.7 billion in 2017, is now in talks to open grocery stores in shopping centers in San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, the WSJ report said.
The online retail giant plans to open its first store in Los Angeles as early as the end of the year, and has already signed leases for at least two other grocery locations with openings planned for early next year, the Journal reported.
The new stores were not intended to compete directly with Whole Foods, according to the report. 
Amazon declined to comment.
""We're not surprised,"" said David Bujnicki, in charge of investor relations at  Kimco Realty  Corp (NYSE:KIM) , an owner or manager of 437 mostly grocery-anchored shopping centers.
Amazon is slow but deliberate when rolling out new brick and mortar concepts, he said. He added that a new grocer would validate the need for physical stores, a business that has been hit hard by e-commerce, whose surge Amazon has led.
Amazon rival Walmart, the largest grocer in the country, has not been caught off guard as it has been preparing for competition to heat up for nearly two years, according to a source with knowledge of the company's business plans.
""Their (Amazon's) ambitions in this space have been known for a long time,"" the source said.

The prospect of more competition has spurred Walmart to action, the source said. Walmart will have grocery pickup service at 3,100 stores by next January, and offer grocery deliveries from about 800 more stores by the end of the year, bringing the total number of stores offering delivery service to 1,600 stores.

Southwest's new service will include inner-island travel in direct competition to Hawaiian Airlines, as well as a combination of flights from Oakland, Sacramento, San Diego and San Jose to four destinations in Hawaii.
Southwest, already a go-to airline for many travelers within California with over 60-percent market share, has been trying to expand its West Coast leisure portfolio under a growth drive that has also included new flights to Mexico.
""Hawaii allows us to give more leisure options to our customers on the West Coast, which has been heavy on the business side,"" Andrew Watterson, chief revenue officer for Southwest, said in a phone interview.
That contrasts with Southwest's portfolio on the East Coast of the United States, where it has built a reputation as a low-cost carrier for leisure destinations in Florida from cities in the U.S. Northeast. 
The Hawaii launch comes later than Southwest had hoped after a partial U.S. government shutdown earlier in the year delayed the certification process needed for new over-ocean flights. 
As a result, the Dallas-based carrier missed a key booking window for travel to the Hawaiian islands, which Watterson said passengers tend to reserve months in advance, rather than days or weeks. 
This means Southwest has had to offer lower-than-average introductory fares through mid-June to stimulate passenger traffic.
""After that we'll have the traditional Southwest low fares in the subsequent booking period,"" Watterson said.
While the government over-water certification opens the door for other long-haul flights for Southwest, Watterson said the plan is to focus on Hawaii for the time being, noting that there is no extra aircraft right now to service new routes.
Southwest will begin flying to Hawaii with its Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 NG planes and plans to switch to 737-MAX 8 aircraft later this year, he said.

The launch comes as Southwest grapples with a bitter labor dispute with its mechanics union that has led to a spike in out-of-service aircraft, forcing flight cancellations and delays.

227,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 05:25PM ET</span>","Stocks - S&P Closes Above 2,800 for First Time Since November","Investing.com - The S&P 500 racked up solid gains Friday to close above a key level, shrugging off data pointing to slowing U.S. economic and global growth as hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal kept risk appetite alive.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.43%. The S&P 500 added 0.69%, closing above 2,800 for the first time since Nov. 8. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.83%.
Despite the rally, the Dow finished down slightly -- 0.02% -- for the week, after nine-straight weeks of gains. The S&P 500 was up 0.4%, its fifth gain in a row. The Nasdaq added 0.9% on the week and has seen gains for nine-straight weeks.
As Wall Street got a new month underway, traders were reminded of headwinds that could hinder the path to swashbuckling gains. One of the biggest: The U.S. economy continued to show signs of a slowdown.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, fell 0.5% in December. ISM manufacturing data for February missed expectations of 55.5.
The fall in personal spending was the largest since 2009, BMO said in note. The bank added the report ""serves to give more credence to the abysmal retail sales figure released a couple weeks ago.""
But the consumer's ""trepidation"" going into year-end is more than sufficient to keep the Federal Reserve on the sidelines for the time being, BMO said.
The downbeat data arrived after China's economy showed a fall in factory activity for the third month in a row. However, the pace of the slowdown had moderated, raising hopes a bottom was forming.
Sentiment on Wall Street was boosted by signs that U.S. and Chinese negotiators are closer to reaching a trade agreement.
""We made so much progress last week when the Chinese were here,"" National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told Fox Business Friday. ""The agreements made last week represent tremendous progress on IP theft, on forced technology transfer, on ownership, on cyber interference and, maybe most importantly, on enforcement.""
Beyond trade, the markets were powered by a rise in energy stocks despite a fall in oil prices on signs of weakness in China's economy.
Retailers also led the charge for the major averages thanks to a 16.2% rally in retailer Gap.
Gap (NYSE:GPS) said Thursday it would split into two pieces, spinning off its fast-growing budget brand Old Navy into a separate company. The other company, which has yet to be named, will include the Gap brand, Athleta, Banana Republic, Intermix and Hill City. The news arrived as the retailer revealed mixed results, beating estimates compiled by Investing.com on the bottom line, but missing on the top line.
In other company news, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) reportedly plans to open dozens of grocery stores, with Los Angeles touted as the location of the first store, The Wall Street Journal reported. The news sent shares of supermarket giant Kroger (NYSE:KR) sliding 4.47%. Amazon rose nearly 2%.

Dentsply Sirona (NASDAQ:XRAY), Gap (NYSE:GPS) and Masco (NYSE:MAS) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.

228,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",Tyson Bets on Omnivores With New Alternative Protein Business,"(Bloomberg) --  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN)., the largest U.S. meat producer, is getting into the vegetarian protein business.
The company plans to accelerate and develop its own alternative-protein business line, and every kind of protein is on the table from legumes and peas to mushrooms and insects, according to Justin Whitmore, Tyson’s chief sustainability officer. Formerly with McKinsey & Co., he was also named head of Tyson’s ""alternative protein"" business earlier this week.
""We’re going to be making significant investments in the space,"" Whitmore said in an interview with Bloomberg. ""The companies and ecosystem that are in place to provide protein to the world can do the same thing for alternative protein -- the mechanics of the supply chain all the way from the farm to your plate don’t necessarily change.""
Food giants have been investing increasingly in vegetarian and vegan brands this year, as plant-based food sales grew 20 percent to $3.3 billion in 2018, according to data from Nielsen and the Plant Based Foods Association.
Through its ventures unit, Tyson has already made deals with vegetarian burger-maker Beyond Meat and mushroom protein company MycoProtein. But Whitmore said it’s now ready to develop its own products and expects it to be a ""material part of the business"" going forward.
Farming Evolution
The company hasn’t decided on brand names, whether to target food-service or retail, or what kind of protein it will use. But it says the move is part of a necessity for agriculture to evolve. Agriculture -- as one of the world’s biggest sources of global greenhouse gas emissions -- faces significant supply threats in a warming world.
Whitmore said the company, which largely relies on independent farmers, wants to help its supply chain diversify and expects consumers in the future will be open to all kinds of protein -- even from a large meat company.
""Alternative protein is going to be a part of the larger protein growth landscape globally,"" he said. ""You’re going to see chicken, pork, turkey or beef and alternative proteins, rather than an either-or situation."""
229,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 04:43PM ET</span>",Tesla enters uncharted territory after move to dismantle store network,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's move to dismantle its network of high-end showrooms as part of a plan to launch the long-awaited cheaper version of its Model 3 sedan has pushed the electric carmaker into uncharted territory for an industry that has long relied on physical stores to move the metal.
Retailers from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to traditional automakers have trumpeted the benefits of physical stores, and Apple and automakers also rely heavily on advertising, which Tesla has eschewed, making the electric carmaker an outlier in its dependence on the web.
As Tesla pushes to broaden its appeal and drive up sales with the arrival of the $35,000 Model 3, the impact of the store closings announced on Thursday will play out over time, answering questions about whether a national physical footprint is necessary in an increasingly digital world, analysts and investors said on Friday.
""Customers are becoming increasingly comfortable making purchases online, and that is especially true for Tesla,"" Chief Executive Elon Musk said in an email to employees, which CNBC posted online. 
However, some analysts and investors question whether Tesla closing most of its 250 stores was the panicked decision of a company seeking to build the lower-cost model profitably. Shares in Tesla closed 7.8 percent lower to $294.79 on Friday. 
It was only last month that Musk said a $35,000 version that could be sold profitably was perhaps six months away. And in the company's annual report released last month, Tesla talked about growing its network of stores.
""There's a bit of a leap of faith that's required to have confidence that the moving from a physical distribution model to an online distribution model will succeed,"" Tom Vandeventer, portfolio manager with Tocqueville Opportunity Fund, said in a telephone interview. He has owned Tesla stock in the past and still follows the company closely.
""People like to go to car showrooms and kick the wheels and sit in the car,"" he added. 
However, Musk pointed out in the email that 78 percent of all Model 3 orders were placed online and 82 percent of customers bought such models without ever taking a test drive. He said shifting to an online sales model, cutting jobs and reducing spending on marketing will allow Tesla to offer the lower vehicle price. Tesla also said Thursday it now expects to record a loss in the first quarter. 
To overcome any remaining hesitation, Musk said Tesla would make it easier for customers to return a car within seven days or 1,000 miles for a full refund. 
""Given its seeming abruptness, it does not appear that yesterday's announcement was made from a position of strength,"" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi Jr said in a research note entitled, ""The $35k Model 3 - Genius or Desperation?"" 
Vandeventer still likes Tesla's innovative, forward-thinking nature, but worries about the short term.
""Cutting prices is more often a sign of weakness unless you are Amazon,"" he said. ""And only Amazon is Amazon."" 
Adding to the pressure Tesla faces is the growing level of competition from Chinese electric carmakers as well as established players like Volkswagen's Audi and Porsche brands, and Jaguar Land Rover.
Meanwhile, U.S. dealers remain sanguine about their position in the sales chain.
""We still believe that the franchised dealer model is by far the best way to sell, distribute and service new vehicles,"" National Automotive Dealers Association spokesman Jared Allen said. ""The vast majority of consumers want to do some combination of both online and traditional shopping for new vehicles.""
Since unveiling the Model 3 in 2016, Musk has been promising a $35,000 version. A lower-priced Model 3 is seen as critical to Tesla's long-term viability as it needs to reach more customers who can afford the vehicles to offset slowing sales of costlier sedans.

The lower price could expand the Model 3 market by about 600,000 cars in the United States alone, based on historical sales figures for similarly priced sedans, Baird analyst Ben Kalo said in a research note. However, the lower-cost model also could squeeze profit margins at a time when Tesla has said it is targeting 25 percent margins for the vehicle some time this year.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - JupiterMLP LLC, one of several companies proposing to build oil export terminals along the U.S. Gulf Coast, has secured new financial backing from a global private equity firm, an executive said on Thursday, even as it faces two separate lawsuits, including one for breach of contract. 
Last October, Jupiter MLP said it had secured financing to build a 650-mile (1,046 km) oil pipeline from West Texas to the Gulf Coast. It has also proposed an export terminal near Brownsville, in South Texas. Charon System Advisors agreed to fund the pipeline construction, it said at the time. 
It has since been sued by Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY), which claimed a JupiterMLP affiliate ""continues to hold on to millions of dollars that belong to Occidental"" despite a promise to pay the money from an expected financing, according to a Feb. 12 lawsuit filed in Harris County district court. 
Macquarie Group Ltd separately sued in January for breach of contract seeking $17.4 million for a storage contract termination and for unpaid bills for crude oil sales. 
Spokespeople for Occidental and Macquarie declined to comment on the lawsuits. 
Albert Johnson, president of Jupiter Pipeline, declined in an interview this week to comment on the disputes. However, he said the company has ""secured a large equity commitment from a global private equity firm,"" but declined to identify the investor or disclose the amount of the commitment.
""I know the rumors in the market,"" Johnson said. ""'It's an expensive project. Where are they going to get the money?'"" 
""We have that commitment in hand,"" he said, adding Charon is ""still there and able to participate"" in the equity investment. 
Charon did not respond to requests for comment. 
Addison, Texas-based Jupiter on Thursday extended the deadline for shippers to book space on its proposed pipeline to the Port of Brownsville. The extension, to May 31, will allow more time for companies to review pipeline contracts, Johnson said. 
""The downside of an export terminal there is there's only going to be one pipeline going to Brownsville,"" said Sandy Fielden, an analyst at Morningstar. ""Is there enough crude coming that way to justify the project? There are very limited options there."" 
The pipeline is projected to be in operation beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the company said this week. It plans to apply for permits to build an offshore terminal with operations projected to begin in the second quarter of 2021.

231,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 04:18PM ET</span>",U.S. trade chief courts auto union to back North American trade pact,"By Ben Klayman and David Shepardson
DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and his staff will head to Michigan next week to meet with United Auto Workers union leaders in an effort to win labor backing for a new North American free trade deal, the union said on Friday.
Lighthizer is set to meet on Tuesday with union officials in Dearborn to answer questions about the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), UAW officials said. 
A USTR spokesman did not immediately respond on Friday to Reuters' queries about the planned meeting.
Lighthizer said at a congressional hearing on Wednesday that the USMCA is ""clearly better than"" the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that preceded it.
Business leaders and Democrats say gaining labor approval will be critical to winning its final approval in Washington.
If Congress does not pass USMCA, then the United States has ""no credibility at all"" with China or ""on any deals with your other trading partners,"" Lighthizer said at the hearing.
The USMCA deal would boost requirements for North American content for vehicles and requires that 40 percent of vehicle value be made in high-wage areas paying $16 an hour, requiring significant automotive production in the United States and Canada.
Many Democrats argue the agreement needs improvements to ensure that higher labor and environmental standards can be fully enforced before they can support it. The pact has been billed as requiring Mexico to change its labor laws to allow unions with true collective bargaining power a fairer chance to form, a provision aimed at pushing up Mexican wages.
And many Republicans, as well as companies and farm groups, say the administration must agree to drop tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from Canada and Mexico before the agreement can move to a vote. 
The American Automotive Policy Council, which represents General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, said on Friday it is supportive of USMCA and urges ""Congress to pass the implementing legislation.""
In August, U.S. President Donald Trump met with labor leaders, including UAW President Gary Jones, to discuss the trade deal.
In November, Jones said the trade agreement was ""not strong enough,"" citing GM's announcement to end production at five North American plants and cut about 15,000 jobs.
""The 'new' NAFTA needs more input and more work,"" he said in a Nov. 30 statement. ""Our elected leaders owe it to working families in the United States to go back to the table and make this stronger, tighter and enforceable.""
""We need the 'new' NAFTA to make GM and other auto companies rethink mass layoffs while they invest in exploited labor in other countries like Mexico,"" Jones added.

Fiat Chrysler said in January 2018 it would shift production of Ram heavy-duty pickup trucks from Mexico to Michigan in 2020. But this week, the company reversed course saying it would add production of other vehicles in Michigan and build a new assembly plant in Detroit.

232,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 04:10PM ET</span>",Schlumberger Unloaded Its PDVSA IOUs Just Before U.S. Sanctions,"(Bloomberg) -- With Venezuela’s economy in ruins, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) Ltd. moved at the end of last year to sell promissory notes representing $700 million in bills owed by state oil giant PDVSA, just in the nick of time to avoid sanctions that would have complicated the deal.
The world’s largest provider of oilfield services transferred the notes -- essentially IOUs -- to an unidentified buyer in the fourth quarter of 2018 after writing down their worth to about one-fifth of the face value, according to a regulatory filing. In January, the U.S. tightened sanctions on Venezuela and PDVSA that severely limited transactions in their debt.
Joao Felix, a spokesman at Schlumberger, declined to comment on the deal beyond what was in the annual filing. He said in an email Friday that the company’s operations in Venezuela are continuing as normal.
Schlumberger’s promissory notes are one of the latest examples of illiquid Venezuelan assets to switch hands as some firms seek to unwind their exposure to the South American nation. Distressed-debt investors have pounced on the beaten-down securities amid speculation an eventual restructuring will hand them a windfall. Court documents link Connecticut-based hedge fund Contrarian Capital Management to a lawsuit against PDVSA for $182 million of unpaid loans to  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Capital, and Dresser-Rand Co., which makes equipment for oil and gas production, has sued PDVSA for $132.3 million, claiming it defaulted on a 2017 loan.
Schlumberger, based in Houston and Paris, is among a handful of oil firms granted licenses by the U.S. Treasury Department to continue operating in Venezuela through July 27. In 2017, when PDVSA was struggling to meet payments for suppliers, Schlumberger accepted the promissory notes with a three-year term bearing an annual interest rate of 6.5 percent.
Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has also accepted these type of notes in the past as well as Weatherford International, according to a prospectus filed for a planned bond offering.

235,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 03:30PM ET</span>","Ram Sales Gain Aided by Paying Dealers Up to $7,500 Per Truck","(Bloomberg) -- Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s Ram just recorded another big month of U.S. sales, in part by paying dealers as much as $7,500 to get them to do the buying.
The company ran a promotion in the last days of the month on a range of 2019 Ram 1500 pickup models to entice dealers to purchase the trucks for their service-loaner fleets, according to an emailed memo. Fiat Chrysler offered as much as $3,000 cash payments to get dealers to put the trucks into service fleets, and up to $7,500 for when they are moved to dealers’ used-vehicle lots.
Dealers loan service vehicles to customers whose cars are being repaired. Paying dealers big, late-month incentives do more buying than they might otherwise is a tactic that helped BMW AG outsell rival Mercedes in the U.S. luxury market in 2016. Some dealers criticize the programs for artificially inflating sales and undermining their ability to hit future targets the manufacturers set.
Fiat Chrysler is taking a two-pronged approach to gain share in the ultra-competitive pickup market. Its award-winning redesigned Ram 1500 has been a hit with big-spending customers, but it’s also extending production of its older “Ram Classic” pickups through 2019 to go after more budget-conscious buyers.
Ram’s pickups have been closing the gap with General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).’s Chevrolet Silverado, the longtime No. 2 in the full-size truck segment, and even outsold that model line in the last three months of 2018.
“We’re going to keep our pickup trucks competitive in the marketplace, whether that’s through advertising, marketing, incentives, whatever,” Reid Bigland, Fiat Chrysler’s U.S. sales chief, said in an interview in January.
A Fiat Chrysler spokesman said the company doesn’t comment on dealer incentive programs.
Ram pickup sales jumped 20 percent to 39,950 units in February, while overall deliveries for the brand were up 24 percent. GM no longer reports monthly figures to the public and will release quarterly results early next month.
Fiat Chrysler is offering big discounts on its older Ram Classic models. Incentives were about 21.5 percent of average transaction prices in February, compared with 16.1 percent for older model Chevrolet Silverados and 14.3 percent for Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.’s F-150, according to J.D. Power dealer data.
Incentive spending by both Fiat Chrysler and GM probably will decline this year because the companies have introduced redesigned models, said Eric Lyman, chief industry analyst at TrueCar Inc.’s ALG unit. Ford, whose F-Series line dominates the segment, likely will increase promotions because its models are older.
Fiat Chrysler and GM incentives aren’t that far apart, according to Lyman. The forecast for their residual values in the next 36 months are among the strongest in the pickup segment, he said.
“While we’re seeing Ram and Silverado come down in their spend with that sort of long view, we’re also seeing Ford go up,” Lyman said. “They’re starting to converge, and I think that makes sense, because you have the influence of those new models coming into the market.”"
236,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 02:09PM ET</span>",MarketPulse: MSCI Expands Road to China's Mainland Markets,"Investing.com - Global index giant MSCI shares moved higher Friday, propping up financials, after raising the weight of Chinese stocks in key indexes.
The company said it would raise the inclusion of China A-shares in its indexes to 20% from 5%, a move which will likely attract funds that had ignored stocks on the mainland market because of its limited weighting.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) rose nearly 3% on the news; the shares are up nearly 29% so far in 2019.
The cap will be lifted in three stages from May through August, rising to 10% in May to 15% in August and to 20% in November, the company said.
Traders cheered the news as it marked another significant step to further open the mainland's equity markets to foreign investors. It comes just months after a rule change in September allowed foreign investors working on the Chinese mainland to trade in the country's A-share market.
Before the reform, only foreigners with permanent residency in China had been allowed to trade freely in the A-share market.
For years, China has been taking to the road to win support from the investment community to get more of its mainland shares into global stock indexes, which usually attracts billions in capital inflows.
MSCI said the ""strong commitment"" by Chinese regulators to continue to improve market accessibility, including the ""significant reduction in trading suspensions in recent months,"" was one of the factors that had won the support of international institutional investors.
The increased weighting has led some to speculate that this is far from a one-and-done move, but MSCI said in a statement that further increases beyond the 20% cap would require Chinese authorities to address key issues of market accessibility."

238,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 01:43PM ET</span>",U.S. auto sales fall in February on weak SUV demand,"By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Automakers on Friday reported a decline in U.S. sales for February as demand for SUVs slows after years of rapid growth, pointing to a drop in overall sales in 2019.
Toyota Motor Corp said its sales fell 5.2 percent to 172,748 vehicles due to declining sales of its flagship Camry sedan as well as its Tundra pickup trucks and Sienna minivans.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said sales fell 2 percent to 162,036 vehicles, hurt by lower demand for its Jeep Compass and Renegade sport utility vehicles.
""The overall industry is starting off slower due in part to weather, the U.S. government shutdown, and concern over tax refunds,"" Reid Bigland, Fiat Chrysler's U.S. head of sales, said in a statement.
Analysts have also pointed to rising interest rates on auto loans that have weighed on sales. The interest rates translated into higher monthly car payments for consumers, some of whom have likely postponed purchases until a later date.
""We knew sky-rocketing comparisons to last year, particularly for the Jeep brand, would catch up with Fiat Chrysler,"" said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at online marketplace Autotrader.
Krebs added that Fiat Chrysler's Compass and Renegade models are typically purchased by more budget-constrained buyers, who might be facing some cash crunch at this time of the year.
U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported cars risks a further hit to vehicle demand and profits for automakers, potentially forcing consumers to shift to the used car market, analysts say.
Industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive have forecast 2019 total light-vehicle sales to fall 1.9 percent to 17.0 million units, assuming tariffs on imported cars are not enacted.
The consultants' estimate for full-year sales with tariffs on imported cars assumes a reduction in demand by as much as 700,000 units, as prices rise significantly, hitting buyers' purchasing power.
Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd reported a 0.4 percent dip in U.S. vehicles sales to 115,159 units, while Nissan Motor Co Ltd's sales in the United States plummeted 12 percent to 114,342.
Top two automakers General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co have stopped reporting monthly auto sales numbers.
J.D. Power and LMC Automotive's had forecast U.S. auto sales to drop about 1 percent to 1.29 million vehicles in February.

A poll of economists by Reuters expected U.S. car and light truck sales to fall to 16.80 million units in annualized terms in February, from 17.01 million units a year earlier.

Ryanair, which has faced a series of strikes across Europe over the last year, has made significant progress in union talks in recent months and has said it hopes to come to agreements with unions in all its main markets before the end of March.
But some large unions say problems remain, with Britain's BALPA last month saying there was ""real frustration building up"" around the talks. 
Ryanair said it had reached an agreement with the VC union, which was responsible for Ryanair's first ever pilot strike in Dec. 2017, on pay and allowances for a four-year period. 
It said it hoped to complete a Collective Labor Agreement (CLA) by the end of March, while VC said it was targeting a resolution by the middle of that month. 
""A salary scale was agreed upon which will be an integral part of the CLA remuneration for Ryanair pilots in Germany,"" VC spokesperson Janis Schmitt said in a statement.

Schmitt added that they had made progress in their negotiations for a social plan.

In a 13-count indictment unsealed in January, the Justice Department said Huawei misled a global bank and U.S. authorities about its relationship with subsidiaries Skycom Tech and Huawei Device USA Inc, in order to conduct business in Iran.
On Thursday, Huawei Device and Huawei Device USA pleaded not guilty in a federal court in Seattle in a separate court case. The companies are charged with fraud, trade secrets conspiracy and other charges alleging that they conspired to steal T-Mobile US Inc trade secrets between 2012 and 2014. A trial date was set for March 2020.

The charges have added to pressure from the U.S. government on Huawei, the world’s biggest telecommunications equipment maker. Washington is trying to prevent American companies from buying Huawei routers and switches and is pressing allies to do the same.

PARIS (Reuters) -  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) reached an agreement with unions over a plan to cut as many as 2,500 jobs at its Belgian retail banking unit by 2021 as part of an effort to bring down costs.
The bank expects most of the departures at BNP Paribas Fortis to come through attrition and it will offer an early retirement to 800 workers aged 58 and over, said spokesman Valery Halloy. The bank employs 13,000 people in Belgium.
""There will be no unvoluntary layoffs for the next three years,"" he said. As part of the agreement, the remaining workers accepted to work an additional hour per week.
In Belgium as elsewhere, retail banks are closing down branches as the growth of electronic banking means that fewer people visit local branches. 
Cost-cutting has become an even more pressing issue for traditional retail banks with the arrival of new online banks who offer real-time and dirt-cheap services.
BNP Paribas Fortis dominates the local market with one of the densest branch networks in Belgium and needs to align its costs to its main competitors, KBC Groep and the local unit of ING, Halloy said.
Fortis has reduced the number of its branches to 678 from 938 between 2012 and 2018, according to BNP Paribas documents.
The headcount cut will involve jobs at all levels, not only in branches, he added.
The negotiations for this agreement were more tense than for previous similar deals in the past as the bank intends to cut its payroll by a wider margin, SETCA union general secretary Jean-Michel Cappoen said.
""The bank has cut around 400 jobs per year with the previous plans, this time it was a lot more,"" Cappoen said. 
The bank's goal is to eventually reduce its staff to 10,000, he said.

Spokesman Halloy declined to confirm the figure.

252,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 11:40AM ET</span>",Gap shares surge 24 percent as Wall Street praises split,"By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) shares surged as much as 24 percent on Friday as a number of Wall Street analysts lauded the company's decision to separate its better-performing Old Navy brand.
The company, once a trend setter with its casual logo emblazoned hoodies to Khaki cargos, has struggled to keep pace with fast-fashion rivals such as Zara and H&M.
Old Navy has been the only bright spot for the company in the past few years, cushioning it from the weak performance of its namesake Gap and Banana Republic brands, where sales have also taken a hit from fewer additions of new designs.
""Separating Old Navy to a standalone company is what we have argued for over the past few years. Doing so allows the market to properly value Old Navy for its high margins and strong cash flows,"" Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said.
Konik said separating Old Navy, which is the primary driver of profit for Gap, would also make the budget brand as attractive as off-price retailers such as TJX (NYSE:TJX) Co Inc and Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST).
""We are buyers,"" Konik said.
The gains in the stock set it up for its best day in more than 10 years and added about $2 billion to the company's market capitalization.
Gap said on Thursday that Old Navy would be spun off to its shareholders, while the other entity will consist of the Gap brand, Athleta, BR, Intermix and Hill City.
""Santa didn't bring the sales but brought Old Navy spin instead,"" RBC's analyst Kate Fitzsimons said.
At least four brokerages raised their price target on the stock, with Telsey making the most bullish move by raising its price by $6 to $40, well above the median of $30.
The company also said it would close hundreds of underperforming Gap stores in the next two years and would increase investments in its online business as they try to adapt to a more modern retail environment.
It has already shut its massive flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York earlier this year.
On a post-earnings call with analysts on Thursday, Chief Executive Officer Art Peck said the company would focus on quality, fit and style of apparel that today's consumer needs, with special focus on denim to boost the Gap brand.
The company also said it plans to invest more in fleece for spring, summer and fall seasons.
At Old Navy, the fashion is already more resonant with the latest styles, with blouses and dresses priced as cheap as $30.
""You can have confidence that we definitely boil the ocean in looking at all the combinations and permutations here ... We settled on this largely due to the business logic at the end of the day,"" Peck said referring to the split.
While analysts were encouraged by Thursday's announcement, some said concerns around the company's money-losing Gap brand would remain.
""While we are encouraged by the decision, we would note the company's brands continue to face intense competitive pressure, particularly in the U.S.,"" Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul said.

Gap's shares lost a fifth of their value in the past 12 months, while the broader S&P 500 Apparel Retail index rose 13 percent.

253,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 11:40AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Apollo bets on Clearway Energy, defying PG&E bankruptcy fallout","By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC has amassed a 6 percent stake in Clearway Energy Inc, a renewable energy producer whose shares were hit after one of its customers filed for bankruptcy, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Apollo's move is a sign of confidence in Clearway, which cut its dividend from 33 cents to 20 cents per share last month amid concerns that California utility PG&E Corp could abandon its power purchase agreement with Clearway, a wind, solar and natural gas-fired power generation company.
PG&E filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 29, citing mounting liabilities, including the possibility its equipment set off the deadly Camp Fire, which destroyed the Northern California town of Paradise and killed 86 people.
Since November, Clearway's shares have lost more than a fifth of their value as investors worried that PG&E will renege on its contract. 
PG&E has $42 billion worth of contracts with about 350 energy producers, mostly solar and wind farms.
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded several renewable energy projects with significant revenue exposure to PG&E in the aftermath of its bankruptcy filing, including Topaz Solar Farms, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, and Genesis Solar Farm, developed by NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). 
The PG&E contract accounts for about 23 percent of Clearway's cash flow. Clearway Chief Financial Officer Chad Plotkin told investors on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday that PG&E had continued to make payments, but that the cash did not flow to Clearway because of debt covenants in its renewable energy projects.
PG&E has not yet decided whether it will default on its power purchase agreements as part of its bankruptcy process. If it does, these contracts would have the same claim as $20 billion of unsecured bonds that PG&E has outstanding. 
Were this to happen, Apollo believes PG&E's contract to Clearway would pay in full, at 100 cents on the dollar, the sources said. Clearway currently has an equity cushion of $9 billion, a rare occurrence for a company in bankruptcy.
Apollo, which is one of PG&E's biggest creditors, believes that the utility's contract with Clearway has a value equivalent to $4.5 to $5 per Clearway share, according to the sources. 
Apollo's stake in Clearway is a passive trading position originating from the private equity firm's global liquid credit business, that is co-led by Joseph Moroney and John Zito, the sources said.
Apollo declined to comment. Clearway, which is controlled by infrastructure investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Clearway shares pared some losses and were trading down 2 percent at $14.71 in late morning trading in New York, giving the company a market capitalization of $2.8 billion.

258,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 10:50AM ET</span>",Gap Analysts Say Old Navy Can Now Get Multiple It Deserves,"(Bloomberg) -- Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS).’s plans to split off its Old Navy brand from its Gap namesake and other brands overshadowed the fourth-quarter results, sending shares soaring in Friday’s session.
Analysts applauded the decision, saying the split could provide a greater valuation for Old Navy -- with analysts estimating per-share value as much as seven times greater than that of NewCo, which will hold the Gap, Banana Republic and Athleta brands. Telsey Advisory Group initially targets an Old Navy value at $35 per share, while B. Riley FBR pegs it at about $23. The NewCo management team will also get greater opportunity to focus on fixing the other brands with more targeted investments and resources.
Gap shares surged as much as 21 percent to $30.65, the highest intraday since Aug. 30.
Here’s what analysts are saying:
Telsey Advisory Group, Dana Telsey
“Given what we see as the ability to further unlock shareholder value from the spin off of the ON business, we are taking our price target up to $40 from $34 previously.” Specifically, Telsey values Old Navy at $35 per share and NewCo at $5. Rates outperform.
“NewCo can benefit from a rebalanced Gap brand, the Athleta growth component, and a healthier BR at an attractive valuation.”
“Fourth quarter results may not have been worse than feared. EPS came in better than expected and the Gap brand comp matched market estimates, while a comp shortfall at ON came against a strong 9% compare from a year ago at a time of understood macro headwinds.”
Meanwhile, the high-end of the year EPS forecast is just 2 percent to 3 percent below the consensus estimate of $2.62.
Cowen, Oliver Chen
“We do expect stock upside as investors are able to attribute a higher multiple to Old Navy and its value-driven orientation which is well positioned for growth. Ideally, changes should enable greater focus & more efficient allocation of investment dollars at each respective company.”
Rates market perform and raises his price target to $32 from $29 based on sum-of-the-parts analysis that estimates Old Navy’s equity value can be about $9.5 billion, which implies EV/Ebitda multiple of about 7.5 times, compared with Gap’s current combined EV/Ebitda multiple of about 6 times. Expects the equity value for NewCo to be close to $2.7 billion, which implies EV/Ebitda multiple of about 4 times.
B.Riley FRB, Susan Anderson
Views the planned separation of Old Navy and the major re-sizing of the Gap store fleet “favorably” as the NewCo (Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta and others) takes “necessary steps towards modernization, and likely gives the Gap brand more focus vs. previously.”
Sum-of-the-parts analysis valued the entire company at $32: Old Navy at $23, Gap Global $4, Banana Republic at $2 and other brands (Athleta, etc.) at $3.
Rates neutral, price target $30.
Deutsche Bank, Paul Trussell
“The announcement to create two publicly traded companies (Old Navy and NewCo) has overshadowed results and surprised investors.”
The fourth-quarter results showcased that “challenges remain, particularly at the Gap brand,” although Old Navy sales also missed and trends there remain “soft” quarter-to-date.
“We applaud management on the pending transaction which unlocks meaningful shareholder value given Old Navy’s margin profile and long runway of growth ahead,” including low- to mid-single digit comp. sales/square foot growth.
Rates hold, boosts price target to $34 from $30
Citi, Paul Lejuez
“There was a clear deterioration” in the business during the fourth quarter that is being overshadowed by news of the Old Navy separation. “We believe the stock would have traded lower on 4Q earnings” without the spin news.
Rates neutral, price target $29

259,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 10:43AM ET</span>",Another Kroger unit to stop accepting Visa credit cards due to high fees,"(Reuters) - U.S. supermarket chain Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co on Friday said its Smith's Food and Drug Stores division will stop accepting Visa (NYSE:V) Inc's credit cards, starting April 3, because of excessive transaction fees.
Kroger had stopped accepting Visa's credit cards at its Foods Co stores in California in August last year, because of a price dispute over interchange rates and network fees.
""At Smith's, Visa's credit card fees are higher than any other credit card brand that we accept. Visa's excessive fees and unfairness cannot continue to go unchecked,"" Kroger's Chief Financial Officer Mike Schlotman said https://reut.rs/2NzW0oi.
The company added it is going to continue to explore other options to reduce the cost of accepting credit cards and keep prices low for customers.
""It is unfair and disappointing that Kroger is putting shoppers in the middle of a business dispute,"" a Visa spokeswoman said, adding that the company has put forward a number of solutions to allow its cardholders to continue using their credit cards at Foods Co and Smith's ""without Kroger-imposed restrictions.""
""When consumer choice is limited, nobody wins,"" she added.
Smith's operates over 130 stores across the U.S. Together with Foods Co, almost 142 supermarket and 108 fuel center locations across seven states in the U.S. will stop accepting Visa credit cards from April.
The dispute between Kroger and Visa is the latest between payments processors and merchants over transaction fees. Card companies have said in the past that expenses for ramping up anti-fraud/anti-theft security measures to make payment processing safer have resulted in a fee hike.
Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa have another round of fee hikes, slated for April, which will be levied on merchant banks, not on the merchants directly, although the banks could pass on the fee hike to sellers, if they want to avoid absorbing it themselves.
Visa's shares were up 0.5 percent in morning trading, while Kroger rose 0.31 percent.

Smith's stores will continue to accept all other forms of payment, including major credit cards, and health savings account cards.

Stateside, investors awaited the publication of a report on manufacturing activity, a more recent look at the American economy compared to other delayed reports released earlier.
At 9:38 AM ET (14:38 GMT), the Dow Jones gained 197 points, or 0.76%, to 26,112.78 points, the S&P 500 rose 20 points, or 0.74%, to 2,804.98, while the Nasdaq Composite traded up 49 points, or 0.65%, to 7,581.78 points.
Business surveys from China and Europe showed that the economic situation there wasn’t quite as bad as initial readings last week had suggested, even though both the Caixin and the IHS Markit manufacturing purchasing managers' index, for China and the euro zone respectively, were below the 50 level that separates growth from contraction. Stronger-than-expected retail sales and jobless data from Germany also helped to lift spirits.
The Institute of Supply Management will release its manufacturing data for February at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT) on Friday, the same time as a revision to the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index for February.
The look at factory activity will overshadow other reports released ahead of the open that had been delayed by the government shutdown and were mostly old news from December.
Personal spending registered its first decline in two years last December, a fact already suggested by dispiriting retail sales data, the worst in nine years, for the same month.
From the same report, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, core personal consumption expenditures, held unsurprisingly at 1.9% year on year at the end of 2018, causing little waves for a market expecting the central bank to officially announce an end to its balance sheet runoff.
The Commerce Department was able to release its January reading on personal income. While it showed its first decline since November 2015, that came after a surge in December on the back of an increase in special payments, including a special dividend from VMware (NYSE:VMW) and subsidies to farmers.
In company news, Gap (NYSE:GPS) soared around 19% after the company announced it would spin off its Old Navy business and close about 230 Gap specialty stores over the next two years.
As the earnings season came to a close, with more than 95% of the S&P 500 having reported numbers,  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) pleased investors, with shares jumping 7.7% after the company reported strong organic sales growth around the turn of the year and forecast that earnings per share will rise by over 10% in its current fiscal year.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) filed a lawsuit against its mechanics union on Thursday, accusing the workers of an illegal campaign to disrupt operations in order to improve their position in prolonged labor talks.
Southwest and the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, which represents some 2,400 mechanics at the low-cost carrier, have been in contract negotiations since 2012.
In a lawsuit filed in Texas, Southwest asked a federal judge to order a halt to what it called an unlawful job action by the union. 
AMFA did not immediately return a request for comment.
Tensions escalated when the union claimed on Feb. 11 that Southwest was not negotiating in good faith, according to the lawsuit.
Southwest said soon after it began experiencing ""an uptick on cosmetic and other minor maintenance write-ups,"" leading to an unprecedented number of aircraft out of service and forcing the airline to delay or cancel hundreds of flights.
For example, it said the number of write-ups for minor interior systems such as a missing row number on an airline that does not assign seats spiked almost 400 percent to 500 percent after talks broke down.
""It quickly became clear as these unusual write-ups spread across Southwest's stations that something coordinated was beginning to occur,"" the airline said in the lawsuit.
In addition to the cost and revenue loss for canceled flights, Southwest said experience showed that passengers whose flights were canceled could end up traveling on other airlines rather than re-booking with Southwest.

The union has disputed the notion that the maintenance issues were driven by the labor dispute, one of the biggest to hit a top-four U.S. airline in more than a decade.

266,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 07:35AM ET</span>","Philippines to charge officials of Sanofi, gov't over deaths linked to vaccine","By Karen Lema
MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine Department of Justice said on Friday it has found probable cause to indict officials from French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) and former and current Philippine health officials over 10 deaths it said were linked to use of a dengue vaccine.
It recommended charges be filed in court for multiple counts of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide, due to what it said were procedural lapses and irregularities in implementing a Philippine dengue immunization program using Sanofi's Dengvaxia.
It recommended that six Sanofi officials, mostly country representatives of the firm, and 14 current and former Philippine health officials be charged, including former Health Minister Janette Garin. 
Sanofi has repeatedly said Dengvaxia is safe and effective. The drugmaker on Friday rejected the justice department's recommendations.
""We strongly disagree with the findings made against Sanofi and some of its employees and we will vigorously defend them,"" a spokesman said, adding it was not appropriate to comment further as proceedings were ongoing.
The justice department statement did not say Dengvaxia had caused the deaths, but it quoted excerpts from a resolution by prosecutors that said the 20 individuals had exhibited an ""inexcusable lack of precaution and foresight"".
It said the government registered and bought Dengvaxia for its immunization program with undue haste.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne tropical disease that kills about 20,000 people a year and infects hundreds of millions.
The Philippines started rolling out the vaccination program in 2016 in a bid to dramatically reduce as many as 200,000 domestic dengue cases a year. It spent 3.5 billion pesos ($67.7 million) on the program during which it immunized 800,000 children with Dengvaxia. 
But that drive came under heavy scrutiny the following year, with critics and some lawmakers voicing suspicion about the speed at which the government sought to register, procure and distribute Dengvaxia among schools and clinics.
SAFETY CONCERNS
That suspicion was compounded by concerns about the safety of the vaccine after Sanofi in late 2017 said Dengvaxia could increase the risk of severe dengue in children who had never been exposed to the virus.
A criminal investigation and two congressional inquiries have taken place, and the Philippines last month permanently halted the sale, distribution and marketing of Dengvaxia, after concluding Sanofi had failed to meet directives issued by regulators. 
Justice undersecretary Markk Perete told Reuters that there were 35 deaths under investigation, 10 of which were the basis for the charges announced on Friday.
Perete said the 20 individuals faced up to six years in prison for each of the alleged offences. All but two officials could be charged with eight counts of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide, he said.
A Sanofi source with knowledge of the situation said the Philippine prosecutors' criticism was vague and they were more interested in the processes in which the product was approved.
Separate to the case announced on Friday, the Philippines has tasked a panel of medical experts to investigate the deaths of scores of children who received the vaccine, to establish whether or not Dengvaxia was a contributing factor.
The panel's head, Juliet Aguilar, told Reuters that medical records of 119 victims were being looked into as of Friday.
The 20 officials named by the justice department on Friday had shown neglect in having ""totally disregarded the identified risks and adverse effects of the vaccine"", the resolution said.
The department said those risks ""materialized with the death of the victims"".

It also said Sanofi had failed to closely monitor the recipients of Dengvaxia, nor did it extend medical assistance to victims or their families, even after reports of ""serious adverse reactions"" surfaced.

267,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 07:20AM ET</span>",EU banks watchdog urges protection of deposits in case of no deal Brexit,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The EU banking watchdog has urged member states to offer deposit account protection for customers of branches of British banks in the rest of the European Union in case Britain crashes out of the bloc this month with no deal.
Bank deposits are protected by national deposit guarantee schemes so that if a lender went bust, sums up to 100,000 euros remain safe under EU law - but that does not extend to branches of a bank that would be outside the EU. 
The European Banking Authority - itself having to move from London to Paris because of Brexit - said it was calling on the schemes in EU states to ensure that depositors in the branches of UK banks in the bloc are adequately protected in case of a no-deal departure by Britain on March 29.
""The withdrawal of the UK from the EU is not likely to have an impact on the protection of deposits in the vast majority of credit institutions operating in the EU,"" EBA said in an ""opinion"" published on Friday.
""It may affect branches of UK credit institutions in the EU depending on the decisions taken by the UK authorities on the potential exclusion of such branches from the scope of the UK depositor protection scheme, after the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.""
EBA said it had to take action in an ""unprecedented"" situation, given that the EU law on deposit protection does not set out how cross-border payouts involving a non-EU branch should be carried out.
It noted that the Bank of England proposed in October that EU branches of UK banks would no longer be protected by Britain's deposit protection scheme.
The BoE has not yet made a definitive statement on this, EBA said.
Britain's intended approach would mean customers of UK banks in the EU would lose protection unless the branches joined the local deposit guarantee scheme, EBA added.

When the chief executive officer announced plans to dismiss about 9 percent of the electric-car maker’s workforce in June, he wrote in an internal memo that Tesla was “making this hard decision now so that we never have to do this again.”
On Thursday, Musk told workers more jobs will be cut as Tesla moves to wind down most stores worldwide and transition to online-only ordering. This is the second culling the billionaire has announced this year -- he said in January the company had “no choice” but to reduce headcount by about 7 percent.
Musk, 47, didn’t specify in his latest email to employees how many jobs will be impacted by the shift to online sales and said some workers will transition to other areas of the business. He also wrote that he expects headcount will increase next year.
“This is a hard decision” but is “necessary to make our cars more affordable,” the CEO wrote, after announcing another series of price cuts for the Model S and Model X and the arrival of a $35,000 version of the Model 3.

269,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 07:20AM ET</span>",Foot Locker Shares Soar After Strong 4Q and Outlook,"Shares in  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) soared in premarket trading after the company reported strong organic sales growth around the turn of the year and forecast that earnings per share will rise by over 10% in its current fiscal year.
The numbers suggest that the company is coming to terms with the challenge of online competition and changing distribution preferences at key suppliers such as  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (DE:ADSGN).
The shares were indicated up 14.2% at $67.95 by 07:20 AM ET (1220 GMT) in response.
Comparable-store sales increased 9.7% in the three months ending Feb. 2, a much stronger-than-expected performance that meant revenue hit $2.27 billion, well ahead of analysts’ forecasts for $2.18 billion. Even after allowing for currency fluctuations, fourth-quarter sales were up 4.2%.
Earnings per share, however, fell 1 cent short of forecasts for the quarter at $1.39.
Inventories, a key measure of how well the chain is keeping up with changes in demand patterns, fell 0.7% on the year, although they were up 1.3% in constant currency terms.
“The fundamentals of our core business remain strong and led to meaningful improvement in our financial results, not only during the fourth quarter but throughout 2018,” said chairman and chief executive officer Richard Johnson.
Johnson said that he expects “a mid-single digit comparable sales gain and another double-digit percentage increase in earnings per share” for the fiscal year just started."

By Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Dell Technologies Inc topped Street estimates for quarterly revenue on Thursday in the computer maker's first earnings report since a return to public markets and also forecast annual revenue above estimates, lifted by demand for its servers and network devices.
Dell, one of the top players in the PC market, returned to public markets on Dec. 28 after it bought back interest tied to the performance of software maker VMware, and shares have risen more than 22 percent since then.
Revenue in its Infrastructure Solutions Group, which houses its servers and network device business, rose 10 percent to $9.9 billion. Servers and networking revenue rose 14 percent to $5.3 billion.
Client Solutions Group segment revenue rose 4 percent to $10.9 billion. The unit holds its desktop PCs, notebooks and tablets, as well as branded peripherals business. 
Excluding some items, Dell expects full-year 2020 revenue between $93 billion and $96 billion, mostly above analysts' estimate of $94.11 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Its expectations for annual adjusted earnings per share between $6.05 and $6.70 falls below Street estimates of $6.81.
Dell did not report earnings per share for fiscal 2019 due to certain transactions. 
Dell Chief Financial Officer Tom Sweet referenced the dynamic macroeconomic environment in an interview to Reuters and said, ""I don't think full-year 2020 will be quite as strong from a year-over-year revenue growth perspective, but I do think that we will continue to improve profitability over the course of the year."" 
Excluding impact of purchase accounting of $167 million, the company posted total revenue of $24 billion, above estimates of $23.83 billion.
For the fourth quarter ended Feb. 1, net loss attributable to Dell jumped nearly three-fold to $299 million. Operating expenses surged 13.7 percent to $6.78 billion.
Separately, Dell unit VMware Inc beat fourth-quarter revenue and profit estimates on strong demand for its software to boost cloud computing efficiency, sending its shares up 3 percent.
Forrester analyst Glenn O'Donnell is bullish on both Dell and VMWare.
""The companies have more than their share of critics, but both are executing well in ruthlessly competitive markets. You won’t see AWS-like growth numbers, but anyone who suggests these companies are dinosaurs - is just wrong,"" he said, referring to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's Amazon Web Services (AWS).
HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) on Wednesday reported quarterly revenue that fell short of estimates, due to weak demand in its printer as well as in its personal systems businesses.

271,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 07:05AM ET</span>",Your Money: State taxes are too hard for mere mortals to compute,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK(Reuters) - Can regular people calculate their state taxes in light of the new U.S. tax law?
No way, experts say.
""There isn't a way to figure it out,"" said Craig Smalley, an enrolled agent tax preparer in Orlando, Florida. ""I've worked with clients all over the United States. There's nothing you can do.""
But surely, users of do-it-yourself software can get a little window into what is going on? 
TurboTax's answer is that you need not know the intricacies of state law. The software ""automatically imports your information into your state tax return from your federal tax return,"" explained Lisa Greene-Lewis, a CPA and tax expert with TurboTax.
The Tax Cuts & Jobs Act passed in December 2017 has already created a particularly challenging tax year. But situations in the 44 states that levy income tax are even more confusing.
Some states are following federal rules, but others like New York have broken ranks. Some, like New Jersey, have never been on board.
Virginia may be the winner for the most complicated taxes, according to Tynisa Gaines, an enrolled agent tax preparer based in Herndon, Virginia. It is among those states that say if you take the standard deduction on the federal return, you cannot itemize on your state return.
Since federal changes doubled the standard deduction to $12,000 for singles and $24,000 for married couples, fewer taxpayers are expected to itemize than before. But Virginia's standard deduction is low, just $3,000 for singles and $6,000 for married.
Gaines said she would pay $1,000 more in state taxes if she did not itemize. She runs returns multiple ways to figure out the least painful options for her clients.
Keeping up with changes for her nationwide clientele requires constant attention. The only way Gaines manages is to download the regulation handbook from each state's tax information website and pore over it. 
""It's not easy. I have to look it up for almost every client every year,"" Gaines said. ""A state might decide not to tax veteran retirement pay when they did before, or they might exempt military spouse pay suddenly. There is no shortcut to it at all.""
Even in a small state like Massachusetts, tax law can send professionals into a tizzy. The state conforms to federal law on issues like 529 college saving plan rules, but not on others like the tax treatment of debt cancellations, said John Warren, an enrolled agent tax preparer in Medford, Massachusetts.
""If I call up my tax software company, it's most likely on the state side,"" Warren said.
WITHHOLDING ISSUES
One reason you cannot just let the software figure it out is that the state takes out money from each of your paychecks. It is likely that the amount withheld in 2018 was incorrect and carried over to this year.
Even if you did projections, those may be obsolete. Enrolled agent Phyllis Jo Kubey did an analysis for each of New York clients, but the state later announced it would decouple from the federal rules.
New York still allows $1,000 per dependent personal exemption, for instance. ""So if you just say, I'm going to use the standard deduction and not think about it, you might be leaving money on the table,"" Kubey said. 
Some state tax websites have withholding calculators, and you can navigate through the inputs - which, like the federal W-4 calculator, now require a lot of information. 
You can also use your completed 2018 return as a baseline. Take your total state taxes due and then figure out the filing status and number of allowances that will equal the correct amount for 2019, divided by the number of paychecks you get for the rest of the year. 

""The state is the stepchild. People forget about the state until the end,"" Gaines said.

The blue-chip Dow futures gained 174 points, or 0.67%, to 26,086.5 points by 6:50 AM ET (11:50 GMT), the S&P 500 futures rose 17 points, or 0.62%, to 2,801.88 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 54 points, or 0.75%, to 7,156.12 points.
Business surveys from China and Europe showed that the economic situation there wasn’t quite as bad as initial readings last week had suggested – even though both the Caixin and the IHS Markit Purchasing Managers Index, for China and euro zone, respectively, were below the 50 level that separates growth from contraction. Stronger-than-expected retail sales and jobless data from Germany also helped to lift spirits.
In company news, investors are likely to focus on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which fell 4.4% in pre-market trading Friday after it said it closed most of its stores and moved to an online sales model, a move aimed at stripping out enough costs to let it meet Elon Musk’s target of selling its mass-market Model 3 for only $35,000.
AT&T (NYSE:T) will also grab attention amid news that two of the firm’s longtime executives are stepping down. According to The Wall Street Journal, Richard Plepler, the chairman and chief executive of HBO, sent a memo to staff announcing his resignation, while David Levy, president of Turner - the parent of cable channels CNN, TNT, TBS and Cartoon Network - will also step down as early as Friday.
On the economic front, ISM manufacturing data for February will take the spotlight at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT) on Friday, overshadowing the delayed release of personal income and spending, which includes the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), or the final revision of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment for February.
Elsewhere, European indices registered gains across the board. Germany’s Dax, up 1%, led the pack as the country’s manufacturing activity, unemployment change and retail sales all topped expectations.
Earlier, Asian shares ended sharply higher as data eased economic fears. China’s Shanghai Composite led gains as index publisher MSCI announced it would raise the weight of Chinese mainland shares in its global benchmarks.
Outside of equities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, edged forward 0.08% to 96.12 by 6:52 AM ET (11:52 GMT), while the yield on the 10-year Treasury advanced 1.9 basis points to 2.73%.

Trudeau's domestic troubles have attracted attention in Chinese state media due to his previous assertion that his government cannot interfere in the case of a senior Huawei Technologies Co Ltd executive arrested in Canada and now fighting extradition to the United States.
China has repeatedly called for the release of Meng Wanzhou, the telecommunication giant's chief financial officer, arrested in Vancouver in December at Washington's request. In late January the U.S. Justice Department charged Huawei and Meng with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.
At a regular daily news briefing in Beijing, China's Foreign Ministry took the opportunity to take Canada to task over possible double standards, by commenting on a domestic Canadian political issue that does not otherwise involve China.
Trudeau has disputed allegations by his former justice minister that government officials inappropriately pressured her to help the SNC-Lavalin construction firm avoid a corruption trial.
Asked by a state media journalist if it was contradictory for Trudeau to say he couldn't interfere in Meng's case and yet his government be accused of trying to intervene in the SNC-Lavalin case, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he ""really liked this question"".
""Of course I think that this is a question that should be asked of the Canadian government,"" Lu said.
""In fact on this case you have mentioned, people in Canada are paying it a great deal of attention,"" he added. ""In fact, not only Chinese and Canadian citizens, but the whole world are extremely interested to hear how the Canadian government answers this question.""
Both Meng and Huawei have denied the U.S. allegations.

Ottawa has until midnight on Friday (0500 GMT Saturday) to announce whether it will issue an authority to proceed, which would allow a court in the Pacific province of British Columbia to start a formal extradition hearing.

276,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 05:20AM ET</span>",Big U.S. pension funds ask electric utilities for decarbonization plans,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. pension funds are asking electric utilities to accelerate efforts to cut carbon emissions but will not force the issue with proxy resolutions this spring, hoping market shifts and falling prices for renewable energy have already made executives and directors receptive to the goal.
Investors including New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees retirement funds, and leaders of the California Public Employees' Retirement System are asking the 20 largest publicly traded electric generators in the United States for detailed plans for achieving carbon-free electricity by 2050 at the latest, according to material seen by Reuters. 
They also seek other steps like board commitments and tying progress to executive pay.
Stringer termed decarbonization a ""financial necessity"" in a statement sent by a spokeswoman. ""This initiative makes clear that mobilizing for the planet goes hand-in-hand with protecting our pensions, and we need these commitments now.""
Making electricity carbon-free by 2050 will be key to meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to constrain global warming, the investor group said in a separate statement. They praised a December announcement by  Xcel Energy  Inc (NASDAQ:XEL) that it will aim for carbon-free generation by 2050. 
Large utilities receiving the letter include  Duke Energy  Corp (NYSE:DUK) and  NRG Energy Inc  (NYSE:NRG). Each has already moved toward cutting emissions: Duke has set a goal of reducing carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030 from its 2005 levels, and NRG aims to cut emissions in half by 2030 and by 90 percent by 2050 compared with 2014 levels.
Asked about the funds' request, Duke spokeswoman Catherine Butler noted the goal and said via email, ""We continue to evaluate options to further reduce emissions beyond that date.""
In a statement sent by a spokeswoman, NRG Vice President of Sustainability Bruno Sarda said the company agrees with the ""urgency for decarbonization"" and said it is reviewing its goals based on newly-available science.
Falling prices for wind and solar power will help the utilities' efforts, while the pace of coal-fired power plant closures has accelerated in the face of price competition. 
Funds involved in Stringer's effort collectively manage $1.8 trillion and also include Hermes Investment Management and money overseen by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. 
Technically the group is asking for ""net-zero"" carbon emissions by 2050, meaning the amount of carbon utilities release must equal the amount they remove.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose to five-month highs in the morning of the first trading day of March as a fresh batch of corporate updates helped drive a risk-on mood after U.S. President Donald Trump earlier fueled some concerns over trade talks with China.
The pan-regional STOXX 600 index was up 0.7 percent by 0926 GMT to above 375 points, a level not see since Oct.8. 
""Momentum has flagged slightly in recent sessions and concrete news of an agreement between the U.S. and China is now needed to prolong the rally in risk assets,"" wrote Peel Hunt analyst Ian Williams (NYSE:WMB), noting that in the meantime it was up to corporate earnings to maintain morale.
Gains spread across all regional bourses with Germany's exporter-heavy DAX leading the charge thanks notably to rising car makers stocks.
""If corporate profits do grow, which I think they will, equities look reasonably good value,"" said Edward Rumble, European equity portfolio manager at RWC Partners.
The optimism on markets came despite mixed news from economic indicators. 
Data showed euro-zone manufacturing activity went into reverse for the first time in over five years, but German retail sales jumped and the bloc's powerhouse unemployment remained at record lows. 
All sectors were on the rise but telecoms were flat. The sector, a traditional defensive play, has suffered from the 5-percent fall experienced by Belgium's Proximus after it published disappointing results. 
Italian luxury group Moncler stole the spotlight with its 2018 results, which broker Jefferies called ""remarkable"", and rose 8.7 percent.
Moncler peer benefited from the rally with Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) up 3 percent, LVMH up 2.1 percent and Burberry rose 1.8 percent. 
In the less fashionable food industry, Spanish sausage casing producer Viscofan was up 7.6 percent after it struck an upbeat note on 2019 guidance and Kepler Cheuvreux upgraded it to ""hold"" from ""reduce"".
Britain's WPP (LON:WPP), the world's biggest advertising company, rose 6.6 percent after its full-year results came as a relief amid fears the industry is facing structural headwinds.
Investors have been cautious about the company since French rival Publicis earlier this month results alarmed the market.
Among financials, Jupiter Fund Management was another big gainer, up 8.5 percent after its dividend beat estimates. 
""The company paid out 90 percent of underlying earnings, driving the beat,"" write KBW analysts. 
It was a different story for hedge fund manager Man Group which lost 3.6 percent after reporting funds under management fell last year. 
Another disappointment came in from and Rightmove which fell 5 percent. 

The property website reported its slowest full-year underlying operating profit growth in nine years, sending its shares down nearly 7 percent at the bottom of London's blue-chip index.

LONDON (Reuters) - Miner and trader  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) said trade barriers are its ""foremost risk"", but climate, political, legal and other risks had become more prominent.
Glencore, said in its annual report published on Friday that it was seeking to mitigate these challenges through conservative spending and strict compliance. It also said in February it would limit its coal capacity.
Risk is high on the agenda for mining companies after the Vale dam burst in Brazil provided a stark reminder of the potential dangers in some parts of the world.
Glencore, which operates in Democratic Republic of Congo and is the world's biggest shipper of carbon-intensive seaborne coal, is viewed by analysts as having a high risk appetite. 
While that can drive profits, its share price has underperformed as the difficulty of mining in countries such as Congo has risen to the fore and as investors shun coal. 
Glencore said trade barriers continued to be ""could reduce demand for certain of our commodities or restrict our supplies"".
On market volatility, it also said significant falls, especially in copper, coal or zinc prices would have ""a severe drag on our financial performance"".
But while commodity price risk is perennial, other concerns rose last year, especially in Congo, where Glencore mines copper and cobalt, needed for electric vehicles.
It has said it is waiting for a new government to stabilize following elections at the end of last year to allow it to try to negotiate better terms following a new 2018 mining code.
Glencore is also subject to a U.S. Department of Justice investigation related to its activities in Congo.
Given the challenges, it said spending was at ""controllable levels"" to help maintain its strong investment grade rating.
Glencore has also set up an ethics committee and said it was monitoring climate risk. It regards coal as an opportunity as well as a risk because its assets are high quality and can command a premium as demand, especially in Asia, continues. 

It also has more exposure than many miners to the copper and cobalt needed for electrification and electric vehicles.

Investing.com -- It used to be said that when the U.S. sneezes, Europe caught a cold. That may still be true, but what is also true that when China gets off its sick bed, Europe’s stock markets go for a run.
After a brief setback on Thursday morning in the wake of the U.S.-North Korea summit breakdown, European markets are again racing higher, taking their cue from Asian markets.
The Stoxx 600 was up 0.7% at 375.46 by 04:20 AM ET (0920 GMT). Germany's Dax led the way, rising 1.2%, while the U.K. FTSE 100 lagged, rising only 0.6%.
Asian markets had rallied on two things overnight: first, MSCI announced it would give a much greater weighting to China’s mainland shares in future, triggering a sharp rally in that market; second, the Caixin manufacturing survey showed a surprising uptick in February, further raising hopes that the global economy is bottoming out after the slowdown at the end of last year.
Add stronger-than-expected retail sales out of Germany this morning, a slight upward revision to the Eurozone purchasing managers index for February and a much steeper-than-expected fall in joblessness in Germany, and a very broad-based rally this morning becomes easier to understand.
However, it also weakens the case for action by the European Central Bank at its policy meeting next week. Normally, that would be a negative for stocks, but as former IMF economist Ashoka Mody argued in a recent blog post, the Eurozone economy now appears to react less to ECB policy than it does to developments in global trade.
The fact that the narrower Stoxx 50 index is being led this morning by luxury goods groups  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH) and a bunch of trade-sensitive auto stocks seems to support Mody’s argument.
Among the other individual stocks standing out are U.K. fund manager Jupiter (LON:JUP), which is up 10% after accelerating a changeover of its top management and publishing full-year figures that were less awful than expected. The stock has been one of the most shorted in the London market, and was thus vulnerable to short-covering. Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa), meanwhile, is trailing the market, rising only 0.3% after news that Dutch prosecutors are preparing to charge it over allegations of bribery in Nigeria."

U.S.-based high-yield bond funds attracted $698 million, marking the sector's fifth straight week of inflows, according to data from Refinitiv's Lipper research service. U.S.-based equity ETFs attracted about $7.5 billion in the latest week, Lipper noted.
Investors' risk appetite grew in the wake of ""some positive"" news about U.S.-China trade talks earlier in the week, said Pat Keon, senior research analyst at Lipper. He also cited the U.S. Federal Reserve's statements that the central bank would be patient in hiking interest rate and that it would soon stop reducing its balance sheet.
""It was a good week overall, net inflows just shy of $16 billion with all four asset groups - money markets, taxable bond funds, muni bond funds, and equity funds - taking in net new money,"" Keon said.
Taxable bond funds posted $4.3 billion in inflows, the largest outside of money market funds.
""It was the taxable bond funds group's seventh straight weekly net inflow,"" he said. ""Ultra-short obligation funds (USO (NYSE:USO)) drove the overall positive net flows for the group as they took in $1.47 billion. This is the continuation of a long-term trend as USO funds have had net inflows in 50 of the last 51 weeks for a total intake of over $69 billion.""
Equity ETFs, which attracted $7.5 billion, were responsible for all of the net inflows as equity mutual funds saw $5.1 billion leave, Keon noted.
""This was the second straight net outflow for equity mutual funds after six straight net inflows,"" he said. ""The net outflows for equity mutual funds were across the board as the majority of peer groups saw money leave, both for domestic and nondomestic funds.""
The two largest net inflows for individual ETFs belong to broad market U.S. equity products as SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF took in $2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, Keon pointed out.

British betting companies have been pushing into the United States market because of tighter regulations at home and after the U.S. Supreme Court decided to overturn a federal ban on sports betting. 
William Hill has put money into a digital launch in New Jersey and has started operations or expanded in six states, and the investments resulted in a net adjusted operating loss of 33.2 million pounds in 2018.

283,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 02:37AM ET</span>","Tesla debuts $35,000 Model 3, sees loss in first quarter","By Alexandria Sage
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said on Thursday it would not be profitable in the first quarter, as it offered for the first time a $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan and said its global sales would now be online-only, steps designed to increase demand and cut overhead costs for the electric vehicle maker.
Chief Executive Elon Musk's warning on profit during a conference call with members of the media, which did not include Reuters, contrasted with Tesla's statements last month that it was expecting a ""very small"" net profit in the first quarter. 
Shares of Tesla fell 3.4 percent after hours. Investors have voiced concerns about whether Tesla would be able to maintain profit margins through cost cutting - such as recent layoffs - as it reduces prices of its newest vehicle.
Still, the price drop could quell concerns from some analysts that demand for the higher-priced versions of the Model 3 was beginning to dry up in the United States, especially after a federal tax credit was cut in half this year.
""Tesla wants to drum up demand,"" said Elazar Advisors' Chaim Siegel. ""There was a slowdown in the U.S. as the tax credits dropped. (There are) more tax credit hits later in the year too so they are trying to be proactive.""
Musk has often shared that his strategy for Tesla was to build higher-priced cars - the Model S and X - whose success would ultimately usher in a $35,000 mass-market car, followed by an SUV, the Model Y, which is currently in development. But customers who reserved the Model 3 at that lower price have waited nearly three years since Musk first promised it. 
An online-only sales strategy, along with other changes, would allow vehicle prices to fall by about 6 percent on average, Tesla said in a blog on its website https:// Over the next few months, Tesla will wind down ""many"" of its stores, while investing in its service system, it said.
Online-only sales represent a dramatic shift for the company that has prided itself on its boutique retail stores. In June 2017, Musk pledged to increase the number of stores, saying they had ""barely touched the surface"" of what was possible. 
As of the fourth quarter, Tesla said it recently opened 27 new locations, bringing its total of stores and service centers to 378. 
Thursday was the third time this year that Tesla lowered the price on the Model 3, which recently started at $42,900. 
The new $35,000 version has a top speed of 130 miles per hour (209 km per hour) and can go from zero to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds, Tesla said. For $2,000 more, Tesla offers a version with a range of 240 miles (386 km) and a top speed of 140 mph.
GAME CHANGER WITH SPEED BUMPS 
A $35,000 Model 3 is a major shot in the arm for Tesla sales during a period of major challenges, including deliveries of the Model 3 to Europe and China and construction of a factory in Shanghai.
""This is a game changer,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives. Since tax credits will continue to decline over 2019, ""this is really exactly what the doctor ordered,"" he said.
He warned, however, there could be ""more speed bumps ahead,"" if more sales volume exacerbates prior problems with deliveries and service to customers. 
Musk declined to answer a question on what the profit margins of the $35,000 vehicle would be, according to the New York Times. Gross margins on the car were above 20 percent in the fourth quarter. 
""The margin on the vehicle obviously is going to be very small if there's any margin there at all,"" said David Kudla, CEO of Mainstay Capital Management, which has a short position in Tesla.
As part of cost-cutting efforts, Tesla last month reduced its full-time headcount by 7 percent, following a similar cut of 9 percent to its workforce in June 2018.
The price cut on the Model 3 comes three days after renewed tensions between Musk and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency petitioned a judge this week to have Tesla's CEO found in contempt of an October settlement between the parties. The SEC accuses Musk of having made material statements about production levels on Twitter without first having them vetted internally. 
That settlement between Musk, Tesla and the SEC concerned Musk's August Twitter post in which he claimed to have ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share. 
On Friday, Tesla is due to repay a $920 million convertible bond. Convertible issues give bondholders the right to trade their debt for equity after shares rise over a certain price. Tesla shares are currently about $40 below the $359.87 conversion price. 

Tesla had $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of December.

Treasury yields held gains.
Weakness in the yen helped boost Japanese shares, while Chinese equities outperformed. South Korea was shut. An increase in the Caixin manufacturing gauge to a three-month high and confirmation that MSCI Inc. will increase the weight of Chinese stocks in its global benchmarks buoyed sentiment. S&P 500 Index futures pointed to gains after the benchmark closed lower Thursday, while the dollar ticked higher.
“The news surrounding China and the Chinese economy has been better than news we’ve seen elsewhere,” Andrew Cole, head of multi asset at Pictet Asset Management Ltd., told Bloomberg TV in Hong Kong. “Clearly the central bank and the authorities are providing both fiscal and monetary stimulus.”
After a 16 percent surge from Christmas through the start of this week, MSCI’s gauge of global equities has been treading water as investors await results from U.S.-China trade negotiations. American officials are preparing a final trade deal that Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping could sign in weeks, people familiar with the matter said, even as a debate continues in Washington over whether to push Beijing for more concessions.
Geopolitical concerns remain in the background, amid tensions between India and Pakistan and the failure of a summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump to achieve a deal between the U.S. and North Korea.
Elsewhere, oil climbed back above $57 a barrel in New York as evidence of OPEC cuts and strengthening economic trends in the U.S. signaled tightening supplies.

285,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 02:18AM ET</span>",Asian shares up as MSCI weighting plan lifts China,"By Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Asian shares edged up on Friday after index publisher MSCI announced it would raise the weight of Chinese mainland shares in its global benchmarks, while strong U.S. economic data lifted the dollar.
China's blue-chip CSI300 index surged 2.2 percent to finish off its best week since November 2015, after MSCI said it would quadruple the weighting of China's A-shares in its global benchmarks later this year, potentially drawing more than $80 billion of fresh foreign inflows to the world's second-biggest economy.
That, along with strength in other markets in the region, helped push MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up 0.3 percent. 
Shares in Europe are seen following Asia higher, with financial spreadbetters expecting London's FTSE and Frankfurt's DAX to open 0.5 percent higher. Paris' CAC is expected to rise 0.3 percent at the open.
Friday's Chinese stock rally follows a strong run this year, with major indexes posting their best month in nearly four years in February, driven by expectations for government stimulus and policy support, as well as optimism over U.S.-China trade talks.
""Just two months ago China was facing one of the worst years it's ever had in terms of equity market performance. So I think investors are taking very seriously the fact that the rebalancing of MSCI is happening,"" said Jim McCafferty, head of equity research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura.
""There's a disconnect between China's place in the world economy and China's place in the world's stock markets. And the two things can't be diverged for so long,"" he said.
Elsewhere in the region, Japan's Nikkei 225 ended 1 percent higher, helped by a weaker yen, while Australian shares added 0.4 percent.
The gains in Asia contrast with a weaker finish on Wall Street on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.27 percent to 25,916 points, the S&P 500 lost 0.28 percent to 2,784.49 and the Nasdaq dropped 0.29 percent to 7,532.53.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday fueled concerns over trade talks between the United States and China, warning that he could walk away from a trade deal with China if it were not good enough.
But in subsequent comments Thursday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow called progress in the negotiations ""fantastic"" and said the countries were ""heading towards a remarkable, historic deal.""
Mixed messages on trade combined with the collapse of the summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on denuclearization, and data from China showing slowing factory activity to pressure U.S. stocks.
""News that President Trump walked out of the meeting with Supreme Leader Kim, because the two sides couldn't reach an agreement over North Korea's nuclear disarmament, dashed hopes for an easing in geopolitical tensions,"" analysts at ANZ said in a morning note.
South Korea's financial markets are closed Friday for a public holiday. 
HIGHER YIELDS
Better-than-expected U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter had little impact on U.S. stocks. Gross domestic product rose 2.9 percent for the year, just shy of the 3 percent goal set by the Trump administration.
The GDP data lifted yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes. After rising to a high of 2.7222 percent on Friday, the yield eased to 2.7204 percent, still up from a U.S. close of 2.711 percent on Thursday.
Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan said on Thursday that it will take time to see how much the U.S. economy is slowing, supporting views of the Fed's rate-hike holiday at least through to June.
The dollar also rose on the U.S. data, adding 0.4 percent against the yen to 111.80, having earlier touched a new high for the year at 111.82..
The dollar index which tracks the greenback against major rivals, was up 0.2 percent at 96.302.
In commodity markets, U.S. crude added 0.8 percent to $57.67 a barrel, and Brent crude rose 1 percent to $66.95 per barrel.
Spot gold fell 0.3 percent on the stronger dollar, to $1,309.35 per ounce.

286,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 01:29AM ET</span>",Japan's Subaru plans biggest-ever global recall over brake lights,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Subaru Corp plans to recall around 2.3 million vehicles globally over a brake light problem, in what would be the automaker's biggest-ever recall as it grapples with a series of quality-related issues following rapid expansion.
Japan's sixth-largest automaker told Reuters on Friday that it was recalling nearly 2 million of its popular Impreza and Forester models in the United States, its biggest market, and other countries, along with around 300,000 units in Japan to fix a fault with the brake light switch which can lead to ignition problems.
Vehicles affected were produced from 2008 through 2017. If all of the identified vehicles are recalled, it would be the automaker's biggest in terms of affected units, excluding the ongoing Takata airbag recall.
Since late 2017, Subaru has been reeling from a host of problems ranging from faulty components to inspection re-dos which, coupled with weakening sales in the United States, has forced the automaker to slash its full-year profit outlook to its weakest in six years.
Quality-related issues have cast a pall on the automaker which enjoyed years of rapid growth in the United States, where it won over affluent and liberal-minded consumers with advertisements featuring slogans championing love and inclusion.
Such branding boosted the image of the tiny automaker, prompting it to ramp up production in the United States, which accounts for around 60 percent of its global sales volume.
But in January, Subaru halted production at its sole car factory in Japan for nearly two weeks, holding up roughly 60 percent of its global output after it found a defect in a power steering component. 
Late last year, it announced a global recall of its signature boxer engines over an issue with its valve springs, while it has launched a series of domestic recalls for re-inspections after it admitted to cheating on testing processes.
(The story corrects to clarify recall has not yet begun, in the headline and first and third paragraphs)

287,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2019 01:00AM ET</span>",Wine and shine: Scorching summer wilts Australia's grape crop,"By Tom Westbrook
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's hottest summer on record is hitting its $4.4 billion wine industry hard, with grape yields set to drop to the lowest in years and hopes the heat could produce tastier tipples starting to shrivel like fruit on some of the nation's vines.
As harvesting gets into full swing, forecasts show winemakers are the latest to succumb to a catastrophic drought that has already wilted the winter wheat crop and is expected to drag the wool clip to a record low.
Rabobank in January forecast Australia's total grape crush would fall about 5 percent from the year before to 1.7 million tonnes, but heatwave conditions since then have industry players predicting the smallest harvest since a disease-hit 2011 crop, at around 1.6 million tonnes at best. 
""The general consensus is things are pretty grim,"" said Greg Knight, a grower in the Barossa region, a premier winemaking area in the state of South Australia. 
He began picking the season's first pinot noir this week, about three weeks sooner than usual, after his dams dried up in January, and expects his crop to be between half and two-thirds the size of last year's. 
""It was a heatwave we didn't really need,"" he said on the phone after working from dawn until the temperature nudged 39 Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) at lunchtime. Although he noted that the quality of his surviving grapes was good.
Australia is the world's sixth-largest wine exporter, with the weaker yield coming as top producers in Europe harvested a bumper crop in 2018.
""There's no question that (the Australian grape harvest is) going to be down,"" said Perth-based wine broker Peter Briggs, who trades about 10 million liters of wine annually.
Bulk grape prices have already surged by about a fifth, he said, squeezing local winemakers who don't run their own vineyards and who will find it very difficult to pass on price rises to customers, especially bulk buyers overseas.
""A lot of the bigger players don't care where they get the wine from as long as they can get it at a (good) price,"" he said. 
Australia's weather bureau on Friday said that the Southern (NYSE:SO) summer just ended was its hottest since national records began in 1910, and among the 10 driest. It forecasts hot, dry weather persisting through autumn.
""You just could not keep the water up to the vines,"" said winemaker Neil McGuigan, chief executive of Australian Vintage Ltd, on a conference call after the firm announced it expects its 2019 tonnage to drop from a year ago. 
""When you cook the fruit, they just disappear. They become raisins and they just dry up ... It's a little upsetting when you've worked so hard.""
But not all vineyards are suffering, with Australia's west coast spared the worst of the weather. Irrigation, though expensive, has offered a cushion to some growers in the east.
FADING HOPES 
Hopes the dry weather could produce a vintage with a stronger flavor due to more sugar in grapes are also starting to fade, with some in the industry saying conditions have simply been too hot.
""Vines won't do anything while it's stinking hot,"" said Briggs in Perth.
""The grapes just start to shrivel and you get that horrible raisiny character. When it's this hot ... it doesn't necessarily improve quality at all.""
However, some are more optimistic. Australia's largest wine exporter, Treasury Wine Estates Ltd, said it did not generally forecast the quality of its vintages but was ""really encouraged"" this year. 
And Mark Dietz, owner of Stuyvesant's House, a Sydney restaurant famed for its wine list, calls out Hunter Valley shiraz as a drop to watch. 
""I reckon '19 is going to be pretty spot on,"" he said.
""It's a part of why you go into it - it's not just the romance about picking grapes, you've got to fight against all these natural things that come.""

289,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 11:00PM ET</span>",There Are Some Losers as Chinese Stocks Rise in MSCI Indexes,"(Bloomberg) -- Global equity investors wanting greater Chinese stock exposure without taking on active management strategies have reason to celebrate MSCI Inc.’s latest tweak to benchmark indexes. Yet the move also creates some losers.
“With China being added to the investible list of indices, tracking funds will have to rebalance their holdings to accommodate for this, which could result in an overhang for other indices in the region,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners, a firm specializing in event-driven analysis.
MSCI will lift China-listed stocks in its Emerging Markets Index to 3.3 percent by November, from the current 0.72 percent. While billions of dollars are set to flow into so-called A-shares as a result, the weighting of Southeast Asian markets will likely drop to about 7.7 percent from 8 percent now,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts Sean Gardiner and Aarti Shah wrote in a report published Friday. “A mild dilution, but overhang nonetheless.”
That may help explain why the Philippine Stock Exchange Index was down 1 percent as of 11:09 a.m. in Manila, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index was up 0.2 percent. Nicky Franco, head of research for Abacus Securities Corp. in Manila, calculates the potential outflows from the Philippines at about $700 million, he wrote in a note Friday.
By contrast, the ChiNext Index of Chinese small-cap and tech stocks gained 1.2 percent and the CSI 300 Index advanced 0.9 percent. Once the latest inclusion is completed -- it will start in May -- there will be 253 large- and 168 mid-cap China shares in the index.
Still, it may not be all bad news if the net result is that global investors get more interested in the broader Asian region.
“China’s greater weight is at the expense of other countries whose weights get adjusted down,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney. “But that’s only a short-term impact. China’s greater weight may in time attract more funds to the Asian region.”

Investors have been concerned about the status of PDVSA debt after Washington imposed sweeping sanctions on the company earlier this year.
JPMorgan, which declined to comment on its monthly rebalancing, also sent out a survey to its clients asking more specific questions about Venezuela, Tina Vandersteel, Boston-based head of emerging country debt at Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo & Co, told Reuters.
""JPM had launched a survey, which I'd completed, about what to do about VENZ. The feedback I gave them was, per their index liquidity rules, while the sanctions prevailed, they should be removed,"" Vandersteel said in an email.
At the end of January, PDVSA had a weight of 0.53 in JPMorgan's EMBI Global Diversified index while Venezuela Republic bonds were at 0.66, according to the index provider.
Reuters did not have access to February index weight data.
Venezuela - the country with the largest oil reserves in the world - has defaulted on most of its $63 billion of debt as it has spiraled into its worst-ever economic crisis. The International Monetary Fund has forecast inflation will hit 10 million percent this year.
Since the start of the year, bonds issued by Venezuela and PDVSA chalked up steady gains amid weeks of protests that saw pressure mount on President Nicolas Maduro. 
However, trading in PDVSA bonds almost ground to a halt after Washington imposed a swathe of sanctions, including a ban on U.S. investors from trading in the secondary market, other than divestment. 

JPMorgan communicates any changes of index constituents to its clients on the last trading day of the month. The EMBI Global index includes $24.1 billion of dollar-denominated PDVSA debt, according to the index provider.

293,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 08:40PM ET</span>",Intellia CEO not involved in Starboard's Bristol-Myers board challenge,"By Greg Roumeliotis
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Intellia Therapeutics Inc Chief Executive John Leonard, who U.S. drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co said last week was nominated by hedge fund Starboard Value LP to sit on its board, is not affiliated with the effort, an Intellia spokeswoman said on Thursday.
""He is not involved. He has a very demanding job as our CEO and he is on other boards as well,"" Jennifer Mound Smoter, Intellia senior vice president for external affairs and communications, said in an interview after Reuters contacted Leonard. 
Smoter declined to offer an explanation on how Leonard's name was included in Starboard's slate of five directors to challenge Bristol-Myers' board. Starboard declined to comment. 
Leonard is a seasoned pharmaceutical industry executive, having previously held senior positions at  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) and Abbvie Inc. 
Starboard's four other board nominees are Starboard Chief Executive Jeffrey Smith, Shulman Family Ventures managing partner Steven Shulman, Tyree & D'Angelo Partners co-CEO Michael Tyree, and Water Street Healthcare Partner Janet Vergis, according to a regulatory filing by Bristol-Myers.
Starboard's immediate goal is to muster enough Bristol-Myers shareholder support to shoot down the company's $74 billion deal to acquire biotech  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG), the New York-based fund said on Thursday. If it succeeds, it will use the slate to challenge Bristol-Myers' board, Starboard added.
Starboard reported on Thursday it owned 4.4 million shares, or 0.3 percent, of Bristol's shares.
A top Bristol-Myers shareholder, Wellington Management, came out against the Celgene deal on Wednesday, criticizing it as too risky and expensive.
Bristol-Myers on Thursday defended the Celgene deal, through which it hopes to create a market leader in the lucrative treatment of cancer by combining two of the world's biggest-selling portfolios of drugs that treat the disease, as well as adding assets in immunology and inflammation.
Starboard has a track record of opposing deals. It tried to block Virginia-based meat giant Smithfield Foods' sale to Chinese company Shuanghui International in 2013, as well as aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) Inc's acquisition of B/E Aerospace two years ago. Both deals were done.
Starboard has been seeking to burnish its credentials in the pharmaceutical sector. Perrigo Company Plc shares have lost more than a third of their value since the drug maker gave Starboard board representation in 2017.

294,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 07:55PM ET</span>","Marriott revenue, FY forecast miss estimates on weak demand","By Divya R and Manojna Maddipatla
(Reuters) - Marriott International Inc on Thursday missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue and forecast a lower-than-expected full-year profit, blaming weak demand in North America, its largest market.
Marriott's revPAR growth - a key measure of hotel health - during the fourth quarter was hurt by labor strikes in eight markets in North America and weaker-than-expected demand for the industry.
""Q4 profit beat, but RevPAR unimpressive. 2019 RevPAR guide lowered and earnings guide miss,"" SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Patrick Scholes said in a note.
The hotel operator's worldwide RevPAR growth of 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter missed analysts' expectations of 2.04 percent.
RevPAR is calculated by multiplying a hotel's average daily room rate by its occupancy rate.
The world's largest hotel chain lowered its full-year worldwide revPAR forecast between 1 percent and 3 percent, from a previously announced range of 2 percent to 3 percent. 
Marriott also incurred $28 million of expenses in the quarter and recognized $25 million of insurance proceeds related to data security incident it disclosed in November. 
The company did not say, however, whether the data breach had any impact on demand.
Marriott said in January that fewer than 383 million customer records were stolen in a massive cyber attack and 25.55 million passport numbers were stolen in the attack on the Starwood Hotels reservation system.
The company also said North America's RevPAR to grow in the range of 1 percent to 2 percent in the current quarter, reflecting the impact of the government shutdown offset by a favorable calendar comparison.
Shares of the company, which owns the Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis luxury hotel brands, fell 2 percent to $122.95 in after-hours trading.
The company expects full-year 2019 profit in the range of $5.87 to $6.10 per share, well below analysts' estimates of $6.32, according to Refinitiv data.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.44 per share, beating estimates of $1.39.
Net income rose to $317 million, or 92 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $114 million, or 31 cents per share, a year earlier.

Revenue rose to $5.29 billion from $5.25 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $5.48 billion.

295,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>","Lloyds' overdraft charges 'fly in the face' of transparency, say UK lawmakers","LONDON, Mar 1 (Reuters) - Lawmakers have criticized a move by Britain's Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) to impose more expensive and complex overdraft fees on customers only months before a regulatory clampdown.
Nicky Morgan, chair of the powerful Treasury Select Committee, said the charges by Britain's biggest domestic bank ""fly in the face"" of clarity and transparency.
Lloyds, which has a 38 percent market share in basic bank accounts, began rolling out a tiered system of overdraft charges from last month, increasing charges for anyone borrowing less than about 4,100 pounds ($5,443).
The bank previously charged a flat daily rate of 1 pence per 7 pounds of borrowing, but the new staggered charges start at 1 pence for every 6 pounds of credit, meaning more fees are racked up on lower sums.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has published proposals to drive down high overdraft costs, including a ban on tiered charges, with enforcement potentially starting as early as December.
The watchdog said the average arranged overdraft across the British banking sector is about 250 pounds.
""It’s puzzling that whilst welcoming the FCA's simplification proposals, Lloyds Banking Group has introduced such a complex tiered system for – potentially – a relatively short period of time,"" Morgan said.
In a letter to Morgan, Lloyds Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio defended the fee changes and said the bank had already moved to help customers by removing higher charges on unplanned overdrafts, in line with the FCA's recent proposals.
A spokesman for Lloyds said the lender would reflect on the points raised by the Treasury Select Committee.
The spokseman added: ""We have been working closely with the FCA and other stakeholders on overdrafts and we are fully participating in the FCA's consultation process.  
""Overdrafts are an important issue and we will continue to listen to the views of the FCA and other stakeholders on the need to bring more clarity and transparency.""

296,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 07:05PM ET</span>","Gap to separate Old Navy brand, close stores; shares soar 25 percent","By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) will separate its better-performing Old Navy brand and shutter about 230 stores of its struggling namesake apparel business, in one of its biggest restructuring efforts to energize sales, sending shares surging 25 percent on Thursday.
The company has struggled with contrasting performances of its brands. Old Navy has been a bright spot as its wide range of budget apparel made it more attractive to a broader base of customers, while its specialty Gap brand struggled in the face of competition from fast-fashion retailers and changing trends.
""It's clear that Old Navy's business model and customers have increasingly diverged from our specialty brands over time,"" Gap's Chairman Robert Fisher said in a statement. 
The 230 Gap specialty stores the company planned to close over the next two years, along with the 68 already shut, represents nearly half of its stores, the company said.
The company also said it would boost spending on marketing and developing new products for the Gap brand, but Chief Executive Officer Art Peck stopped short of saying that the brand was in a turnaround.
""I've called the turn before. And I've eaten my words. I'm not calling a turn again. What I'm looking forward is period-over-period improvement, and I'm quite confident and comfortable with what I'm seeing.""
Gap, Athleta, Banana Republic and the remaining brands will be part of a yet-to-be-named company. The separation of Old Navy into a publicly listed company, which Gap said will be tax free to investors, is likely to be completed by 2020. 
Peck will hold the same position in the new company, while Old Navy CEO Sonia Syngal will stay on as head of the standalone firm.
Old Navy has annual sales of about $8 billion, while the other brands have a combined revenue of $9 billion.
""Although the proposed spin at Old Navy will enable a sharpened strategic focus on its business priorities, it reduces the diversification the brand provides to the overall entity,"" said Moody's analyst Christina Boni.
The company's shares were up 24.8 percent at $31.70 in extended trading.
POOR HOLIDAY PERFORMANCE
Separately, Gap reported a surprise drop in overall same-store sales for the holiday quarter, down 1 percent compared with analysts' average estimate of a 0.3 percent rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Ironically, lack of same-store sales growth at Old Navy hurt fourth-quarter overall sales. The company blamed an absence of new products and macro-economic issues for a drop in traffic to the Old Navy stores during the crucial December shopping season.
Gap also warned that it expects the first half of 2019 to be more challenging than last year, due to a cold start to the year that weighed on all its businesses, particularly Old Navy.

(Reuters) - HBO Chief Executive Richard Plepler will leave the premium television network owned by U.S. wireless carrier AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) after nearly 28 years at the company, Plepler said in a memo to HBO employees on Thursday.
Turner President David Levy is also expected to resign from the broadcasting company, which is also owned by AT&T, according to a source familiar with the plan.
AT&T unit WarnerMedia, which oversees HBO and Turner, declined to comment.
""Hard as it is to think about leaving the company I love, and the people I love in it, it is the right time for me to do so,"" Plepler wrote in the memo seen by Reuters.
Plepler oversaw many successes at HBO such as hit shows like ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Girls.""
The news comes after AT&T won an appeals court decision on Tuesday for its purchase of media company Time Warner, which included HBO and the Turner TV networks.
Many in the industry had expected AT&T would begin to restructure the HBO and Turner properties after its second victory over the U.S. Department of Justice, which had sued to stop the merger.
Former NBC Chairman Robert Greenblatt is in talks to take a leadership role at WarnerMedia, the source added.

298,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 06:29PM ET</span>",China's fledgling junk bond market spawns new breed of vulture funds,"By Samuel Shen and Noah Sin
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG(Reuters) - When the Shanghai-traded bonds of conglomerate China Minsheng Investment Group plunged 40 percent over two days in January after news it had missed a repayment, Beijing-based hedge fund manager Jash Zhang smelled blood.
As the private investors in the bond rushed to sell, Zhang snapped up CMIG's dumped bonds at about 50 yuan ($7.48) apiece, or half their face value, betting that the 300-billion-yuan company would eventually repay the debt.
The strategy，she said, is simply to pounce when faint-hearted investors are wavering.
""When bad news breaks about an issuer, some funds will scramble to sell the bonds,"" said Liu Xiaofang, head of investment research at Shanghai Fengshi Asset Management Ltd, which launched its first vulture fund in September. But the bonds' underlying problem might be ""not that big,"" creating opportunities.
Zhang and Liu are among a new flock of vulture investors that have emerged in China's corporate bond market in the last year, seeking to profit from steep sell-offs.
The risky but potentially lucrative business of trading in bonds on the verge of default is in its infancy in China, almost as new as the phenomenon of corporate defaults in the state-run economy. 
A regulatory source said only a handful of other hedge funds have entered the trade, including Lanjing Investment, Colight Asset Management, Jing Tang Investment and Yongle Fund Management. The source declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
By some estimates, the market in such distressed bonds is worth just 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion), a tiny fraction of the $472 billion corporate bond market.
But analysts expect it to grow rapidly as the country's default wave, driven by funding squeezes in the private sector, claims more victims.
'FALLEN ANGELS'
The strategy of trading in distressed bonds is more commonplace in mature markets, with recognisable names such as Elliot Management and Aurelius Capital known for their aggressive recovery tactics. 
The emergence of vultures in China, spurred by a record number of delinquencies in 2018, could help improve liquidity in a corporate bond market that has traditionally been dominated by low-risk investors such as mutual funds, brokers and insurers.
In all, 45 companies in sectors ranging from real estate to industrials and mining defaulted on 117 bonds with a total principal amount of 110.5 billion yuan in 2018, according to ratings agency Fitch.
That is more than all the previous years' sums combined. China's first bond default occurred in 2014. 
""The (Chinese) government did not really allow defaults to happen until about four years ago,"" said Ben Zhu, a Hong Kong-based distressed debt investor. ""As defaults spread, the bad apples get picked out. These companies will lose access to financing, and that's a good thing."" 
For Liu of Fengshi Asset Management, the game of hunting for ""fallen angels"" has been highly profitable.
Last November, when Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co's debt instruments dived on a wave of negative reports suggesting reckless fundraising and insider trading by the firm, Liu bought for 70 cents on the dollar one of its bonds that would mature soon. 
""The market consensus was that this company was cooking books. But we didn't think the problem was big enough to lead to an imminent default,"" Liu said.
Kangmei paid investors in full the next month.
""On an annualized basis, it's a return of several hundred percent. On an absolute basis, it was a gain of around 40 percent. And we bet heavily,"" he said.
More audacious investors like to buy bonds that have failed to repay investors on time.
""There's too much panic around defaults,"" said Zhou Li, president of Rationalstone Investment. ""Whenever a company defaults, people would assume the (bond) value would be wiped out to naught. But that's not the case."" 
He added that not all technical defaults - such as a delay in payment - would lead to genuine defaults. And some or all of the money can be recovered, he said, making bargain hunting profitable. 
'LUCK REQUIRED'
Distressed asset specialists previously active only in lending markets are now venturing into troubled bonds. Guoho AMC, a bad-loan company in eastern Anhui province, is one example. 
""We see mutual funds dumping them in the market. They have to. For them, it's toxic,"" said Liu Zhenhua, Guoho's Shanghai general manager. ""But as a bad-loan company, we're good at assessing its value. You need an eye to spot gold in a junk market."" 
Skeptics say this money-making model will falter in China.
Desmond Kuang, portfolio manager at Income Partners Asset Management in Hong Kong, said the typical strategy would be to buy into cheap bonds after thorough research and with some conviction that the investment can be recovered. That may not work in China, he said, where there is a lack of transparency in company disclosures.
""There will be a lot of luck required onshore,"" he said.
Fengshi Asset Management's Liu said the risks could be big, and such a strategy would typically require clients with strong nerves to commit their funds for three to five years.
""It's a gamble. And you're betting against professional institutions, not layman retail investors,"" Liu said. ""This game is very demanding in your ability to identify and assess risks.""

299,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 06:13PM ET</span>",MSCI to quadruple weighting of China A-shares in its global benchmarks,"By Rodrigo Campos and Samuel Shen
NEW YORK/SHANGAI (Reuters) - Global index provider MSCI will quadruple the weighting of Chinese mainland shares in its global benchmarks later this year, it said on Thursday, potentially drawing more than $80 billion of fresh foreign inflows to the world's second-biggest economy.
MSCI also announced that it will add Chinese mid-cap stocks to its emerging market benchmark in November, boosting the number of Chinese constituents. 
In a statement on its website, MSCI said it will increase the inclusion factor of Chinese large-cap stocks to 20 percent from the current 5 percent in two steps, in May 2019 and in August. As a result, the weighting of Chinese stocks in the MSCI Emerging Market Index will jump to 3.3 percent, from roughly 0.7 percent currently. 
The announcement could add fuel to a stock market that has jumped over 20 percent this year, partly on hopes that Beijing and Washington will soon reach a deal to resolve their trade dispute.
Rival index publisher FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices will both start adding yuan-denominated Chinese shares to their global benchmarks this year as Beijing steps up efforts to integrate China’s capital markets into the global financial system.
Fang Xinghai, deputy head of China's securities regulator, predicted foreign capital inflows to Chinese stocks this year will double to about 600 billion yuan ($89.76 billion).
MSCI said it will add Chinese A Mid-Cap shares, including eligible ChiNext shares, with a 20 percent inclusion factor, to the MSCI indexes in November. 
After implementation, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index will include 253 large-cap and 168 mid-cap China A-shares, representing a weight of 3.3 percent in the pro-forma index.
Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at Krane Funds Advisors in New York, which manages the KraneShares Bosera MSCI China A ETF, said: ""I am almost crying. We have built the (ETF) in anticipation of this event. We anticipated that this inclusion would take place and built an ETF vehicle that investors could proactively take advantage of.""

KBA is up 24.6 percent so far this year.

300,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 06:10PM ET</span>",Watch China Inc.’s Insider Selling,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Foreigners are finally warming to China. 
It’s no surprise: In just two months, the country’s stock market has done a 180. Investors from abroad were net buyers of more than 120 billion yuan ($18 billion) of shares this year through Hong Kong’s Stock Connect. In hindsight, MSCI Inc.’s decision to include mainland stocks in its benchmark indexes last May seems like a wise one. 
Late Thursday in New York, MSCI said it will increase the weighting of A shares in its China indexes and related benchmarks by raising the so-called inclusion factor – the ratio of mainland stocks' market cap that's included in the index – to 20 percent from 5 percent. As a result, China’s stock market can expect another $60 billion of buying, estimates  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
This flood of foreign money is a bullish sign for Chinese stocks, enthusiasts say. 
Not so fast. 
Take a look at who owns China’s $6.4 trillion stock market. At 2.2 percent, foreigners’ sway is tiny. And while local retail investors are blamed for the 2015 stock-market frenzy, they hold only 20 percent. The majority of shares are still controlled by insiders: founders, management and parent holding companies. 
As early as May 2017, China’s securities watchdog tightened regulation on stock sales by majority shareholders. The move was intended to protect retail investors and strengthen corporate governance. 
But that hasn’t stopped insiders from selling, even at the risk of facing the regulator’s ire. In the three weeks ended Feb. 23, such investors – concentrated among firms listed on the private-sector ChiNext board – were net sellers of more than 4 billion yuan of shares, according to data compiled by Sinolink Securities Co. On Monday and Tuesday, when daily trading volume exceeded 1 trillion yuan, close to 80 companies filed insider-selling disclosures with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges.
It’s not hard to see why. China’s private sector is battling a crisis of confidence. Entrepreneurs are fleeing the country and curtailing their spending on equipment and machinery. The central bank’s credit disproportionately benefits state-backed firms. Nowadays, local government financing vehicles can issue bonds more cheaply than their private-sector peers. High-yield enterprises – real estate developers, for instance – still can’t raise new notes onshore. 
If you were a lucky entrepreneur at a ChiNext-listed company, wouldn’t you maximize this rare bull window and sell, too? 
Those betting on foreign money to stabilize China’s stock market are simply delusional. As developing countries from Indonesia to Argentina have discovered, a nation that relies on hot money from abroad is an unstable one. Will these investors stay in China’s stock market if Beijing can’t reach a trade agreement with the U.S., or the Federal Reserve continues to taper its balance sheet?
MSCI’s indexes are just guidelines – portfolio managers can always go “off the benchmark.” If Beijing really wants a slow bull, forget about lobbying index providers and massaging trading volumes. Lift private entrepreneurs’ spirits instead. "
301,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 06:06PM ET</span>","In U.S. charm offensive, China's Huawei launches ad to combat dark image","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies ran a full page ad in major U.S. newspapers on Thursday urging readers not to believe ""everything you hear,"" about the Chinese tech firm, as it defends itself against government accusations its equipment can be used to spy.
The world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, which has been charged with bank fraud related to U.S. sanctions against Iran, touted its relief efforts in disaster-torn countries like Chile and Indonesia, and its work to connect the undeserved around the world.
""Our doors are always open. We would like the U.S. public to get to know us better,"" the ad states, noting that the U.S. government has ""developed some misunderstandings about us.""
The advertisement ran in the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Politico, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times, said Huawei spokesman Chase Skinner. 
The move is part of an unprecedented public relations blitz, launched last month with a 25-minute interview aired on state-controlled China Central Television (CCTV) with Huawei Chief Executive Ren Zhengfei. Interviews on the UK's BBC and American broadcaster CBS soon followed.
In the CCTV segment, Zhengfei shrugged off the global push against his company and hinted at the rationale behind the media push. 
""My public relations department forced me,"" a smiling Ren told CCTV. ""I must make our clients understand us, make our 180,000 employees understand us, come together and get through this tough time.""
The United States warns that next-generation 5G equipment, which some telecoms experts see as more vulnerable to attack than previous technology, could be exploited by the Chinese government for spying if supplied by Huawei.
Huawei has denied the claims, even as American officials have tried to persuade governments and telecoms operators around the world to shun Huawei equipment. 
""I think it's more being transparent. It's time to take control of our narrative,"" Skinner said, who noted that Huawei buys $11 billion in U.S. goods every year. 
The move comes as the United States is seeking the extradition from Canada of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and Ren's 47-year-old daughter, after charging her with bank and wire fraud related to violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran.

In interviews earlier this month, Ren said her arrest was politically motivated and that the company had never shared any customer information with the Chinese government, and never would.

304,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 05:40PM ET</span>",Bond Traders Need to Get Their Mojo Back,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- This year’s rebound in stocks looks to be running out of steam, geopolitical risks are on the rise and central banks are turning dovish amid evidence that the global economy is slowing. And yet the bond market is doing a whole lot of nothing when it should be roaring ahead. That should soon change.
As of late Thursday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note had traded in a tight range of just 12 basis points during February, making it the most static month since the 1970s, according to Bloomberg News’s Elizabeth Stanton. Also, the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. Treasury Index was on track to deliver its first negative monthly return since October. Now, this could be a sign that bond traders feel that the broader economy won’t get much worse. That makes sense, given that the latest forecasts show most economists don’t expect a recession to hit until late 2021. But recent history suggests there’s plenty of room for yields to move lower. Medley Global Macro Managing Director Ben Emons has noticed an interesting relationship between Chinese manufacturing and bonds yields. More specifically, Emons pointed out in a note to clients Thursday that yields tend to track the new orders portion of the China purchasing managers index with a six-month lag. Given that the most recent China PMI released Thursday fell to its lowest level since early 2016, the bond market should see sustained demand – and lower yields – in the months ahead.
After real GDP growth of 3.2 percent in 2018, aggregate growth among the Group of 20 economies will slow to 2.9 percent in 2019 and 2.8 percent in 2020, Moody’s Investors Service said in a research note Thursday. The credit-rating firm noted that key risks include a sharper-than-expected slowdown in China with negative spillovers for global growth, a further escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions and a renewed tightening of financial conditions.
STOCKS ARE GETTING STUCKGlobal stocks ended a lackluster February with the MSCI All-Country World Index falling the most in about three weeks. Many markets worldwide seem to be getting stuck at key levels of resistance. For the S&P 500 Index, that level is 2,800. The benchmark did basically nothing the first three days this week, moving less than 3.5 points each day for a total journey of 7.2 points. The last time the gauge had such a small move over three sessions was 14 months ago, according to Bloomberg News’s Elena Popina. “The market has been jumping over the small hurdles on the way up, but we’re approaching the 2,800 line and the hurdle all of a sudden is four stories tall,” Michael Antonelli, a managing director and market strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co., told Bloomberg News. “We need some serious progress in U.S.- China trade talks for the S&P 500 to breach that line. As of right now, the markets are not convinced that we’re ready for new highs.” At the same time, long-short hedge funds on  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG’s prime brokerage platform have reduced their net exposure to equities in the last two weeks as they ramp up short bets, reports Bloomberg News’s Justina Lee. After slashing positions amid last quarter’s carnage, their gross positioning remains well below last year’s peaks – a 13 percent dip for long-short managers and 22 percent lower for quants.
CURRENCY TRADERS MISS YET AGAINIf there is one word I would use to describe currency traders these days, it would probably be hapless. The Citi Parker Global Currency Index, which tracks nine distinct foreign-exchange investment styles, fell in each of the last four years, and is down again in February following a decline in January. The 1.33 percent drop for February is among the worst in recent years. There are a few takeaways from this dismal performance. The first is that currency traders are a victim of low volatility, which generally provides fewer opportunities to exploit wild market swings. Overall volatility in the foreign-exchange market as measured by a JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) index is about the lowest since 2014. The euro-dollar cross, which sees roughly $1.25 trillion of transactions a day, has traded within 3.4 U.S. cents since the beginning of 2019, marking the tightest quarterly range since the inception of the euro two decades ago, according to Bloomberg News’s Katherine Greifeld. The most plausible reason for the decline in volatility has been the dovish shift in central bank rhetoric. To the strategists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), the drop in volatility suggests markets aren’t prepared for potential negative shocks. They cite the large 0.5 percent decline in the South Korean won on Thursday after summit talks between the U.S. and North Korea unexpectedly broke down as just one example of how the currency market is too complacent, especially given the number of potential flash points out there. These include tensions between India and Pakistan, U.S.-China trade talks that continue to drag on, the danger of a no-deal Brexit, and the political and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela.
EMERGING MARKETS ARE GETTING TIRED February wasn’t very kind to emerging markets outside of bonds, where yield spreads narrowed to their tightest levels since October. The MSCI Emerging Market Index of equities was essentially flat and a similar index measuring the performance of their currencies fell for the first time since October. Such results don’t speak well for the outlook for riskier assets in general. That’s especially true now that one of the bellwethers in emerging markets looks to be running into some trouble. Data on Thursday showed India’s economy expanded 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, down from 7 percent in the July-September period. Waning consumer demand dampened momentum in the economy where domestic spending makes up about two-thirds of GDP, according to Bloomberg News’s Anirban Nag and Vrishti Beniwal. And that was before this week’s tensions with neighboring Pakistan. “This comes at a tricky time for both sides, as India heads into the general elections in April-May 2019, while Pakistan is in a tenuous economic position,"" Radhika Rao, an economist at DBS Bank, told Bloomberg News. Tensions are likely to overshadow the growth data, she added. With it’s $2.6 trillion economy, India is the “I” in the BRIC acronym that also includes Brazil, Russia and China. So, any weakness in Indian markets has the high potential to turn off emerging-market investors globally.
BEEF IS ONE COMMODITIES BRIGHT SPOTThe commodities market eked out its second straight monthly gain in February, with the Bloomberg Commodity Index rising less than 1 percent following January’s big 5.23 percent surge. The results for February would have been much better if not for agricultural commodities, which tumbled about 4 percent and negated much of the gains in energy and industrial metals, which rallied more than 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively. On the whole, this is a positive sign for the global economy, or at least shows that worries about an imminent recession are overblown. But even within the agriculture complex, there are reasons for optimism. Take the cattle market, which is booming. Futures for April delivery touched a record high for the contract in Chicago this week at $1.30 a pound. The contract, which debuted in late 2017, is up 18 percent from a low in April, according to Bloomberg News’s Lydia Mulvany. Beef is a premium protein, and consumers generally cut back in times of trouble in favor of less expensive chicken and pork. And yet sales in the past four weeks for delivery 22 to 60 days out are up 16 percent compared with a year earlier, Mulvany reports, citing the Steiner Consulting Group’s Daily Livestock Report. Sales over the past four weeks for delivery 60 to 90 days out are even more impressive, more than double from 2018. “Retailers that want to once again promote ribs, strips or other such cuts now have to jump on this earlier in order to make sure they can get the regular supply,” according to the Daily Livestock Report.
TEA LEAVESThe Commerce Department said Thursday that U.S. economic growth decelerated to a 2.6 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter. Still, that was seen as mildly positive, as economists had forecast a rate of 2.2 percent. But on Friday, market participants are likely to find out that things are probably much weaker than they seem. That’s because the government is forecast to say that real personal spending in December, which excludes inflation, fell 0.3 percent in the biggest decline since 2009. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy. There’s more: The Institute for Supply Management is expected to say that its monthly manufacturing index dropped to 55.7 for February from 56.6 in January. Although that would still indicate healthy growth, the risk is to the downside. The reason is that the index unexpectedly rose in January, propelled higher as the orders portion of the index jumped by the most since 2014 and production gained the most in eight years. So it makes sense that there could be a big give-back in the February numbers, especially since other manufacturing data has been a mixed bag.

1. Income and Spending Data on Tap
Following today’s delayed in-line report on GDP, the market will get a look at shutdown-delayed income and spending numbers.
At 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT), the December numbers on personal income and spending will arrive. In addition, the January income number will also be issued.
Personal spending is expected by economists to have fallen 0.2% in December.
Income is forecast to post a 0.3% rise in January and a 0.5% rise for December.

2. ISM Manufacturing, Michigan Sentiment Due
Along with spending and income, there will be economic indicators on manufacturing activity and consumer confidence.
The Institute of Supply Management will report its February manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
The manufacturing PMI is expected to drop to 55.5 for the month, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com. A reading above 50 indicates the manufacturing sector of the economy is still growing.
At the same time, the University of Michigan will issue its final measure of February consumer sentiment.
The index is seen coming in at 95.8, slightly higher than the preliminary measure. The end of the government shutdown at the end of January cheered consumers, the survey's chief economist said. In January, the index fell to 91.2, a two-year low.

Both Booking and L Brands fell sharply after delivering mixed results, as earnings beat estimates from Investing.com, but revenue fell short.
On the economic front, the U.S. economy grew at an annual pace of 2.6% in the fourth quarter, in line with expectations, but well below the 3.4% growth in the third quarter, raising fears the economy likely made a slow start to the year.
But Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said a slowdown in 2019 would likely be ""manageable,"" pointing to an uptick in private domestic final sales and business investment in the fourth quarter from the third.
The data is unlikely to move the needle for the Fed on tightening in the next few months, but the central bank could abandon its pause later this year, probably sometime in the third quarter,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said.
In tech, HP (NYSE:HPQ) plummeted 17.3% after Bank of America Merrill Lynch double downgraded the company's stock to underperform from buy and cut its price target on the stock to $19. The downgrade arrived as the company posted fiscal first-quarter results that missed estimates on the top line.
Energy stocks were shunned, falling 1% despite U.S. oil prices settling higher, a day after the Energy Information Administration reported U.S. crude supplies unexpectedly fell last week.
On the trade front, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow touted progress on U.S.-China trade talks. But that did little to spark a bid in markets.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Wednesday said ""much still needs to be done"" to reach a trade deal.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell slightly on Thursday as support from better-than-feared U.S. GDP data was countered by concerns about earnings and U.S.-China trade relations.
Also on Thursday, President Donald Trump said he had walked out of his Vietnam summit with Kim Jong Un because of demands from the North Korean leader to lift U.S.-led sanctions. 
Commerce Department data on Thursday showed that while the U.S. economy missed a 3 percent annual growth target for 2018, a better-than-expected fourth quarter pushed gross domestic product up 2.9 percent for the year.
But investors were cautious, nothing that the S&P has risen 11 percent year-to-date at the same time as expectations for current quarter earnings have turned negative.
That's a ""disconnect that needs to be reconciled"" said Terry Sandven, portfolio manager and chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank in Minneapolis. 
Wall Street analysts now expect first-quarter earnings to fall 1.1 percent compared with Jan. 1 estimates for 5.3 percent growth, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""This week we've lacked directional drivers. Fourth quarter earnings is coming to a quick close and there's been no news on the U.S.-China trade negotiations. On balance, we're due for a period of consolidation and retrenchment,"" said Sandven.
Investors were also unimpressed by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow's assurance Thursday that U.S.-China trade negotiations were moving forward after ""fantastic"" progress made last week.
""Unlike a month ago, where a statement by an official was probably sufficient to push stocks higher, it no longer is. It's time for concrete progress,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. 
""What's pushing markets down and counterpointing GDP is the concern about corporate earnings.""

The S&P and Dow both registered their third straight day of losses on Thursday. 
Of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, the materials sector was the biggest percentage decliner with a 1.27 percent drop, while the energy sector was the second biggest percentage loser, with a 0.97 percent fall. [O/R]
The healthcare sector fell 0.3 percent with drags from UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), down 3 percent on concerns about the potential for a single-payer U.S. healthcare system.
Also,  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG) fell 8.6 percent after activist investor Starboard Value LP said it will vote against drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co's proposed $74 billion acquisition of the biotech company. Bristol-Myers rose 1.4 percent. 
Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) Holdings Inc fell 10.96 percent after missing quarterly earnings expectations and was the biggest single-stock drag on the S&P. Also dragging on the S&P was HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ), which plunged about 17.3 percent after it reported revenue that missed analysts' estimates.
 Monster Beverage  Corp (NASDAQ:MNST) jumped 8.7 percent, making it the biggest percentage gainer on the S&P, after it beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue and profit.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.30-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 34 new lows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American Airlines was fined $1 million and Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) $750,000 for violating federal rules barring lengthy tarmac delays at U.S. airports, the U.S. Transportation Department said on Thursday.
Under most circumstances, airlines are prohibited from allowing domestic flights to remain on the tarmac for longer than three hours, and international flights for more than four hours, without giving passengers an opportunity to deplane. 
Of the fine assessed to American, $450,000 was credited to the airline for compensating passengers. The Transportation Department cited 13 tarmac delays since December 2015 at American Airlines and blamed ""gate mismanagement"" for two delayed flights.
Delta was credited with $450,000 for compensating customers and establishing a backup data center and an automated aircraft-parking guidance and jet-bridge positioning system, the department said.
The airlines agreed to pay the resulting fines as part of consent orders.
Delta said it provided customers with substantial compensation for the delays, including cash reimbursements, SkyMiles and future travel vouchers.
""Delta has spent millions to invest in new technologies to increase efficiency of aircraft movement during irregular operations and additional deicing capacity at its Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport hub,"" the company added.
American Airlines spokeswoman Shannon Gilson said the delays were the result of ""exceptional weather events dating as far back as 2015."" The company disputed that gate mismanagement was to blame for two delays.
She said the airline had ""put procedures in place to help better accommodate our customers when inclement weather occurs.""
American Airlines told the department it has invested more than $5 million in additional capital investments like vans, air stairs and lavatory trucks to address tarmac delays.
The Transportation Department cited about a dozen tarmac delays at Delta since 2017 and said passengers on seven flights at Atlanta were not allowed to deplane for hours even though there was ""no safety, security or Air Traffic Control reason for not doing so.""
Delta said the ""delays were the direct result of an extraordinary, unanticipated, and unpredictable system outage in the data center at Delta's Atlanta hub.""
Delta has invested more than $250 million to set up a new data center to back up essential applications in case of problems at the primary data center, the company said.

Delta has also spent $12.4 million on an automated aircraft-parking guidance and jet-bridge positioning system and is purchasing 20 additional deicing trucks and planning additional deicing pads at Atlanta.

316,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 02:13PM ET</span>","Kia, Hyundai expand U.S. engine fire recalls by 534,000 vehicles","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kia Motors Corp and affiliate Hyundai Motor Co said on Thursday they are recalling around 534,000 additional U.S. vehicles at risk of engine fires. 
Kia said it is recalling 378,000 2012-2016 Kia Soul vehicles over engine damage and fire risks, while Hyundai and Kia are recalling 155,000 2011-2013 Tucson vehicles and 2011-2012 Sportage vehicles over possible oil pan leaks in a separate callback.
Last month, the companies said they would recall 168,000 vehicles for fire risks. 
The South Korean automakers have now recalled more than 2.3 million vehicles since 2015 to address various engine fire risks in a series of recalls.
In November 2018, Reuters reported that federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation into Hyundai and Kia to determine if vehicle recalls linked to engine defects were conducted properly. The companies have declined to comment on the probe.
In May 2017, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the recalls of nearly 1.7 million Hyundai and Kia vehicles over engine defects.
Hyundai said it met with NHTSA in December 2018 to discuss the company's analysis and the agency informed the company that it ""expected Hyundai to conduct a safety recall"" of the 2011-2013 Hyundai Tucson.
There are no reports of accidents or injuries connected to either new recall, the companies said.
Kia said one new recall Thursday was prompted by high exhaust gas temperatures that may damage the catalytic converter and potentially other parts. Dealers will upgrade software to prevent overheating of the catalytic converter. 
Reuters reported in January that the companies would offer software upgrades for 3.7 million vehicles not being recalled. The automakers said the software update aims to protect the vehicles from internal damage, and they will also offer new extended warranties for engine issues.
A South Korean whistleblower in 2016 reported concerns to NHTSA, which has been probing the timeliness of three U.S. recalls and whether they covered enough vehicles.
In 2015, Hyundai recalled 470,000 U.S. Sonata sedans, saying engine failure would result in a vehicle stall, increasing the risk of a crash. At the time, Kia did not recall its vehicles, which share the same “Theta II” engines.
In March 2017, Hyundai expanded its original U.S. recall to 572,000 Sonata and Santa Fe Sport vehicles with “Theta II” engines, citing the same issue involving manufacturing debris.
On the same day, Kia also recalled 618,000 Optima, Sorento and Sportage vehicles, all of which use the same engine.

On Wednesday, the Center for Auto Safety, which has petitioned NHTSA to demand the recall of additional vehicles, told Congress that Kia and Hyundai must recall more vehicles at risk of fires after reports of 300 fires that were not the result of a collision.

317,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 01:45PM ET</span>","Uber, Lyft to offer some drivers shares in stock market listing","By Heather Somerville
(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft plan to offer cash bonuses to some of their most active drivers with the option to purchase shares in the ride-hailing firms' highly anticipated Wall Street debuts, a bold effort to improve driver relations as the companies transition to the public markets.
Both programs will offer drivers who have driven the longest and logged the most miles for the companies the rare chance to purchase stock at the initial public offering, before shares begin trading on public stock exchanges, according to four sources with knowledge of the matter. Such transactions are normally unavailable to retail investors.
The move is the latest bid by Uber and Lyft to improve relations with drivers who have long contested their classification as independent contractors and what they have claimed are low wages and poor treatment by the companies. Both companies still face thousands of driver arbitration claims over their employment status.
Lyft plans to give drivers who have logged at least 10,000 rides on the platform $1,000 that can be kept as a cash bonus or used to buy the IPO shares, one of the sources said on Thursday. The plan is an effort to reward the longest-serving and most active drivers, who do not enjoy employee benefits such as health insurance and reimbursement for expenses.
A driver who has completed 20,000 rides would be eligible for $10,000 in cash or an equivalent amount of stock, the person said. It was not clear how many drivers would qualify, but there is no cap on the program.
Many drivers in urban areas like San Francisco and Los Angeles drive for both Uber and Lyft, and some could stand to benefit from both stock programs.
The Wall Street Journal first reported Uber and Lyft's driver stock plans earlier on Thursday.
Lyft plans to launch its ""roadshow,"" when the company will pitch prospective investors to buy stock in the offering, the week of March 18, Reuters reported last week. The roadshow is expected to last about two weeks, likely making Lyft the first Wall Street debut from a group of highly valued, venture-backed companies all expected to go public this year.
Both Uber and Lyft confidentially filed for an IPO in December. Lyft is expected to publicly release its regulatory paperwork this week, and it likely will contain details on the driver stock reward program.
Uber, Lyft's much larger rival, still needs several more weeks to prepare for its IPO. The company is working out the details on a broad program for drivers that would give a significant portion of its 3 million active drivers and couriers globally a cash bonus, which they can use to purchase shares at the IPO price, according to three of the people with knowledge of the matter. 
The stock program will be much more complicated than Lyft’s since it involves many more drivers and countries with different securities laws, and it will run into the millions of dollars, one of these people said.
For drivers in overseas markets where securities laws will prohibit them from purchasing shares, keeping the cash will be their only option, another of the sources said. 
The cash bonuses will be doled out on a sliding scale based on the driver's length of service and number of trips or deliveries, this person said. The target numbers and the cutoff date to meet those targets are still being worked out and will be set prior to the IPO.
Stock prices often pop after trading begins, making for a lucrative payday for shareholders who are able to buy at the IPO price. However, many drivers are likely to keep the cash, said Harry Campbell, creator of the Rideshare Guy blog and podcast, which offers advice to drivers. 
""Most drivers are on a pretty tight budget so I think it will be tempting for them to take the cash bonus,"" he said.
Uber last year sent a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asking for a rule change so the company could award shares to drivers while it was still privately held. Such programs had been problematic in the past. New York-based ride-hailing startup Juno promised equity to drivers, which drew SEC scrutiny. Juno ended up voiding the equity program after it was acquired, prompting a lawsuit from drivers.

Lyft expects to be valued at between $20 billion and $25 billion in its IPO, up from its current $15 billion valuation. Uber is seeking a valuation that could reach $120 billion, up from its $76 billion valuation in the private market.

318,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 01:44PM ET</span>","MarketPulse: Box Flattened on Guidance, Revenue Miss ","Investing.com - Cloud-based content management company Box sank Thursday after it posted revenue and guidance that fell short of expectations.
Box (NYSE:BOX) reported fourth-quarter earnings of 6 cents a share, well above estimates from Investing.com for earnings of 2 cents a share. But revenue of $163.7 million fell short of estimates for $164.17 million. Its shares plunged 20%.
The company blamed the mixed results on weaker-than-expected billings generated for its subscription services in the fourth quarter, driven by ""underperformance in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. and longer sales cycles for some seven-figure deals.""
Despite some ""encouraging metrics,"" such as an increase in deals worth more than $100,000, the numbers show that Box's ""focus on strategic selling has yet to yield gains,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients.
Box grew billings 16%, but that was below the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s anticipated 26%.
Billings growth for the current-quarter is expected to remain challenged as the company guided in the low single-digit range. In 2020, however, growth rates are expected to normalize.
KeyBanc Capital Markets downgraded its rating on Box to sector weight from overweight.
For the first quarter, Box expects revenue of $161 million to $162 million on losses in a range of $0.06 to $0.05 a share, below estimates for a $0.01 loss a share on revenue of $169.81 million."
319,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 01:43PM ET</span>",Huawei units plead not guilty to U.S. trade secret theft,"(Reuters) - Huawei Device Co Ltd and Huawei Device USA Inc pleaded not guilty to U.S. fraud, trade secrets conspiracy and other charges, and a trial date was set for March 2020, the Justice Department said on Thursday. 
The units of China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd were arraigned in U.S. District Court in Seattle, and Chief U.S. District Judge Ricardo S. Martinez set trial for March 2, 2020.
The two companies were charged in an indictment unsealed last month that they conspired to steal T-Mobile US Inc trade secrets between 2012 and 2014. 
The charges have added to pressure from the U.S. government on Huawei, the world’s biggest telecommunications equipment maker. Washington is trying to prevent American companies from buying Huawei routers and switches and is pressing allies to do the same.
T-Mobile had accused Huawei of stealing technology called ""Tappy,"" which mimicked human fingers and was used to test smartphones. Huawei has said the two companies settled their disputes in 2017.
Separately, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have charged Huawei and its affiliates with bank and wire fraud on allegations that they violated sanctions against Iran. An arraignment date is yet to be set in that case, which has added to Washington's tensions with Beijing.
The United States is also seeking the extradition from Canada of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, after charging her with bank and wire fraud.
A senior U.S. cyber official said on Tuesday that European governments were listening to the U.S. message that Huawei exposes telecommunications networks to security risks. 

No evidence of the securities risks have been presented publicly even as scrutiny on Huawei has intensified and the company has denied Beijing could use its technology for spying.

320,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 01:42PM ET</span>","Martha Stewart, Canadian pot business in joint effort aimed at pets","(Reuters) - Lifestyle guru Martha Stewart is joining Canadian marijuana producer Canopy Growth as an adviser to help develop and launch a line of pot-based products for humans and animals, it said on Thursday.
The deal between Sequential Brands Group Inc, which owns the Martha Stewart brand, and Canopy will seek to leverage Stewart's knowledge of consumer products in the launch of products based on CBD, the non-psychoactive chemical found in marijuana.
Stewart, who became a household name through her books and cooking and lifestyle television shows starting in the 1980s, co-hosts a show with rapper Snoop Dogg, who made headlines last year for smoking marijuana in front of the White House.
Sequential's shares were up 28 percent in afternoon trading.
""I'm especially looking forward to our first collaboration together, which will offer sensible products for people's beloved pets,"" Stewart said.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has prohibited companies from adding CBD to food but many drinks companies have announced plans to use it. 
Corona beer maker Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) has signed a deal with Canopy to make various pot-infused drinks. 
Cannabis companies in Canada have been pouring cash into their businesses to both fend off competition and develop new products, especially after the country approved the use of recreational marijuana in October.

Canopy has also announced plans to invest between $100 million and $150 million in a hemp industrial park in New York state.

324,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 01:27PM ET</span>","J.C. Penney fourth-quarter results beat estimates, shares surge 31 percent","By Melissa Fares and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - J. C. Penney Co Inc on Thursday reported quarterly results that topped estimates as the struggling retailer sold more jewelry and women's, men's and children's apparel during the key holiday shopping season.
Its shares surged as much as 31.5 percent.
The 116-year-old company, once a storied American retailer whose stock is today worth less than one-tenth of its value two years ago, has been trying to strengthen its apparel business to compete with online retailers like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and off-price retailers like TJX (NYSE:TJX) Cos Inc.
Earlier this month, Penney announced it would stop selling major appliances including refrigerators and washing machines, and revamp store layouts.
Adjusted sales at J.C. Penney outlets open for at least 12 months fell 4 percent in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 2, better than the average analyst estimate of a 4.3 percent decline, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
But total net sales decreased 9.5 percent to $3.67 billion from $4.05 billion the year before. 
Net income totaled $75 million, or 24 cents per share, compared with $242 million, or 77 cents a share, in the same period last year. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 18 cents per share, 8 cents more than Wall Street expectations.
Plano, Texas-based Penney hopes to turn the company around in part by bringing back lost customers with more popular offerings and improving inventory management.
While Penney managed to reduce inventory by 13 percent last year, excess slow-moving stock still plagued the chain and forced unplanned markdowns, analysts said.
""In spite of our past financial performance, we have already taken meaningful steps to drive improvement in key businesses such as women's apparel, active apparel, special-sized apparel and fine jewelry,"" Chief Executive Officer Jill Soltau said in a statement. 
Analysts were unsure whether it could revive the business.
""I am a bit skeptical about the chain’s focus on apparel,"" said research firm Retail Metrics founder Ken Perkins. ""They are doing it because it's a high-margin category but it remains a highly competitive space that will prove very difficult for Penney to differentiate itself from its competitors.""
Off-price apparel retailer TJX Cos Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly same-store sales on Wednesday.
The company has shut hundreds of stores over the years and revamped its locations to boost sales and revive profits as it struggles to avoid the same problems that sent longtime rival Sears Hold Corp into bankruptcy.
Penney's interest coverage ratio - which measures its ability to pay interest on nearly $4.5 billion of debt from operating income - has been negative in all but one of the past seven years.
Both its stock and its bond prices have swooned. Penney shares have collapsed 70 percent in the last 12 months and briefly sank below $1 a share late last year. The stock rose 25 percent to $1.55 on Thursday but went as high as $1.63 earlier in the session.
(GRAPHIC: J.C. Penney size shrinking - https://tmsnrt.rs/2VpAK7t)
The company said on Thursday it will shut 18 full-line stores this year and nine ancillary home and furniture stores. It operates 860 department stores across the United States and Puerto Rico.
Penney said earlier this week it will end a clothing subscription service on Friday to focus on more profitable apparel sales.

The company also announced it has hired Michelle Wlazlo, who has 30 years of merchandising experience at Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) and most recently  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), as its new chief merchant. Penney will also bring in new heads of planning and allocation as well as asset protection.

(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co faces a new lawsuit questioning why controlling shareholder 3G Capital transferred $1.23 billion of stock six months before the processed foods company stunned investors with a huge writedown and other bad news.
The proposed class-action lawsuit made public on Wednesday is among the first accusing Kraft Heinz, whose other controlling shareholder is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, of defrauding shareholders about its business prospects.
Kraft Heinz's share price sank 27.5 percent on Feb. 22 after the company took a $15.4 billion writedown on its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands and Canadian assets, as consumers shifted to healthier and fresher alternatives or private-label products.
The company, headquartered in both Chicago and Pittsburgh, also slashed its dividend and announced a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accounting probe. Kraft Heinz's stock plunge erased more than $16 billion of market value.
In his damages complaint, shareholder Steve Walling accused Kraft Heinz, Chief Executive Bernardo Hees, 3G and others of concealing damage to Kraft Heinz's iconic brands and internal controls, including from 3G's signature belt-tightening.
Walling also said the defendants had been ""motivated"" to engage in improper conduct to allow 3G to ""sell"" $1.23 billion of stock last August at artificially inflated prices. The complaint was filed in the federal court in Pittsburgh.
In an Aug. 7 regulatory filing, 3G said an affiliate had transferred 20.63 million Kraft Heinz shares worth $59.83 each to an entity called HK3 18 LP.
The Brazilian private equity firm said none of the shares sold related to 3G partners' original Kraft Heinz stake.
Hees told Reuters in a Sept. 7, 2018 interview that the transfer was made on behalf of institutional investors that had a ""window to liquidity"" and were exiting a 3G fund.
""It's not 3G, as we know 3G,"" he said. ""We are very optimistic about the profile of what the investment can be for the long run.""
Kraft Heinz and 3G did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment. Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, a law firm representing Walling, did not respond to similar requests.
Berkshire and Buffett are not defendants. Buffett told CNBC on Monday the market reacted ""probably quite properly"" to Kraft Heinz's news.
Shareholder lawsuits are common after unexpected bad news hurts a company's stock price. They are often combined into a single lawsuit near where the company is based.

The case is Walling v Kraft Heinz Co et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Pennsylvania, No. 19-00214.

LONDON (Reuters) - John Varley, former CEO of  Barclays  (LON:BARC), told investigators in 2014 he had had to delegate responsibility during the British bank's efforts to raise more than 11 billion pounds ($15 billion) at the height of the credit crisis.
In a prepared statement read out by a lawyer for the Serious Fraud Office prosecutor in a London fraud trial, Varley said he had wanted Barclays to have a strategic relationship with Qatar in 2008 as part of a broader plan to generate 75 percent of income and profit from outside Britain.
But Varley said that he had had to place heavy reliance on others to run a bank the size of Barclays, especially during the financial crisis in 2008.
""Of necessity, the CEO cannot acquire full visibility nor command the detailed work,"" he told investigators, according to the statement read out by the SFO lawyer on Thursday.
""There is nothing unusual in such a business model. A large organization would risk cirrhosis if the CEO had to be involved in the detail of every decision,"" Varley told investigators, according to the statement read to the court.
Varley and former Barclays' executives Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation over side deals struck with Qatar during a two-part emergency fundraising that allowed the British bank to avoid a state bailout in 2008.
Prosecutors allege the men misled shareholders and other investors by not disclosing that Barclays paid an extra 322 million pounds to Qatar through so-called ""advisory service agreements"" (ASAs) at the height of the credit crisis.
The men, the most senior to face a criminal trial over crisis-era conduct, deny wrongdoing.
Varley told the SFO he regarded the ASAs as symbiotic with but not dependent or conditional on the Qatari participation in the capital raising - and that it marked a formalized cooperation with Qatar that would involve new business opportunities for the bank in the region.
""I did not regard the fee payable ... as connected to the capital raising from a regulatory perspective. The agreement was distinct and I received no contrary advice,"" he was quoted as saying in the statement read to the court.
Jenkins, the former chairman of the bank's Middle East investment banking division, told investigators in 2014 he had relied on legal advice at the time, according to the statement read to the court.
Jenkins told SFO officials he had had no responsibility for the bank's decisions and no authority to agree terms to any deal. He said he relied on instructions and legal advice and had no reason to doubt the legal advice he had been given.
""I want to be clear that I did not lead on and was not responsible for Barclays' decisions to raise capital in June and October 2008,"" he was quoted as saying in the statement read out to the court.
He said the decision to enter into advisory services agreements with Qatar in June and October 2008 was made by the company board or others in senior management, including Varley and former finance director Chris Lucas.
Lucas has not been charged because of serious ill health.
Prosecutors, who will continue reading out prepared statements by the defendants, said they were not calling further witnesses in the case.

Qatar has not been accused of wrongdoing.

The news heightened concerns that U.S. authorities could potentially look into Swedbank after allegations in a media report that at least 40 billion Swedish crowns transferred between Swedbank and Danske Bank accounts between 2007 and 2015 could be laundered money.

335,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 11:53AM ET</span>","Starboard to vote against Celgene/Bristol deal, move ahead with proxy","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Michael Erman
(Reuters) - Activist investor Starboard Value LP plans to vote against Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co's proposed $74 billion takeover of biotech  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG) and urged other shareholders to join it in voting down the ""poorly conceived and ill-advised"" deal.
The New York-based hedge fund said in a letter sent to Bristol-Myers shareholders that the Bristol-Myers board should be open to evaluating all alternatives, including a sale of the company. It also said it will move ahead with its campaign to install its own directors on Bristol's board.The letter comes only hours after Bristol-Myers' second biggest shareholder, Wellington Management, publicly said it was not supporting the deal. Wellington, which owns nearly 8 percent of Bristol-Myers, said the buyout was too risky and expensive. 
The shareholder opposition imperils what would be the largest pharmaceutical acquisition of all time. 
Starboard criticized the record of Bristol-Myers management, saying the U.S. drugmaker has underperformed the S&P 500 index by more than 40 percent over the tenure of Chief Executive Giovanni Caforio.
""These results are not reflective of a management team and Board of Directors that has earned the right, in our view, to execute on a 'bet the company' acquisition,"" the letter from Starboard Chief Investment Officer Jeffrey Smith said.
Bristol-Myers investors are due to vote on the deal at a special meeting scheduled for April 12.
Celgene's shares fell more than 7 percent on Thursday while Bristol-Myers was up nearly 1 percent.
Starboard, one of the industry's most prominent and successful activist investors, also said that it will sue Bristol for documents in Delaware court to gain a better understand how management decided to make the offer for Celgene.
One of Starboard's biggest criticisms of the deal is that Celgene's blockbuster drugs will soon lose patent protection and that its pipeline is ""risky and will continue to require significant research and development.""
Reuters reported earlier this month that Starboard was working with a proxy solicitor to gauge the level of support among Bristol-Myers shareholders for the Celgene deal.
Bristol-Myers said Starboard informed the company it had bought roughly one million of its common shares. That is equivalent to a roughly $50 million stake, a sliver of the company's $84 billion market value. 
Bristol has told employees that it is disappointed by Wellington's opposition to the Celgene deal, and said it would press ahead.
""Even with the combined voting power for both Wellington and Starboard Value, we believe there continues to be a high hurdle for opposition to reach majority,"" said Andy Hsieh, a William Blair analyst.
Sources have told Reuters that Dodge & Cox, Bristol-Myers' fifth largest shareholder, is also unhappy with the deal.

Bristol and Celgene through the deal hope to create a market leader in the lucrative treatment of cancer through their combined portfolios.

336,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 11:50AM ET</span>",Investor flows to emerging markets cool after China stocks fever: IIF,"By Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - Investor money flows into emerging markets have slowed in recent days after scaling dizzying heights in mid-February thanks to Chinese equities attracting foreign funds, data from the Institute of International Finance showed.
Emerging markets had a torrid 2018 when crisis in Turkey and Argentina as well as rising borrowing costs battered riskier assets around the globe. Yet a dovish turn by the U.S. Federal Reserve in early February saw investors pile back into riskier assets in recent weeks. 
In mid-February, fund managers surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) named emerging markets the ""most crowded trade"" around for the first time in the report's history. This accolade could prove to be a bad omen for emerging markets, though, as assets named ""most crowded"" usually sink soon afterwards.
Major asset managers and investment banks such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citi and BlueBay Asset Management ramped up their exposure to emerging markets in recent weeks.
Analysing high frequency data from local stock exchanges and debt offices, the IIF, which tracks capital market movements, found that flows to emerging market assets in mid-February after a dovish turn by the U.S. Federal Reserve had soared close to levels last seen late January 2018 - days before emerging and global markets suffered hefty falls. 
(Graphic: IIF Real Money EM Flows including China - https://tmsnrt.rs/2UbDntj) 
But flows have cooled since then, IIF chief economist Robin Brooks told Reuters.
""Flows have pulled back, including into China equities where we had seen a pick up in Q4 and around the Fed meeting,"" said Brooks. ""You can see that equity flows in particular have pulled back after a big surge post-FOMC on Jan. 30, indicating more caution as the final trade negotiations take shape."" 
Much of that move has been driven by China, where foreign capital inflows into stock markets have surged in the first few weeks of 2019 as investors bet on stimulus measures from Beijing and awaited an announcement by index provider MSCI that it would increase the weighting of China A-shares in its key benchmarks at the end of February.
Taking China equity flows out of the mix, recent inflows looked a lot less dramatic, with mid-February levels coming in at around half the total enjoyed in January 2018, the IIF found. 
(Graphic: IIF Real Money EM Flows ex-China - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Uf5MPe) 
Looking at investors' geographic preferences, data analyzing average quarterly flows shows that apart from China, Indonesia has been the most popular destination for investors. 
Mexico also proved enticing, though unlike other emerging markets it had some catching up to do after suffering in 2017 when its standoff with U.S. President Donald Trump over the NAFTA trade deal more than offset dollar weakness that proved a boon for emerging markets more widely.

""South Africa remains very weak,"" said IIF's Brooks. ""Perhaps the biggest surprise to me is that flows to Brazil remain quite weak, even with ... light positioning after many tough years and an interesting reform agenda.""

337,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 11:40AM ET</span>","India finalizing $1.4 billion subsidy scheme for electric, hybrid vehicles: sources","By Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is close to finalizing a scheme to spend $1.4 billion to subsidize sales of electric and hybrid vehicles, two sources told Reuters, part of efforts by the South Asian nation to curb pollution and reduce dependency on fossil fuels.
The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme would offer subsidies based on the battery capacity of the vehicle, the sources said, adding that the cabinet could approve the plan as early as this week. 
India, one of the world's fastest-growing car markets, still has negligible sales of electric vehicles (EVs).
The government had set a target in 2015 for all new vehicles to be electric by 2030, but critics said the high cost of batteries and a lack of charge points were major obstacles to that. Carmakers also said the target was too ambitious. 
The transport ministry later scaled back that target to EVs making up 15 percent of vehicle sales in five years.
India would spend 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) over three years on incentives under the new scheme, with subsidies applying to vehicles costing up to 1.5 million rupees, the sources said.
The subsidies would apply to hybrid and electric vehicles, ranging from buses and cars to three-wheelers and motorbikes, the sources added.
The subsidy would amount to 10,000 rupees for each kiloWatt per hour (kWh) of battery capacity in the car, adding up to about 50 percent of the battery cost, the sources said.
The average price of an electric car in India is now about 1 million rupees. Cars typically have a battery up to 20 kWh, so the discount under the new scheme would be 200,000 rupees.
Automakers Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors both produce electric cars in India. Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Motor Co build hybrid cars.

Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp said last year it would start testing 50 prototypes of an electric vehicle. It plans to launch EVs in India around 2020, in cooperation with Toyota.

LONDON (Reuters) - British regulators will give banks, asset managers, insurers and brokers until mid-2020 to fully comply with rules that replace European Union law in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Bank of England and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on Thursday published a ""near final"" version of the rulebook that would come into effect if Britain leaves the EU without a transition deal.
Britain has already turned EU laws into UK statutes, but this ""onshoring"" entailed some changes to function properly and financial firms have said they would have limited time to comply if there is a no-deal Brexit, meaning they would be in breach of regulation and face possible sanction.
""In most cases, we plan to allow firms a period of 15 months to adapt,"" the FCA and BoE said in separate statements.
Financial firms have been planning for all forms of Brexit since Britain voted in June 2016 to leave the EU, with the bloc as well as the UK putting in place measures to avoid markets falling off a ""cliff edge"" if there is a no-deal Brexit.
But FCA chief Andrew Bailey told UK lawmakers on Wednesday that despite the preparations, he could give no assurance that a no-deal Brexit would not disrupt finance. 
""This grace period will offer relief and a degree of regulatory predictability,"" Jonathan Herbst, global head of financial services at Norton Rose Fulbright law firm, said.
The final version of the rulebook would be published on 28 March, a day before Brexit is officially due to take place on March 29, if there is no deal.
If there is a transition deal, financial firms would continue under EU rules until the end of 2020 when the UK wants new, long-term trading terms with the bloc to start.
FCA executive director international, Nausicaa Delfas, said Thursday's announcement was a significant milestone in the financial sector's preparations for a no-deal Brexit.

""They ensure that there is a functioning regulatory regime from day one, and that firms are clear as to the requirements they need to meet by end March 2019 and beyond, so they can continue to meet the needs of their customers,"" Delfas said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equities markets fell for a third straight day on Thursday, with Wall Street stocks edging lower as weak Chinese economic data and mixed messages on the progress of trade talks between China and the United States weighed on investor sentiment.
Data showed that Chinese factory activity contracted to a three-year low and that China's export orders fell at their fastest pace since the global financial crisis a decade ago. The data added to consistent worries about a slowdown in the Chinese economy and its impact on global markets.
Receding optimism on the U.S.-China Trade talks also dampened sentiment.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said his office was taking legal steps to implement President Donald Trump's announcement on Sunday to delay a tariff increase on more than $200 billion worth of Chinese goods that had been scheduled for Friday. But the office later issued a statement clarifying that it was not abandoning the threat of increasing the tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent.
The major U.S. stock indexes dipped, though the pan-European STOXX 600 pared losses to trade little changed. Concerns about China also weighed on emerging market stocks, with the MSCI International EM Price Index down 1.0 percent.
""The negative PMI number is certainly of concern,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York, referring to the weak Chinese economic data. ""It paints a question mark globally because China is a huge economy.""
Earlier, news of the break-up of the summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on denuclearization triggered flight-to-quality bids in lower-risk assets. The Japanese yen gained 0.3 percent against the dollar.
PULLING BACK 
Global equities had scaled a four-month high earlier this week, helped by upbeat expectations about the U.S.-China trade talks.
But on Thursday, the MSCI All-Country World Index dropped 0.3 percent and was on track for a third straight day of losses.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 23.07 points, or 0.09 percent, to 25,962.09, the S&P 500 lost 3.59 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,788.79 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.91 points, or 0.17 percent, to 7,541.60.
According to equity market analysts in Reuters polls, global stock markets in 2019 will at best only recoup losses from the deep sell-off late last year. They reckon the risk is skewed more toward a sharp fall by mid-year. 
In currency markets, the dollar index (DXY) was little changed against a basket of six major currencies. The euro rose 0.2 percent against the dollar.

342,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 10:45AM ET</span>",Exclusive: European Investment Bank revives plan for new international arm,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's largest development bank, the EIB, has revived plans for a new offshoot focused solely on non-European Union projects that it expects to formalize in a year and have up and running within two years, its president said.
In an interview with Reuters, EIB head Werner Hoyer also said he was confident EU countries would replace the 3.5 billion euros of British cash and near 40 billion euros of callable capital that will be lost if Brexit goes ahead as planned.
The new internationally focused offshoot could potentially invest in a post-Brexit Britain, but its main aim is to bring more of the EU’s foreign spending into a streamlined and market-savvy unit.
Hoyer said the plan had been put on the back burner for a year due to Brexit and while a new EU budget was being hammered out, but that it was now active again.
""We have revitalized the whole idea and have presented ideas to our shareholders and others,"" Hoyer said.
The Bank currently invests between 65-80 billion euros($91.08 billion) a year, with around 10 percent or 7-8 billion of that spent outside of the EU from central Africa to Argentina in Latin America. 
Hoyer said the EIB would reorganize internally and work with other European and national development banks in what Hoyer expects to be a comparable set-up to the European Investment Fund. The Fund is a subsidiary of the EIB but is open to non-EU members and helps to provide financing for small and medium sized businesses.
""Within the next 12 months we will probably see where the train is going to go, and within the next 24 months I want to see that thing established.""
On the EIB's Brexit complexities, Hoyer laid out both the task of plugging the 40 billion euros hole Britain will leave behind and what it means for the 55 billion euros worth of assets the bank has amassed in the UK over the years.
""The UK is holder of more than 16 percent of the callable capital ... so this has to be replaced by the others.""
""It will be, as always, a negotiation to the very last minute but I am confident that we will get there,"" he added, saying the cost was likely to be spread between EU members.
The Bank's legacy UK portfolio is likely to be the more complex issue. 
The assets range from healthcare research facilities to renewable energy infrastructure but would no longer enjoy what is known as the ""protocol of privileges and immunity"" after Brexit as Britain would be outside the EU.
""So far our assets here are protected against any court tapping them, that will not be the case in future so we must find a way to organize the future because we are not going to simply pull out the assets here,"" Hoyer said.
It raises the question whether Britain could somehow still retain some of its EIB links. Hoyer said he would be ""happy about it"" but that it was not in his remit and a decision instead for EU and UK leaders.
""In the political negotiations it has not been a part of them, but of course reasonable people are thinking about the future and then probably one day it will come back.""

""But for the time being the situation is what it is.""

At 9:37 AM ET (14:37 GMT), the Dow Jones dropped 19 points, or 0.07% to 25,965.68 points, the S&P 500 lost 5 points, or 0.19%, to 2,787.08 while the Nasdaq Composite traded down 17 points, or 0.23%, to 7,537.15 points.
GDP in the fourth quarter slowed as expected to 2.6%. The reading left the U.S. with an annual expansion of 3.1% in 2018, the first yearly print above 3% since 2005, but provides further evidence of a loss of momentum at the end of the year as the effect of the 2017 tax cuts fades.
“This ends the 12-year streak without a 3% print, by far the longest in our country’s history,” Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial, said.
Detrick also noted that stocks were off to a positive start this year, with the S&P 500 showing its best performance since 1987.
“But be aware over the past 20 years, March and April have been the two strongest months,” he added.
The data released ahead of the open pared losses seen in U.S. futures, but sentiment was still marred by U.S. President Donald Trump’s remarks that he had walked away from talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un because of unacceptable demands to lift sanctions.
Trump insisted that good progress was made over denuclearization, but that the U.S. could not lift all of the sanctions at the current juncture.
“Sometimes you have to walk, and this was just one of those times,” Trump said, adding that “it was a friendly walk.”
Markets had already turned more cautious after comments from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Wednesday.
Lighthizer told a Congressional hearing that it was too early to predict an outcome to negotiations between Washington and Beijing over trade, dampening hopes for a quick and comprehensive deal.

PG&E faces billions of dollars of potential liabilities related to the wildfires if an investigation determines its equipment caused them.
The company took a $10.5 billion charge for the 2018 Camp Fire and an additional $1 billion charge related to 2017 Northern California wildfires.
PG&E said it had taken a total of $14 billion in pretax charges for the 2018 Camp Fire and the 2017 Northern California wildfires to date.
The charges represent a portion of the previously announced estimate of potential wildfire liabilities, which could exceed more than $30 billion, PG&E said.
Last November's deadly Camp Fire destroyed the Northern California town of Paradise and killed 86 people

Federal filings showed on Wednesday that the power utility had delayed a safety overhaul of a high-voltage transmission line, a prime suspect behind the deadliest wildfire in California's history.

346,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 09:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: UK chemicals industry says Brexit could cost sector 500 million pounds,"By Noah Browning
LONDON (Reuters) - UK chemicals companies face being shut out of a common EU products registry after Brexit and would need to pay around half a billion pounds ($664 million) to set up a British counterpart, the head of the Chemicals Industry Association told Reuters.
The sector - which includes companies such as Ineos,  Johnson Matthey  (LON:JMAT), Croda and Synthomer - is bound to the European Union by an especially dense web of laws and safety standards as well as supply chains which loop back and forth repeatedly across the English channel.
If the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal, it will immediately be excluded from a strict set of EU laws on safety and production of chemicals called REACH and locked out of a Helsinki-based data registry underpinning trade called ECHA.
The government is planning to copy REACH guidelines and set up a domestic registry in case of a no-deal Brexit, but the industry and campaigners are wary of the plan.
""Companies have been generating and submitting data to Helsinki for a decade. We estimate submitting that again to a UK REACH would cost them a total of around half a billion pounds,"" Stephen Elliott, chief executive of the Chemicals Industries Association, told Reuters.
""Our line since the day after the vote for Brexit has been that the industry is registering zero percent appetite given the interconnectedness with the EU,"" he added.
ECHA plans to open a near three-week ""Brexit window"" ending on March 29 - when Britain is due to leave the EU - for UK chemicals firms to register subsidiaries in EU countries in order to gain access.
For some companies, it may be cheaper than seeking to access data from ECHA on a case-by-case basis, in which looking up information on even a single chemical product can cost tens of thousands of pounds.
DEEP UNCERTAINTY
There's a lot at stake for the country and the sector: chemicals is the UK's second-biggest exporter to the EU and the second largest manufacturer behind the car industry.
With 60 percent of UK chemicals exports going to the EU, and 75 percent of its imports coming from the bloc, it's common for a single chemical or product to be bought, developed and sold back and forth repeatedly between the UK and EU countries.
Strategies employed by chemicals companies include stocking up before Brexit day, gaining EU access by setting up a presence in a member country or winding down UK sales.
Prime Minister Theresa May hopes parliament will ratify a divorce deal with the EU which will give businesses an 18-month interim period to adjust to the rules of a new relationship.
Deal or no deal, chemicals businesses face deep uncertainty.
While May's government hopes to stay a party to REACH after an exit agreement, EU officials have said such a move may require staying in the bloc's common market or subjecting its activity to the European Court of Justice.
But leaving both bodies has been a main plank of Brexit supporters, who say they curtail British sovereignty.
Kate Young, a campaigner with industry watchdog group CHEM Trust, warned that parting with ECHA might see the sector increasingly deregulated and lead to a relaxation of safety and environmental standards.
""The bureaucracy is stretched given all the preparation for Brexit and the government has a deregulation target of 9 billion pounds, which is a huge disincentive to strict standards,"" Young said.
""We're concerned that as the EU makes progress and goes forward, the UK will just be falling back.""

347,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 08:38AM ET</span>",JD.com shares jump on upbeat sales performance,"By Cate Cadell
BEIJING (Reuters) - JD.com Inc, China's second largest e-commerce firm, reported a 22.4 percent jump in quarterly sales on Thursday, beating estimates on the back of robust retail sales and sending its U.S.-listed shares up 13.8 percent in pre-market trade.
The results, however, still represent the company's slowest quarterly revenue growth rate since its 2015 initial public offering, as an economic slowdown hits China's top ecommerce companies.
JD.com's sales are seasonally high in the fourth quarter due to promotions surrounding ""Single's Day"", a China-wide online shopping frenzy that peaks on November 11. 
The company said sales for the event peaked at 159.8 billion yuan ($23.9 billion), up 26 percent from a year earlier. 
Its shares are up 24 percent this year, recovering after slower sales growth and the temporary arrest of chief executive Richard Liu sent stock down in 2018.
Analysts and executives in the industry have pointed to lower sales of big ticket items, including smartphones and appliances, as the driving factor behind slower sales growth on JD.com and competitor  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.
""Electronics appliances were impacted in the fourth quarter,"" said chief financial officer Sydney Huang on a call with analysts on Thursday. ""At this point it's tough to tell, but we are cautiously optimistic for the second half of this year,"" he said. 
The company has invested heavily in offline retail, finance and logistics services to diversify outside its e-commerce business. 
It also announced on Thursday that its luxury e-commerce business ""Toplife"" will merge with the China unit of London-based online fashion retailer Farfetch. The deal will expand JD.com's luxury offerings as it faces fierce competition from Alibaba's Tmall.
Chief Executive Richard Liu on Thursday said the company will also focus on expanding into smaller Chinese cities in 2019, boosting investments in offline retail technology and logistics. 
JD.com forecast March quarter revenue between 118 billion yuan and 122 billion yuan. That compares to a consensus analysts' estimate of 119.48 billion yuan according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
JD.com, which is backed by Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and China's Tencent Holdings, posted a net loss of 3.32 yuan or 48 cents per American depository share, compared with a loss of 0.64 yuan a year earlier. 

Full year revenue for 2018 was 462.02 billion, up 27.5 percent from 362.3 billion in 2017, beating analyst expectations and China's wider internet industry, which has seen full-year revenue rise on average 20.3 percent, according to China's industry ministry.

348,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>",Booking Holdings shares fall 10 percent after weak Europe outlook,"By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Shares of Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) Holdings Inc fell more than 10 percent in early trading on Thursday, after the U.S. online travel agency said it was seeing a sharp demand slowdown in Europe, its biggest market.
The company, which gets more than two thirds of its sales from Europe, said uncertainties related to Brexit and political issues in France lead it to forecast lower first quarter room bookings.
""While we acknowledge that many of the factors causing the slowdown are unrelated to BKNG's execution, there was little indication on the call that European travel demand would reaccelerate any time soon,"" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said.
The company, whose brands include Booking.com, Priceline and Agoda, forecast first-quarter room bookings to grow between 6 percent and 8 percent, compared with a more than 13 percent growth recorded a year earlier.
Chief Executive Officer Glenn Fogel said the trade war between the United States and China was making conditions worse for European economies including Germany, whose slowing automotive industry was weighing on Europe's overall growth.
""People are uncertain,"" Fogel said, as they ponder over questions such as ""Should I spend a lot of money right now or not? I don't know if there are going to be troubles traveling into Europe.""
The weak outlook led multiple brokerages to cut price targets on Booking Holdings' stock, following the company's fourth-quarter results on Wednesday.
Cowen & Co cut its price target on the company's stock by $300 to $2,000, RBC Capital Markets by $275 to $2150, Wedbush by $100 to $2,000 and Jefferies by $40 to $1900.
""The uncertainty surrounding Brexit has significantly impacted booking trends among British consumers, as concerns over both passport requirements and currency devaluation led to travel-related concerns,"" Wedbush analyst James Hardiman said.
Up To Wednesday's close the company had risen 10.7 percent this year, compared with a 11 percent increase in the Dow Jones U.S. Consumer Services index.

351,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>",Global funds reached for a bigger cash buffer in February: Reuters poll,"By Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global funds recommended a bigger safety buffer in February, with cash holdings raised to their highest in more than three years and equity allocations cut to the lowest in nearly two, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
Many top equity indexes posted their best start to a year in decades, but a slowdown is underway in several major economies and the still-unresolved trade war between the U.S. and China has kept investors cautious.
A monthly Reuters poll of 43 fund managers around the globe, taken Feb 14-27, showed cash holdings - a key gauge of investor caution - were increased to their highest since June 2015, to 7.2 percent from 6.2 percent last month.
Asset managers reduced recommendations to equity exposure to 45.9 percent of the model global portfolio from 48.5 percent, the lowest since March 2017. Bond allocations were nudged up to 39.3 percent of the portfolio from 39.1 percent.
Nearly 65 percent of fund managers who answered an additional question said the risk for global stocks by mid-year was for a sharp fall. The remaining said the opposite.
The more defensive approach among long-term investors lines up with findings from a separate Reuters poll of equity market strategists, who cut their 2019 stock markets outlook and who also came to the same conclusion on risk. 
""At the beginning of the year, we saw opportunities to increase risk exposure, starting with emerging markets and credit - now partially exploited - and we are now taking some profits. We expect the year to be quite volatile with the market mood continuing to swing between fear and greed,"" said Pascal Blanqué, chief investment officer at Amundi Asset Management, in Paris.
But nearly half the fund managers in the latest poll who answered a separate question said investor risk-taking will stay the same over the next 12 months. The others were almost evenly split between an increase and decrease.
""Markets began 2019 pricing in gloom and doom after major indexes fell ... in 2018. If the major risks facing the market, rising interest rates and a full-blown trade war, are avoided, equities can rally to new record highs,"" said Alan Gayle, president at Via Nova Investment Management, in Washinton DC.
""Interest rate risks have clearly subsided, and trade negotiations appear to be moving closer to a resolution. These are very positive developments for stock markets.""
Across equity portfolios, fund managers increased allocations to North American stocks to the highest since at least the start of 2013, according to a sub-set of respondents in the poll.
""We expect the U.S. economy to stay strong relative to other major economies and there is a risk of USD strength in the next risk-off move which could hurt emerging market relative to developed market equities,"" said Trevor Greetham, head of multi-asset strategies fund at Royal London Asset Management.
A regional breakdown also showed fund managers cutting allocations to euro zone and UK stocks this month on economic growth worries in those economies and on Britain's torturous exit process from the European Union.
""Risks to economic momentum and parallel geopolitics appear to remain on the downside,"" said Michael Ingram, chief market strategist at WH Ireland, in London.
""Given the sharp recovery in risk-appetite that we have seen year-to-date, it seems likely that equity market risk will increasingly lie to the downside by mid-year in the absence of more supportive fundamental momentum.""
Looking ahead, many fund managers said emerging-market assets will be buying opportunities, provided the U.S. and China reach a trade deal - which several called the biggest risk if that doesn't happen.
This also echoed what sell-side equity-market strategists told Reuters in a poll conducted over the same period. [EPOLL/WRAP]
""Financial markets have seen a robust rebound since the beginning of the year with global central banks (sounding) more dovish tones, fears of an imminent recession receding and with a resolution on the war on trade looking more likely,"" said John Husselbee, head of multi-asset at Liontrust, in London.

""With sentiment improving these risks bring opportunity, however, significant deterioration will once again unsettle investors' nerves.""

352,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 06:46AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Drop as North Korea Talks Collapse; 4Q GDP Ahead,"Investing.com - U.S. futures pointed to a lower open on Thursday as U.S. President Donald Trump's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un ended abruptly, while sentiment continued to suffer after downbeat comments on a potential trade deal with China from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
The double-blow came ahead of a delayed reading on the strength of the U.S. economy, in the form of fourth-quarter gross domestic product data at 8:30AM ET (13:30 GMT).
The blue-chip Dow futures lost 51 points, or 0.19%, to 24,957.5 points by 6:41 AM ET (11:41 GMT), the S&P 500 futures fell 7 points, or 0.25%, to 2,787.88 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 28 points, or 0.39%, to 7,094.0 points.
U.S. President Donald Trump said that he had walked away from talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un because of unacceptable demands to lift U.S. sanctions.
Trump insisted that good progress was made over denuclearization, but that the U.S. could not lift all of the sanctions at the current juncture.
“Sometimes you have to walk, and this was just one of those times,” Trump said, adding that “it was a friendly walk.”
Markets had already turned more cautious after comments from USTR Lighthizer on Wednesday.
Lighthizer told a Congressional hearing on Wednesday that it was too early to predict an outcome to negotiations between Washington and Beijing over trade, dampening hopes for a quick and comprehensive deal.
Thursday’s calendar also features data on weekly jobless claims as well as the Chicago PMI survey.
Among several appearances from Federal Reserve officials, investors will likely focus on remarks from the central bank's’ chief Jerome Powell and vice chairman Richard Clarida.
As the fourth-quarter earnings period comes to an end, a string of weak numbers and disappointing guidance looked set to hit shares on Thursday.
L Brands (NYSE:LB), Square (NYSE:SQ), Box (NYSE:BOX) and Fitbit (NYSE:FIT)saw sharp declines in premarket trade after issuing outlooks that missed analysts’ estimates.
A notable exception came with Anheuser Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD) whose shares jumped 5.7% after the company forecast stronger growth in 2019.
Elsewhere, pessimism sent European stocks lower for a second day, with all continental bourses in the red.
Earlier, Asian shares closed lower, with South Korea's KOSPI taking the brunt, falling 1.8%.

Shareholders at the event in Basel also approved Novartis's planned spin-off of its Alcon eyecare unit, due for coming months, with investors with five Novartis shares due to receive one share of Alcon stock.
Swiss shareholder group Actares said insurance systems are being ""taken hostage"" by high prices for life-saving drugs. It called out Novartis's $475,000 cancer cell therapy Kymriah and its still-unapproved gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy that Novartis contends is cost-effective at $4-$5 million per patient, while independent groups have concluded its value is less than that.
Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan, who did not testify this week before the U.S. Senate with other global drug industry executives also facing criticism for drug prices, said he seeks to price medicines based on their value, adding Novartis needs a fair return to further research and development.
""With respect to pricing in cell and gene therapies, I think what's often lost in the discussion is the remarkable impact of these medicines,"" Narasimhan said. ""These are true breakthroughs that come from a single infusion of a medicine that don't require lifelong therapy.""
Actares President Veronika Hendry said high drug prices present society with difficult questions over access. 
""With this business model you are taking hostage an insurance system that depends on solidarity,"" Hendry said. ""There's currently a broad discussion going on over exorbitant drug prices, and this discussion is creating resentment and disbelief.""

359,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 05:30AM ET</span>","Huawei Faces First U.S. Hearing in Criminal Case, CFO Decision","(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. faces its first U.S. court date stemming from a criminal indictment alleging trade-secret theft, a day before the company learns if Canada will start extradition proceedings for its chief financial officer in a pivotal week that could see diplomatic tensions flare.
China’s biggest smartphone maker and its U.S. affiliate are set to appear in federal court in Seattle at 9 a.m. to face charges that they engaged in a scheme to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile US Inc. They are expected through lawyers to plead not guilty to trade-secret theft, wire fraud and obstruction of justice.
The arraignment comes just a day before Canada’s deadline to decide whether to officially order the start of extradition hearings against Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, who is wanted in the U.S. on fraud charges. In a separate indictment filed in Brooklyn, U.S. prosecutors allege she lied to banks to trick them into processing transactions for Huawei that potentially violated Iran trade sanctions.
The two cases have intensified the spotlight on Huawei, which has come to symbolize China’s economic rise and challenge to the U.S.’s status as the world’s top superpower. In particular, the decision to prosecute Meng -- daughter of billionaire Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei -- has sparked an unprecedented diplomatic dispute, with Canada trapped in the middle.
If history is any guide, Canada will probably start extradition proceedings, which will set in motion a process that promises to be long and politically explosive. China has demanded that Canada release Meng and, since her December arrest in Vancouver, has detained two Canadians on national security grounds and sentenced a third with a death sentence for drug trafficking in China.

In the trade-secrets case, prosecutors said in a January indictment that from 2012 to 2014 Huawei stole information from T-Mobile’s Bellevue, Washington, headquarters contained in “Tappy,” a robotic phone-testing system.
The U.S. says it uncovered Huawei email messages showing it offered bonuses to employees for information stolen from companies worldwide. Huawei faces fines of more than $5 million, or three times the value of T-Mobile’s secrets, according to the government.
The company has denied any wrongdoing and said it expects to be found innocent in court.
Prosecutors and lawyers for the company may discuss Thursday what pretrial information sharing they’ve done or is required, schedule the next hearing, and possibly set a trial date.

Joerg Rocholl, the deputy chairman of a council of outside experts who advise the Finance Ministry, said Deutsche Bank should be given time to continue to improve profitability.
""Deutsche Bank has just made its first profit in several years and even exceeded its cost targets,"" he told Reuters. ""One should give the bank and its management time to continue along this path.""
""That is why I do not see any economically plausible justification for a merger at the moment,"" he said.
Speculation of a merger has heightened under the tenure of Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who has spoken in favor of strong banks. Both banks have been slow to return to sustainable profitability since the global financial crisis.

On Wednesday, a person familiar with the matter said U.S. investor Cerberus, a major shareholder in both banks, was open to a merger between Germany's two biggest lenders.

361,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 05:25AM ET</span>","Some Facebook content reviewers in India complain of low pay, high pressure","By Munsif Vengattil and Paresh Dave
HYDERABAD, India/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - On a busy day, contract employees in India monitoring nudity and pornography on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram will each view 2,000 posts in an eight-hour shift, or almost four a minute.
They are part of a 1,600-member team at Genpact, an outsourcing firm with offices in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad that is contracted to review Facebook content.
Seven content reviewers at Genpact said in interviews late last year and early in 2019 that their work was underpaid, stressful and sometimes traumatic. The reviewers, all in their 20s, declined to be identified for fear of losing their jobs or violating non-disclosure agreements. Three of the seven have left Genpact in recent months.
""I have seen women employees breaking down on the floor, reliving the trauma of watching suicides real-time,"" one former employee said. He said he had seen this happen at least three times.
Reuters was unable to independently verify the incidents or determine how often they may have occurred.
Genpact declined comment.
The working conditions described by the employees offers a window into the moderator operations at Facebook and the challenges faced by the company as it seeks to police what its 2 billion users post. Their account contrasts in several respects with the image presented by three Facebook executives in interviews and statements to Reuters of a carefully selected, skilled workforce that is paid well and has the tools to handle a difficult job.
Ellen Silver, Facebook's vice president of operations, acknowledged to Reuters that content moderation ""at this size is uncharted territory"".
""We care deeply about getting this right,"" she said in January. ""This includes the training reviewers receive, our hiring practices, the wellness resources that we provide to each and every person reviewing content, and our overall engagement with partners.""
While rejecting the Hyderabad employees' assertions about low pay, Facebook has said it had begun drafting a code of conduct for outsourcing partners but declined to give details.
It has also said it would be introducing an annual compliance audit of its vendor policies this year to review the work at contractor facilities. The company is organising a first-ever summit in April to bring together its outsourcing vendors from around the world, with the aim of sharing best practices and bringing more consistency to how moderators are treated.
These efforts were announced in a blog post on Monday by Justin Osofsky, Facebook's vice-president of global operations.
Facebook works with at least five outsourcing vendors in at least eight countries on content review, a Reuters tally shows. Silver said about 15,000 people, a mix of contractors and employees, were working on content review at Facebook as of December. Facebook had over 20 content review sites around the world, she said. 
Over a dozen moderators in other parts of the world have talked of similar traumatic experiences.
A former Facebook contract employee, Selena Scola, filed a lawsuit in California in September, alleging that content moderators who face mental trauma after reviewing distressing images on the platform are not being properly protected by the social networking company.
Facebook in a court filing has denied all of Scola's allegations and called for a dismissal, contending that Scola has insufficient grounds to sue.
Some examples of traumatic experiences among Facebook content moderators in the United States were described this week by The Verge, a technology news website. (https:// PRESSURE, LACK OF EXPERIENCE The Genpact unit in Hyderabad reviews posts in Indian languages, Arabic, English and some Afghan and Asian tribal dialects, according to Facebook. On one team, employees spend their days reviewing nudity and explicit pornography. The ""counter-terrorism"" team, meanwhile, watches videos that include beheadings, car bombings and electric shock torture sessions, the employees said. Those on the ""self-harm"" unit regularly watch live videos of suicide attempts - and do not always succeed in alerting authorities in time, two of the employees said. They told Reuters they had no experience with suicide or trauma.  Facebook said its policies called for moderators to alert a ""specially trained team"" to review situations where there was ""potential imminent risk or harm.""  The moderators who spoke to Reuters said in the instances they knew of, the trained team was called in when there was a possibility of a suicide, but the reviewers continued to monitor the feed even after the team had been alerted. Job postings and salary pay-slips seen by Reuters showed annual compensation at Genpact for an entry-level Facebook Arabic language content reviewer was 100,000 Indian rupees ($1,404) annually, or just over $6 a day. Facebook contended that benefits made the real pay much higher.  The workers said they did receive transport to and from work, a common non-cash benefit in India.  Moderators in Hyderabad employed by another IT outsourcing firm, Accenture (NYSE:ACN), monitor Arabic content on YouTube on behalf of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for a minimum of 350,000 rupees annually, according to two of its workers and pay slips seen by Reuters. Accenture declined to comment, citing client confidentiality.  Facebook disputed the pay analysis, saying Genpact is required to pay above industry averages. The outsourcer, while declining to comment on its work for Facebook, said in a statement that its wages are ""significantly higher than the standard in the industry or the minimum wage set by law."" 'MASSIVE TARGETS'  The Genpact moderators in Hyderabad said Facebook sets performance targets, which are reassessed from time to time, that are called Average Review Time or Average Handling Time.  ""We have to meet an accuracy rate of 98 percent on massive targets,"" one of the moderators told Reuters. ""It is just not easy when you are consistently bombarded with stuff that is mostly mind-numbing.""  They said they often took work home on their laptops to keep up.  Silver said handling time was tracked to assess whether Facebook needs more reviewers and whether its policies are clear enough. But she acknowledged some older procedures may have led moderators to feel pressured.  The company also said it was increasing restrictions on workers' remote access to its tools.

The New York-based bank is doing a “feasibility study” on China’s onshore wealth business as part of broader plans to expand in the nation, said Kam Shing Kwang, chief executive officer of JPMorgan’s private banking business in Asia. Deliberations are at an early stage and any business would start “not in the distant future,” she said, declining to elaborate.
CEO Jamie Dimon has vowed to bring JPMorgan’s “full force” to China as policy makers open up their financial sector. Rivals UBS Group AG and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, which already have a domestic wealth presence, are looking to boost operations in the market that was earlier protected by stiff regulations and strong competition from homemade brands.
JPMorgan has also sought permission to run a majority owned securities joint venture in China. The move follows policy makers’ decision last year to treat overseas financial institutions the same as local companies, which allows global firms the chance to build the necessary infrastructure and expertise.
The biggest international firms mostly manage Chinese money from offices in Hong Kong and Singapore, Asia’s offshore financial centers. That may change as China further opens, given the potential for private banks: Boston Consulting Group estimates that personal wealth in the nation surged to a record $24 trillion in 2018, with only $1 trillion held abroad.
JPMorgan plans to hire in China across banking, asset management, custodian services and markets, Mark Leung, chief executive officer for China, said in September.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese startup Luckin Coffee, which has ambitions to overtake Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) at home this year, has tapped three banks including  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to work on a U.S. IPO in 2019, said people with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are also advising Luckin, one of the quickest firms to reach 'unicorn' status in China, on preparatory work for the initial public offering (IPO), said the people. One of the people said the company is targeting a valuation of about $3 billion in the IPO.
Credit Suisse is the only bank that has so far won the formal mandate for the IPO which will likely take place early in May or June, or the second half of the year, said another person. 
Beijing-based Luckin, which officially launched its business only in January last year and is still loss-making, chose New York for the listing as Hong Kong generally requires IPO applicants to have a track record of three financial years. 
Another reason is that Luckin looks to benchmark itself against Seattle-based Starbucks in terms of valuation, said two of the people. Starbucks has long dominated China's coffee scene and has over 3,600 stores in the country.
Luckin didn't respond to requests for comment. Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. 
The move comes as Luckin, backed by Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd, expands at breakneck speed across China. The firm already opened over 2,000 cafes last year, propelled by a focus on online ordering, cheap delivery, and heavy discounting even at the cost of mounting losses.
Luckin said last month it is aiming to open 2,500 new stores this year and overtake Starbucks as the largest coffee chain by number of outlets in the world's second-biggest economy.
In December, it raised $200 million in its latest funding round from investors including GIC and investment bank China International Capital Corp Ltd, increasing its valuation to $2.2 billion.
Luckin raised $200 million in July from investors including GIC, making it a unicorn with a valuation of $1 billion. Unicorns are startups valued at $1 billion or more.
The firm recorded a loss of 800 million yuan ($120 million) last year, which Chief Marketing Officer Yang Fei said in January was in line with expectations as it pushed to expand.

Investing.com - “Sometimes you have to walk,” U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday after the collapse of his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un – and the stock market couldn’t agree more.
The Stoxx 600 was down 1.20 points or 0.3%, at 371.38 at 04.00 AM ET (0900 GMT) on a wave of profit-taking after a two-month rally since the start of the year. Germany’s Dax was down 0.3%, the U.K. FTSE down 0.7% and France’s CAC 40 down 0.1%.
A Reuters survey released earlier Thursday showed that fund managers expect the Stoxx 600 to end the year at 371 points, suggesting little or no further upside from current levels.
It’s not just about Korea and nukes. There’s a fresh wave of concern this morning about the strength of the Chinese economy (and hence the global one) after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer played down the chance of a comprehensive agreement with China in the near future.
That puts news of a further drop in Chinese manufacturing activity into a particularly bleak context. The Caixin PMI for February showed output contracting at the fastest rate since the end of 2015, when China was exporting deflation to the rest of the world.
No coincidence that the worst performing sectoral indexes this morning are the China-sensitive EURO STOXX Basic Resources Futures, down 0.8%, and the Stoxx Autos & Parts index, down 0.7%
Optimists can still point to a more positive tone on Brexit, where the risk of a chaotic split between the U.K. and EU has fallen sharply in recent days. Much of the drop in the FTSE is the mirror image of a sharp rise in the British pound, which depresses the value of dollar income streams for its oil and mining heavyweights.
And it’s notable that Italy has outperformed this week too, after a dismal performance by the populist 5 Star movement in regional elections suggests the country may return to a more predictable political path.
But all that means today is – to borrow a phrase from Kenny Rogers – that while it’s time to walk away, at least you don’t have to run."

LONDON (Reuters) - A delay to Brexit would be a ""further annoyance"" which would prolong uncertainty, the boss of luxury carmaker Aston Martin said after Prime Minister Theresa May promised to give lawmakers a vote on extending the date for Britain to leave the EU.
Many firms have been triggering contingency plans on the assumption Britain will leave the European Union on March 29, so a delay could scupper the timing of those preparations. 
Aston Martin, which has authorized up to 30 million pounds ($40 million) worth of contingencies, is stocking more components and could fly in parts if ports are clogged up. 
Lawmakers will vote on whether to delay Brexit on March 14, just over two weeks before the scheduled departure date.
""I would categorize it as a further annoyance,"" Chief Executive Andy Palmer told Reuters. ""You're holding that contingency stock for longer which means that your working capital is tied up for longer.""
""More importantly, what you're doing is you're creating continued uncertainty,"" he added. 
Shares are down a third since the company's October flotation, falling 12 percent to 12.05 pounds at 0843 GMT on Thursday. 
Aston Martin, which is boosting volumes and building its first sport utility vehicle at a new factory, posted on Thursday a 26 percent rise in 2018 volumes and a 25 percent increase in revenues. 
But adjusted pre-tax profits fell 7 percent to 68 million pounds ($90 million) before one-off costs related to its initial public offering, which totaled 136 million pounds. 
The company said that if some one-time pension-related credits were stripped out of 2017's figures, adjusted pre-tax profit would have risen in 2018. 
Volumes rose in each of its regions with demand rising 31 percent in China, where other automakers, such as Jaguar Land Rover, have reported plunging demand. 
Aston Martin said it was confident it would deliver another year of growth in 2019 but Brexit remained a major uncertainty for the industry.
Britain's once-soaring car industry is now recording falling sales, investment and production. Honda delivered the most serious blow, with this month's announcement it was closing its British factory. 
Industry output fell 18 percent last month, according to data released on Thursday.
""That's about consumer confidence,"" said Palmer. ""We know there are other factors there as well but, fundamentally, why would you buy a car in the current circumstances? We're insulated from that but we're not immune to it.""

Ghosn was arrested in November over alleged financial misconduct and remains in detention in a Tokyo jail. Earlier this month, he picked a new team with long-time defense attorney Junichiro Hironaka as a key member to replace Motonari Otsuru, a lawyer who once ran the prosecutor's office investigating him.
Hironaka's combative style contrasts with the low-key approach adopted by the media-shy Otsuru.
At his first news conference last week, Hironaka - nicknamed ""the Razor"" - dismissed the charges against Ghosn as an internal company matter and said Japan was out of step with international norms by keeping his client in jail. 
Ghosn switched to an aggressive legal strategy came after his attempts to win bail failed, despite pledging to remain in Japan should bail be granted.
The switch also came just before lawyers were due to sit down with prosecutors and judges for the first time to hash out a schedule for pre-trial discovery meetings, where prosecutors will reveal evidence and submit a list of witnesses.
The 73-year-old defense attorney is reputed for winning high profile cases, including the acquittal of senior lawmaker Ichiro Ozawa on financial misconduct charges. He also helped free a senior bureaucrat, Atsuko Muraki, who was jailed for four months on corruption charges.
Yet, even with greater legal firepower the former Nissan boss faces a criminal justice system where only three out of every hundred defendants pleading not guilty are acquitted. Neither does Japan have a plea deal mechanism that would allow Ghosn to agree to lesser charges for a lighter sentence.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Investor optimism about the new Brazilian government's economic and fiscal reforms will power Brazilian stocks higher this year, leading to gains of more than twice those expected in Mexican stocks, according to Reuters polls.
The latest Reuters poll on Brazil's equity market, Latin America's largest, showed its Bovespa index rising 36.5 percent in 2019 to 120,000, according to the median estimates of 10 strategists and traders.
That would represent an increase of 23 percent from Tuesday's close of 97,602.50 points. The Bovespa was one of the best-performing stock markets in the world last year, gaining 15 percent.
In a separate poll, the median estimate from 11 traders' and strategists' forecasts for Mexico's S&P/BVM IPC index is for an end-2019 level of 48,300 points. That would mark a rise of almost 11 percent from Tuesday's close, and 16 percent over the year. The S&P/BVM IPC fell 15.6 percent in 2018.
The reasons given for Brazil's continued outperformance centered on what investors perceive to be the policy divergence between the two countries
Brazil's new right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, this week presented his pension reform proposals to Congress, a sweeping package of measures that aims to save more than 1 trillion reais ($270 billion) over the next decade.
The bill is the cornerstone of his administration's effort to close what most economists call an unsustainable public deficit and invigorate a weak economic recovery. Investors cheered it, even if the final bill is likely to be watered down.
""The Bolsonaro government proposals on fiscal consolidation and reform agenda, plus lower-than-historical interest and inflation rates are likely to help capital inflows,"" Citi's equity strategists wrote in a client note.
According to their analysis, ""earnings diversification and operating leverage, and a favorable macro environment"" justify an overweight position in Brazilian equities. 
On the monetary policy front, Brazil's central bank has kept benchmark interest rates at a record low of 6.50 percent for almost a year and shows no sign of moving any time soon. The consensus is it stays on hold all year, and if there is going to be a move, money markets reckon there is more chance of a cut than a hike.
It is a favorable policy mix that can mitigate the risks, analysts say. Pension reform will almost certainly be diluted and delayed, Bolsonaro's government is fragile, the risk of political scandal is high, and the economy is still weak as it emerges from its deepest recession in history.
The mix in Mexico is not quite as favorable, analysts say, even if the central bank may be pivoting to a more neutral or dovish stance. 
Bank of Mexico held its benchmark rate at a decade-high of 8.25 percent earlier this month, after raising it in December for the fourth time last year. But according to Alberto Ramos at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), policymakers now have a more nuanced view of the upside risks to inflation and seem increasingly attuned to the weak growth dynamics.
Investors are closely scrutinizing details of Mexico's budget for 2019 because of questions about the economic competence of its new president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whose performance during the five-month transition after the July election caused concern in financial markets.
Sentiment was severely dented when Lopez Obrador scrapped a partly-built $13 billion Mexico City airport.
Still, analysts on the whole took a positive view of the budget.
If there is a shift underway, Mexican stocks might need it. 
Both Brazilian and Mexican stocks could come under pressure in the near term regardless of the respective domestic pictures. Global growth is slowing, the U.S.-China trade dispute is rumbling on, and earnings expectations are being revised down.
""The risks for stocks globally through the middle of the year are to the downside,"" said Sofia Santoscoy at Bursametrica in Mexico City, reflecting the majority view of analysts polled.

The median forecast of 30 portfolio managers and strategists polled was for the Toronto market to rise just 1.0 percent from where it closed on Tuesday, to 16,225 by the end of the year. The index is then expected to climb to 16,900 by mid-2020, which would eclipse the record high of 16,586 set in July last year.
""Global economic data should bottom in the summer and start to recover in the fall of 2019, which will lead to further strength in equities,"" said Mike Archibald, associate portfolio manager at AGF Investments.
The strength of the global economy is important for the Toronto market because the index has a heavy weighting in energy and mining shares. Investors said a trade deal between the United States and China could boost prospects for global growth.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he would delay an increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods thanks to ""productive"" trade talks and that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping would meet to seal a deal if progress continued.
""The prospects of a trade war causing a global recession are fading and we have moved into the back half of the (U.S.)presidential cycle, a time when presidents have historically pivoted from putting through contentious measures to planning their re-election campaign,"" said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management.
Trump has argued Federal Reserve interest rate hikes were undercutting his administration's efforts to boost economic growth. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has pledged the Fed will make policy decisions ""in a way that is not political."" On Tuesday, Powell solidified a Fed policy shift last month in which it indicated it would pause a three-year cycle of rate hikes until the inflation or growth dynamics change.
Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz last Thursday indicated he was in no rush to resume monetary tightening.
""If the rate (hiking) cycle is broken and interest rates start to go down again ... earnings growth can be maintained,"" said Matt Skipp, president of SW8 Asset Management.
Still, investors may be reluctant to pay a higher multiple for Canadian earnings due to volatility in oil prices. The price of oil has rebounded more than 30 percent since plunging in December to an 18-month low.
""EPS (earnings per share) variability is elevated due to a large portion of the index depending on energy prices,"" said Ben Jang, a portfolio manager at Nicola Wealth Management.

The Shanghai Composite was down 0.7% by 1:25 AM ET (06:25 GMT). The Shenzhen Component, which opened higher earlier in the day, fell 0.2%. Hong Kong's Hang Send Index slipped 0.2%.
The fall in Chinese stocks came after data showed that the official Purchasing Manager's Index fell to 49.2 in February, the weakest level since February 2016.
Comments from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer were also cited as a headwind for Asian stocks, after he said it was too early to predict an outcome in talks between Washington and Beijing.
""Lighthizer's comments trimmed a bit of the trade resolution hopes which had grown recently, and equities are exposed to some downward pressure,"" said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management, in a Reuters report.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 0.9% after the country’s factory output posted the biggest decline in a year in January.
Output fell 3.7%, compared with the market forecast for a 2.4% drop.
Elsewhere, South Korea’s KOSPI traded 1.5% lower as U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un began the second day of talks in Vietnam on nuclear disarmament. Analysts are closely monitoring if any concrete steps would be agreed on later today.
Trump on Wednesday told reporters that he is “in no rush” to find a solution to North Korea’s nuclear threat.
Instead, the President said he “appreciated no testing of nuclear rockets.”
""Speed is not that important to me,"" Trump said in a brief statement. ""I very much appreciate no testing of nuclear rockets, missiles, any of it — very much appreciate it.""
""I am in no rush — just we don't want the testing and we've developed something very special with respect to that,"" Trump added.
Kim, for his part, said ""it's too early to tell, but I wouldn't say that I'm pessimistic. For what I feel right now, I do have a feeling that good results will come out.""
Separately, the Bank of Korea held interest rates unchanged at 1.75% as expected.

377,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2019 01:30AM ET</span>","After recent surge, U.S. stocks to make only small gains this year: Reuters poll","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks will rack up only modest gains this year on top of a surge in recent months as a weakening profit outlook reins in market bulls, according to a Reuters poll of strategists.
The benchmark S&P 500 index will end 2019 at 2,900, up around 3.8 percent from Tuesday's close of 2,793.90, based on the median forecast of over 50 strategists polled by Reuters in the last two weeks. That would represent a gain of 15.7 percent from the end of 2018.
Dovish signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve and, more recently, increased hopes of a trade deal between the United States and China have driven this year's gains, reversing a late-2018 sell-off that resulted in the worst December performance since the Great Depression.
The S&P 500 is now up about 19 percent from its late-December lows.
Still, the poll's end-2019 forecast is down from November, when strategists surveyed by Reuters predicted the index would reach 2,975 by year end.
As worries about Fed policy, economic growth and trade seem to have eased for the moment, some strategists see earnings as one of the biggest risks to stocks this year.
""Earnings drive stocks. If earnings expectations aren't met, that will be disappointing,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist and senior portfolio manager at Nuveen in Princeton, New Jersey.
""So keep your eye on earnings. I think that's the biggest risk.""
Investors had expected U.S. profit growth to slow this year after 2018's tax cut fueled a jump in earnings of more than 20 percent, but some are increasingly worried about the potential for a profit recession, typically defined as two straight quarters of year-over-year earnings declines.
Analysts have reduced earnings growth estimates for 2019 sharply in recent months. S&P 500 earnings are now estimated to grow just 4.1 percent for the year and to decline 1 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Valuations have gone up as profit estimates have fallen, with the S&P 500 now trading at 16.6 times forward earnings, up from 14.7 at the end of 2018 and above the long-term average of 15, based on Refinitiv data.
The majority of strategists in the poll said the risk for stocks globally by mid-year is skewed more toward a sharp fall than a sharp rise. 
""At least for now, all the good news is pretty much priced in here. I'm not looking for markets to really increase here by any significant amount,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
Many strategists are hopeful about a positive resolution to the U.S.-China trade talks and said that could support further gains in the market. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he would delay an increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods after ""productive"" trade talks. 
Hopes of a resolution to the trade conflict have boosted shares of industrials, after trade worries pressured the sector in 2018. If Washington approves any kind of infrastructure program this year, that would be positive for those stocks as well, strategists said.
So far this year, S&P 500 industrials have had the best performance, followed by the technology sector, and several strategists were upbeat on one or both of those sectors.
""What works best in the late cycle is quality growth companies, which tend to be found in tech and healthcare,"" said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors LLC in New York. 
The poll also showed the Dow Jones industrial average finishing 2019 at 26,500, also below the forecast from the Reuters November poll of 26,865. That would represent a gain of 1.7 percent from Tuesday's close and an increase of 13.6 percent from the end of 2018.
The S&P 500 will reach 3,000 by mid-2020 while the Dow will hit 27,311 by end-June 2020, according to the poll.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's stock market is seen rising in the short term but sanctions against Moscow and global economic woes could trigger a temporary decline later this year, a Reuters poll of market experts found.
Russian stock indexes are likely to peak within a few months, then retreat below current levels before heading towards record highs next year, a consensus forecast of 10 analysts showed.
The dollar-based RTS index is forecast to rise 3.9 percent from Tuesday's close of 1,193.07 to 1,240 points by the middle of the year, the poll showed. By the end of 2019, it is seen at 1,150, with forecasts ranging from 960 to 1,500. 
Russian financial markets have proved vulnerable to swings in the oil price and geopolitical risks, particularly Western sanctions and the threat of more curbs to punish Moscow for what Washington calls ""malign activities."" 
Analysts polled by Reuters this month -- after U.S. senators introduced a new bill on sanctions on Russia -- highlighted that risk but predicted the rouble-based MOEX index would rise to an all-time high of 2,560 by mid-2019 before declining to 2,400 by the end of the year. 
MOEX closed at 2,494.02 on Tuesday. 
""With respect to Russia the key risk is geopolitical tensions ... which we expect to be confirmed before mid-2019,"" said Iskander Lutsko, chief investment strategist at ITI Capital.
""Hence the performance of the Russian equity market would decouple from the global trend,"" Lutsko said, forecasting negative shocks from sanctions in the short term and a gradual recovery afterwards.
So far this year, RTS has gained 12 percent and MOEX 6 percent.
Sergei Drozdov, an analyst at Finam brokerage, said year-to-date gains were mostly driven by inflows of speculative money from Western investment funds. 
He said U.S. Federal Reserve policy and tensions between the U.S. and China could trigger a serious adjustment on global stock markets, leading to a reversal of the speculative flows into Russian equity and debt markets. In such a scenario, he added, the MOEX could fall to 2,200 in March-April. 
However, other analysts argued that the Russian economy and budget were now less vulnerable to external shocks than previously.
""I see no risk of capital outflow that could ruin the market this year,"" said Georgy Vaschenko, head of capital market operations at Freedom Finance brokerage.
Vladimir Miklashevsky, senior economist at Danske Bank in Helsinki, said this year was likely to be broadly challenging for Russian stocks, with the exception of the energy and banking sectors.
Shares of export-focused companies also still look promising, said Mikhail Kuzin, head of the investment division at Raiffeisen Capital Asset Management Company in Moscow. 
Analysts expect Russian stocks to rebound with MOEX rising to 2,570 by mid-2020 and RTS to 1,255, despite the uncertainty and gloom linked to risk of new sanctions remaining.
""2020 is a presidential election year in the U.S. and that could raise sanctions rhetoric and risk,"" said Geldy Soyunov, chief analyst at Alfa Bank.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - How Indian shares fare this year will depend heavily on the outcome of national elections in May, with market experts polled by Reuters saying a majority win for the ruling party would be the most favorable outcome for equities.
Since hitting a record high of 38,989.65 on Aug. 29, the BSE Sensex index has fallen roughly 8 percent. This year, it is down about 0.3 percent, as there has not been the kind of recovery from late 2018's deep equities sell-off that other major stock indexes have had.
The absence of a 2019 rally partly driven by increasing uncertainty before the election, reflected in a second consecutive cut to 2019's outlook in the latest quarterly Reuters poll of 50 equity strategists.
The polling was conducted Feb. 13-26, before the escalation in tensions between India and Pakistan after both sides said they shot down each other's fighter jets.
The BSE Sensex is forecast to gain 2.7 percent to 36,960 by mid-2019 from Tuesday's close of 35,973.71, just a touch lower than the 37,000 predicted three months ago. The index is then expected to rise to 37,975 by end-2019, a downgrade from 39,400 forecast in November's poll.
Late last year, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost power in three key states, handing Prime Minister Narendra Modi his biggest electoral defeat since he took office in 2014.
""Despite the recent state election outcomes, the base case assumption continues to remain, with the incumbent party coming back to power for another term,"" said Hitesh Agrawal, retail research head at Religare Broking.
""This will be taken positively by the market, which likes certainty and continuity, especially on the policy front. Any other general election outcome will lead to a knee-jerk reaction."" 
RECOUPING LOSSES? 
But at best, Indian stocks are forecast to only recoup losses they incurred late last year.
If the BJP wins a majority of seats, that would help the BSE Sensex gain over 7 percent in the election's immediate aftermath, according to strategists who answered an additional poll question.
However, if BJP falls short of a majority and has to form a coalition to stay in power, Indian stocks are expected to rise only half that much. 
If the Indian National Congress (INC) party wins a majority, Indian shares were predicted to rise about 2 percent immediately after the election. But the BSE Sensex is forecast to fall 3 percent if a INC-led coalition forms the next government.
An alliance of regional parties would be the worst outcome, knocking the market down 7.5 percent in the vote's immediate aftermath, according to the poll replies.
Rajat Agarwal, Asia equity strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), said the equity market ""is sanguine about politics at this point"".
But while a return of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) under Modi's leadership ""should be hailed by the market, equity markets could de-rate in the near-term if the BJP loses,"" he noted 
The tepid outlook for Indian stocks also stems from a slowing domestic economy that has dampened investors' interest in already over-valued stocks.
India's economic growth likely slowed again in the final three months of 2018 after a worse-than-expected performance in the prior quarter. The October-December growth number will be reported later on Thursday.
The Reserve Bank of India, which surprisingly cut interest rates on Feb. 7, is widely expected to cut them again in the coming months according to a separate Reuters poll.
That could also provide a boost to the market. 
Nearly 90 percent of strategists who answered a separate question said earnings growth, which has failed to rise at a significant pace over the past four years, will improve.
Societe Generale's Agarwal called the elections a ""risk event for equity markets in the near-term."" But study of past ones ""suggests that beyond the short-term reaction, the equity markets align themselves to the trajectory of corporate earnings,"" he added. 
""The medium-term prospects of the equity markets are well supported by the earnings recovery, domestic liquidity and a new private capital expenditure cycle.""

381,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 11:48PM ET</span>","Exclusive: KKR, China's Tencent eyeing bids for Universal Music - sources","By Pamela Barbaglia
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. buyout fund KKR and China's Tencent Music Entertainment Group are exploring rival bids for up to half of Vivendi's iconic Universal Music division, a deal potentially worth up 20 billion euros ($22.73 billion), sources told Reuters.
French tycoon Vincent Bollore, who controls  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) with a 25 percent stake, is in the process of selecting banks to oversee a partial sale of Universal Music Group (UMG), two sources familiar with matter said.
Sell-side banks are expected to be appointed in March, with a process likely to kick off in the second quarter, they said.
But informal discussions with potential bidders are underway as banks are trying to gauge appetite for the unit. 
UMG is the world's biggest music label ahead of Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music, and is home to artists like Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Drake and Kendrick Lamar.
Vivendi and KKR declined to comment. Tencent Music declined to comment.
Analysts have expressed different views on UMG's valuation.
JPMorgan's media analyst Daniel Kerven recently described the business as ""a unique asset – under-monetized, must-have global content that is strategic to the tech giants and can't be replicated"". He pegged UMG's fair value at 44 billion euros.
That is higher than rival estimates.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) put it at 29 billion euros, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) at 35 billion euros and Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) at 25 billion euros.
Vivendi's boss Arnaud de Puyfontaine said in 2017 that the unit could be worth more than $40 billion. 
At the time Vivendi was exploring a possible stock market listing, a plan later shelved amid challenges in eking out big profits in the sector, with many customers still unwilling to pay much for songs they can hear free on the radio, in music blogs or on free apps.
Universal will generate roughly 1.5 billion euros of free cash flow excluding interest payments in 2023, Deutsche Bank forecast. Tencent Music Entertainment Group, a subsidiary of China's biggest gaming and social media firm Tencent Holdings Ltd, has an existing licensing agreement with Universal and wants to strengthen its collaboration with a partial acquisition, the sources said, cautioning that no deal was certain.
But industry bidders may find it hard to negotiate a joint venture deal with Bollore as they would not be able to secure a majority stake and have a meaningful say on UMG's strategy going forward, the sources said. 
Bollore wants to stay in the driving seat, they added. 
Some private equity funds including U.S.-based KKR are willing to enter an equity partnership with Bollore and help fund UMG's international expansion, even if they won't be able to take full control, the sources said.
KKR previously entered a joint venture deal with Bertelsmann, Europe's largest media company, to back music rights management company BMG. It proved to be a lucrative investment for KKR, which doubled its money when it sold its stake back to Bertelsmann in 2013.
One of the sources said other big buyout funds who are technology-savvy and have conducted similar investments in the TMT sector have shown interest in making a bid for UMG.
For private equity investors the deal offers a high-profile platform to tap into the music industry, which is recovering from a 15-year long downturn and has grown for the past three years.
Global recorded music revenues rose 8.1 percent in 2017 to $17.3 billion, according to record industry trade group IFPI.
Streaming revenues represented the bulk of the growth, with sales up more than 41 percent, driven by 176 million paid subscribers.
UMG owns 4 percent of Spotify, the world's most popular paid music streaming service, a stake that Vivendi executives have always described as a core investment, ruling out any plans to cash out.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese stocks will gain another 4 percent by end-December as stimulus measures in China, one of the country's most important markets, counter weak domestic demand, a Reuters poll found.
The Nikkei share average has already gained around 7 percent so far this year, buoyed by hopes that the United States and China are making progress in talks aimed at ending their trade war, which has hurt Japan and other export-reliant Asian economies. 
Median estimates from 24 analysts and fund managers polled by Reuters in the past week put the Nikkei at 22,300 by year-end, compared with 20,014.77 at the end of 2018 and Tuesday's close of 21,449.39.
The forecast for the index in mid-2020 was 24,000.
""We expect the Chinese economy will bottom out this year helped by its stimulus measures, while concerns about U.S.-China trade wars will recede. Emerging markets' economies will likely recover as well,"" said Masashi Akutsu, chief equity strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities, who expects the Nikkei to reach 24,000 by end-2019.
China's economy grew at the weakest pace in nearly three decades last year amid weakening domestic demand and U.S. trade tariffs, prompting Beijing to announce a series of growth-boosting measures to avert the risk of a sharper slowdown.
Beijing is likely to unveil more fiscal stimulus during the annual parliament meeting in March, including further tax cuts and more spending on infrastructure projects, to support growth.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he may soon sign a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping to end their trade war if their countries can bridge remaining differences, saying negotiators were ""very, very close"" to a deal.
NEGATIVE RISKS
While market watchers expect Japan's equities market to improve this year, many cited concerns about an expected blow to consumption from a planned sales tax hike in October.
""Domestic consumer sentiment is likely to worsen at the scheduled tax hike,"" said Hiroyuki Ueno, a senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management.
Indeed, analysts expect the Nikkei to dip 3 percent in the second half of this year, from 23,000 at end-June to 22,300 at end-December.
Forecasts for mid-2019 ranged from 20,000 to 24,500. For end-2019, the range was 18,000 to 27,000. 
""Retail sales are expected to decline significantly and retail companies will probably refrain from raising prices. The country has a risk of going back to deflation,"" Ueno said.
Japanese companies' earnings outlook remains murky, with many manufacturers slashing their annual profit forecasts for the year ending March, hit by slowing demand from China.
Companies will likely report a 0.3 percent drop in their profits on a pre-tax basis for this fiscal year, according to data compiled by Daiwa Securities.
""Japanese companies' earnings have peaked out. Their earnings are supported by foreign demand and not by domestic demand,"" said Shinichi Ichikawa, chief market strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). ""Domestic demand is weak as it has a structural problem with the declining population and aging society.""
Ichikawa forecast the Nikkei to drop to 20,000 in June and 18,000 in December.
The Cabinet Office data last week showed that Japan's economy bounced back in the fourth quarter as business and consumer spending recovered from the impact of natural disasters, but trade frictions and a proposed sales tax hike are expected to hinder growth in 2019.
A Reuters monthly corporate survey out last week showed 56 percent of more than 250 companies polled predict domestic investment in factories and equipment will be flat in the next fiscal year that starts in April.

385,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 08:50PM ET</span>",Apple self-driving car layoffs give hints to division's direction,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said on Wednesday it planned to lay off 190 employees in its self-driving car program, Project Titan, changes that provide a rare window into the automotive technologies the company has been pursuing.
The tech firm said in a filing with state regulators that it planned to lay off people from eight different Santa Clara County facilities near its Cupertino, California, headquarters, as of April 16. A company spokesman confirmed that the reduction was from the self-driving car program.
While the iPhone maker has acknowledged its interest in self-driving cars in broad terms, it has never detailed precisely which technologies it is working on and whether it seeks to build a whole vehicle or the sensors, computer system and software to control one.
The public documents filed with regulators provide some previously undisclosed clues.
Among those laid off were at least two dozen software engineers, including a machine learning engineer, and 40 hardware engineers, according to a letter sent by Apple to California employment regulators earlier this month. 
Some of the positions hint at physical products for consumers: three product design engineers and an ergonomics engineer face layoffs. A machine shop supervisor was among the reductions, though it is unclear how many machinists reported to the supervisor and whether the shop fabricates automotive parts or smaller parts for electronics and sensors.
The layoffs appear to be the first major shake-up of Project Titan under Doug Field, who returned to Apple last year as Vice President of Special Projects after a stint at electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Apple operates the car project on a ""need-to-know"" basis, with only about 5,000 of Apple's 140,000 full-time workers included, according to court documents in a theft of trade secrets criminal case filed this year against an ex-Apple employee.
About 1,200 of those are ""core"" employees that are ""directly working on the development of the project,"" according to the complaint, which was unsealed in January.
Despite the headcount changes, the company appears to have ramped up its testing on California roads. In a filing with regulators earlier this month, Apple said it had logged nearly 80,000 miles of testing in its home state in 2018, far surpassing the less than 1,000 miles it had logged the year before.
It was, however, far fewer than Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo unit, which logged 1.2 million miles in California last year.

387,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 07:20PM ET</span>","Global stock market resurgence to be short-lived, 2019 outlook cut: Reuters poll","By Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global stock markets in 2019 will at best only recoup losses from the deep sell-off late last year, according to equity market analysts in Reuters polls, who reckon the risk is skewed more toward a sharp fall by mid-year.
Optimism among ever-bullish equity strategists has been dented after 2018 marked the worst year for most markets since the global financial crisis, when nearly $7 trillion was wiped off world stock markets.
The Feb 12-27 Reuters polls of over 200 equity strategists, analysts and fund managers from around the world is the latest in a series of surveys over the past year in which respondents markedly lowered their forecasts for global stocks.
That view is driven by a cocktail of worries, including the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, cooling global growth and tightening liquidity conditions.
""There are significant risks to the outlook for 2019,"" noted David Kelly, chief global strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.
""2018 has been a difficult year for investors as long bull markets... have encountered strong headwinds, and international stocks have underperformed following a very strong 2017. Shifting fundamentals in an aging expansion have certainly played their part in slowing investment returns.""
About 65 percent of more than 90 respondents who answered an additional question said the risk for global stocks by mid-year was for a sharp fall. The remaining said the opposite.
""Risks for global stocks are skewed to a sharp fall as a global economic slowdown gathers pace, the current business cycle is fairly old and global central banks have limited firepower to support weakening economies,"" said Vyacheslav Smolyaninov, chief equity strategist at BCS Global Markets.
While nine of 16 indexes were forecast to trade higher by the end of 2019, analysts had predicted just three months ago that all but one of them would rise. Forecasts for only three of those 16 indexes were raised from the previous poll.
Among those indexes forecast to gain in this calendar year, five were predicted to rise sharply, while the rest were at best expected to recoup their 2018 losses.
That was despite some major equity indexes having their best start to a year in over three decades.
""At least for now, all the good news is pretty much priced in here. I'm not looking for markets to really increase here by any significant amount,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
After the worst annual performance since 2015 and the worst December since the Great Depression, the S&P 500 gained nearly 8 percent in January, marking its best start in over 32 years.
But in the survey, the S&P 500 was forecast to rack up only modest additional gains as a weakening profit outlook reins in market bulls. The end-2019 view is about where strategists polled just six months ago thought the index would be by the end of last year.
""We expect 2019 to be stormy, since we are still in the late phase of the economic cycle. This means that global growth will gradually slow down and that the earnings-generating ability will be challenged,"" noted Fredrik Oberg, chief investment officer at SEB.
Toronto's stock market was expected to make tepid gains over the rest of the year after surging since January.
European shares were forecast to run out of steam and end 2019 roughly at their current levels, as continuous political risks and slowing growth keep a tight lid on their upward potential.
While earnings growth estimates for 2019 have been reduced sharply across regions, equity strategists were almost equally split on whether earnings growth in their domestic markets has already peaked or will soon, versus will improve.
""The near-term outlook for international equities is perhaps even more uncertain than for U.S. stocks. Recent volatility, particularly around mounting trade tensions, has left international equities trading at a deep discount to both the U.S. and history,"" added JP Morgan's Kelly.
""But the question of whether or not this valuation advantage will result in relatively better returns in 2019 is a close call.""
Brazilian stocks were forecast to power higher this year, driven by investors' faith in the new Brazilian government's economic and fiscal reforms. Mexican stocks will make almost 11 percent gains.
But the outlook for Indian stocks go will depend heavily on the outcomes of the current military conflict Pakistan and national elections in May, with market experts saying a majority win for the ruling party would be the most favorable outcome for equities.

388,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>",That's all folks: European shares to stall for the rest of 2019: Reuters poll,"By Julien Ponthus and Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares are running out of steam and are expected to end 2019 roughly at their current level, a Reuters poll showed, as continuous political risks and slowing growth keep a tight lid on their upward potential. 
Europe's main indexes are up about 10 percent so far this year, having kept pace with a rebound which has lifted global markets since the start of January.
According to the survey of over 30 brokers, fund managers and analysts taken Feb. 12-25, the pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark index is seen ending the year at 371 points, which was almost the level it closed at on Tuesday. 
The latest forecasts are in line with a previous November poll, which forecast the STOXX 600 climbing to 373 points by end-2019.
Expectations were less optimistic for the euro zone blue-chip index which was seen losing about 40 points and closing 2019 at 3,250 points. Germany's DAX was expected to retreat about 120 points to 11,420 points. 
Much of the rationale behind cautious expectations for European stocks is tepid growth after investment banks and international institutions cut their 2019 forecasts for the region.
The continent's economic powerhouse, Germany, is on the verge of a recession and should only grow 1.1 percent this year according to the European Commission. 
Fading growth has cast a shadow on hopes the European Central Bank could start raising interest rates and resurgent corporate profits could kickstart stock markets.
At the moment, European companies listed on the STOXX 600 are expected to report 2.6 percent year-on-year earnings growth for the fourth quarter of 2018, according to I/B/E/S Refinitiv.
This contrasts sharply with the optimism of last autumn when profit growth expectations for Q4 were as high as 13 percent in early November.
""After a couple of years of rare economic momentum and relative political calm, domestic Europe has reverted toward its norm of underwhelming nominal growth and political uncertainty,” said Giles Rothbarth, portfolio manager in BlackRock's European equity team. 
While other investors argue a U.S.-China trade deal could lift European markets, others fear Europe could be the fall guy in any breakthrough which would allow Donald Trump to turn his attention to German cars and French luxury wines.

Output dropped to 120,649 vehicles last month hit by a 21.4 percent fall in exports, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. 
""The industry faces myriad challenges, from falling demand in key markets, to escalating global trade tensions and the need to stay at the forefront of future technology,"" said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.
""But, the clear and present danger remains the threat of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, which is monopolizing time and resources, undermining competitiveness."" 

Britain's once-soaring car industry is now recording falling sales, investment and production, with Honda delivering the most serious blow earlier this month, announcing the closure of its British factory, which builds over 10 percent of the country's 1.5 million cars.

390,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 06:56PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Petrobras oil trader to plead guilty in U.S. money-laundering case - documents,"By Gary McWilliams
HOUSTON (Reuters) - A former U.S.-based oil trader sought in Brazil over a multimillion-dollar bribery scheme involving commodities traders Vitol,  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) and Trafigura has agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit money-laundering in the United States, court records show.
The plea is part of a cooperation agreement by a key figure in Brazil's ""Car Wash"" probe into corruption at state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, according to people familiar with the matter. That scandal has toppled presidents in two countries and sent more than 130 politicians and businessmen to jail across Latin America.
Rodrigo Garcia Berkowitz, who worked as a trader for Petrobras in Houston until last year, waived an indictment and offered to plead guilty to the charge, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. The court accepted the request and set sentencing for Sept. 13.
Berkowitz is among 12 former Petrobras employees and middlemen charged in Brazil in December in connection with a scheme that Brazilian investigators have said offered Vitol, Glencore, Trafigura lower prices for oil and services and then shared in the savings, authorities have said. The activities took place between 2011 and 2014.
Vitol declined to comment on the plea agreement, adding it has a zero tolerance policy for bribery and corruption and cooperates fully with relevant authorities. Petrobras said it fired Berkowitz and is working with prosecutors in Brazil.
Glencore, which could not immediately be reached for comment, has said in the past it was cooperating with Brazilian authorities. Trafigura has said it took the allegations seriously.
The conspiracy to commit money laundering documents do not name Berkowitz. The case is against John Doe, a pseudonym that prosecutors sometimes use to keep the names of individuals involved in an investigation out of the public eye.
But Berkowitz signed his name to an application to plead guilty that was filed with court records. The application was approved by Judge Raymond Dearie, of federal court in Brooklyn.
Kent Schaffer, a top Houston criminal defense attorney who signed court papers to represent John Doe, confirmed that Berkowitz is the individual named in the documents. He declined other comment.
Berkowitz, who is living in the United States, has been cooperating with New York prosecutors who opened a probe into the allegations, the people familiar with the matter have said.
John Marzulli, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue, for the Eastern District of New York, declined to comment.
Bribes allegedly paid to Petrobras insiders moved through bank accounts in the United States, Britain, Sweden, Switzerland and Uruguay, Brazilian authorities have said, paving the way for U.S. prosecutors to probe for violations of U.S. money laundering laws.
The U.S. attorneys office for the Eastern District of New York that struck the plea agreement with Berkowitz has worked hand-in-hand with Brazilian prosecutors in the Car Wash probe in the past. In late 2016, they jointly negotiated with construction firm Odebrecht to reach a deal that resulted in a $2.6 billion fine.

391,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 06:28PM ET</span>","Wells Fargo starts settlement talks with Justice Dept, SEC","NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co said on Wednesday that it entered preliminary settlement discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission over previously disclosed probes into its sales practices.
In an annual regulatory filing, the bank said it raised the maximum figure it could exceed its legal reserves by as much as $2.7 billion, an increase of $500 million since it last reported the number in November.
The bank said it raised the figure, which is called a reasonable possible loss and is separate from the bank's legal reserves, because of several legal matters, including ones related to its sales practices.
Wells Fargo has faced a long list of penalties related to a sales scandal beginning in 2015 which initially related to employees in the consumer bank opening millions of accounts in customers' names without their permission. It has since spread to other bank businesses, from mortgage banking to auto lending.
To date the bank has paid out over $4 billion in settlements and fines related to the scandal and has faced probes from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Los Angeles city attorney and the New York attorney general. 

Lingering investigations by the SEC, the Department of Justice and the Department of Labor represent the largest open questions hanging over the bank's head.

397,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 04:55PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. GDP Growth Expected to Slow
The latest figures on U.S. economic growth headline the economic calendar tomorrow, with the market expecting a more modest expansion.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis will report advance fourth-quarter 2018 gross domestic product at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Economists, on average, expect that growth slowed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6%, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Economic “momentum appears to remain on a trajectory in Q1 2019,” FocusEconomics said in a note this week. “In December, the ISM manufacturing index posted its steepest monthly decline in a decade. Moreover, consumer confidence tanked in the month, retail sales unexpectedly contracted and existing home sales fell to an over three-year low.”
“This suggests private consumption softened in Q4, which was likely compounded by a sharp fall in equity prices in December,” FocusEconomics said.
The weekly report on initial jobless claims is due at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
The forecast of economists polled by Investing.com is for a small gain to 221,000, up 2.3% from the week before. The U.S. jobs picture in the aggregate has been very strong, even if wage gains haven't been quite as strong.
In addition, investors will watch the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, a measure that looks at the health of manufacturing in the Chicago region. The report comes out at 9:45 a.m. ET (14:45 GMT).
The forecast, according to economists polled by Investing.com, is for the index to rise to 58.1 from 56.7 in January. The index had fallen modestly from prior months in November, December and January.
In addition there will be Fed speakers, although the market may be a little overloaded on central bank talk after two days of testimony from Fed chief Jerome Powell.
At 11 AM ET, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker will give a speech on economic outlook at The Philadelphia Inquirer's Influencers of Finance.
At 1 PM ET, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan will participate in a Q&A at the Real Estate Council of San Antonio.
2. This Earnings Report's for You
The world’s largest brewer is on tap to report earnings tomorrow morning.
Anheuser Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD) is expected to report a profit of $1.01 per share on sales of about $14 billion.
Shares have rebounded since the stock followed the broader market lower in December. They are about back to the level seen just after they took a sharp dive in late October following results that missed on the top and bottom lines.
Also reporting Thursday:
Hotel company Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR). The forecast for the lodging giant, according to analysts polled by Investing.com, is $1.39 a share on revenue of $5.53 billion
Software maker Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), The software maker is forecast to earn $0.42 a share on revenue of $707.3 million.
Entertainment ticketing company Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV). The company is forecast to show a loss of 74 cents a share on revenue of $2.38 billion, according to analysts polled by Investing.com.
Department store operator JC Penney (NYSE:JCP). The retailer is expected to earn $0.11 a share on revenue of $3.72 billion.
Software company VMware (NYSE:VMW). The company is expect to report earnings of $1.88 a share on revenue of $2.5 billion.
3. Geopolitics Moving the Market
Markets have been very sensitive about the news on the U.S.-China trade dispute.
Wednesday's stock-market decline was due in large part to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer's comment that a lot of hard work is still needed to get a deal, and it is not clear when a deal will get done. So, the idea is higher tariffs is alive at least for now
Also President Donald Trump has been meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un in Vietnam in hopes of getting Kim's country to halt its nuclear weapons program. Real progress would be bullish.
In addition, investors will be watching for any further escalation in tensions between India and Pakistan."
398,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 04:52PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Extends Losing Streak as Trade Optimism Cools,"Investing.com - The Dow fell for a second-straight day Wednesday as investor optimism on trade cooled and healthcare was led lower by a slump in Mylan.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.28%, or about 73 points, but was down as much as 180 points at session lows. The S&P 500 lost 0.05%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.07%.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer cooled investor hopes of the U.S. and China reaching a trade deal sooner rather later, suggesting there was still more work done.
""Let me be clear,"" Lighthizer told the House Ways and Means Committee. ""Much still needs to be done both before an agreement is reached and, more importantly, after it is reached, if one is reached.""
The somewhat somber tone on trade comes just days after the market participants cheered news that President Donald Trump pushed back a deadline on imposing additional tariffs on China that were due to go into effect on Friday.
Semiconductor stocks, some of which have a sizable exposure to China, tripped up on the Lighthizer's remarks.
But Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), both viewed as barometers of international trade, ended the day higher, underpinning industrials.
Healthcare stocks, meanwhile, struggled to get shake off a slump in the Mylan, keeping a lid on gains in the broader market.
Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) fell 15% after the drugmaker reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed estimates provided by Investing.com. Guidance also fell short of the expectations.
WellCare Health Plans (NYSE:WCG) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) closed down sharply.
But it wasn't all doom and gloom as  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) served up fourth-quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines, triggering a wave of green for retailers.
Energy stocks also helped the broader market off session lows on rising oil prices thanks to data showing domestic crude supplies fell much more than expected last week.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was also focus and reiterated his upbeat assessment of the economy, while signaling the central bank was looking to stop shrinking its balance sheet later this year.
""We’ve worked out the framework of a plan, that we hope to be able to announce soon, that will light the way all the way to the end of balance sheet normalization and that will result in the end of asset runoff sometime later this year,"" Powell said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German drugs and lab supplies maker Merck KGaA offered $5.9 billion, including debt, for Versum Materials, in a cash deal that tops an offer from U.S. rival Entegris, as both seek to boost their electrochemicals operations. 
Shares in electronic materials maker Versum soared 18.7 percent to close at $49.13 on Wednesday, while shares in Merck lost 4.2 percent and Entegris fell 2.7 percent. 
Merck said it planned to buy Versum for $48 per share - or $5.2 billion excluding debt - for a premium of 16 percent to Tuesday's closing price and of 52 percent to the share price before Entegris' offer.
Entegris announced a $4 billion all-stock deal in January, saying it wanted to create a big chemical supplier to the semiconductor market at a time when the industry is under pressure. 
Versum said in a statement on Wednesday that it ""continues to believe in the strategic and financial rationale of the proposed merger of equals with Entegris,"" but its advisers will also thoroughly review the Merck proposal.
Entegris' combination with Versum ""is highly complementary and strategically compelling"", Entegris Chief Executive Bertrand Loy said in a statement.
Shares in Versum, spun off from Air Products (NYSE:APD) in 2016, fell 27 percent in 2018 as demand for microchips used in smartphones and other personal devices plateaued and a decade-long rally in U.S. stock markets wobbled. 
Merck is building a high-tech chemicals division, called Performance Materials, that caters to the electronics industry and will complement its shrinking liquid crystals business. 
The liquid crystals business used to enjoy operating income margins of 40-50 percent but is now under pressure from Chinese rivals.
Merck has said Performance Materials would return to growth in 2020, thanks to restructuring measures.
Family controlled Merck is diversified across three separate businesses, including a healthcare unit, which stems from a collaboration deal with GSK, and a life science division that makes supplies and gear for biotech labs.
To bolster its Performance Materials division, Merck in 2014 bought Britain's AZ Electronic Materials for 1.9 billion euros.
Merck said it was ready to proceed immediately to due diligence and to quickly agree a deal, adding it did not need its own shareholders to approve a transaction.
""The transaction that Versum recently disclosed significantly undervalues Versum,"" Merck Chief Executive Stefan Oschmann said in a letter to Versum's board of directors.
""Instead of the speculative value offered by the Entegris transaction, the all-cash proposal would deliver immediate and certain cash value to Versum stockholders and employees"", he added.
The proposed deal would value Versum at 13.3 times its 2018 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, Oschmann said, adding he anticipated no regulatory problems. 
Merck expects the deal, which it said will reap cost synergies of about 60 million euros annually, to close in the second half of 2019. 
Merck is working with the bank Guggenheim and the law firm Sullivan Cromwell on the deal, which a spokesman said was fully financed with equity and debt and has not yet been discussed with Versum.

Merck has been flush with cash since the sale of its consumer health unit to Procter & Gamble for 3.4 billion euros last year.

400,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 04:30PM ET</span>","Wall Street steadies after Lighthizer, Powell, Cohen testimonies","By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed down slightly on Wednesday but well above its session low after testimonies to U.S. Congress from trade and central bank officials as well as President Donald Trump's former lawyer brought few major surprises. 
U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer told a congressional hearing the United States and China still had hard work ahead to settle their trade dispute in his first public comments since Trump announced a delay to Chinese import tariffs on Sunday.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress the central bank would stop shrinking its $4 trillion balance sheet this year, ending a process investors say is at cross-purposes with its current pause on interest rate hikes.
The S&P had drifted gradually higher after hitting a session low around 10.30 a.m. and swerved in and out of positive territory in afternoon trading. 
""The two things that have been market drivers have been central bank policy and trade negotiations. Two of the most important guys in those areas testified today. When they said reasonable and measured things, (stocks) recovered,"" said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. 
Also on Wednesday, Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen called the president a ""conman"" but said he had no direct evidence Trump colluded with Moscow to bolster his White House campaign ahead of the 2016 election.
Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York said that the market recovered when investors realize there would not be ""some kind of bombshell out of Cohen's testimony."" 
He also saw India-Pakistan tensions as a support for U.S. assets as investors sought alternatives to emerging markets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 72.82 points, or 0.28 percent, to 25,985.16, the S&P 500 lost 1.52 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,792.38 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.21 points, or 0.07 percent, to 7,554.51.
Optimism on trade and Fed policy had boosted equities from December lows in recent weeks, with the S&P 500 index roughly 5 percent below its record closing high hit in late September.
""Investors are stepping back and taking a pause to see how these news events play out,"" Carol Schleif, Deputy Chief Investment Officer, Abbot Downing in Minneapolis, MN.
Of the 11 major S&P sectors, seven closed lower with the healthcare index 0.5 percent decline weighing the most. Health insurer and pharmacy benefit manager shares slipped after a Senate hearing and the introduction of a bill aimed at moving all Americans into a government health insurance program on Tuesday. 
A 15 percent drop in Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) NV shares was another drag after the generic drugmaker missed quarterly profit estimates and forecast weak 2019 earnings.
 Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) jumped 14 percent after the consumer electronics retailer beat analysts' estimates for quarterly same-store sales, while announcing a dividend hike and a share buyback plan.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.05-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 25 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 58 new highs and 30 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.30 billion shares, compared with the 7.34 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

401,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 04:12PM ET</span>","FedEx partners with Walmart, Pizza Hut to test last-mile delivery robot","By Lisa Baertlein
(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) this summer plans to begin testing a robot to handle home deliveries for partners ranging from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc to Pizza Hut.
Shippers, retailers and restaurants are experimenting with robots, drones and self-driving cars in a bid to use automation to drive down the high cost of delivering gadgets, groceries and even cups of coffee the ""last mile"" to consumer doorsteps.
FedEx is teaming up with DEKA Development & Research Corp, whose founder Dean Kamen invented the Segway stand-up scooter and iBot stair-climbing wheelchair, for its project. The delivery company said the robots could become part of its SameDay service that operates in 1,900 cities around the world. 
The battery-powered robots look like coolers on wheels. Cameras and software help them detect and avoid obstacles as they roam sidewalks and roadways at a top speed of 10 miles (16 km) per hour. 
The project must win approval in test cities, including the shipper's hometown of Memphis, and the first deliveries will be between FedEx office stores. 
On average, more than 60 percent of merchants' customers live within three miles of a store location. FedEx said it is working with its partners, which also include AutoZone Inc (NYSE:AZO) and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), to determine if autonomous delivery to them is a viable option for fast, cheap deliveries.
The ""last mile"" to the home accounts for 50 percent or more of total package delivery costs. Restaurants pay third-party delivery companies like Uber Eats, DoorDash and GrubHub commissions of 10-30 percent per order. 
Investors and companies are pouring millions of dollars into projects aimed at lowering those costs and overcoming regulatory hurdles. For safety reasons, many states want autonomous vehicles to have humans as emergency backup drivers. 
Starship Technologies, which has raised more than $40 million in venture funding, last year deployed robots to deliver packages in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
In January, it teamed up with French food service company Sodexo (PA:EXHO) to take Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Dunkin' Donuts and Blaze Pizza orders to the 40,000 students at George Mason University's Fairfax, Virginia, campus. That service costs $1.99 per order. 
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is testing its own delivery robot dubbed ""Scout"". 
FedEx rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) is not testing robots - but like FedEx and Amazon, it is experimenting with drone deliveries.
Other tests include tie-ups between grocery seller Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co and self-driving car startup Nuro, as well as DoorDash and General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's Cruise Automation.

AVALON, Australia (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) hopes Britain will decide this year on plans to buy E-7 Wedgetail early warning jets, an executive said, after talks last year sparked a row over competition in arms procurement.
Britain said in October it was in exclusive discussions with Boeing and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) about buying jets to replace its fleet of six aging E-3D Sentry planes without holding a tender. 
It did not give a timeline for the roughly $1 billion deal, but defense trade media reported that it wants the first jet in service by 2022. 
""We hope to have a decision this year,"" Scott Carpendale, Boeing Defence Australia's director of commercial derivative aircraft, told Reuters.
""There are reasons why that is really important in terms of production availability and obviously the sooner they make a decision the sooner we make their aircraft. They are looking for that capability as soon as possible,"" he said at the Australian International Airshow. 
Britain's decision to skip a formal tender, on the grounds that this was the least risky option, angered European rivals Airbus and Saab which had proposed a joint offering. It led to an unusual public rebuke from UK parliamentarians who had pushed for a competition.
It came as Britain prepares to take delivery of its first Boeing P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, also selected without a competition to fill an urgent capability gap. The early-warning and sub-hunting planes are both based on the 737 passenger jet.
In a letter late last year to the British parliament's defense committee, Saab said the Ministry of Defence had ignored an offer of a detailed briefing on the Erieye sensor system that it proposed to place on Airbus A330 planes, indicating a lack of interest in a bid. 
Defence sources said Airbus had also privately complained to the government.
Carpendale said Boeing and other key suppliers had made sure they had room in their schedules to support production and they were providing data on how Australia had operated Wedgetail, but Britain was still going through the approvals process.
Britain's Ministry of Defence did not respond to a request for comment. An RAAF spokesman declined to comment.
Australia, a close ally of Britain, has six Wedgetails in operation and has developed advanced proprietary capabilities that it could potentially share depending on government agreements and U.S. export approvals, Carpendale said.
Early-warning systems like Wedgetail are designed to manage battles from the sky, tracking multiple airborne and maritime targets at the same time. They then use that information to direct other assets like fighter jets and warships.
Australia has deployed Wedgetail in Iraq and Syria.
RAAF Squadron Leader Martin Davies, who previously served on the E-3 in Britain's Royal Air Force, said Wedgetail's E-Scan radar was more advanced than the manual one on the E-3.

Saab has said it offered to ""cloak"" the A330 plane electronically to make it more survivable and has denied that the Airbus jet and Swedish radar involved more procurement risk.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) on Wednesday named half a dozen people to a commercial banking team in Europe and new international and Asia-Pacific regional leaders, as the U.S. bank closes in on business clients it hopes to poach from rivals abroad.
For two years, JPMorgan's commercial banking business has been building a list of around 1,500 middle-market European companies that it wants to attract through its global approach to investment banking, credit, hedging and treasury services.
The targets are companies with between $500 million to $2 billion in annual revenue and international ambitions, including known brands that already use JPMorgan for their U.S. business and companies whose owners are JPMorgan private wealth clients.
""We see a lot of opportunity for local corporations in these markets to grow, and they can benefit from working with a global banking partner,"" Rob Holmes, head of the bank's corporate client banking & specialized industries (CCBSI) group, said in a statement. 
Andrew Kresse was named head of CCBSI international banking. Kresse comes from JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank and he will build local teams to expand commercial banking activity in European and Asia-Pacific markets, where the investment bank already has a foothold. 
Bertrand Cousin was named head of CCBSI Europe and will be based out of Paris, managing bankers in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, France and the UK.

Investing.com - On the surface, there's no reason Papa John's International (NASDAQ:PZZA), the third-largest pizza delivery company, should see its stock rising.
But the shares were up 4% Wednesday afternoon, a day after reporting a 20% decline in fourth-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings of 15 cents a share, down from 65 cents a year ago. The stock's performance was better than that of rivals Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), owner of Pizza Hut.
The reason for the gain seems to be the guidance. The company expects 2019 to be not so bad, with comparable sales in North America falling 1% to 5% from 2018 and international comparable sales flat to up 3%, better than some analysts were hoping for.
Adjusted earnings for the year will be $1 to $1.20, the company projected. Adjusted earnings in 2018 were $1.34, according to the company's earnings report.
In the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings were 15 cents, compared with a forecast of 19 cents from analysts polled by Investing.com and down from 65 cents a year ago. Revenue of about $374 million also missed the Investing.com estimate of $393 million.
Still, the question is if the stock can go on any kind of sustained rally.
It has been parked in the lower $40s this year and is still off about a third from its 52-week high of $64.18. What will make 2019 better (especially in the second half of the year) will be strong promotional efforts throughout the year emphasizing ingredient quality, stronger internal systems and better relations with franchisees, who have struggled with intense competition from other pizza companies, CEO Steve Ritchie said in a conference call.
Ritchie took over as CEO from founder John Schattner last summer.
As important, it negotiated a $200 investment in February from Starboard Value LP, the activist investor, with an option for $50 million more. Starboard's Jeff Smith is now board chairman and, at least for now, the executive suite is stable.
Papa John's struggled for much of 2018 from the fallout after Schattner resigned after he used a racial slur on a conference call. The fallout damaged sales and the company looked to find a buyer. It gave up the effort when it deemed offers too low and, in February, found Starboard willing to invest."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - WeWork is expanding an effort to retain mid-sized businesses which had been leaving the shared office space manager after they grew past the small-company phase, and to catch up with rivals already catering to these clients.
HQ by WeWork, launched in San Francisco and New York in August to provide enhanced services for businesses with 11 to 250 employees, is targeting 11 overseas markets including London and Shanghai and other U.S. hot spots such as Boston and Denver, said executives at WeWork, a unit of The We Company.
The $42 billion New York-based ""unicorn"" in 2010 helped pioneer ""coworking,"" or shared desk-space, with a focus on startups, entrepreneurs and freelancers. WeWork has been losing clients as they grew to more than a dozen or so employees and found that sharing office space no longer suited their needs.
""Those companies were within the platform, but we weren't going out of our way to serve them,"" David Fano, chief growth officer at WeWork, said in an interview. ""Some of the companies were saying, 'Look, we really just want our own space.'""
The new service aims to help fill that gap between WeWork's signature coworking platform and its offering for large companies with more than 1,000 employees. 
""That's our ultimate dream, that companies stay with us for life. From being a single-person start-up to the day that they're Airbnb,"" WeWork's Fano said.
HQ by WeWork marks a departure from its coworking model of shared space as companies seek to build their own identity and environment, a service that Knotel, but few others operating flexible office space, has seized on exclusively.
Flexible office space gained its name from shorter-term leases than landlords typically offer, and their operators build out spaces that have services and are more fashionable.
Minimum leases for HQ by WeWork are two years and companies gain Wi-Fi, IT and audiovisual systems, along with access to WeWork's global network of shared space and conference rooms.
Knotel recently said it has completed more than 2 million square feet of deals in Manhattan, or double that of HQ by WeWork. Industrious, a rival flex-space startup, in January said teams of 20 or more people make up its fastest-growing segment.
The initiative marks a shift where WeWork is no longer seen as taking incremental space from landlords with its coworking model but is competing with them for traditional clients even as they still lease the property owner's space.
About 13 percent of HQ by WeWork members are previous clients. WeWork was unable to say how many potential HQ clients had left its operations.
But WeWork expects the HQ segment to account for some 70,000 of a projected overall membership base of 800,000 by year's end, or double WeWork's 400,000 members in January. A member is any individual working in a WeWork location.
WeWork last year became the largest private leasor of office space in Manhattan and operates almost 100 sites in New York City. WeWork told bond investors in November it was on track to post revenue of $2.3 billion in 2018.
""The marketplace is being disrupted, the most telling sign for that is landlords are starting to bring their own product into the market,"" said Dom Harding, head of Workthere Americas, a new unit of brokerage Savills Plc that provides consulting for companies seeking flexible office space.
Many mainstream real estate companies, such as developer Tishman Speyer, brokerage  CBRE  Group Inc (NYSE:CBRE) and Washington Real Estate Investment Trust, have spawned their own flexible office units to tap the demand for shorter-term leases.
HQ by WeWork has grown to 30 locations with almost 1 million square feet under lease in its two launch cities. The unit expects to have 270 locations open worldwide by the end of 2019 as it also targets office markets in Berlin, Toronto, Amsterdam, Jakarta, Sao Paulo, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas.

""WeWork continues to take bigger bites out of the existing tenant base instead of just pulling people out of coffee shops,"" said Alexander Snyder, senior analyst at real estate-focused CenterSquare Investment Management in Philadelphia.

In a series of tweets to his 25 million followers following charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this week, Musk accused the regulator of failing to read Tesla's annual reports and said its oversight was ""broken"".
Overnight, he changed his display https://twitter.com/elonmusk name and added an elephant tag.
Shares of the company were up nearly 5 percent at $312.15 in afternoon trading on Wednesday, after Musk said Tesla would have ""news"" at 2 p.m. California time on Thursday.
The company, which is deep in debt as it ramps up production of its popular Model 3 sedan, is due to repay a $920 million convertible bond a day later.
Convertible issues give bondholders the right to trade their debt for equity after shares rise over a certain price. Tesla shares are currently about $48 below the $359.87 conversion price.
Tesla had $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of December, according to the company's annual filing.

Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said earlier this month the company could consider making products free of German parts because of Germany's ""moral superelevation"" on arms exports, which was frustrating Britain, France and Spain.
German curbs on arms exports to non-EU or NATO countries have long been a thorn in bilateral co-operation because of the historical objections of the Social Democrats (SPD), junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition.
But in October, Germany decided unilaterally to reject future arms exports licenses to Saudi Arabia over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and to freeze deliveries of already approved equipment. 
Existing deals allow Berlin to stop exports of arms that include German parts.
""We are now designing (the German content) out of the plane,"" said one source familiar with the plans. Navigational lamps used for landing the planes are built in Germany, with the total German content standing at about four percent, the source said.
Airbus has received 208 orders for the military transport from 28 countries, with 166 aircraft in operation worldwide.
A second company source said a review was underway to see if German-sourced parts could be replaced on other Airbus aircraft that have smaller amounts of German content. No further details were immediately available.
But this source said it would be difficult, if not impossible, to redesign the Eurofighter Typhoon, a multinational program that has about a third German content.
Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES), which generates 14 percent of its annual sales from selling Typhoons and other arms to Saudi Arabia, last week warned Germany's freeze on arms exports to Saudi Arabia could hit its financial results.
The German move has delayed British government efforts to finalize a 10 billion pound deal to sell Saudi Arabia 48 new Typhoons. 
Airbus estimates that the export freeze on Saudi Arabia is affecting delivery of equipment and parts worth billions of euros. One French supplier, PME Nicolas Industrie, has already cut jobs as a result, according to French media.
Germany's SPD said this week it wanted to extend the freeze on arms exports to Saudi Arabia beyond the current March 9 deadline, despite pressure by Britain and France not to do so as it could risk costly compensation claims.

Merkel last week declined to say whether the freeze would be extended, but senior conservative lawmakers say they see no immediate progress on loosening the embargo.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The Chinese government is looking to boost its presence in the Brazilian food processing sector and reach agreements on joint food safety controls that would allow for long-term supply deals between the countries, a Chinese official said on Wednesday.
Yang Wanming, who took over as China's ambassador to Brazil roughly two months ago, said in a presentation to businessmen and Sao Paulo state government officials that the Asian nation is also looking into opportunities in the country's infrastructure projects and oil refining sector.
""The two countries should boost trade flows, work to liberalize and facilitate trade, expand two-way access to markets,"" Yang said in the presentation, through a translator. 
""The agricultural sector is an important part of our trade cooperation. China would like to enlarge that cooperation toward processing of agricultural products and intensify cooperation in food safety controls with the aim to build a long-term partnership, where both countries would win,"" he said.
Some Brazilian food processors were bruised by a large food safety probe started in 2017 that investigated the relationship between meatpackers, agriculture ministry officials and laboratories with a mandate to certify the safety of meat products.
The probe, which is still ongoing, alleged that some firms bribed inspectors to keep processing plants running, issue international health certificates, and allow the sale of products in violation of food safety standards.
China has been Brazil's largest trade partner since 2009, a relationship that reached almost $100 billion last year. 
There were signs of possible obstacles to expanding relations during last year's presidential campaign in Brazil, when right-wing candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who won the election, criticized recent acquisitions of Brazilian assets by Chinese companies.
Yang said he has spoken with several ministers in the new administration since he arrived in Brasilia earlier this year, and was well-received.
""All of them expressed interest in boosting our relation. The President himself expressed his will to deepen our relationship, particularly in trade,"" the ambassador said.
He did not provide details of China's plans in food processing or oil refining.
Chinese company CNODC, a subsidiary of China's National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), signed an agreement with Brazil's Petrobras last year to partner on building the Comperj refining complex in Rio de Janeiro.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc on Friday will end a clothing subscription service venture, the retailer said this week, a move toward sharpening its focus on more-profitable apparel sales and exiting lines like major appliances.
In December 2017, the department store chain announced a new service through a partnership with Bombfell.com that offered Penney private label and national men's clothing brands to people who signed up for regular apparel shipments.
Bombfell sends customers five clothing items handpicked by a stylist for them to try on in the comfort of their own home. Penney shoppers then have seven days to decide which items they wanted to buy and which they will send back.
Customers who signed up for the men's subscription service paid a $20 ""styling fee"" with each order that included a ""dedicated personal stylist, free shipping and returns"" and which was applied toward the cost of any clothing they kept. Penney, with $2.65 billion in total net sales last quarter, relied on Bombfell to handle logistics of the arrangement.
Some of Bombfell's current partners include Lucky Brand, Tommy Bahama, Barbour and Johnnie-O.
The end of the partnership was mentioned on the style blog chubstr.com. Representatives for Penney and Bombfell confirmed that the arrangement would end but declined to elaborate.
Bombfell, based in New York and founded in 2011, is similar to Stitch Fix Inc, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN)'s Trunk Club, and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's Prime Wardrobe service, which launched in the U.S. in June and more recently in the UK and Japan.
Through the partnership, Plano, Texas-based Penney became one of many consumer companies to pitch online subscription services. The strategy has not always worked.
When successful, subscriptions and timed shipments can provide retailers with guaranteed revenue and valuable customer data. But analysts said the downside includes high marketing costs and high cancellation rates as consumers get frustrated with the return process.
Penney, struggling to maintain sales as more shoppers move online, recently cut jobs, shut some stores around the country and renovated others as part of a multi-year turnaround plan that sped up under newly installed Chief Executive Officer Jill Soltau.
This month, Penney announced it would stop selling major appliances including fridges and washing machines, and revamp the layout of its stores in a bid to focus on apparel to boost profits. Penney has generated a quarterly profit just three times since 2012 and analysts expect it to report another net loss in the fourth quarter.
The 116-year-old company is struggling with the same problems that sent longtime rival Sears into bankruptcy. Penney's interest coverage ratio, measuring ability to pay interest on its nearly $4.5 billion debt load out of operating income, has been negative in all but one of the past seven years and remained so through the first three quarters of last year.
Both its stock and its bond prices have swooned. JCPenney's share price has collapsed 70 percent in 12 months and briefly sank below $1 a share late last year. It closed at $1.25 on Tuesday.
Its bonds were downgraded twice in the past 12 months by each of the three main credit rating agencies and now stand six notches into junk bond territory. Its longest-dated obligation, a $500 million ""century bond"" issued in 1997 and maturing in 2097, is quoted at 35 cents on the dollar and has lost half its face value in the past year.
The service, Penney's only subscription offering, marketed big and tall clothing, according to a notice ""Team Bombfell"" sent to customers of the big and tall clothing service earlier this month. ""It was great to see firsthand how much the Big & Tall Box provided easy style solutions to so many of our loyal customers,"" said the notice, which Reuters reviewed. Current subscribers can work with their stylists to place orders through Feb. 28.
Trent Kruse, J.C. Penney's head of investor relations, highlighted the success of Penney's overall sales to big and tall men on an earnings call last November. ""Men's apparel outpaced the company comp with particular strength in big and tall, active and seasonal categories,"" Kruse said.
Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, dubbed the big and tall clothing business one of the ""fastest growing"" in retail and valued the category at roughly $25 billion. But, he added, ""neither Penney nor Bombfell really has the size or the scale now to take the partnership forward."" Both companies declined to comment on Flickinger's analysis.
He said both retailers are better off continuing independently, as Bombfell works to develop its technology and Penney focuses on turning around its apparel business among its consumers, who tend to favor in-store shopping as opposed to making online purchases.

416,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 01:06PM ET</span>","MarketPulse: Mylan Bleeds After Q4 Results, Guidance Fall Short","Investing.com - Mylan slumped Wednesday, sending healthcare stocks into the red after the pharma giant delivered earnings and guidance that fell short of estimates.
Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.30 a share, missing estimates from Investing.com for earnings of $1.35 a share. Revenue of $3.08 billion beat estimates of $3.07 billion, but shares fell more than 11%.
The earnings miss was driven by a 16% decline in the drugmaker's North America segment, which accounts for 36% of total sales, on lower volumes and lower prices of biosimilar drugs.
Biosimilar drugs are generic versions of expensive biologic drugs, which treat diseases like cancer, multiple sclerosis and diabetes.
Mylan this month launched its generic version of GlaxoSmithKline's (NYSE:GSK) blockbuster asthma treatment Advair at a price 70% lower than the branded medicine.
Regulators in the U.S. have been calling on drugmakers to speed up the pace of developing biosimilar drugs in hopes that increased competition will lead to lower drug prices.
For 2019, Mylan said it expects revenue in a range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion and adjusted earnings of $3.80 to $4.80. Current consensus expectations were for revenue of $11.87 billion and earnings of $5.02 a share.

419,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 12:53PM ET</span>","Qatar, China, Japan sought 'extras' after Barclays 2008 fundraising: court","By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - Qatari, Chinese and Japanese investors all sought ""extras"" from  Barclays  (LON:BARC) as the British bank raised billions of pounds at the height of the credit crisis in 2008, a landmark London criminal trial heard on Wednesday.
Glenn Leighton, a former Barclays director and a witness for the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) prosecutor, told Southwark Crown Court that these agreements with Qatar, Japan and China were separate from the bank's emergency fundraising in June 2008 but negotiated ""in tandem"".
Former CEO John Varley and some of his most senior former colleagues - Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath - are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation over ""side deals"" struck with Qatar as it raised more than 11 billion pounds ($14 billion) in emergency funding in 2008.
Two capital raisings in June and October 2008 allowed Barclays to avoid a state bailout as markets roiled in the financial crisis over a decade ago.
Prosecutors allege the four defendants misled shareholders and other investors by not disclosing that Barclays paid an extra 322 million pounds to Qatar through so-called ""advisory service agreements"" (ASAs), described as a ""mechanism of paying the Qataris what they wanted"".
The men, the most senior bankers to face a jury trial over credit crisis-era conduct, deny wrongdoing.
Cross-examined by William Boyce, a lawyer for Boath, Leighton agreed that Japan's Sumitomo and China Development Bank sought Memoranda of Understanding to deepen relationships with Barclays after investing in the bank in June 2008.
But such agreements did not lead to preferential prices for any strategic investors during the first of the bank's two emergency fundraisings in 2008, the court heard.
""The Japanese, Chinese, Qataris all wanted extras and the extras were dealt with in different ways without it affecting the level playing field for everyone else,"" said Boyce, taking the court through Leighton's interviews with the SFO and markets regulator in 2014 and 2013.
""That's right,"" Leighton responded.
Leighton, who was responsible for designing spreadsheets to stress test numbers for the June 2008 transaction, said he had understood that the Qataris had to perform their side of the service agreement, designed to open up fresh business opportunities for Barclays in the Middle East.
Leighton told the court that after June capital raising, he traveled to Bahrain to advise an investment fund that had got itself into trouble in the financial crisis and also advised an entity in Kuwait.
""Part of our success in winning these transactions came from the fact that we had our own shareholder (Qatar) pushing for Barclays to be involved in those trades,"" Leighton said.
Boyce put it to Leighton that Barclays' former head of the investment bank, Bob Diamond, had trumpeted the Qatari ASA to investors when unveiling the capital raising on June 25, 2008, saying it would ""sort out our strategy for the whole Middle East"".
""This was broadcasting it as loudly as it could because it was so good for the bank,"" Boyce said, taking Leighton through testimony he has given to investigators.
""That's right,"" Leighton said.
Barclays did not publicly disclose that it paid Qatar a 42 million pound fee under the first ASA in June 2008. Four months later, the bank paid Qatar 280 million pounds in a second ASA, the court has heard previously.
Varley and Jenkins have been charged with two counts each of fraud by false representation over the two fundraisings in 2008. Kalaris and Boath face one charge each over the June fundraising.

The trial continues.

420,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 12:25PM ET</span>","UK banks strong enough to weather no-deal Brexit, says Moody's","By Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's banks would be resilient to a chaotic Brexit, even if this leads to a spike in bad loans that hits their profits, credit rating agency Moody's said.
Lenders' efforts to boost their capital buffers since the financial crisis has put them in a good position to weather any disruption caused by a no-deal Brexit, Moody's said in a report on Wednesday.
""UK banks have comfortable capital positions and robust liquidity buffers following years of intense regulatory pressure to increase both risk-weighted and leverage ratios and to strengthen their liquidity positions,” said Laurie Mayers, Moody’s Associate Managing Director and author of the report.
“Under a no-deal scenario, we expect the sector to remain profitable, albeit weakly so,"" she added.
Lenders have become increasingly nervous at the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union without a divorce deal as the date of departure, currently set for 29 March, approaches.
HSBC, RBS (LON:RBS) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) collectively made provisions of around half a billion pounds in full-year results this month in preparation for any downturn precipitated by Brexit.
Bank bosses have also privately lobbied the government for assistance in dealing with a potential spike in business casualties, if delays in cross-border shipments and payments push businesses under.
Moody's predicts a no-deal Brexit would lead to a sharp economic slowdown, a moderate increase in unemployment and weakness in house prices that would increase credit losses and pressure bank revenues and profits.
But the agency said overall credit conditions would remain resilient.
Moody's verdict echoes comments made by the Bank of England, which gave Britain's banks a clean bill of health in November when it tested the potential impact of a chaotic Brexit on their finances in its latest round of stress tests.
While banks are widely seen as resilient going into Brexit, experts have warned a chaotic departure still poses risks.
Andrew Bailey, chief executive of regulator the Financial Conduct Authority, warned earlier on Wednesday that financial markets are still at risk of disruption if there is a no-deal outcome.

Major banks are still not ready for a no-deal Brexit as they contend with delays in licenses for new European Union businesses, staffing problems and snags redrafting contracts.

NEW YORK (LPC/IFR) - Former Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Janet Yellen warned on Tuesday that America's corporate debt binge could end up sparking a deeper recession when the next downturn hits.
Rock-bottom rates and easy lending standards have allowed US companies to pile on record levels of debt, sparking concern from regulators about the risk the credit markets may pose to the U.S. economy.
When asked about asset bubbles and potential fallout when the current US economic expansion cools down, Yellen singled out high corporate debt levels as a worry, according to a recording obtained by LPC/IFR, divisions of Refinitiv. 
""I have expressed concerns about leveraged lending,"" Yellen said during a keynote discussion that was closed to the press. ""I do think non-financial corporations have run up, really, quite a lot of debt.”
The comments were made during a standing-room only panel at the annual Structured Finance Industry Group conference in Las Vegas.
""What I would worry about is if the economy encounters a downturn, we could see a good deal of corporate distress. If corporations are in distress, they fire workers and cut back on investment spending. And I think that's something that could make the next recession a deeper recession,"" said Yellen, who served as Fed Chair from 2014 to 2018.
A record $923.8 billion of U.S. institutional loans was arranged in 2017 followed by $730.4 billion in 2018, according to LPC data. 
At the same time corporate buyout leverage, the amount of debt a company has compared to its earnings, rose to 6.6 times last year, up from 6.4 times in 2017, while lender protections weakened in the third quarter to a record low, according to Moody’s Investors Service.
When U.S. regulators, including the Fed, updated existing leveraged lending guidance in 2013, apprehensive at the time of deteriorating lending standards, they warned that leverage that exceeds 6.0 times “raises concerns.”
Yellen also sees potential for trouble in how the market reached its current size – the US leveraged loan market now tops $1 trillion.
""I have concerns about the deterioration in lending standards that we have seen,"" Yellen said. ""A large share of it is covenant-lite and some of the explicit ways in which covenants have weakened are a concern to me.""
Covenants are included into credit agreements as protection for lenders and consist of financial limits and conditions.
A spokesperson from the Brookings Institution, where Janet Yellen is a Distinguished Fellow in Residence with the Economics Studies Program, did not return email communications by press time.
CLO GROWTH
While loan defaults remain low – Fitch reported a 1.75 percent rate at the end of 2018 – if loan defaults were to increase in a downturn, that could weigh on Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLO), the largest buyer of U.S. leveraged loans. Issuance in the $585 billion U.S. CLO market, which large US corporations rely on for financing, hit a record $128.1 billion in 2018.
Moody’s is forecasting first-lien loan recoveries to be just 61 percent in the next default cycle, down from the historical average of 77 percent. Second-lien loans may recover just 14 percent.
But Yellen also underscored that unlike the proliferation of toxic mortgage Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) in the run-up to the financial crisis, there is currently less leverage in the system. Potential fallout from future write-downs also would appear to mostly reside outside of the banking system, and thus, have less far-reaching consequences than in the past.
""The holders are not by and large leveraged entities,"" Yellen said.
While US households were at the epicenter of the global financial crisis a decade ago, after easy mortgage lending standards allowed many borrowers to use their homes as automated teller machines, homeowners, this time around, are not keeping Yellen up at night.
“I am not worried about households with respect to leverage and debt,” she said. “Households are in good shape.”
NO COMMENT
Yellen also elaborated on an interview published earlier this week that quoted her challenging President Donald Trump’s grasp on macro-economic policy.
“I doubt that he would even be able to say that the Fed’s goals are maximum employment and price stability, which are the goals that Congress have assigned to the Fed,” Yellen said in an interview with Marketplace.
When asked during the keynote about her response, Yellen said the question was unexpected and that she had answered it honestly.
During the approximately 50 minute discussion, Yellen also stressed that the Fed has done a good job of maintaining its independence over the past decade and staying out of politics.
“I don’t think there has been a lot of pressure. But I am more worried about it now with President Trump’s criticisms of the Fed,” she said.
Current Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that independence and non-political decision-making is the Congressional mandate. The tradition in recent decades had been that Presidents do not comment on the Fed, Yellen said.

“No comment was the stance of President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama,” she said. “That was the way things were during my time.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jonathan Kellner, former chief executive officer of brokerage Instinet, was on Wednesday named CEO of the Members Exchange, a new low-cost electronic bourse being built by a group of financial heavyweights to challenge the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. 
Kellner is the first publicly announced employee of the would-be exchange, known as MEMX, which is backed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp, Citadel Securities, E*TRADE Financial Corp, Fidelity Investments,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), TD Ameritrade, UBS, and Virtu Financial. 
The consortium said in January it was forming MEMX to reduce fixed costs for its members and to increase transparency around how those costs are set. 
""The launching of MEMX, with the backing of a diverse and large cross-section of leading market players, is a transformative development that will drive a more competitive equity trading environment,"" Kellner said in a statement.
Brokers have long complained about what they say are unjustifiably high fees for essential data on stock trades charged by the big three U.S. exchange groups, which control 12 of the 13 U.S. stock exchanges. The incumbents are Intercontinental Exchange Inc, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Inc and Cboe Global Markets Inc. IEX Group runs the only independent U.S. stock exchange and does not charge for market data.
MEMX is expected to be up and running late this year or in early 2020, subject to regulatory approval.
Kellner, an industry veteran, was tapped by cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase in October to build out the firm's institutional crypto-trading offerings. But in January, Coinbase said it had pulled the plug on that effort and that Kellner would not be joining after all. 
Kellner spent more than 11 years at Instinet and previously held key positions at Schwab and Morgan Stanley. Instinet was a part of Reuters from 1987 until its 2001 initial public offering. It is now owned by Nomura Group.

428,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 10:56AM ET</span>","Best Buy shares surge 16 percent on upbeat profit view, robust holiday quarter","By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) -  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) shares surged 16 percent on Wednesday after it gave an upbeat profit forecast for the year and reported better-than-expected holiday-quarter sales.
The company, which cited the frenzy for battle royale game ""Fortnite"" for a boost in sales of gaming gear, also announced an 11 percent boost to its quarterly dividend and a plan to buy back $3 billion of stock. 
Best Buy's report comes after a largely disappointing holiday season for retailers, which have struggled to compete with online sellers such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Best Buy has managed to ward off pressure from Amazon by focusing on customer services that has helped drive both store and online sales. 
Investments in its online business and expansion of services that encourage customers to set up smart homes and provide advice on purchase of televisions and appliances have resonated with consumers and boosted sales.
A $199-per-year ""Total Tech Support"" program launched in May, which includes unlimited support online and in stores, saw 1 million members sign up by the end of the year, the company said.
""We continued to drive efficiencies and reduced cost in order to find investments and offset pressure,"" Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly said on a post-earnings call.
During fiscal 2019, the company achieved $255 million in cost reductions, adding to its fiscal 2021 goal of $600 million in savings.
""The key is that Best Buy has matched its operating expenses with its revenues, has focused on share repurchases, and is managing to grow same-store sales through increases in appliance sales and the offering of value added services,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. 
The company also benefited from the bankruptcy of Sears Holdings Corp and J.C. Penney Co Inc's exit from the appliance business.
Best Buy's domestic online revenue surged 9.3 percent to $2.96 billion in the fourth quarter on a comparable basis.
Domestic comparable sales rose by a better-than-expected 3 percent in the three months ended Feb. 2, with growth across wearables, appliances, smart home and gaming, being partially offset by a decline in sales of mobile phones.
Best Buy forecast fiscal 2020 adjusted profit of $5.45 to $5.65 per share, the mid-point of which was above analysts' expectations of $5.49.
Excluding items, it earned $2.72 per share, while analysts expected $2.57.

Revenue fell 3.7 percent to $14.80 billion, as the year-ago quarter had an extra week, but still came above expectations of $14.70 billion.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) on Wednesday reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings, helped by its acquisitions of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods.
Excluding items, the company earned 77 cents a share in the second quarter ended Jan. 27, beating the average analyst estimate of 70 cents, according to Refinitiv data. Campbell's shares jumped 5 percent in premarket trading.
Net sales rose 24 percent to $2.71 billion, while organic sales were flat. In 2017, Campbell agreed to buy pretzels and Cape Cod chips maker Snyder's-Lance Inc for $4.87 billion, and organic soup maker Pacific Foods for $700 million.
Like other packaged food companies, Campbell has been struggling to attract young, increasingly health-conscious consumers. It has tried to make its portfolio healthier, and launched a cost-cutting and divestment plan in August.
Campbell reported a net quarterly loss, hurt by higher restructuring costs and a $346 million writedown of its troubled fresh food business.
This is the fourth time Camden, New Jersey-based Campbell has written down the value of its fresh unit since September 2016, knocking about $1.35 billion off its value in total. The unit, which was put up for sale in August after a months-long strategic review, includes Bolthouse Farms. The business has struggled in recent years, with issues ranging from farming missteps to the recall of 3.8 million bottles of protein shakes.
Campbell said on Tuesday that it expects to name buyers for Bolthouse and its international business by the end of its fiscal year in July. The company also said it had agreed to sell salsa maker Garden Fresh Gourmet to a unit of Fountain of Health USA, which makes hummus, dips and prepared salads. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Sources told Reuters in December that Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC) and  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ) were among those bidding for Campbell's international business, which includes Australian cookie brand Arnott's and Danish baked snacks maker Kelsen Group.
The net loss attributable to Campbell was $59 million, or 20 cents per share, compared with earnings of $285 million, or 95 cents per share, a year earlier.

Mylan said on Tuesday its lower-than-expected profit outlook was due to rising costs related to marketing and research and development.
It added that product launches should offset revenue declines for existing products this year as prices of generic drugs remain under pressure due to increased competition.
""Even with the approvals and launches of Copaxone, Neulasta and Advair these approvals are only providing some relief, but are not altering the systemic problems inherent with the generic model,"" Cowen & Co analyst Ken Cacciatore said in a report to clients.
Mylan this month launched its generic version of GlaxoSmithKline's blockbuster asthma treatment Advair at a price 70 percent lower than the branded medicine.
Five brokerages cut their 12-month targets on Mylan's share price, and analysts at Cowen & Co were the most negative with a $25 target, a third lower than the median Wall Street price target.
""Clearly spending roughly $15 billion on product and company acquisitions and having flat cash generation over 4-5 years should be alarming,"" Cacciatore said.
Generic drug prices in the United States have been declining as regulators approve more cheaper, copycat drugs, spurring competition and weighing on the profits of generic drug makers like Mylan and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd.
Additionally, manufacturing troubles at Mylan's Morgantown plant in West Virginia is hurting profits.
The market would have to see evidence that the company's increased investments in 2019 are translating to higher revenue before Mylan's stock price recovers, said JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Chriss Schott.
A ""lack of earnings visibility makes it hard to tell if Mylan is still built to last,"" Cantor Fitzgerald analysts said.
Eleven of 16 Wall Street analysts covering Mylan have positive ratings, while five have neutral or ""hold"" ratings, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Mylan shares were last down 9.5 percent at $27.72 in early trade. The stock has fallen nearly 27 percent over the past 12 months.

435,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 08:50AM ET</span>",Volvo's Polestar joins electric car race with rival to Tesla 3,"By Esha Vaish
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Volvo Cars' luxury performance brand Polestar unveiled its first fully electric sedan on Wednesday, opening up online pre-orders for the five-seater fastback at a price and with a driving range to rival Tesla's mass market Model 3.
Sporting signature Polestar gold seat belts, the Polestar 2 will cost about 59,900 euros ($68,100) for its launch edition and can be driven for around 275 miles before it needs recharging - broadly in line with the Model 3's current price in Europe of 58,800 euros and about 260 miles range.
The Model 3 and Polestar 2 are cheaper than most of the electric models launched by traditional premium carmakers so far, as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Polestar bet mass market customers are on the verge of adopting battery technology. Both have also promised even lower prices later on.
Polestar's launch comes as Tesla is trying to ramp up Model 3 sales in Europe and China, where recent government subsidies and programs are boosting the take up of electric vehicles. A cut in subsidies in the United States, in contrast, is dampening demand in the Californian start-up's home market.
Tesla was dealt a setback this month after influential U.S. magazine Consumer Reports withdrew its endorsement for the Model 3, citing reliability problems. Analysts say Polestar has strong engineering as it is built on the Volvo platform.
Polestar's chief executive told Reuters he hoped to sell ""north of"" 50,000 Polestar 2s annually within two or three years after deliveries start from the first half of 2020, but said how much production capacity the company sets up would depend on market conditions.
""If the market develops fine, I don't think the production volume will be the limitation. It depends much more on how the car resonates with the market, how the market develops and how the tariffs develop,"" Thomas Ingenlath said.
Carmakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Mercedes-Benz and BMW are beginning deliveries of premium electric cars unveiled over the past year as they try to muscle in on a market that Tesla has dominated so far.
Securing the electric market has become increasingly important as demand for traditional combustion engine vehicles slows in China and Europe, partly due to tariffs stemming from Washington's trade war with Beijing.
Although electric carmakers have also been affected, with Tesla having adjusted Model 3 prices in China after tariffs, Ingenlath said he expected electric sales to be supported by government subsidies and as the market grows from a low base.
Electric vehicle sales forecasts support this view. 
Made at Polestar's facility in China, the Polestar 2 is the first of five fully electric vehicles that Volvo has promised.
The car, which Polestar hopes to largely offer via a Netflix-style monthly subscription model that covers insurance and maintenance costs, will be initially sold in China, United States, Canada and six European markets. 
Ingenlath said he expected Asia, North America and Europe to each account for roughly a third of sales, though China would be slightly larger.

Volvo, which owns half of Polestar with the rest held by its Chinese parent Geely, said earlier this year it was talking to investors about raising funds to support Polestar's electrification costs. Ingenlath said it was too early to give an update on how that was progressing.

Two weeks after counterparts at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). warned the U.S. was vulnerable to a slowdown elsewhere, economists led by Catherine Mann said there is historically a large correlation of about 70 percent between U.S. growth and the performance of 25 other economies. That’s in part because the U.S. accounts for almost a quarter of global gross domestic product and 10 percent of worldwide trade flows.
The upshot is that a 1 percentage point decline in U.S. expansion would lower the rest of the world’s growth by a similar amount over one year, Citi said. Argentina, Mexico, Taiwan and Canada are deemed the most exposed to a U.S. slump.
The study also discovered that the U.S.’s influence over growth elsewhere has increased since the global financial crisis. The impact of an American slowdown in the quarter after the shock has gone up to about 0.5 percentage point from 0.3 point prior the the turmoil of a decade ago.
This could reflect the fact that the U.S. expansion has been stronger than that of the euro area and perhaps also because of increased capital flows from the U.S. to emerging markets.

The U.S. investment bank flew out a team of senior executives including partner Dina Powell, a veteran of the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, to pitch for the deal, the sources said.
Saudi Aramco did not respond to queries for immediate comment. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
The state oil giant had already picked a group of banks including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Citi, HSBC and Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank to help with the financing, Reuters reported on Feb. 14. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were appointed joint global coordinators and, together with the other banks, joint bookrunners.
Aramco, the world’s top oil producer, plans to issue its first international bonds, likely worth about $10 billion, in the second quarter of 2019, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said last month.
Sources previously told Reuters it could borrow as much as $50 billion from international investors to fund the purchase of all, or nearly all, of the 70 percent stake in SABIC held by the Public Investment Fund, the kingdom’s top sovereign wealth fund.
Goldman Sachs has won a slew of mandates in the kingdom recently, including one to advise Riyad bank on merger talks with National Commercial Bank.

It also advised Abu Dhabi's state oil firm ADNOC on the sale of a stake in its refining unit.

The two companies filed a joint motion to a U.S. appeals court on Tuesday to pause court proceedings over their intellectual property disputes because they have entered into a settlement agreement on February 25. 
The world's two largest makers of Android smartphones have been fighting in courts in the United States and in China since 2016, with Huawei alleging that Samsung had used its cellular communications technology without authorization and has unreasonably delayed entering into a licensing agreement. 
Samsung had denied the allegations and accused Huawei of seeking ""grossly"" inflated licensing fees, countersuing Huawei in the United States.
The joint filing on Tuesday did not give a reason for their intended settlement. It asked for a 30-day stay after which the two companies expect to finalize a settlement where Huawei would drop an appeal request. The case was originally set to go to trial in September.
Huawei and Samsung did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In January 2018, a Shenzhen court outpaced a federal court in San Francisco, ruling for Huawei and issuing an order blocking Samsung’s Chinese affiliates from manufacturing and selling 4G LTE smartphones in China. A judge hearing the parallel U.S. case in April ordered Huawei not to enforce the Shenzhen court’s ban.

443,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 07:20AM ET</span>",U.K. Approved to Rejoin $1.7 Trillion WTO Procurement Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- The United Kingdom won approval to remain in a key World Trade Organization agreement that governs $1.7 trillion worth of annual public procurement opportunities.
A group of 46 nations, including the U.S. and Japan, agreed on Wednesday to let Britain stay in the Government Procurement Agreement, according to a WTO statement.
Maintaining membership ensures that U.K.-based contractors will retain their preferential access to foreign public procurement opportunities if Britain leaves the European Union without a withdrawal accord. It also ensures that the GPA’s signatories will continue to have access to the U.K.’s 67 billion-pound ($89 billion) public procurement marketplace in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
“The agreement is another huge step in the U.K. establishing itself as an independent WTO member, continuing to bang the drum for free trade and U.K. business,” British International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said in a statement on Twitter.
More Transparent
The purpose of the GPA is to open up, in a reciprocal manner, government procurement markets to foreign competition, and to help make public purchasing more transparent.
The U.K. currently participates in the GPA via the EU; Britain never independently ratified the agreement and must now rejoin as a member in its own right in order to ensure continuity following its planned departure from the bloc. The U.K.’s offer replicates its current GPA commitments as an EU member and does not increase or decrease access to its public procurement marketplace.
The agreement will now be laid before the U.K. Parliament for 21 sitting days to provide the opportunity to raise any objections to the accord. There is no indication that any members of Parliament intend to object to the deal.
The U.K.’s accession to the GPA will take effect 30 days after the U.K. government submits its instrument of acceptance to the WTO.
Regardless of Wednesday’s approval, the U.K. will remain a member of the GPA under its current terms if the British government approves a withdrawal agreement or extends its negotiations with the EU beyond the scheduled Brexit date of March 29.
Brexit Continuity
The decision marks a positive development in the U.K.’s effort to become an independent member of the WTO in preparation for its exit from the European trading bloc.
In October, several countries including the U.S., New Zealand and Moldova objected to the U.K.’s offer to rejoin the GPA because they said it was outdated and should include further concessions, like increased access to U.K. visas. The situation threatened to blow up the U.K.’s post-Brexit access to the $1.7 trillion deal since each member has a veto.
On Wednesday, the GPA parties acted ""rationally and pragmatically,"" said Julian Braithwaite, the U.K.’s ambassador to the WTO. ""The economic interest in providing continuity outweighed all the interests that have been raised that could have blocked our accession,"" Braithwaite told Bloomberg in a telephone interview.
The U.S. ambassador to the WTO, Dennis Shea, said that ""keeping the U.K. in the GPA is very important for this agreement"" and noted that the U.K. accounts for over a quarter of the EU’s total procurement covered by the GPA, according to a statement.
As part of Wednesday’s agreement, the U.K. will renegotiate certain aspects of its GPA membership over the next three months in order to account for certain government entities that did not exist before Brexit -- like the Department for International Trade.
Braithwaite said Britain won’t liberalize its current public procurement commitments, which restrict foreign access to the U.K. rail system and the National Health Service.
""We won’t change our market access,"" Braithwaite told Bloomberg. The U.K. is ""already the most open and liberal European economy in the GPA.""

446,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 06:45AM ET</span>",Ubben's socially conscious ValueAct Spring Fund bets on workplace wonk,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jeffrey Ubben's ValueAct Spring Fund, which invests in companies aiming to address environmental and social problems, is making a bet on an academic-turned-hedge-fund-manager who picks stocks based on how effective companies are as employers.
The Spring Fund is buying a stake in Irrational Capital, a hedge fund launched three years ago by Duke University behavioral economist Dan Ariely and his business partner David van Adelsberg. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
It is an unusual move for a hedge fund to back a smaller rival. But ValueAct, the $15 billion fund that last year launched the $350 million Spring Fund, is familiar with such an arrangement. It sold a stake in itself to Affiliated Managers Group (NYSE:AMG) more than a decade ago.
So far Spring Fund has mainly bought stakes in publicly listed companies, including power utility Hawaii Electric Industries Inc and gene-editing company Horizon Discovery Group Plc. 
""Dan (Ariely's) work makes the case for connecting positive workforce culture to performance,"" Ubben said in an interview. He met the economist seven years ago through a connection at Duke University, where Ubben earned his undergraduate degree.
Ariely and Van Adelsberg have come up with a system to measure employee engagement, pride in their work and sense of purpose across the corporate world. Their data is funneled into a computer that churns out rankings of companies that Irrational Capital then invests in. 
Irrational Capital has so far gathered information on over 1,000 companies through ""any type of data we can get our hands on,"" Ariely said, adding this includes 350 companies with market capitalizations of more then $1 billion. Ariely declined to name the companies, and Ubben said he doesn't need to know Ariely's picks.
""We don't intervene in what the data show by saying something like this company scores highly but we don't like the CEO. We are true to the data,"" Ariely said in an interview.
Ariely, a 51-year old professor, researcher and author, views himself as an expert in understanding human behavior. He spent time in the hospital as a teenager recovering from burns received when a flare exploded during a celebration and said the opportunity to observe nurses at work built his skill.
Meanwhile, Ubben, 57, is fast becoming one of Wall Street's biggest critics of corporate America's short-termism. He is now trying to convince investors that positive workplace culture can drive above-average returns.
OPERATIONAL CHANGES
For nearly two decades, Ubben has staked a claim to bringing a long-term approach to activist investing. His playbook does not usually call for a fast return of capital to shareholders or a quick flip of a company to a seller.
Instead, ValueAct prefers to push for operational changes at companies such as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) from behind the scenes. Two years ago, Ubben handed the chief investment officer role at ValueAct to Mason Morfit, but he remains the firm's CEO and runs the Spring Fund.
Over ValueAct's lifetime, the main fund has returned an average of nearly 15 percent a year, an investor said. Ubben declined to say how the new fund has done, citing regulations.
Pushing back against corporate greed has galvanized public opinion and politicians alike, and Ubben wants to convince mainstream investors that committing resources to employees' well-being will not short-change shareholders.
""These hedge fund managers write letters and dictate what should be done by management and then they get their buddies to buy the stock and help hijack the company,"" Ubben said of some of his competitors, declining to name them.
Ubben said he was particularly irked when Aramark Inc, the food services and facilities company he recently invested in, was punished by analysts for doing good. Management returned the roughly $100 million windfall the company received through the tax system overhaul to employees in the form of higher wages and by boosting the match to their retirement savings, Ubben said. But  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) downgraded its rating to neutral from buy, citing growing labor pressures in the sector.
Aramark did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Data from Gallup Inc, known for its public opinion polls, also showed that organizations that are best in engaging their employees deliver earnings per share growth that is more than four times that of their competitors.

""This is the last mile and this is the hardest thing,"" Ubben said of Irrational Capital. ""We want to spread the word and introduce the concept and grow it so that a lot of people will invest in it.""

Lowe’s reported earnings per share of $0.80 on revenue of $15.65 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected EPS of $0.79 on revenue of $15.75 billion.
The numbers from the second largest home improvement retailer followed disappointing earnings released Tuesday by rival  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), but Marvin Ellison, Lowe's president and chief executive officer, maintained that “U.S. macroeconomic fundamentals remain sound for 2019”.
The stalled housing market has some investors wondering if home improvement projects will also decline, hitting bottom lines.
Builders have slowed housing starts as high real estate prices hit affordability, reducing the number of would-be buyers. The number of homes being built in the U.S. plunged to its lowest level in two years, according to data for December recently released by the Commerce Department.
Home builder confidence also fell to a three-and-a-half year low in December due to higher mortgage rates caused by last year’s policy tightening by the  Federal Reserve.
Ellison tried to waylay these concerns in the press release: “Most of the intense work over the past six months to transform our company has been in preparation for an improved spring season and fiscal 2019,” he said.

450,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 05:55AM ET</span>","Bayer reaps profit lift from Monsanto seeds, consumer health","By Ludwig Burger
LEVERKUSEN, Germany (Reuters) - Bayer's $63 billion purchase of U.S. seeds maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) made its mark on the German company's fourth quarter earnings on Wednesday, lifting profit and boding well for the peak season of its enlarged agriculture business.
However, mounting litigation risks related to Monsanto still cast a pall over an adjusted core earnings rise of 15.8 percent, which was inflated by the addition of the U.S. group and helped by cost cuts at Bayer's consumer healthcare business.
The pharmaceuticals and farming pesticides firm said adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was 2.07 billion euros ($2.4 billion), beating a 2 billion euro average analyst forecast.
Analysts said this showed early signs of recovery after years of weakness in demand and was also partly due to transitional service payments from BASF, which had acquired some of Bayer's agriculture business under a deal that helped it get antitrust approval for the Monsanto acquisition.
Bayer's shares were up 4.3 percent to 69.34 euros at 0937 GMT, the best performer on Germany's DAX index.
""A starting recovery at Bayer’s agrochemicals and seeds (after 5 years of a downturn) could be ... a significant share price trigger,"" Baader Helvea analyst Markus Mayer said.
The positive result from Bayer (DE:BAYGN) appeared to conflict with rival Syngenta which has called agricultural market conditions challenging.
However at Bayer, previously announced write-downs on the value of consumer health brands and one-off charges from the closure of a German haemophilia drug plant led to an overall quarterly net loss of 3.9 billion euros.
Adjusted EBITDA at its non-prescription consumer products unit, which plans to shed the Coppertone sunscreen and Dr. Scholl's footcare brands, rose 11 percent to 279 million euros in the quarter, on 4.9 percent lower sales, as it cut costs.
Meanwhile, litigation risks are piling up with the number of plaintiffs claiming damages over the alleged role of Monsanto's popular weedkiller Roundup in causing cancer jumping to 11,200 from 9,300, Bayer's results statement showed.
""The sword of Damocles continues to hang over Bayer,"" Bryan Garnier analyst Jean-Jacques Le Fur said.
Bayer, which says scientists and regulators across the globe have found Roundup to be safe, faces a second U.S. jury, following an initial verdict in California state court that was reduced to $78 million in damages.
Bayer, which wrapped up the Monsanto purchase in June, has not yet been able to show its pulling power as about 80 percent of its earnings are generated during the January-to-June period.

Adjusted EBITDA of the enlarged agriculture division jumped 79 percent to a better-than-expected 543 million euros.

452,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2019 05:35AM ET</span>",Investor Cerberus open to Deutsche Bank merger with Commerzbank: source,"By Hans Seidenstuecker and Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. investor Cerberus, a major shareholder in both  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), is open to a merger between Germany's two biggest lenders, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, raising the chances of a tie-up.
Speculation of a merger has heightened under the tenure of Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who has spoken in favor of strong banks. Both banks have been slow to return to sustainable profitability since the global financial crisis.
""Cerberus wouldn't stand in the way of a merger,"" said the person familiar with the thinking of the U.S. buyout firm. 
Cerberus holds 3 percent of Deutsche Bank shares and 5 percent of Commerzbank shares, and was previously opposed to a merger, German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on Tuesday.
The buyout firm believes there is still room in Germany for two big banks but that it is an open question whether both can turn around their businesses on their own, the person said.
Cerberus hasn't yet decided on the need for a merger, the person added.
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank declined to comment.
Based on Tuesday's closing prices, a combination of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank would have an equity market value of almost 25 billion euros ($28 billion). 
Deutsche Bank has more than 20 million personal and business customers, and Commerzbank around 18 million. 
Cerberus is among the largest shareholders in both banks after buying stakes in 2017. Since its purchase, shares in Deutsche Bank have fallen 51 percent, while those of Commerzbank have lost 39 percent of their value.
Midmorning in Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank shares were 0.6 percent lower, while Commerzbank was flat.
Cerberus is the second-largest investor in Commerzbank after the German government, which holds a stake of more than 15 percent after a state bailout.
Finance Minister Scholz's team has met frequently with executives of Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank and major shareholders, including Cerberus. 
A merger between the two banks has appeared more likely since last month when two people with the knowledge of the matter said time was running out for Deutsche Bank to turn itself around on its own.
Both banks are in the process of restructuring, and executives at both lenders say privately they would prefer to remain independent to carry out those plans.
Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing, who took the helm last year in a sudden management shake-up, has repeatedly said in public that he is focused on the bank's ""homework"" - returning the bank to profitability. 

He announced job cuts last year and moved to slim down the sprawling investment bank division. The bank posted a profit in 2018 for the first time in four years.

The Netherlands purchased a 13 percent holding, a move aimed at gaining parity with influential shareholder France following a power clash that left the Dutch side of the partnership weakened. The stock dropped as much as 15 percent in Paris, the most since 2002, when it was just Air France. The current company was created two years later when the French flag carrier merged with its smaller Dutch counterpart.
“The Dutch stake does not make us more positive,” Bernstein analysts including Daniel Roeska said in note Wednesday. “We worry that national, diverging interests will slow the group down in its much-needed restructuring.”
KLM and Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam are of great importance to the economy and employment, Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra told reporters late Tuesday after announcing the investment. He said the government was concerned that decisions on KLM’s strategy more frequently were being made at the level of Air France-KLM’s Paris-based holding company.
“There was simply too little influence from the state in KLM to be able to look after the Dutch public interest well, and to make a success of KLM,” Hoekstra said. “This step shows our long-term commitment to the entire company.”
The shares traded 12 percent lower at 11.24 euros at 11:13 a.m. in Paris, giving Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) a market value of 4.82 billion euros ($5.5 billion).
New Twist
The move reignites tensions between the French and Dutch arms of Air France-KLM, just as pressure was easing from a crisis that threatened the job of KLM boss Pieter Elbers. The Dutch head stayed, but Smith gained a seat on KLM’s supervisory board and won a more streamlined power structure that sidelined some of the cumbersome committees that slowed decision making but ensured the Dutch side had some parity.
Hoekstra said the Dutch government, which held a 5.9 percent in the local KLM unit before the recent transactions, wants to reach parity with France, which holds a 14 percent stake in the holding company and as a long-term investor has extra voting rights that give it 23 percent of the vote.
The Netherlands’ group-level stake, which cost 680 million euros, will put the state in a position to ask for board seats at the next general meeting. It won’t qualify for extra voting rights for two years.
Air France-KLM’s board and the French government weren’t informed of the Dutch purchase in advance, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Les Echos on Tuesday. He said he reaffirmed his support for Air France-KLM management and said it is “essential to respect the principles of good government” without national interference.
Dutch Revolt
The threat of Elbers’ departure had triggered an outpouring of support in the Netherlands, where Hoekstra touted his achievements and hundreds of KLM employees demonstrated outside the headquarters to defend their boss. KLM went as far as hiring a public affairs adviser in Paris and launching the #BlueStormRising hashtag to support Elbers. Although Smith -- a Canadian brought in to ease strife among labor and the various stakeholders -- eventually decided to renew Elbers’ mandate, the tensions deepened the rift between the two partners.
Air France and KLM have been operating semi-independently since their merger through a complex arrangement that was meant to guarantee the Dutch government would keep a say in the companies and KLM would keep jobs and business in Amsterdam.
Smith, who took over in September after Elbers refused the job, has made clear he wants the units to operate more like a single company, a move that has been met with resistance from KLM managers and unions who say they fear Air France’s lower profits will drag down their company.
Emerging Nationalism
European governments have intervened more frequently recently in the affairs of major businesses -- countering a 40-year trend toward privatization -- in an effort to protect local champions and respond to the increasingly nationalistic trade policies of the world’s dominant economies, China and the U.S.
The French and German governments lobbied hard to save the rail merger of  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) SA and Siemens AG’s train unit, which was blocked by the EU. Germany is also looking to orchestrate a merger to keep  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) out of foreign hands, and France is looking to delist nuclear power company Electricite de France SA (PA:EDF). In Italy, the government is increasing its stake in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) SpA and bankrupt airline Alitalia.
For French President Emmanuel Macron, this is the second instance of an unexpected and not-so-friendly move on a French state-held company, after  Renault  (PA:RENA) leader Carlos Ghosn’s arrest in November in Japan. The French president, who has had a rocky start in his relationship with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, is discovering that another European leader can make a move straight out of the dirigiste playbook of Old France, sharpened into an art form by Louis XIV’s finance minster Jean-Baptiste Colbert in the 1600s.
“The Dutch state seems to be implementing the same methods as the French,” said Philippe Waechter, chief economist at Ostrum Asset Management. “The perception of this all is that there is no choice to have an influence over what is seen as strategic assets but to own parts or all of these assets.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European stock markets opened lower on Wednesday after fresh hostilities erupted between India and Pakistan, causing Asian assets to fall and pushing investors into safe havens such as the yen.
After about an hour of trading, the pan-European STOXX 600 was down about 0.5 percent. All the main regional indexes were in the red. (EU) U.S. stock futures for the S&P 500 were down 0.1 percent.
Earlier, Pakistan said it had carried out air strikes in Indian-controlled Kashmir and shot down two Indian jets in its own airspace.
Indian and Pakistan bonds and currencies fell and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was last down 0.15 percent as the threat of conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbors grew. 
""This adds another layer of risks for investors"", said Charles St-Arnaud, a strategist at Lombard Odier, although he noted the market moves remained limited for now. 
Markets were watching the U.S.-North Korean summit, which begins in Hanoi later on Wednesday. U.S. President Donald Trump will meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for their second summit, with the United States pushing North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons program.
The heightened geopolitical risks helped assets considered safer than stocks, such as the Japanese yen, which gained against the dollar. 
The dollar itself hovered around a three-week lows after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated on Tuesday the Fed had shifted to a more ""patient"" policy approach regarding changes to interest rates.
""We didn't learn much new,"" St-Arnaud said. The new dovish stance of U.S. monetary policy had not weakened the dollar much, notably against the euro. 
Also in the currency market, the British pound continued to rise after Prime Minister Theresa May offered lawmakers a chance to vote on delaying Brexit.
Sterling last traded at $1.3274, having risen to $1.3288 on Tuesday, its highest levels in five months. 
Oil prices rose after a report that U.S. crude inventories had declined and as producer club OPEC seemed to stick to its supply cuts despite pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.
International Brent crude futures LCOc1 were at $65.32 per barrel, up 0.11 cents, or 0.21 percent from their last close.

Gold was down 0.17 percent at $1,326.24.

The deal, reached late on Tuesday and which confirms an agreement in January by EU states, will boost the European Commission's powers in overseeing foreign financial firms operating in the EU, giving Brussels more clout over London-based financial firms after Britain leaves the EU.
The overhaul also imposes stricter liquidity and capital requirements to large EU investment firms, tightening an initial proposal put forward by the European Commission in December 2017.
""The agreement further strengthens the equivalence regime that would apply to third country investment firms,"" the EU said in a statement, adding more powers would be given to the Commission to assess whether foreign rules are compatible with EU regulations.
More than half of the 6,000 European investment firms, including U.S. giants Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), have their EU headquarters in Britain, although many have started setting up continental subsidiaries to ensure they can continue to serve clients after Brexit.
Under the new rules, that require a final rubber stamp by the European Parliament and the EU Council, the Commission would assess whether foreign investment firms operate as banks. In that case they would be subject to stricter conditions, especially if they are deemed ""of systemic importance"".
The agreement ""levels the playing field between the largest investment firms and the largest banks; they will follow the same rules,"" the Commission's vice-president in charge of investment and growth, Jyrki Katainen, said in a statement. 
Under the reform, EU legislators also agreed to halve a threshold for the automatic application of the strictest capital and liquidity rules for EU-based firms, which the Commission had initially proposed would only apply to financial companies with assets above 30 billion euros.
As a result, investment firms with assets of 15 billion euros ($17 billion) or more would automatically be subject to the same requirements as large banks, while firms with assets between 5 and 15 billion euros could face lighter requirements unless their activities are seen to pose risks to financial stability, an EU statement said.
Other smaller firms would face a lighter prudential regime.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.6 percent at 0857 GMT, snapping three days of gains after hitting its highest level since the beginning of October a day earlier. All continental bourses were in the red.
The export-heavy FTSE 100 lagged the broader market as sterling lingered near five-month highs against the dollar amid fresh hopes that a no-deal Brexit could be avoided.
There was little macro news to drive the markets, investors awaiting fresh news on China-U.S. trade talks, although sentiment was rattled by growing tensions between India and Pakistan. 
The overall mood was gloomy. Healthcare was the only sector in positive territory in early deals, with travel, leisure, chemicals and retail notching up the biggest losses.
Among individual moves, shares in Air France KLM were on track for their worst day in more than a decade after the Dutch government said it would take a 14-percent stake in the airline, highlighting tensions between the Netherlands and its French partners in the company.
Investors also punished Beiersdorf, which plunged to two-year lows, after the Nivea skin cream maker warned its operating margins would fall this year, with the company's new CEO declaring the consumer goods industry is ""turmoil"".
 Unilever  (LON:ULVR), Henkel and Reckitt Benckiser were all dragged lower with it.
British retailer Marks & Spencer plunged 9 percent after announcing it will finance its $1 billion food delivery tie-up with Ocado (LON:OCDO) by issuing shares and cutting its dividend. In contrast, Ocado bounced to the top of the FTSE 100, as the companies outlined details of the deal.
Bayer (DE:BAYGN) was a bright spot, rising 3.4 percent after delivering better-than-expected results boosted by its recent  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) acquisition.

The small up-tick in the earnings-estimates chart for emerging markets is the strongest sign in 13 months that analysts are turning bullish on corporate performance.
The average forecast for profit at companies in the MSCI Emerging Market Index rose for a seventh day, the longest streak since January 2018. That means analysts, who had cut their projections by 10 percent in as many months, are finally letting go of their pessimism and joining investors to wager on a growth revival in developing nations.
Investors started returning to emerging-market stocks at the end of October as valuations that fell to the lowest level since March 2014 became too cheap to ignore. In the following months, optimism that a trade war between the U.S. and China would end with an agreement boosted risk appetite, sending the benchmark index 14 percent higher from its bear-market low.
Yet, analysts continued to cut profit forecasts amid a collapse in China’s exports and downgrades of global economic growth estimates by the International Monetary Fund, even as the stocks gauge rallied 10 percent this year.
This led to the narrowest gap since 2014 between equity valuations based on trailing 12-month profits and those based on estimates for the year ahead. Such a squeeze in the spread had sparked stock gains in the past, underscoring that analysts lag behind investors in betting on trend reversals.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Ahold Delhaize, which operates supermarkets in Europe and the United States, is on track to meet a 20 percent U.S. online sales growth target this year as it opens automated grocery distribution points along the East Coast, its chief executive said on Wednesday.
Frans Muller, promoted to the top job last July, said in an interview that Ahold, which makes roughly two-thirds of its sales in the United States, plans to open several more of the automated hubs in 2019.
The comments came after Ahold said on Wednesday that group net consumer online sales rose 25 percent to 1.1 billion euros in the fourth quarter at constant exchange rates.
In the Netherlands, where it also operates the non-food Bol.com retailer, Ahold saw strong online sales growth of 28 percent. In the U.S., online sales rose 12 percent at constant exchange rates to 203 million euros in the three months through Dec. 31.
Overall, Ahold said its core earnings rose 9.5 percent in the fourth quarter, bolstered by strong online sales growth, meeting market expectations.
Muller has said the company hopes to make acquisitions to meet targets of 20 percent online U.S. sales growth in 2019 and 30 percent in 2020.
""We are on track for 2019 to make our 20 percent. That's all planned for and I am excited about reaching 30 percent,"" Muller told Reuters. ""I think the market is there.""
Speaking about acquisitions, Muller said, ""we see more opportunities in the U.S. The market is consolidating. We have a strong base and strong brands along the East Coast.""
In November, Ahold announced plans to roll out small, automated warehouses to increase order picking and cut delivery times, part of a revamp of its ecommerce business to help fight competitors like Kroger (NYSE:KR), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
Muller said several new centers will be opened this year, with a higher number in 2020, but gave no specific number.
Ahold's underlying income increased to 691 million euros ($786 million) in the three months through Dec. 31, in line with forecasts. Ahold shares slipped 1.8 percent by 0835 GMT.
Ahold, which operates the 'Stop & Shop' and 'Food Lion' chains in the United States, confirmed its 2019 target of 750 million euros in gross synergies from the merger with Delhaize.

A growing dispute between the two has complicated efforts to revamp South Korea's No.2 conglomerate and pave the way for the group's executive vice-chairman, Euisun Chung, to take over as group chairman from his 80-year-old father Mong-Koo Chung.
Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Mobis, under pressure to address excess cash and governance structures, on Tuesday rejected Elliott's demands for a combined 7 trillion won ($6.3 billion) dividend payout, well above the companies' proposed payouts of nearly 1 trillion won.
The companies also rejected Elliot's call for new board and audit members. Investors of Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Mobis will decide which proposals to support at their respective general shareholders meetings on March 22.
Elliott, in an open letter released on Wednesday, urged Hyundai Mobis shareholders to vote for its proposals.
""We are ... asking today for all shareholders to support these landmark resolutions, which are designed to both transform governance and right-size the company's overcapitalized balance sheet,"" Elliott's letter to Hyundai Mobis shareholders says. 
Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Mobis shares finished up 5.3 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively, on Wednesday as investors licked their lips at the prospect of higher returns and a favorable restructuring plan due to Elliott's pressure.
""We expect a vote showdown at the upcoming meeting, which will create a favorable environment for minority shareholders,"" Chung Yong-jin, an analyst with Shinhan Investment and Securities, said.
Elliott had proposed a 2018 dividend of 4.5 trillion won for Hyundai Motor and 2.5 trillion won for auto parts supplier Hyundai Mobis, but the companies rejected the proposals, saying the plans would undermine their future competitiveness.
Hyundai Motor said on Wednesday it plans to boost the core automotive businesses' operating profit margin to 7 percent by 2022 from 2.1 percent in 2018, and announced 45.3 trillion won investment plan over the next five years. [S6N1US00Y]
Opposition from Elliott led Hyundai to drop an attempt to overhaul its ownership structure last year. Euisun Chung pledged in January to complete a restructuring expected to pave the way for him to take the reins of the group. 
The group is likely to come up with a revised restructuring plan that is expected to be put to a vote at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting in April or May, experts have said.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Harry Potter and Star Wars building sets helped Lego return to growth in 2018, along with strong sales in China, where the privately-owned Danish toymaker plans to open new stores.
Sales at Lego, known around the world for its colorful plastic bricks, dropped for the first time in a decade in 2017, but it ended 2018 stronger after gaining market share.
A Lego version of the Star Wars Millennium Falcon space ship was last year's best seller, while four Harry Potter-themed Lego sets were among the firm's top-10.
Lego, which competes with toymakers such as Barbie maker  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT) and Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS), said on Wednesday that global sales rose by 3 percent last year, while total revenue rose 4 percent to 36.4 billion Danish crowns ($5.5 billion).
""We had aimed to stabilize the business in 2018, but have actually returned to moderate growth on all parameters in a very tough environment,"" chief executive Niels B. Christiansen said as operating profit grew by 4 percent to 10.8 billion crowns.
Efforts to combine physical bricks with the digital world, including programming a Lego set to move and augmented reality, had also paid off in 2018, Christiansen told Reuters..
While Lego's sales increased in all key markets, China was most notable with strong double-digit growth, while the United States and Western Europe returned low-single digit growth.
In China, which still accounts for less than 10 percent of sales, the toymaker plans to more than double the number of stores to 140 this year.
""Right now we're not really limited by how private consumption is developing in China. It's more our ability to develop our brand and expand to more Chinese cities that's driving growth,"" Christiansen said.
While online and e-commerce sales continued to grow at the expense of physical stores, Christiansen said these remained key in order to expand the brand's presence in new markets and give children ""that magic experience"".
Lego, which has no shops in India but sells via third party stores, has begun a push into the Middle East and North Africa.
""India is the next big journey for us. It begins now and over the coming three years we'll begin to invest heavily in India,"" Christiansen said.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnamese carriers VietJet and Bamboo Airways formally announced on Wednesday deals with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co to buy 110 planes worth more than $15 billion as the fast-growing companies look to expand their operations in Asia and beyond.
On the sidelines of a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi, VietJet showcased a recent order to purchase 100 737 MAX planes worth $12.7 billion. The deal was provisionally announced in July 2018 and firmed up later that year, without a public announcement until now.
Boeing said the VietJet purchase, which was previously on its order books as an unidentified order, took the Vietnamese carrier's MAX orders to 200 jets and included 80 of its latest 737 MAX 10 model.
VietJet CEO Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao told Reuters the first four aircraft ordered as part of a previous 100-plane deal, announced in 2016 when President Barack Obama visited Vietnam, would be delivered later this year.
Bamboo announced a firm deal with Boeing to purchase 10 wide-bodied 787 planes worth $2.9 billion. Boeing said this deal too was already on its order book as an undisclosed customer.
Bamboo, owned by property and leisure company FLC Group, is also in talks to buy 25 narrow-bodied Boeing 737 planes, Chairman Trinh Van Quyet told Reuters.
Bamboo, which made its first flights in January, had placed a provisional order last year for 20 Boeing 787 widebody jets worth $5.6 billion at list prices, and Wednesday's deal is not part of that.
""The purchases are part of our strategy to expand our operations on the international market, including flying to the United States and Europe,"" Quyet said. 
Bamboo plans to launch its first international flights in second quarter this year, with initial destinations in Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Singapore, he added, ahead of non-stop flights to the United States late this year or early next. 
Earlier this month, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration declared Vietnam complied with international aviation standards, allowing Vietnamese carriers to fly to the United States for the first time and codeshare with U.S. airlines.
VietJet also finalised a $5.3 billion long-term engine support agreement with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) for the LEAP-1B engines in its fleet. 
The White House put the total value of the deals at more than $21 billion.
""These deals will support more than 83,000 American jobs and provide increased safety and reliability for Vietnamese International travelers,"" a senior White House official said.
Trump and Kim Jong Un meet in Hanoi on Wednesday for their second summit, with Trump holding out Vietnam as a model of economic success that isolated North Korea could follow.
Trump hailed the Boeing deals at a lunch with Vietnamese officials.
""We appreciate very much that you're reducing the trade deficit with the United States, which was very substantial before I got here, and now where we're bringing it down with great orders like the orders that you made today,"" Trump said.

Vietnam ran a trade surplus of $34.8 billion with the United States last year, widening from a surplus of $32.2 billion a year earlier, according to Vietnamese customs data.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - An internal investigation by  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) PLC into Huawei Technologies' connections to a suspected front company in Iran found that the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker maintained close financial ties to the firm years after purportedly selling the unit, documents reviewed by Reuters show.
The HSBC probe of Huawei came in late 2016 and 2017 as the bank was trying to get the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to dismiss criminal charges for the bank's own misconduct involving U.S. sanctions.
The bank's findings, which have not been made public, were given in a series of presentations in 2017 to the DOJ. The department used them to help bring its current criminal case against Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou.
She is accused of conspiring to defraud HSBC and other banks by misrepresenting Huawei's relationship with the suspected front company, Skycom Tech Co Ltd. Huawei has said Skycom was a local business partner in Iran, while the United States maintains it was an unofficial subsidiary used to conceal Huawei's Iran business. Huawei and Skycom are also defendants in the U.S. case, accused of bank and wire fraud, as well as violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.
U.S. authorities allege Huawei used Skycom to obtain embargoed U.S. goods and technology in Iran and to move money out of the country via the international banking system. As a result of Huawei's deception, U.S. authorities allege, HSBC and other banks cleared more than $100 million of transactions related to Skycom through the United States that potentially violated economic sanctions Washington had in place at the time against doing business with Iran.
Huawei declined to comment for this story. The company has denied the charges in the case.
Robert Sherman, a spokesman for HSBC, said, ""Information provided by HSBC to the Justice Department was provided pursuant to formal demand, including grand jury subpoena or other obligation to provide information pursuant to a Deferred Prosecution Agreement or similar legal obligation.""
He added, ""The U.S. Department of Justice has confirmed that HSBC is not under investigation in this case.""
A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.
Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in Vancouver in December. She remains free on bail while the U.S. government tries to have her extradited to face bank and wire fraud charges. The case comes at a time of heightened trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, and amid concerns by the United States that Huawei's equipment could be used for Chinese espionage. The Shenzhen-based company, the world's largest maker of telecommunications networking equipment, has repeatedly denied such claims.
Meng has maintained she is innocent of the allegations made against her.
Reuters reported in December that HSBC – which is referred to in the indictment only as ""Financial Institution 1"" – figured prominently in the Huawei case. HSBC's internal probe of Huawei is reported here for the first time.
The HSBC documents contain new financial details about Huawei's relationship with Skycom and the company that Huawei claims it sold Skycom to in 2007, Canicula Holdings Ltd. All three firms previously had bank accounts at HSBC, with the Skycom and Canicula accounts part of what the bank internally called the ""Huawei Mastergroup.""
The HSBC probe found numerous ties between the three firms that suggested Huawei controlled both Skycom and Canicula long after the purported sale, the documents show. For example, Canicula's address was ""c/o Huawei Technologies.""
The probe also found that Huawei financed Canicula's purchase of Skycom, lending Canicula about 14 million euros in a deal the documents show didn't close until December 2009. Canicula repaid Huawei a year later using funds from Skycom.
After HSBC asked Huawei in 2013 to close the Skycom and Canicula accounts, Huawei employees assisted the bank. At Huawei's request, the remaining funds in the Skycom account were transferred to a Huawei bank account, according to the documents.
HSBC's move to close the accounts followed stories by Reuters in 2012 and 2013 about Huawei, Skycom, Canicula and Meng. The articles – which are cited in the HSBC documents as well as the indictment – reported that Skycom had offered to sell at least 1.3 million euros worth of embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran's largest mobile-phone operator in 2010. Reuters also reported that Meng had served on Skycom's board of directors between February 2008 and April 2009.
The earlier Reuters coverage can be read here https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-huawei-hp/exclusive-huawei-partner-offered-embargoed-hp-gear-to-iran-idUSBRE8BT0BF20121230 and here https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-huawei-skycom/exclusive-huawei-cfo-linked-to-firm-that-offered-hp-gear-to-iran-idUKBRE90U0CA20130131. 
The indictment alleges that banks in part relied on Huawei's false statements in the Reuters stories – that it hadn't violated sanctions on Iran and that Skycom was a local partner – to continue doing business with Huawei and Skycom.
HSBC had its own sanctions issues. In 2012, it paid $1.92 billion and entered into a five-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department for disregarding rules designed to prevent money laundering and processing transactions that violated sanctions.
Under the deal, HSBC agreed to strengthen its sanctions and anti-money laundering programs and to cooperate with the Justice Department in any investigations. To conduct its probe of Huawei, it hired the law firm Latham & Watkins.
The law firm did not respond to requests for comment.
According to the HSBC documents, investigators conducted more than 100 interviews, reviewed more than 292,000 emails and analyzed years of financial transactions. At least four presentations were made to the Justice Department between February and July 2017. The criminal charges against the bank were dismissed in December 2017.
The bank's Huawei probe found that in August 2013, at Huawei's request, HSBC's then deputy head of global banking for the Asia Pacific region, Alan Thomas, met with Meng. According to the HSBC documents, Meng later provided Thomas with a PowerPoint presentation in English that stated that Huawei had sold its shares in Skycom and that she was no longer on its board. The presentation described Skycom as a Huawei ""business partner"" in Iran. That presentation – which the United States alleges contained ""numerous misrepresentations"" – plays a central role in the U.S. case against Meng.
Thomas, who retired in 2017, declined to comment.
In the months after the meeting with Meng, HSBC considered whether to retain Huawei as a customer, the documents show. The bank initially concluded the reputational risks were acceptable and kept on Huawei. But, according to the indictment, HSBC told Huawei around 2017 that it was terminating the relationship.
The HSBC probe also uncovered financial transactions by Canicula that referenced Syria or involved a Syrian bank. Reuters reported last month that until 2017 Canicula operated in Syria, where it was connected to Huawei. Like Iran, Syria has been subject to U.S. sanctions.
Two people familiar with Canicula's operations in Syria have since told Reuters that Huawei used the company to circumvent sanctions there.
HSBC also told the Justice Department that it was aware of another company linked to Skycom in Iran. In August 2016, the HSBC documents say, the bank was notified by a British engineering recruitment company, Matchtech Group Ltd, that a Matchtech subsidiary had provided contractors to support telecommunications projects in Iran from 2010 to 2016.
The subsidiary, Networkers International Ltd, had contracted with Skycom and Huawei, and had received payments in U.S. dollars from Skycom, the HSBC documents state. The payments totaled about $7.6 million, the documents show. Networkers terminated its Iran-related contract with Skycom in October 2016, Matchtech told HSBC.

Matchtech is now known as Gattaca plc. A spokesman for Gattaca declined to comment.

AVALON, Australia (Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) expects it will take around 15 to 20 years to bring the cost per flight hour of the F-35 below fourth-generation fighter jets such as the F-16, the head of the F-35 program said on Wednesday.
The U.S. Air Force, the largest global customer for the F-35, has launched a push to drive down the cost of flying and servicing F-35s to the same levels as current fighters without stealth capabilities.
Lockheed Martin Vice President and General Manager F-35 Program Greg Ulmer said there was an effort to lower the cost per flight hour to $25,000 by 2025 but further savings would take longer. 
""Today it is different customer by customer but I think $35,000 per flying hour is a good number,"" he told Reuters in an interview at the Australian International Airshow. 
""If we project that out based on the initiatives we have in place, we believe as we move out to the 2035-2040 timeframe we can get that cost down to under what a fourth gen is today,"" in the range of $20,000-25,000 per flight hour.
Initiatives involved in lowering the cost to $25,000 an hour include reducing the number of mechanics needed to support each plane, Ulmer said.
Lockheed is also looking to refine diagnostic systems to reduce false alarms as well as to ensure there are proper spare parts available for maintenance and repairs.
Lockheed Martin Vice President and General Manager Training and Logistics Services Amy Gowder said the United States had been late to install enough capacity for F-35 repairs due to delays in funding approvals.
""The U.S. has been very slow to fund that in the depots specifically like Hill Air Force Base,"" she said. ""They should have started those projects a few years ago.""
That was becoming increasingly problematic as more planes were added to the fleet, Gowder said.
""When you have 180 aircraft it is probably okay. Now we have 300. It is the scale of the volume increases which is why there is a concern,"" she said. 
""That is putting more pressure on the supply chain in the near term.""
The U.S. Air Force did not respond immediately to a request for comment outside usual business hours.
Operating costs were a big issue when military officials from the United States, Israel and F-35 user nations in Europe - Britain, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Turkey, the Netherlands - met in Germany in September last year.

Experts say the U.S. Air Force could cut back its planned purchases of the aircraft unless it can lower the flying costs.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Nevada casino regulators said on Tuesday they had fined Wynn Resorts Ltd $20 million in a settlement with the company involving misconduct claims against former chief executive Steve Wynn.
The casino company, which has operations in Las Vegas and Macau, said the conclusion of the review by the Nevada Gaming Commission was a step forward for the company and its new leadership.
The settlement was previously disclosed but not the amount of the fine.
Founder Wynn resigned as CEO of the company in 2018 following claims he subjected women who worked for him to unwanted advances. He has denied the accusations.

Steve Wynn was not immediately reachable for comment.

469,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 10:12PM ET</span>",Tesla's Musk must address SEC contempt bid as he calls agency 'broken',"By Jonathan Stempel and Vibhuti Sharma
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk to explain by March 11 why he should not be held in contempt for violating his fraud settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The order by U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan came hours after the billionaire criticized SEC oversight as ""broken,"" in the wake of the regulator's request on Monday night that he be held in contempt.
Lawyers for Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Tesla did not immediately respond to similar requests. The SEC declined to comment.
Analysts said the renewal of the public battle between Musk and the top U.S. securities regulator will be an overhang on Tesla's stock, which has lost about one-quarter of its value since peaking in August.
""Another boxing match with the SEC is the last thing investors wanted to see,"" wrote Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has an ""outperform"" rating on Tesla.
He called the latest incident ""a wild card that could potentially bring this tornado of uncertainty back into the Tesla story until resolved.""
Tesla shares closed 0.3 percent lower at $297.86 on the Nasdaq. They had fallen as much as 3.3 percent earlier.
SEC SAYS TWEETS NOT VETTED
The SEC contempt motion followed Musk's tweet to his more than 24 million Twitter followers on Feb. 19: ""Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,"" meaning 500,000 vehicles.
According to the SEC, Musk violated his October 2018 settlement agreement by sending that tweet without first seeking approval from Tesla's lawyers.
It also said the outlook contrasted with guidance that Tesla had given on Jan. 30 that it would deliver about 400,000 vehicles in 2019.
The settlement resolved an SEC lawsuit over another Twitter post in which Musk said he had ""funding secured"" to take his Palo Alto, California-based company private at $420 per share.
Musk agreed to step down as Tesla's chairman, and both he and Tesla agreed to pay $20 million civil fines.
Four hours after his Feb. 19 tweet, Musk corrected himself, saying annualized production would probably be around 500,000 by year end, with full-year deliveries totaling 400,000.
Bradley Bondi, a lawyer for Tesla, had told the SEC in a Feb. 22 letter that Musk thought the substance of his first tweet had been ""appropriately vetted, pre-approved, and publicly disseminated.""
POTENTIAL PUNISHMENT
It is not clear what punishment the SEC will seek.
The regulator could seek a higher fine, further restrictions on Musk's activities, or removal of him from Tesla's board.
Alternatively, it could seek to ban Musk from being a public company officer, which would force him to step down as Tesla's chief executive.
It also is not clear how Musk's public criticism of the SEC might weigh on his fate.
The criticism continued on Tuesday, when Musk tweeted in the early morning: ""Something is broken with SEC oversight.""
That followed his Monday night tweet, after the contempt motion was filed, that the ""SEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k,"" and added: ""How embarrassing.""
Musk appeared to be referring to his Jan. 30 comment to analysts that Tesla would produce ""maybe on the order of 350,000 to 500,000 Model 3s, something like that this year.""
Criticizing the SEC is nothing new for Musk.
He has called the regulator the ""Shortseller Enrichment Commission,"" recalling his attacks against hedge funds and other investors who sell Tesla stock short, hoping it will fall.
And in a December interview with CBS's ""60 Minutes,"" Musk said he did not have respect for the SEC. He also said his tweets had not been reviewed in advance since the settlement.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.8% and 0.1% respectively by 9:51 PM ET (02:51 GMT).
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also rose 0.4%.
South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.2%.  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380)'s shares surged 4.9% after the company rejected on Tuesday a payout call by activist investor Elliot Management.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded 0.5% higher.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 was up 0.2%.
Powell delivered his testimony to a U.S. Senate committee overnight, warning of headwinds from overseas but noted the U.S. economic outlook was “generally favourable”.
“While we view current economic conditions as healthy and the economic outlook as favourable, over the past few months we have seen some crosscurrents and conflicting signals,” Powell said, adding that the central bank is monitoring how Brexit negotiations and Sino-U.S. trade talks play out. “We will carefully monitor these issues as they evolve.”
On the balance sheet roll-off specifically, Powell says the Fed is prepared to “adjust” the program if conditions warrant. The comment contradicted with his earlier remarks where he described the balance sheet roll-off as being on “autopilot.”
“I would note that we are prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalisation in light of economic and financial developments. In the longer run, the size of the balance sheet will be determined by the demand for Federal Reserve liabilities such as currency and bank reserves,” he said.
A meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is also in focus, although experts said the two sides have low expectations from this week’s talks.
Washington has demanded Pyongyang abandon all its nuclear and missile programs, while North Korea wants sanctions to be removed as part of denuclearisation negotiations.
On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that the two sides have not agreed on the meaning of denuclearisation, or even the ultimate purpose of the talks this week. Key details of the meeting also remained a mystery, the report added."
471,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 08:12PM ET</span>",Boeing unveils unmanned combat jet developed in Australia,"By Jamie Freed
AVALON, Australia (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co on Wednesday unveiled an unmanned, fighter-like jet developed in Australia and designed to fly alongside crewed aircraft in combat for a fraction of the cost.
The U.S. manufacturer hopes to sell the multi-role aircraft, which is 38 feet long (11.6 meters) and has a 2,000 nautical mile (3,704 kilometer) range, to customers around the world, modifying it as requested.
The prototype is Australia's first domestically developed combat aircraft since World War II and Boeing's biggest investment in unmanned systems outside the United States, although the company declined to specify the dollar amount. 
The Australian government is investing A$40 million ($28.75 million) in the prototype program due to its ""enormous capability for exports,"" Minister for Defence Christopher Pyne told reporters at the Australian International Airshow.
Defense contractors are investing increasingly in autonomous technology as militaries around the world look for a cheaper and safer way to maximize their resources.
Boeing rivals like  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Kratos Defense and Security Solutions Inc are also investing in such aircraft.
Four to six of the new aircraft, called the Boeing Airpower Teaming System, can fly alongside a F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, said Shane Arnott, director of Boeing research and prototype arm Phantom Works International.
""To bring that extra component and the advantage of unmanned capability, you can accept a higher level of risk,"" he said. ""It is better for one of these to take a hit than for a manned platform.""
The Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in the United States said last year that the U.S. Air Force should explore pairing crewed and uncrewed aircraft to expand its fleet and complement a limited number of ""exquisite, expensive, but highly potent fifth-generation aircraft"" like the F-35. 
""Human performance factors are a major driver behind current aerial combat practices,"" the policy paper said. ""Humans can only pull a certain number of G's, fly for a certain number of hours, or process a certain amount of information at a given time.""
MULTI-MISSION CAPABILITIES
In addition to performing like a fighter jet, other roles for the Boeing system include electronic warfare, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance alongside aircraft like the P-8 Poseidon and E-7 Wedgetail, said Kristin Robertson, vice president and general manager of Boeing Autonomous Systems.
""It is operationally very flexible, modular, multi-mission,"" she said. ""It is a very disruptive price point. Fighter-like capability at a fraction of the cost."" 
Robertson declined to comment on the cost, saying that it would depend on the configuration chosen by individual customers.
The jet is powered by a derivative of a commercially available engine, uses standard runways for take-off and landing, and can be modified for carrier operations at sea, Robertson said. She declined to specify whether it could reach supersonic speeds, common for modern fighter aircraft.
Its first flight is expected in 2020, with Boeing and the Australian government producing a concept demonstrator to pave the way for full production.
""I would say we are some years away from exports, we are probably years away from it being in operation here in Australia,"" Pyne said. ""It is designed to be a cheaper platform, a shield if you like around the more expensive platforms, to protect our servicemen and women who might be on a Poseidon or a Wedgetail or a F-35A.""
Australia, a staunch U.S. ally, is home to Boeing's largest footprint outside the United States and has vast airspace with relatively low traffic for flight testing. 
The Boeing Airpower Teaming System will be manufactured in Australia, but production lines could be set up in other countries depending on sales, Arnott said.
The United States, which has the world's biggest military budget, would be among the natural customers for the product.
The U.S. Air Force 2030 project foresees the Lockheed Martin F-35A Joint Strike Fighter working together with stealthy combat drones, called the ""Loyal Wingman"" concept, said Derrick Maple, principal analyst for unmanned systems at IHS Markit.
""The U.S. has more specific plans for the wingman concept, but Western Europe will likely develop their requirements in parallel, to abate the capabilities of China and the Russian Federation and other potential threats,"" he said.
Robertson declined to name potential customers and would not comment on potential stealth properties, but said the aircraft had the potential to sell globally.
""We didn't design this as a point solution but a very flexible solution that we could outfit with payloads, sensors, different mission sets to complement whatever their fleet is,"" she said. ""Don't think of it as a specific product that is tailored to do only one mission.""

Shares were up about 3 percent in extended trading, after the company also said it would use about half of a $200 million investment from Starboard Value LP to boost its marketing, introduce new pizzas and improve online ordering. 
""We're going to be very focused on getting traffic, moving back in the right direction because we donated a lot of share in 2018, and we certainly want to get that share back over a period of time"", Chief Executive Officer Steve Ritchie said on conference call with analysts.
Papa John's said sales would continue to struggle in the first half of 2019, but will improve by the second half.
Schnatter, who resigned in July as chairman following reports he used a racial slur during a media call, has said that the comments were taken out of context.
The company has blamed the negative publicity for denting sales and has taken steps to improve its public image by removing Schnatter's image from promotional materials and pizza boxes. 
Papa John's earlier this month snubbed Schnatter and accepted an investment from Starboard, also naming the hedge fund's Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Smith as its chairman.
Schnatter has filed an updated lawsuit against the company as he tries to get more control over the chain he founded in 1984.
Papa John's forecast 2019 North America comparable sales to fall 1 percent to 5 percent, while analysts' were expecting a 3.4 percent drop, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company reported an 8.1 percent fall in North America comparable sales in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 30, compared with the 7.4 percent decline analysts had projected.
However, the company missed total revenue and profit estimates for the quarter.

473,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 07:16PM ET</span>","Rattled by Vale disaster, mining CEOs move to change industry","By Ernest Scheyder
HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (Reuters) - After last month's deadly tailings dam disaster at a Vale SA facility in Brazil, Freeport-McMoRan Inc Chief Executive Richard Adkerson sent a memo to his 29,000 employees telling them to immediately report any safety concerns about the scores of dams his company operates.
The disaster, which killed more than 300, has sparked a push to set global standards for the construction and inspection of tailings dams, which store the muddy detritus of the mining process, as well as emergency preparations. The move reflects a radical departure from the way the facilities have operated for more than a century. 
Freeport, the world's largest publicly traded copper producer, spends several hundred millions of dollars per year on tailings dams upkeep and has not had a tailings dam failure since it acquired Phelps Dodge in 2007. Adkerson's directive underscored his desire not to blemish that record.
""I told my people, 'If you know of a problem, don't try to solve it yourself,'"" Adkerson told Reuters. ""Report it."" 
On Tuesday, Adkerson and 26 other CEOs, including leaders from BHP Group Ltd, Vale SA and  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc, agreed as their first step since the Vale disaster to form a panel that will set international design and maintenance standards for dams and study ways to reduce the volume of water stored behind the dams in waste rock.
""We recognize our responsibility to offer more than just words,"" said Donald Lindsey, CEO of Canadian miner Teck Resources Ltd and chair of the International Council on Mining and Metals, the industry trade group that set the standards.
""We owe it to the families impacted (by the Vale disaster) and to our stakeholders to take meaningful action,"" he said.
In the weeks after the accident, Brazil's government banned new upstream mining dams - the type of dam involved in the Vale disaster - and ordered the decommissioning of all such dams by 2021.
But Brazil and the broader mining industry have grappled with how best to codify uniform tailings dam standards, conscious of not only the safety implications but of growing public resentment over the use of tailings dams.
Right now for instance, there are no global mining industry standards defining what a tailings dam is, how to build one and how to care for it after it is decommissioned.
""I'm paranoid about tailings dams,"" said Mark Bristow, CEO of Barrick Gold Corp, the world's largest gold miner, which has assigned full-time engineers to each tailings dam.
In addition to setting global standards for the construction and inspection of tailings dams, the ICMM panel will also study ways to require so-called dry-stack tailings, where water is removed before tailings are stored, thus bolstering a dam's safety. That likely can happen relatively soon, the ICMM said.
Longer term, ICMM said that in situ mining - in which an acid is pumped underground to leach out copper and other minerals - could become the industry standard, thus eliminating the need for tailings dams entirely.
""We absolutely agree that a fundamental change is required in the industry's collective approach to safe tailings management,"" said BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie at the BMO Metals & Mining Conference in Florida, where the ICMM approved the panel's formation. 
The new standards to be set by ICMM will apply to all members, regardless of location. Past practices favored a more tailored approach.
The Vale disaster ""led us to reconsider how we look at tailings dams and acknowledge we need a step-change,"" said Tom Butler, ICMM's CEO.
Tailings dams in wet locations, for instance, had been held to a higher standard because they were more prone to erosion. But the new standards will favor a uniform approach that industry CEOs hope will greatly reduce the potential for another disaster.

""We cannot have a sense of complacency about this,"" Freeport's Adkerson said.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian automaker CAOA, which produces vehicles with Korea's Hyundai Motor Co and China's Chery Automobile Co, is in talks to buy a Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co plant in the country that is slated to close by 2019, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
Ford announced earlier this month that it would shut down its São Bernardo do Campo plant, a sprawling complex in a suburb of São Paulo that employs some 3,000 people.
In 2018, Ford said it used only 12 percent of its installed capacity in the plant, which is its oldest in the country. Shutting the plant is part of Ford's wider move to stop producing heavy commercial trucks in South America. It also produces the Fiesta small car at the plant.
Negotiations have not been finalized, the source said. 
Earlier on Tuesday, São Paulo governor João Doria said there were three companies interested in buying Ford's plant, although he declined to name them. Doria has pledged to help find a buyer for the plant.
São Paulo state government declined to comment on CAOA talks with Ford. A Ford representative denied that CAOA had approached the automaker directly about buying the factory.
CAOA, which started as a chain of dealerships, has expanded into manufacturing in recent years, most recently purchasing half of a factory originally developed by China's Chery. As part of the move, cars produced in the factory are now co-branded CAOA Chery. 

CAOA is already Ford's single largest distributor in the country.

479,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 05:52PM ET</span>","U.S. opens anti-dumping probe into steel imports from China, Canada, Mexico","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department announced Tuesday it will open a new anti-dumping probe to determine whether fabricated structural steel from Canada, China and Mexico is being sold at below fair value.
The investigation comes as some U.S. lawmakers, car companies and Canada and Mexico have strongly urged the Trump administration to drop U.S. national security tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in the wake of a deal announced last year to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The fabricated structural steel under investigation is used major building projects, including commercial, office and residential buildings, arenas, convention centers, parking decks and ports. 
The Commerce Department said Tuesday the new anti-dumping and countervailing duty probe is based on a petition filed earlier this month by a U.S. steel trade group. The department is investigating whether to seek duties of about 30 percent for Canada and Mexico and 222 percent for China in response to below-market price imports.
The Commerce Department said final determinations for the probe are expected by the end of September.
In 2017, imports of fabricated structural steel from Canada, China, and Mexico were valued at an estimated $658.3 million, $841.7 million, and $406.6 million, respectively. A preliminary determination on the issue is due from the International Trade Commission by March 21.
The Commerce Department alleges there are 44 subsidy programs for Canadian fabricated structural steel, including tax programs, grant programs, loan programs, export insurance programs, and equity programs. There are also 26 subsidy programs for China and 19 subsidy programs for Mexico, according to the agency.
Earlier this month, a Canadian steel industry group said it would strongly oppose a petition urging anti-dumping duty on certain steel imports from Canada.
The Canadian Institute of Steel Construction said the allegations by the U.S. group ""that these products from Canada are unfairly traded and cause injury to U.S. producers of fabricated steel products are baseless.""

480,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 05:51PM ET</span>","U.S. Justice Department will not appeal AT&T, Time Warner merger after court loss","By Diane Bartz and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) emerged victorious on Tuesday over the Trump administration's drawn-out attempts to block its $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner as the U.S. Justice Department said it would not fight an appeals court ruling approving the deal. 
The acquisition had been closely watched in political circles after coming under fire from U.S. President Donald Trump, who opposed it because he saw it helping Time Warner's CNN unit, which he has accused of broadcasting ""fake news.""
The three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled unanimously in favor of the deal on Tuesday, saying that the government's case that the merger would result in higher consumer prices was ""unpersuasive."" The decision ended a 15-month effort by the Justice Department to block the deal. 
It was AT&T's second major court victory against the Justice Department, setting the stage for the No. 2 wireless carrier to integrate its WarnerMedia business as well as its new Xandr advertising unit.
""We are grateful that the Court of Appeals considered our objections to the District Court opinion. The department has no plans to seek further review,"" Justice Department spokesman Jeremy Edwards said in a statement.
Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, telephoned AT&T General Counsel David McAtee and Time Warner’s former general counsel, Paul Cappuccio, to congratulate them on the court victory, according to a source familiar with events. 
McAtee said the merger ""has already yielded significant consumer benefits and will continue to do so for years to come.""
The deal has been seen as a turning point for a media industry that has been upended by companies like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google that put content online with no need for a cable subscription.
The merger, which was announced in October 2016, closed on June 14, 2018, shortly after U.S. District Judge Richard Leon ruled it was legal under antitrust law.
AT&T agreed to manage the Turner network separately until Feb. 28, or until the conclusion of any appeal by the Justice Department. AT&T also agreed it would have no role in setting Turner’s prices to distributors and the number of Turner employees would remain largely unchanged.
The appeals court took a shot at Leon, who had been scathing in his assessment of the government's attempt to stop the deal. 
""Undoubtedly the district court made some problematic statements, which the government identifies and this court cannot ignore,"" the panel said in its opinion.
Gigi Sohn, who worked at the Federal Communications Commission during the Obama administration, said the ruling showed a need to reform antitrust laws so the government can stop problematic deals. 
""AT&T is favoring both Time Warner and DirecTV content over its broadband services through its DirecTV Now and Watch services,"" she said. ""Consumers are the losers.""

AT&T stock closed up 0.3 percent at $31.22 on Tuesday.

482,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 05:30PM ET</span>",JPMorgan absolved by U.S. judge in former top broker's suicide,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Tuesday dismissed a wrongful death lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) by the estate of a former top broker, who it said committed suicide after being forced into retirement.
U.S. District Judge John Keenan said it was not reasonably foreseeable that JPMorgan's treatment of Michael Lorig would cause him to take his life at age 66 on Jan. 22, 2017, after years of what the estate called depression and mental illness.
Keith Fleischman, a lawyer for the estate, declined to comment. JPMorgan also declined to comment.
According to the complaint, Lorig was a senior managing director from Florida who joined JPMorgan after it bought his former employer Bear Stearns in 2008.
The marathoner and avid cyclist performed in the top 20 percent of his division and commanded seven-figure pay, but was told on Aug. 8, 2016, there was ""no work for him to return to"" after he spent two years on disability leave, the complaint said.
Lorig had twice previously taken leaves of absence for his depression, and his mental health issues were or should have been known to the bank, the complaint added.
Keenan, said, however, that because Lorig had assumed he could return to work after his disability leave, only actions taken by JPMorgan after he was told he could not return could be said to have caused his suicide.
The judge also said it had been nearly two years since Lorig's doctors advised JPMorgan that Lorig might be suicidal.
""Given these circumstances, it was not reasonably foreseeable that defendants' actions would result in Lorig's suicide,"" Keenan wrote. ""These actions were simply too attenuated to be the proximate cause.""
The estate had sought a variety of monetary damages.

The case is Mullaugh as personal representative of the Estate of Lorig v JPMorgan Chase & Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 18-02908.

485,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 05:24PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Jerome Powell Speaks Again
This time, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testifies about the economy and Fed interest-rate policy before the House Financial Services Committee, headed by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. At the hearing, which starts at 10 AM ET (15:00 GMT), Powell is likely to get many questions about consumer concerns. He will certainly be asked about how the Fed can help middle-class and lower-middle-class workers.
Powell likely won't say much more than he said at Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. The Fed isn't in any rush to raise interest rates because of worries about slowing economic growth in the U.S. and globally, he said.
Nor is the Fed in much of a rush to sell off huge amounts of the government securities it bought after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Selling down that inventory would also put pressure on interest rates.
While unemployment is at record low levels and job growth is steady, some parts of the economy, especially housing, have slowed in the last half year or so.
2. Crude Stockpiles Seen up 2.8 Million
The Energy Information Agency will release its weekly reports on oil and natural gas inventories, production and imports at 10:30 AM ET (15:30 GMT).
Oil inventories are likely to grow by 2.84 million barrels, down slightly from a week ago's build of 3.67 million barrels, according to analysts’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
That could add a little pressure to crude prices. WTI futures settled at $55.50 a barrel, up 2 cents from Monday.
Oil prices are facing a continuing tug-of-war of late as OPEC and OPEC-plus members continue to pledge cuts in supply, but expectations for more U.S. output from shale rise.
3. Lowe's,  Campbell Soup  and Chesapeake Earnings on Tap
Home-improvement retailer Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW), which issues results before the open, is probably the most important report of the day. Analysts polled by Investing.com expect the company to report earnings of 79 cents a share in its fiscal fourth quarter, up from 74 cents a year ago. The revenue estimate is $15.75 billion, up from $15.5 billion a year ago.
The report will come after arch-rival Home Depot's results missed forecasts on the top and bottom and lines.  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) shares fell 0.9% on the day.
Also reporting Wednesday is Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB). The estimate from analysts polled by Investing.com is 71 cents a share, down from $1 a year ago. Revenue for the venerable maker of soups and other products is forecast at $2.69 billion, unchanged from the third quarter but up from $2.18 billion a year ago.
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), the big Oklahoma City energy producer, is expected to report a profit of 18 cents a share for the fourth quarter, according to analysts polled by Investing.com. That would be down from 30 cents a year ago. Revenue is forecast at $2.28 billion."

(Reuters) - Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk laid into the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission again on Tuesday, after it accused the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc chief executive officer of violating the terms of a settlement last year of fraud charges against him.
In a filing on Monday, the SEC said that in a tweet on Feb. 19 Musk had broken a promise made last year to have his public statements vetted by the company's board, part of the deal.
The regulator did not say what remedy it wanted the court to impose, but the commitment was part of a settlement that headed off demands from the SEC for Musk to resign as Tesla CEO, seen by investors in the company as a substantial risk to its future. 
Musk, who initially on Monday accused the SEC of failing to read the company's annual reports, followed up with another tweet in the early hours of Tuesday.
""Something is broken with SEC oversight,"" he wrote.
Shares of the electric carmaker dipped 0.3 percent to close at $297.86, paring losses from an early sell-off fueled by concern among investors that Musk had reopened his feud with the regulator.
The company's only junk bond also dipped 0.75 points to a cash price of 87.75 in thin trading, still some way off last year's lows.
""With Tesla/Musk settling with the SEC in October this black cloud was in the rear view mirror for the company,"" analysts from brokerage Wedbush said in a note to clients.
""This latest tweet (is) a wild card that could potentially bring this tornado of uncertainty back into the Tesla story until resolved.""
J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Ryan Brinkman said that in a worst case scenario, the SEC could again seek Musk's removal as CEO for violating the terms of the agreement and its shares could fall by a fifth, or more than $50, in value.
""It is difficult to judge the likelihood of the reappearance of this worst case scenario ... but on the other hand the current allegations seem much less serious (than last year's),"" Brinkman told clients in a note.
""If the SEC were to seek Mr. Musk's removal (perhaps subject to yet another settlement), we believe the shares may approach the mid-$200 levels.""
Thirteen of 32 Wall Street brokerages now rate the electric car company a ""buy"" or higher. Eight view it as a ""hold"" and 11 ""sell"" or lower, with a median PT of $327.50
Tesla's general counsel Dane Butswinkas, hired as an outside counsel to help settle the case with the SEC, resigned a day after Musk made the tweet to which the new SEC case refers.
The tweet read: ""Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,"" an inaccurate claim which the SEC said had not been pre-approved by the board and was disseminated to over 24 million people.
Musk corrected his tweet four hours later to say that the ""annualized production rate"" at year-end 2019 would probably be about 500,000, with deliveries expected to be about 400,000.
""While this tweet (after market hours) and the quick correction seem innocuous, the SEC isn't likely to cut Musk any slack,"" said another analyst, Gene Munster from Loup Ventures.

""Musk's unwillingness to follow the rules is part of what you have to be willing to accept as an investor in Tesla.""

Dow component Home Depot (NYSE:HD) fell 0.9%, dragging consumer discretionary stocks lower after reporting results that missed on the top and bottom lines.
The soft report from the home improvement retailer arrived on the heels of data showing housing starts fell to their lowest level since September 2016 ahead of the key spring selling season. Rival Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW) reports fourth-quarter results on Wednesday.
There were some bright spots for consumer discretionary names as Macy’s (NYSE:M) and AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) closed higher on the back of results that topped estimates compiled by Investing.com.
Sentiment on stocks was also boosted by better-than-expected consumer confidence data, which eased some concerns that consumer strength was on the wane in the wake of dour U.S. retail sales reported earlier this month.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge rose to 131.4 in February, from 121.7 last month, beating economists’ forecast for a reading of 124.7.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's somewhat dovish testimony before the Senate Banking Committee reaffirmed investor expectations the central bank is likely to continue to pause on future interest rate hikes.
Powell delivered a upbeat assessment of the economy and said the central bank was prepared to adjust its runoff of the balance sheet as necessary.
In other corporate news,  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) fell 2.4% after Swiss bank UBS doubled downgraded the company from a buy to sell, citing worries over slowing global construction growth.
""We expect 2020 earnings per share to decline about 8% year-on-year, as continued growth in mining and buybacks will not be enough to offset headwinds in construction and oil and gas, in our view,"" UBS said.
""We do not believe an earnings decline in priced in to the stock. We expect downward earnings revisions to pressure the stock over the next 12 months.""
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, pared some losses to end the day above its lows after the Security and Exchange Commission asked a Federal Judge to hold CEO Elon Musk in contempt for breaching a settlement deal reached last year. Tesla fell 0.30% to $297.86, above session lows of $288.77.
Elon Musk has until March 11 to make his case why he should not be held in contempt.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's three major indexes fell slightly after a choppy session on Tuesday as investors eyed mixed U.S. economic data and corporate news and waited for clarity on issues such as the U.S.-China trade talks.
Weaker-than-expected housing data contrasted with a rosy consumer confidence report, while  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) was among the biggest drags on the benchmark S&P 500 index after the home improvement retailer blamed bad weather for missed Wall Street forecasts.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told a U.S. Senate Banking Committee that the central bank would remain ""patient"" in deciding on further interest rate hikes and that rising risks and recent soft data should not prevent solid growth for the economy this year.
The indexes have already been bolstered in recent weeks by trade optimism and dovish signals from the Fed, with the S&P 500's session high just 4.7 percent away from its record closing high in September.
""Investors are a little tentative as far as chasing the market higher. They're waiting for better prices or better news,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.
He cited issues such as a need for specifics on U.S.-China trade relations after President Donald Trump said on Sunday he would delay an increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods after ""productive"" trade talks.
Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis, also cited uncertainty over reports that Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen would tell lawmakers this week that Trump asked him about a proposed skyscraper project in Moscow long after he had secured the Republican presidential nomination.
""You've higher uncertainty today relative to yesterday,"" said Samana. ""The economic data was mixed. We've had a market rally going on for about two months. All those things together suggest this would be a good time to take some profits. It's not wholesale selling but profit taking around the edges.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 33.97 points, or 0.13 percent, to 26,057.98, the S&P 500 lost 2.21 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,793.9 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.16 points, or 0.07 percent, to 7,549.30. 
Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors ended lower with industrials providing the biggest drag with a 0.3 percent drop. The benchmark's biggest boost was the technology index, which closed up 0.2 percent. 
The healthcare index declined 0.3 percent after a U.S. congressional hearing on the prices of medicines wrapped up in Washington. Declines in shares of health insurers  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), both of which operate major pharmacy benefit managers, were big drags on the sector. 
The S&P's biggest losing stock was JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), which closed down 0.8 percent after it warned of rising costs for deposits, a key part of its business, and slowing global economic growth.
 Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) fell 2.4 percent and also depressed the benchmark after brokerage UBS downgraded the stock to ""sell"" from a ""buy"" rating.
U.S. homebuilding tumbled to a more than two-year low in December as construction of both single and multifamily housing declined, the latest sign that the economy had lost momentum in the fourth quarter.
But the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose more than expected in February.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.29-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.56-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 16 new 52-week highs and one new low. The Nasdaq Composite recorded 45 new highs and 21 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.05 billion shares, compared to the 7.3 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The nation's major credit reporting agencies faced renewed scrutiny from Congress on Tuesday, as lawmakers consider legislation overhauling the industry.
Top executives from the three major credit reporting agencies -  Equifax Inc  (NYSE:EFX), Experian Plc (LON:EXPN) and TransUnion had to defend their business models before skeptical lawmakers who appeared eager to order changes to the sector following Expedia's massive data breach, disclosed in 2017.
""Our nation's consumer credit reporting system is broken,"" said Representative Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee. ""I’m troubled to the point where I do think that we need to start thinking about how we reimagine it and rebuild it from the ground ... We will be introducing legislation.""
Waters has a draft bill that would limit the reach of such credit reports, shorten the time adverse information remains on consumers' records, and make it easier for consumers to dispute errors on their reports.
Several Democrats made clear they were dissatisfied with the current state of the country's credit reporting, arguing consumers lack control over their own data. 
The panel's top Republican, Representative Patrick McHenry, agreed the industry was in need of a makeover. However, he emphasized a desire to see more companies compete with the three largest agencies.
""What I see here is an oligopoly,"" he told executives. ""I don’t see that vibrant competition which is needed for these agencies to actually help consumers.""
The massive data breach disclosed by Equifax in 2017, where a cyber attack exposed the personal data of roughly 148 million people, has driven calls from Washington for changes to the industry.
Legislation beefing up protections around consumer data is seen by analysts and lobbyists to be a rare area of common ground in the current Congress, where Democrats control the House and Republicans control the Senate.
Waters' Senate counterpart, Banking Chairman Mike Crapo, has said legislation addressing the collection and protection of personal data is one of his top priorities this year. He is currently soliciting input on how consumers could retain more control over their personal information.
For their part, credit reporting agency executives told lawmakers they were working to address consumer concerns and bolster their cybersecurity to guard against future breaches.

""Consumers trust and expect that their credit reports contain the most accurate and complete data possible, and lenders rely on that information to help millions of consumers obtain the right loans at the right time,"" said Equifax CEO Mark Begor in prepared testimony.

Investing.com - Shares of Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), the marketplace website focused on crafts and creative goods, soared Tuesday after the company beat fourth-quarter earnings and revenue estimates and forecast a bullish year for 2019.
The stock was up 17% and pushed through $69, forcing at least one investment house to raise its price target. The consensus price target has been $59.15, according to analysts polled by Investing.com. Key Bank Capital raised its price target to $75 from $59.
The company earned 32 cents a share in the quarter, compared with the Investing.com compiled forecast of 20 cents and up from an adjusted 15 cents in the fourth quarter of 2017. Its 2017 earnings on a GAAP basis were inflated by a one-time benefit from the tax law.
Revenue, forecast at $194.9 million, was $200 million, up from $136.3 million a year ago. Gross merchandise sales, a key metric, rose 23% to $1.2 billion. GMS represents transaction values as Etsy collects a fee on each transaction. Holiday sales were up 30%, and a third of its transactions in the quarter involved free shipping, something Etsy encourages its sellers to emphasize. More free shipping translates into more transactions and more revenue for Etsy.
In its presentation for analysts late Monday, the company said it expects revenue growth of 29% to 32% in 2019, with gross merchandise sales up 17% to 20%.
But a key question going forward -- at least in the short run -- will be if the stock, up more than 45% this year alone, has moved too far, too fast.
Overall, technical indicators indicate the stock is a strong buy. But several, including its relative strength index and two stochastic indicators, said the shares are overbought. The Etsy relative strength index (RSI), which measures price movement over, typically, a 14-day period, was at 86.3, where 75 is the level suggesting shares are overbought."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said on Tuesday it expects to face rising costs for deposits, a key part of its business, and slowing global economic growth.
Still, senior executives, speaking at the bank's annual investor day, painted a picture of stable financial performance and maintained a key profit goal for the next three years.
Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said while JPMorgan is strong in many of its businesses, the bank was uncertain whether the near-term future for interest rates and the U.S. economy would provide the underlying strength that could boost its bankwide profit targets.
JPMorgan's annual investor day is closely watched by investors as the bank accounts for about 14 percent of U.S. banking industry revenue, according to estimates by analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
Lake said the bank expects growth in deposits to slow and the interest it pays for them to rise, reducing profit margins on its loans. At the same time, new regulations are making those loans less profitable and pushing the bank to invest more in securities.
""The further out you go, the less confidence we have that we won't see"" changes in interest rates and a downturn in the economy, Lake said, when asked why the bank did not raise its target for profitability.
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the bank's decision not to raise its profitability target was not a warning about the economy. ""We are not predicting a recession. We are prepared for a recession,"" Dimon said.
Like last year, the bank said it expects its return on tangible common equity, a key profit measure for how well it uses shareholder money, to be 17 percent over the medium term, which the bank considers roughly three years.
The bank may exceed its key growth targets, Lake said, but its forecast is set with a cautious view of future risks, including global trade worries as well as Britain's pending withdrawal from the European Union, or Brexit, she said.
""Recent declines in business sentiment have driven recessionary risk higher,"" she said, referring to the United States.
Still, she added, ""the U.S. economy remains consumer-led, and consumers are strong and healthy.""
JPMorgan faces a balancing act: reassuring investors while not making pledges that are likely to haunt it in the future amid growing economic turbulence.
In the fourth quarter, JPMorgan and several other big banks took a hit in their fixed-income trading operations as a market swoon kept clients on the sidelines.
Trading revenue in the first quarter is expected to be down in the ""high teens"" in percentage terms after an unusually strong quarter a year earlier when the U.S. tax overhaul boosted results, said Daniel Pinto, head of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank.
In a recession, Dimon said, the bank would continue to invest in its businesses. ""We would take advantage of a recession to build our branches, network, etcetera. We would take advantage of a recession.""
While executives trumpeted market share gains from recently increased spending on technology and marketing, they also acknowledged problems.
""It is a tough time to be in the mortgage business,"" said Gordon Smith, chief executive officer of consumer and community banking.
Mike Weinbach, head of home lending, said mortgage originations will likely remain ""near cyclical lows"" in the coming years. The industry is struggling with excess capacity for making loans, even as the cost of new loans continues to rise, he said. 
The bank sketched out its views before the stock market opened in a slide presentation ahead of the investor day. 
JPMorgan shares fell 1.2 percent at $104.84 after dropping as much as 2 percent early in the session.
The bank stuck with its previous targets of an expense overhead ratio of 55 percent as adjusted expenses were set to rise this year by $2.3 billion, or 3.6 percent.
The higher expense forecast includes $600 million of new technology investments and $1.6 billion for marketing, front-office hiring, new branches and a new headquarters building.

The additional spending is down from $2.7 billion a year ago, when it boosted the technology budget by $1.4 billion.

497,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 02:47PM ET</span>",Boeing nominates former U.N. ambassador Haley to join its board,"By Eric M. Johnson and Mike Stone
SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. aerospace manufacturer Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Tuesday it has nominated Nikki Haley, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a close ally of President Donald Trump, to join its board of directors at the company's annual shareholders meeting on April 29.
If elected by Boeing shareholders, she would help guide the future of America's largest exporter, with a network of suppliers across the United States and the world, as Washington and Beijing have been locked in intense negotiations to end a trade war.
Haley's nomination comes as Boeing grapples with a major decision: whether to launch an all-new jetliner known as NMA, a midsize plane that would serve a niche market falling between narrow- and wide-body aircraft.
The world's largest planemaker has said it would make a final launch decision in 2020 on the new program, which is expected to define competition with archrival Airbus SE.
Viewed as a rising Republican Party star, Haley has often been mentioned as a future presidential candidate. Her counterparts at the United Nations saw her as a voice of clarity in the Trump administration.
Haley, 47, is the first female governor of South Carolina and a three-term legislator in the South Carolina House of Representatives. As governor in 2015, Haley was a key opponent of a campaign by Boeing's largest labor union to form a collective bargaining unit at its 787 Dreamliner factory in South Carolina - though the machinists were later successful in forming a small bargaining unit there.
Boeing has faced growing scrutiny over its links to the Trump administration after a former senior planemaking executive, Pat Shanahan, was named deputy defense secretary and later acting defense secretary. The 31-year Boeing veteran has recused himself, however, from matters relating to the aerospace company.
The U.S. government has been weighing the purchase of an advanced version of the F-15 Boeing fighter. Last year, Boeing's defense side had a series of wins, including the U.S. Air Force's next training jet, which could be worth up to $9.2 billion, as well as a contract to replace UH-1N Huey helicopters worth $2.4 billion over the life of the programs. 
In a press release, Muilenburg praised Haley's record in government and industry partnership.
""Boeing will benefit greatly from her broad perspectives and combined diplomatic, government and business experience to help achieve our aspiration to be the best in aerospace and a global industrial champion,"" Muilenburg said.
Based on total compensation for Boeing's other 13 board members, Haley can expect to earn more than $300,000, well above her salary as U.N. ambassador.
Separately on Tuesday, the shareholders of Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA approved a deal to sell 80 percent of the Sao Paulo-based company's commercial jet division to Boeing, a move that could reshape the global market for aircraft of up to 150 seats.

Boeing shares were flat at $427.88 a share in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

498,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 02:20PM ET</span>","Fiat Deepens SUV Bet With $4.5 Billion for Jeep, Ram Plants","(Bloomberg) -- Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV plans to invest $4.5 billion to produce new Jeep models and boost Ram truck output, as it banks on selling more high-margin sport utility vehicles even as U.S. sales lose steam and a slew of rival offerings hit the market.
The Italian-American automaker is putting $1.6 billion into its Mack Avenue engine plant in Detroit to produce the next-generation Grand Cherokee, plus a new full-size three-row Jeep with an optional plug-in hybrid engine, Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley said on a call with reporters. It’s also spending $1.5 billion on its Warren, Michigan, truck plant to bring back the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer nameplates, and continue production of its Ram 1500 Classic truck through this year.
Those models will hit the market at a time when crosstown rivals General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. are relaunching storied nameplates including the Ford Bronco and Chevy Blazer. An unexpected spike in inventory of Jeep’s iconic Wrangler already is stoking concern that the American SUV boom fueling Detroit automakers’ profit growth is reaching its limits.
Manley downplayed these concerns on a call with reporters, saying that entering segments where the company doesn’t have an offering -- such as with the three-row SUV and the Grand Wagoneer -- will allow Fiat Chrysler to keep growing. The automaker’s U.S. shares dipped as much as 0.6 percent after the announcement.
“Even if we see mitigation in the industry in the coming years, entering white space” will expand the addressable market, the CEO said. “Notwithstanding the fact that the industry is going to be, in total, slightly down year-over-year, the economic indicators as we see them are still strong.”
Fiat Chrysler was the only one of Detroit’s three automakers to increase sales in a flat U.S. market last year, thanks to record deliveries for its Jeep and Ram brands. The company is looking to build on that momentum in 2019 with redesigned heavy-duty Ram trucks and the new Jeep Gladiator pickup being introduced in the first half of the year.
The National Automobile Dealers Association expects industrywide deliveries to dip to 16.8 million cars and trucks this year, down from about 17.3 million in 2018. As the market shrinks, showrooms are getting more crowded with new models. Researcher LMC Automotive projects automakers will offer 191 different SUVs by 2024. That’s up from just 100 in 2014.
Fiat Chrysler is filling out its Jeep lineup to bolster profits after margins in North America fell short of investors’ expectations in the fourth quarter, prompting a stock plunge and slew of analyst downgrades. The company is counting on U.S. sales to sustain earnings while it seeks partners to help cut costs for its ailing European business. It’s also struggling to find its footing in a slowing Chinese market and shore up the Maserati luxury brand.
“They’re more reliant than ever on the good mix in the U.S. and North America in general to offset the foreseeable weakness in Europe and China,” said Pierre Quemener, an analyst at MainFirst Bank AG. “If they falter here, that’s going to be a big issue for them.”
Before today’s announcement, the company had spent $4.9 billion on truck and SUV assembly in the U.S. since 2009, compared with $1.3 billion on passenger cars, according to the Center for Automotive Research.
The investments have helped Fiat Chrysler curry favor with President Donald Trump. The White House has attacked GM for its plans to close factories as it kills off some sedans and frees up resources to invest in electrification and autonomous vehicles.
Fiat Chrysler won plaudits from Trump in January 2017 when it announced a $1 billion investment to build three new Jeeps and shift production of the heavy-duty Ram pickup from Mexico. But Manley said Tuesday the truck’s planned exit from Mexico has been scrapped.
Still, the United Auto Workers praised the move to create more jobs at Fiat Chrysler’s U.S. factories.
“At a time when the Detroit area and our communities have seen auto plants without work and companies continue to ship vehicles into the U.S. from Mexico, China, Korea and other countries, it’s exciting to see now that we can have good union jobs here,” Cindy Estrada, a UAW vice president, told reporters at a press conference.
Here’s a breakdown of Fiat Chrysler’s investments in detail:

499,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 02:12PM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler to invest $4.5 billion in Michigan for new Jeep SUV models,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said on Tuesday it will invest $4.5 billion in five plants to build new models of Jeeps to compete in the lucrative market for full-size, three-row SUVs currently dominated by rivals General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.
At the same time, the automaker said it was cutting the third shift at its Rockford, Illinois plant, where it assembles the Jeep Cherokee, laying off 1,371 workers. The company said it would ""make every effort"" to find work for laid off hourly workers based on seniority.
The new investments announced on Tuesday will create 6,500 jobs in Michigan, Fiat Chrysler (FCA) said in an announcement about three months after GM said it would not allocate new products to five plants in North America that mostly produce less-popular sedan models.
GM workers and politicians, including U.S. President Donald Trump, have blasted GM for the decision, which is likely to close those plants.
The move comes at a time when the U.S. market looks set to decline, with 2019 industry-wide new vehicle sales expected to fall below 2018 levels. 
But FCA Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley said in a conference call with reporters that the company's investments are focused on SUVs, an area ""forecasted to continue to grow.""
He added that 60 percent of SUV sales are for three-row models ""and we don't have a three-row offering... and this is a segment that I've been very interested in for some time."" 
The full-size SUV segment is dominated by GM's Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade, which had about double the sales of Ford's Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator in 2018.
FCA's plans include turning an engine plant in Detroit into an assembly plant. The company also reversed a decision to shift production of heavy-duty trucks from Mexico to Michigan in 2020, freeing the Michigan facility to produce Jeeps.
""I look at today’s investment as a reward for the efforts of our membership and a show of confidence that the members of the UAW are the best auto workers in the world,"" United Auto Workers union Vice President Cindy Estrada said in a statement. 
The automaker said plans included investments to enable three Michigan plants to produce hybrid and fully electric Jeep models. Manley said those hybrid models or electric models could be available as soon as late 2021, but will be rolled out based on consumer demand. 
'UNLIKE ANYTHING WE HAVE SEEN'
FCA plans to start construction on the new $1.6 billion Detroit facility in the third quarter of 2019 and begin production of a new three-row SUV by the end of 2020, followed by a revamped version of the Grand Cherokee in the first half of 2021.
The plans also include a $900 million investment to modernize and retool another Detroit plant to make the Dodge Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee.
Those investments come around six years since Detroit filed the largest ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy and will bring nearly 5,000 jobs to the city. 
FCA and the city of Detroit have signed a memorandum of understanding that provides 60 days to follow through on the agreed acquisition of land for the new plant. 
""This opportunity is unlike anything we have seen in decades,"" Detroit mayor Mike Duggan said in a statement, adding that the investments would take place ""without displacing a single resident."" 
FCA will also start production of its Wagoneer model and the Grand Wagoneer, a new three-row luxury SUV, at a plant in Warren in the first half of 2021. Early last year, FCA said it would move heavy-duty truck production to that plant, but that will now remain in the company's Saltillo, Mexico, plant.

FCA will invest $1.5 billion in the Warren plant - up from $725 million the automaker had not publicly disclosed.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. senators called drug pricing practices ""morally repugnant"" and told drug company executives they do not want to hear them blame others for the high prices, taking an aggressive stance at a Senate hearing on the rising costs of prescription medicines. 
Senators took aim in particular at Abbvie Inc Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez and his company's rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira - the world's top-selling prescription medicine.
Executives from AstraZeneca PLC, Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), Merck & Co, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co also answered questions from members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee.
The executives pointed to their companies' records of developing lifesaving medications, saying profits generated in the lucrative U.S. market help them fund expensive research and development of future treatments. 
""American research-based companies are leading the next wave of biomedical innovation to help patients whose diseases cannot be adequately treated with today's medicines. We should work to ensure policies that support and reward these investments,"" said Bristol-Myers CEO Giovanni Caforio.
The executives also voiced support for plans to reform the industry-wide system of rebates that pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and health insurers receive from drugmakers in exchange for preferential coverage of their medicines. 
In his opening statement, Senator Ron Wyden, the Finance Committee's top Democrat, tore into each company one-by-one for ""profiteering and two-faced scheming.""
""Drugmakers behave as if patients and taxpayers are unlocked ATMs full of cash to be extracted, and their shareholders are the customers they value above all else,"" Wyden said. 
Senators from both parties targeted AbbVie's Gonzalez, with Wyden noting that the CEO's bonus was partially tied to Humira sales, which reached nearly $20 billion globally last year. Republican Senator John Cornyn criticized the company's web of more than 130 patents that protects Humira's exclusivity.
The drug has a list price of more than $60,000 a year, nearly double what it was in 2014, according to Rx Savings Solutions, which helps health plans and employers seek lower cost prescription medicines. 
""I support drug companies recovering a profit based on their research and development and development of innovative drugs. But at some point, that patent has to end, that exclusivity has to end, to be able to get it at a much cheaper cost,"" said Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican from Texas.
Cornyn suggested that the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee should examine the U.S. patent system under which drug companies protect the exclusivity of their medicines.
Congress has already held several hearings on rising prescription drug prices in both the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and the Republican-led Senate, but Tuesday's hearing is the first time drug company executives, most of them CEOs, will face lawmakers in more than two years.
U.S. President Donald Trump has said drugmakers are ""getting away with murder,"" and his administration has made bringing down prescription medicine costs for U.S. consumers a top priority.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) last year rolled out a plan to lower drug prices and has introduced several modest proposals to curb medicine costs, but Democrats have said the Trump administration is not doing enough.
HHS has proposed a rule to eliminate rebates for drugs paid for by Medicare and Medicaid, the government health insurance programs.
Several drugmakers temporarily froze price increases last year after criticism from Trump, but they raised prices on more than 250 prescription drugs at the start of this year, albeit at lower levels than in years past.

502,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 02:00PM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco Eyes LNG Deals in Next Year in New Gas Strategy,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Aramco aims to become one of the world’s largest players in natural gas and the company is eyeing projects in Russia, Australia, America and Africa to kick-start a global business in the liquefied form of the fuel. 
“Gas is a major market and we want to be one of the largest players,” Amin Nasser, the chief executive of Saudi Arabia’s state-run oil company, said in an interview in London. “There’s appetite to invest in natural gas and LNG.”
Asked whether the company, formally known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., will have made a major overseas investment in gas in a year’s time, Nasser responded: “I hope so.”
Natural gas is turned into a liquid by super cooling it to minus 162 degrees Celsius (minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit). After that, the liquefied natural gas, known as LNG, gets loaded onto massive ships and transported around the world. The liquefaction technology, which was developed commercially in the 1960s and 1970s, gave natural gas access to global markets, allowing it to reach countries from Japan to Spain.
The world’s biggest oil companies have invested heavily in natural gas and LNG, with Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). operating large projects from Qatar to Australia. In many ways, Western oil companies also see natural gas as part of their energy transition strategy: it’s far less polluting than crude oil, releasing less carbon dioxide that contributes to climate change.
Gas Strategy
The push into natural gas is a change of strategy for Aramco, which is already the world’s largest oil exporter. The company, fully owned by the Saudi government since its nationalization in the 1970s, has a relatively small natural gas business today, which focuses on meeting local demand. Nasser wants to change that, starting gas exports both from fields in Saudi Arabia but also from outside the kingdom. 
“We are in discussions with Russia, Australia, America and Africa,” Nasser said, declining to name any of the companies involved in the talks. In the past, Saudi officials have said the kingdom is talking about taking a stake in a Russian project known as Arctic LNG 2 controlled by Novatek PJSC.
Saudi Arabia’s efforts to build a global natural gas business follow in the footsteps of regional rivals, including Qatar, one of the world’s largest LNG exporters. The U.S. is also emerging as a large LNG shipper thanks to booming natural gas production from shale fields, from Texas to Pennsylvania. 
Downstream Investments
The gas shift comes as Aramco also invests heavily in oil refining and petrochemicals, in an effort to secure long-term outlets for its crude production. The company is mulling its first ever international bond later this year to help finance the acquisition of a majority stake in local chemical company Saudi Basic Industries Corp. The kingdom has promised an initial public offering of Aramco by late 2020 or early 2021, after shelving plans originally targeting 2018.
Aramco is also planning to boost the kingdom’s domestic use of natural gas, aiming to replace the bulk of the 400,000 barrels a day or so of crude oil and refined products that Saudi Arabia burns to generate electricity. The oil freed by using gas instead for electricity generation could be exported, earning hard currency.
At peak times during the torrid desert summer, Riyadh burns through as much as 800,000 barrels a day of crude to produce electricity to meet peak seasonal demand for air conditioning. “We plan to eliminate most oil burning for electricity by 2030,” Nasser said. “As a strategy, we will replace oil with gas.”

503,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 01:40PM ET</span>",Ex-Barclays sovereign wealth boss says she did not know about Qatar service deal,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - A former  Barclays  (LON:BARC) manager tasked with building relationships with sovereign wealth funds in 2008 did not know about deals for additional services from Qatar after it invested billions of pounds in the British bank during the credit crisis.
The evidence of Gay Huey Evans, a former divisional vice-chairman of investment banking and investment management at Barclays, was read out at London's Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday during the criminal trial of four former senior executives, including ex-chief executive John Varley.
Varley, Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in a case that revolves around how Barclays raised more than 11 billion pounds ($14.6 billion) from investors, including Qatar, to stave off a state bailout more than a decade ago.
The men, the most senior bankers to face a jury trial over credit crisis-era conduct, deny wrongdoing. Qatar, which invested more than 4 billion pounds in Barclays in 2008, has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
Prosecutors for the Serious Fraud Office allege the bankers misled the market, shareholders and other investors by not disclosing around 322 million pounds in extra fees paid to Qatari investors through so-called additional service agreements, described as a ""mechanism of paying the Qataris what they wanted"".
Huey Evans, a witness for the prosecution who is now deputy chair of the Financial Reporting Council accounting watchdog, started reporting directly to Jenkins around September 2008. 
In testimony read by prosecutors, Huey Evans said she would have been ""pushier"" about what services Qatar was providing if she had known about the deal.
""I am not aware of any advisory services provided by Qatar apart from the introduction of Sheikh Mansour (of Abu Dhabi) to the October 2008 fund raising,"" she was quoted as saying.
The court has been told that Qatari investors were paid a separate 66 million pounds for introducing Abu Dhabi's Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan to Barclays' second capital raising in October 2008.
Jenkins was the gatekeeper of the Qatari relationship, but with oil prices rising in 2008, Huey Evans' team hoped to build deeper relationships with oil-rich states and that Jenkins would facilitate introductions. But her department was frustrated at a lack of progress, the court heard. 
She said that ""he (Jenkins) tried to be helpful"" but that business in the Middle East was complex.
The bank had lacked a close relationship with Abu Dhabi and executives who wanted to meet the Crown Prince could be asked to sit and wait for hours - or days. ""No-one liked sitting there,"" Huey Evans was quoted as saying.
The jury in the trial, which is scheduled to last up to six months, was told the witness testimony could be read out if there were no questions from the defense.

Worldpay's (NYSE:WP) fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.12 a share on revenue of $1.05 billion beat estimates compiled by Investing.com for earnings of $1.08 a share on revenue of $1.04 billion. Its share price rose 7%.
The beat on bottom line was driven by strong performance in the company's payments processing technology solutions segment, which saw revenues nearly double to $443.7 million for the quarter from $225.5 million a year earlier.
""Integrated pay and e-commerce pushed technology solutions growth towards the high end of expectations,"" said CFRA, an independent research provider.
""The high rates of organic growth and the continued acceleration in technology solutions shows the power of our strategy,"" said Charles Drucker, chairman and chief executive officer. ""Our strong business fundamentals position us for continued growth in 2019.""
The global payment processor guided first-quarter adjusted earnings in the range of $0.87 to $0.90 share. Full-year revenue was guided between $4.20 billion and $4.26 billion, representing 7% to 9% growth from last year.
""While initial (earnings) guidance was below prior estimates, its worth noting Worldpay has a track record of beating and raising estimates throughout the year,"" JPMorgan said in a note to clients.
In the run-up to the quarterly results, some had said Worldpay would benefit from trends toward the adoption of electronic payments and electronic commerce in the international market, keeping it ahead of its rivals.

512,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 12:32PM ET</span>",UAW sues GM over decision to end production at U.S. plants,"By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union on Tuesday filed suit against General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) over its decision to end production and eliminate thousands of jobs at three U.S. auto plants, saying it violated a 2015 collective bargaining agreement.
In the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Ohio, the UAW asked a federal judge to order GM to rescind its November decision to close three plants in Michigan, Ohio and Maryland, and award damages to employees for losses from what the UAW calls GM's breach of contract.
GM said in a statement that its decisions to halt production ""do not violate the provisions of the UAW-GM National Agreement. We continue to work with the UAW on solutions to our business challenges."" 
GM said in November it was cutting up to 15,000 jobs and ending production at five plants in North America, including one in Canada.
On Friday, GM said it had extended the production at its Detroit Hamtramck plant until January 2020, after earlier saying it planned to discontinue production in June. The suit does not cover GM's Detroit Hamtramck plant because it will remain operational beyond the current contract's September 2019 expiration.
The job cuts have angered U.S. President Donald Trump, who has demanded GM find a replacement product for its Lordstown plant and threatened to cut GM subsidies.
The No.1 U.S. automaker is revamping its operations as it looks to boost profitability after U.S. auto sales declined.
The UAW said GM plans to end production at its Lordstown, Ohio assembly plant on March 8. It will also end production at its White Marsh plant in Maryland on May 3 and at its Warren Transmission on August 1.
Some suppliers have announced job cuts as a result of the end of production, while GM has said it is offering UAW workers jobs at other plants.
A company that provides janitorial and other services at the Ohio plant said it is cutting 73 jobs next month. Two other suppliers said earlier they are cutting 300 jobs that supported the Ohio plant operations. 
GM chief executive Mary Barra has said the fate of the U.S. plants will be determined in contract talks with the UAW this summer.

In January, the UAW sued GM, claiming the automaker’s use of temporary workers at a plant in Indiana violates its labor deal. A March 8 hearing is set in that suit.

513,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 12:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Canadian regulator failed to make checks on risky mortgage brokers,"By Matt Scuffham and Allison Martell
TORONTO (Reuters) - The financial services regulator in Canada's biggest province failed to make planned checks on mortgage brokers it had identified as risky because its resources were stretched, according to documents obtained by Reuters under freedom of information laws and information provided by the regulator.
The Financial Services Commission of Ontario (FSCO) planned to complete five on-site examinations of mortgage brokerages identified as risky this fiscal year, which ends March 31. But as of Dec. 31, 2018, nine months into the year, it had not finished any of them, according to data provided to Reuters. 
During the same period, FSCO staff carried out only four of 50 planned ""desk reviews,"" which are similar to on-site examinations but less detailed.
The findings call into question whether mortgage brokers, which originate 30 percent to 40 percent of new loans in Canada's C$1.5 trillion ($1.1 trillion) mortgage market, are being adequately supervised as record household debt and rising interest rates make it harder for borrowers to make repayments.
Mortgage underwriting standards came under scrutiny in Canada after the country's biggest nonbank lender, Home Capital Group Inc, accepted responsibility for misleading investors about problems with its procedures in 2017. 
The FSCO plays a particularly important role because it supervises brokerages in Toronto, Canada's biggest housing market. It is due to be replaced by a new regulatory body, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA), in the spring of this year but it is currently unclear whether FSRA will have significantly more resources than its predecessor.
In a statement, FSCO said it conducts a thorough investigation where individuals or entities are identified as presenting an elevated risk.
""This investigative process, which makes the best use of finite resources to address the most significant risks, may include, but does not require, a site visit,"" it said. ""As a result, planned examinations may not take place, but other regulatory and supervisory activities would occur, based on the resources available.""
The on-site examinations involve FSCO staff visiting mortgage brokerages that initial reviews have flagged as having ""elevated risk levels,"" warranting further investigation, according to a June 2018 government audit of FSCO's market regulation branch which Reuters obtained through a freedom of information request. They are meant to catch problems early, before they escalate, the report said. 
The checks can stop problems such as mortgage brokers failing to make proper checks to prevent borrowers' lying about their income in order to obtain a loan. According to credit bureau Equifax (NYSE:EFX), suspected fraudulent mortgage applications have increased by 52 percent in Canada since 2013, with Ontario seeing the majority. Other types of fraud include brokers charging unlawful fees, FSCO says on its website. 
TIGHT BUDGET
The audit stated FSCO was ""operating in a challenging regulatory environment with limited resource to carry out its supervisory activities"".
Asked if FSCO's successor will have more resources, Ontario's finance ministry said FSRA is consulting with the department over its planned budget and business plan for 2019-20 and is also working on establishing a fee rule enabling it to recover some costs from the sectors it regulates, potentially enhancing its overall budget.
According to its 2017/18 annual report, FSCO had 382 staff and an annual budget of C$56.5 million. Its annual budget has declined by 40 percent since 2015/16, partly reflecting the transfer of its dispute resolution services activities to another Ontario government department.
The data from FSCO shows that the regulator completed fewer reviews in the first three quarters of this fiscal year than it did last year, when it also missed its targets. 
The June 2018 audit showed that, in the nine months to Dec. 31, 2017, FSCO completed one of 25 planned on-site examinations, while eight of 15 planned desk reviews went ahead.

In its statement, FSCO said it eventually completed three on-site examinations and 11 desk reviews in its fiscal year to Mar. 31, 2018.

516,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 11:19AM ET</span>","Thomson Reuters posts earnings beat, hunts for acquisitions","By Matt Scuffham
TORONTO (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters reported better-than-expected earnings on Tuesday, helping push its shares to a record high, and said it is continuing to look for acquisitions to bolster its Legal and Tax & Accounting units, where demand is up in part because of U.S. tax reforms.
Shares in the news and information provider rose 5 percent in early trading to C$73.24, marking a record high. They have benefited from the company buying back $10 billion worth of shares since August.
Thomson Reuters reported fourth-quarter revenue of $1.52 billion, compared with $1.41 billion a year ago. Earnings excluding special items were 20 cents per share, down from 22 cents per share a year ago but significantly above the average analyst forecast of 6 cents per share according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Thomson Reuters sold a 55-percent stake in its Financial & Risk (F&R) unit to private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP last October in a deal that valued the unit, now a standalone business called Refinitiv, at about $20 billion.
The company has set aside $2 billion of the $17 billion proceeds from the Blackstone deal to make purchases to help grow its Legal, Tax & Accounting and Corporates businesses.
""We have a number of potential targets,"" Chief Executive Jim Smith told analysts on a conference call. ""We're in the process of prioritizing those targets and, in some cases, beginning some discussions, but we're not on the verge of pulling the trigger on something big right now.""
Smith told Reuters News in an interview that market valuations were ""challenging.""
""We have to make certain we find not only the right strategic fit but the fit that makes financial sense as well. It's a pretty frothy M&A market at the moment,"" he said.
Smith said U.S. tax reforms were helping stimulate demand for the company's tax and accounting products.
""Rapid regulatory change is good for our business,"" he said.
Legal, Corporates and Tax & Accounting are the three biggest units following the F&R deal. 
Excluding exchange rates, Legal revenue rose 4 percent during the quarter to $599 million. Tax & Accounting sales rose by 8 percent to $248 million. Sales to corporate clients rose by 7 percent to $315 million. 
""We were encouraged by sales growth during the quarter,"" said Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman. ""There are still many moving pieces in the results following the sale of the F&R business, but Thomson Reuters is seeing early signs of success in accelerating sales growth and improving profitability.""
Earnings were better than expected due to a lower tax rate and the share buyback, Weissman said.
For 2019, the company forecast adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, up from $1.4 billion in the current year.
The company has retained a 45-percent stake in Refinitiv, which sells data and news primarily to financial customers. Under the agreement with Blackstone, Refinitiv will make minimum annual payments of $325 million to Reuters over 30 years, adjusted for inflation, to secure access to its news service, equal to almost $10 billion in all.
Refinitiv revenue grew by 3 percent, excluding currency movements, to $1.55 billion during the quarter, Thomson Reuters said.
Thomson Reuters, controlled by Canada's Thomson family, is the parent of Reuters News. Revenue from Reuters News more than doubled to $155 million, reflecting a first-time contribution from the Refinitiv deal. Smith told analysts on a conference he expects the division to be a stronger contributor to the overall profitability going forward.
For 2018 as a whole, Thomson Reuters reported overall revenue growth of 4 percent. Revenues excluding the impact of the Blackstone deal rose by 2.5 percent. 

For 2019, the company is forecasting organic revenue growth of 3 to 3.5 percent. For 2020, it expects revenue growth of 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent, in line with December guidance.

(Reuters) -  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) missed Wall Street forecasts for quarterly sales on Tuesday, as a snowy winter prevented many Americans from remodeling home exteriors in a housing market that is slowing on the back of high prices.
Shares of the largest U.S. home improvement retailer fell 3 percent, with losses limited by the promise of $15 billion in share buybacks and a 32 percent boost to its dividend.
Separately, official data on Tuesday showed U.S. housing starts hitting a two-year low in December on falling construction of both single and multi-family housing, a significant source of revenue for Home Depot and smaller rival Lowe's.
Home Depot said cold weather during December and January hit sales in the three months to Feb. 3.
""It was cold, it was snowy, and perhaps worst of all, it was wet,"" Home Depot Chief Executive Craig Menear said on a conference call with analysts.
Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome added that the company had not expected such a wet winter. ""Sometimes, weather-driven demand can help sales growth, sometimes hurt,"" Tome said.
Fourth-quarter sales at U.S. Home Depot outlets open at least for a year rose only 3.7 percent, lagging Wall Street analysts' forecasts of a 4.5 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The Atlanta-headquartered retailer also projected full-year earnings below estimates, forecasting $10.03 per share, against expectations of $10.26.
The projections come as Home Depot invests billions of dollars in bolstering its e-commerce operations and store infrastructure as it battles Lowe's and online stores including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Investors were ""unimpressed"" by the Home Depot's outlook, said GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders.
""There are definitely some concerns that Home Depot's business will come under more pressure as the economy and housing market slow down,"" he said.
Still, Home Depot's forecast of a 5 percent rise in full-year same-store sales beat expectations of a 4.45 percent increase.
Overall fourth-quarter sales of $26.49 billion missed Wall Street estimates but showed an 11 percent growth from a year earlier.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-owned bank Caixa Economica Federal is close to selling a 9-billion-real ($2.4 billion) stake it owns in oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday.
The share offering of the 2.3 percent stake owned by Caixa in Petrobras, as the oil company is known, depends on the publication of a new presidential decree authorizing the sale, the sources said, asking for anonymity to discuss private plans.
President Jair Bolsonaro has already signed a first decree authorizing Caixa to sell its Petrobras stake, but the decree had technical mistakes and needed to be republished, they said.
Once the new decree is signed, Caixa will hire investment banks to help manage the secondary share offering. 
Press representatives at Caixa Federal declined to comment.
The sale of the Petrobras stake will be the second divestiture led by Caixa since Chief Executive Pedro Guimaraes took the helm at the state bank last month, after the sale of a 2.4 billion reais stake in reinsurer IRB Brasil Resseguros SA. The IRB share offering will be priced later on Tuesday. 
These shares in IRB are owned by a government fund responsible for financing education and managed by Caixa.
Caixa owns 3.2 percent of Petrobras common stock directly and 1 percent of non-voting capital.
Both transactions will be led by Caixa's recently created investment banking unit, with around 30 bankers recruited internally.

Guimaraes recently appointed new senior management officials at Caixa. Andre Laloni, former head of UBS AG in Brazil and the Southern (NYSE:SO) Cone, is the new chief financial officer, while former  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA executive, Luciane Ribeiro, will lead Caixa's asset management unit.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Shareholders of Brazil's Embraer SA approved a deal on Tuesday to sell 80 percent of the company's commercial plane division to Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, enabling Boeing to compete with Airbus SE in the market for jets with up to 150 seats.
About 96.8 of shareholders voted in favor of the deal after Embraer overturned an injunction that had put the shareholder meeting on hold. The transaction must now be approved by antitrust regulators around the world.
Embraer shares surged as much as 4.6 percent in Sao Paulo trading.
Under the terms of the deal finalized in December, Boeing will pay $4.2 billion to control Embraer's most profitable division, supplying passenger jets to airlines. 
It positions Boeing to better rival Airbus, which last year bought a controlling stake in Bombardier Inc's CSeries planes - which also have less than 150 seats - putting Airbus in direct competition with Embraer.
Embraer shareholders' approval of the Boeing deal caps more than a year of negotiations in Brazil since the companies announced their talks. Behind the scenes it was more than two years since the idea was presented internally to Boeing, a person familiar with the matter said in July.
Brazil's government, which holds veto power over important business decisions at Embraer, a former state company, said last month that it would not block the partnership. 
Once the transaction receives full regulatory approval, Boeing and Embraer will be joint owners of a yet-to-be-named commercial jet company, of which Embraer will own 20 percent, and Boeing, 80 percent.
The deal will provide a cash influx that the Brazilian planemaker has defended as crucial to its survival as increased competition between Boeing and Airbus squeezes out smaller rivals. 
""The potential operation with Boeing will save Embraer,"" lawyers for the Brazilian planemaker said in July in a court filing as it battled an earlier challenge to the deal. 
Embraer executives said earlier this year they would be able to wipe out the company's current debt thanks to Boeing's cash, giving them what they described as a fresh start. 
But critics say the arrangement will leave Embraer weaker and financially dependent on its two remaining divisions, executive jets and defense, both of which have posted losses in recent quarters. 

Shareholders also approved a joint venture between the two planemakers to market Embraer's new KC-390 military cargo jet. Embraer will retain ownership of the plane's intellectual property, but hopes Boeing will drum up orders from allies of the United States.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) has lodged a complaint with the London Metal Exchange (LME) about the company's inability to take speedy delivery of aluminum from warehouses owned by ISTIM UK in Port Klang, Malaysia, two sources familiar with the matter said.
London-listed commodity trader and miner Glencore bought 200,000 tonnes of aluminum on the LME late in January and made preparations to take that metal from ISTIM's warehouses.
Metal entering the LME's global warehouse storage network is issued with a title document called a warrant. In order to take delivery of metal from the network, buyers need to cancel the warrants - earmarking it for delivery.
The metal is then shipped after being scheduled for delivery on a first come, first served basis.
To get the metal out quickly, Glencore moved to complete the formalities and create a queue of more than 50 days before the end of January, which would have activated the LME's load-in, load-out (LILO) rules for warehousing, the sources said.
LILO rules were ushered in as part of sweeping LME reform sparked by accusations from consumers that banks and traders were hoarding metal in LME warehouses.
The rules stipulate that if a warehouse has a queue of more than 50 days, it must load out all the metal delivered in the previous three months.
But the rules were not triggered in this case because ISTIM said there was no queue at its warehouses in Port Klang at the close of business on Jan. 31, sources said.
""The load-out rules are complicated and ISTIM ... argue they didn't have a queue in January, that the queue didn't exist before midnight February 1,"" a metal industry source said.
Glencore, the LME and ISTIM declined to comment.
LME data shows queues to take aluminum out of LME-approved warehouses owned by ISTIM in Port Klang jumped to 118 days at the end of January from zero in December.
This means the 222,713 tonnes deposited in ISTIM's warehouses in Port Klang between November and January would have had to be delivered in February, March and April. That would be above ISTIM's 2,500-tonne daily rate.
""The LME's warehousing rulebook is a labyrinth and both Glencore and ISTIM are inferring different things. We think the difference comes from where they think the queue starts,"" an aluminum trading source said.
Warrants would have been canceled at ISTIM's London office by Glencore's brokers. The process for getting metal into the queue then includes rent payment, provision of shipping instructions and customs-clearance documents.
Once these formalities are complete, the rules require the warehouse to process requests for delivery on the basis of 48 hours' notice and in the order in which they were received.
""Glencore is probably arguing the queue starts when the process is complete, while ISTIM will have said they had a further two days to allocate delivery slots,"" the aluminum trading source said.

Cancelled aluminum in ISTIM's Port Klang warehouses stood at 309,800 tonnes at the end of January, up from 30,000 tonnes at the end of December.

531,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 07:48AM ET</span>",Hyundai set for Elliott showdown as it rejects $6.3 billion payout call,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Group on Tuesday rejected demands by U.S. activist investor Elliott Management for a combined 7 trillion won ($6.3 billion) dividend payout and new board members, complicating efforts to revamp South Korea's second-biggest conglomerate.
Opposition from Elliott led Hyundai to drop an earlier attempt to overhaul its ownership structure and executive vice-chairman Euisun Chung pledged in January to complete a restructuring expected to pave the way for him to succeed his father Mong-Koo Chung as group chairman.
""I think Elliott expected that its proposals would be rejected by Hyundai. Its purpose is to rally support from other shareholders for a vote on a restructuring plan,"" Park Ju-gun, head of corporate analysis firm CEO Score, said.
Elliott, which was not immediately available for comment, had proposed a 2018 dividend of 4.5 trillion won for Hyundai Motor and 2.5 trillion won for auto parts supplier Hyundai Mobis, regulatory filings show.
The two had proposed payouts of nearly 1 trillion won.
Hyundai will hold an annual shareholders meeting on March 22, when shareholders will vote on dividend and board members.
The group is expected to come up with a revised proposal, which is expected to be put to a vote at extraordinary shareholders meeting in April or May, Park said. 
Hyundai Motor said in a regulatory filing that the dividend proposed by Elliott would lead to a ""massive cash outflow,"" hurting future investments and shareholder value. 
Hyundai Mobis also said it would ""undermine its future competitiveness"" as it needs to invest more than 4 trillion won to develop new vehicles over the next three years. 
Instead Hyundai Mobis announced a 2.6 trillion won shareholder return package over the next three years, less than Elliott's demand for at least 4 trillion won.
The Hyundai Mobis package includes dividends worth 1.1 trillion won, a buyback of stock worth 1 trillion won and a cancellation of 460 billion won worth of shares.

In September, the investment bank had expected losses to be $1.8 billion in excess of its reserve. The bank did not give specific details on why it raised its loss estimate.
The amount disclosed in Tuesday's filing is considered a separate accounting item from legal reserves, and covers all matters considered ""reasonably possible"".
Apart from the lawsuits Goldman is already facing, it is being investigated by Malaysian authorities and the U.S. Department of Justice for its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1Malaysia Development Berhad.
The Malaysian government said in December it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB.

The bank added $844 million to its legal and regulatory provisions last year, more than four times what it set aside in 2017, though it did not specify the purpose.

533,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 07:27AM ET</span>","Platinum Partners' Nordlicht, others face $1 billion fraud trial in NY","By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Platinum Partners chief Mark Nordlicht and other executives of the now-defunct hedge fund group are due to go to trial on Tuesday on charges they defrauded investors out of $1 billion.
Opening statements are expected to begin in the morning before U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in federal court in Brooklyn.
On trial alongside Nordlicht are David Levy, who was Platinum's co-chief investment officer; Joseph SanFilippo, who was chief financial officer of Platinum's flagship Value Arbitrage fund; and Daniel Small, who was a Platinum managing director. All have pleaded not guilty.
Prosecutors charged the defendants in December 2016 with orchestrating two fraudulent schemes involving Platinum, which struggled to attract large institutional clients despite years of golden returns from niche and unsavory investments.
In one scheme, Platinum was accused of overvaluing its often-illiquid assets to collect higher fees, and falsely reporting annualized returns topping 17 percent.
Authorities said Platinum operated ""like a Ponzi scheme"" by using new money to fund redemptions by earlier investors, which were referred to internally as ""Hail Mary time.""
The second alleged scheme centered on Black Elk, a Platinum-controlled oil exploration company. Prosecutors said the defendants defrauded Black Elk's bondholders out of $50 million by diverting the proceeds of asset sales to Platinum ahead of Black Elk's 2015 bankruptcy.
Reuters described Platinum’s use of related parties in its Black Elk bond vote in an April 2016 Special Report: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-hedgefunds-platinum
Nordlicht has said in court papers he believed in good faith Platinum would resolve its liquidity issues and that the company's collapse was caused by press coverage about the government's investigation ahead of the indictment. He claims the reporting may have been fueled by leaks from prosecutors.
Cogan ruled last Tuesday that Nordlicht could introduce evidence about the effect of media coverage of the investigation on Platinum's finances, but not about the source of the leaks.
Prosecutors have not publicly named their witnesses, though they are likely to include investors. Former Platinum Chief Operating Officer Naftali Manela and former Chief Marketing Officer Andrew Kaplan have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, according to a person familiar with the case, suggesting they may testify as well.
Platinum's assets are currently being liquidated under the oversight of court-appointed receivers. 
(To read more, see: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-platinum-idUSKBN14D0FP)
Platinum was also implicated in corruption charges brought by Manhattan federal prosecutors against the former head of New York City's prison guard union, Norman Seabrook, and Platinum co-founder Murray Huberfeld. Seabrook was found guilty last August of taking a bribe to invest $20 million of union funds in Platinum.

Huberfeld pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy last May for his role in the scheme.

Ocado, founded by three Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) bankers 18 years ago, has been transformed in the last year after it struck major deals to sell its technology to international retailers such as U.S. group Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co, France's Casino.
The Evening Standard report suggested Ocado would use M&S as a supply partner for British customers. It was not clear what this would mean for its current partnership with the John Lewis-owned Waitrose supermarket chain.

Shares of the Dow component fell 3.3 percent in pre-market trading. The stock has risen by more than 25 percent from an October low, and it ended at its highest level since Oct. 16 on Monday.
UBS analyst Steven Fisher cited concerns about Caterpillar’s construction business and its energy and transportation (E&T) division. He sees construction sales falling 8 percent in 2020, “driven by lower demand” in multiple major geographic regions, including North America and China. E&T sales are seen falling 5 percent, “driven by a slowdown in pipeline capex.”
UBS expects Caterpillar’s 2020 earnings to fall 8 percent from 2019 “as continued growth in mining and buybacks will not be enough to offset headwinds in construction and oil & gas.” The firm cut its earnings estimates for both 2020 and 2021.
These earnings declines, Fisher wrote, were not priced into the stock, and “we expect downward earnings revisions to pressure the stock over the next 12 months.”
UBS stands as only one of two firms with a sell rating on Caterpillar, according to Bloomberg data. Eighteen firms have a buy rating on it and 10 view it as a hold. The average price target is $149, which is roughly 5 percent above Caterpillar’s Monday close.

538,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 06:20AM ET</span>",JPMorgan’s $50 Billion Fund Is Selling Stocks on Dovish Fed,"(Bloomberg) -- One of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management’s largest mutual funds is selling stocks on wagers a dovish Federal Reserve is signaling burgeoning risks to global economic growth.
Eric Bernbaum, co-portfolio manager of the firm’s $50 billion Global Income Fund, has cut European and emerging-market stock exposure to about 27 percent in February from 31 percent in October. He continues to favor junk bonds, though has also loaded up on low-risk, highly liquid money-market investments -- an asset class he didn’t own this time last year -- as a buffer.
The Fed’s “more dovish pivot should be recognized that it was taken because they had a less favorable view of both markets and economic growth,” New York-based Bernbaum said in a telephone interview. “The risk reward trade-off -- both from a return perspective and certainly from a yield perspective -- is more attractive in corporate credit today than it is in equities.”
The risk of a U.S. recession in the next 12 to 18 months is still “pretty low,” and the central bank action is likely to to push out the economic cycle “a bit further,” he added.
Bernbaum’s strategy comes as the Fed signaled that it’s done raising interest rates until inflation accelerates in the world’s biggest economy, switching from last year’s expectation of further gradual hikes. After nine increases since 2015, economists including those from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). have pared back their calls for rate hikes, citing a higher bar for the central bank to ratchet up borrowing costs in 2019.
The $1.7 trillion money manager is still positive on risk assets, but sees junk bonds as a safer avenue to play the dovish Fed-induced rally, according to Bernbaum. Low default rates and sound fundamentals make riskier corporate debt attractive, and the fund is likely to continue adding money into the asset class, he said.
U.S. junk bonds comprised 27 percent of the fund, while about 9 percent was invested in European junk, according to JPMorgan.
Below are edited comments on his views on other asset classes:
Short Duration Buffer
Agency mortgages and short-duration fixed-income instruments comprise 12 to 13 percent of the portfolio today -- a mix of money-market type assets as well as very high quality corporate credit and asset backed-securities. This makes us very comfortable with our meaningful weight in high-yield credit, where we know at times liquidity can be restricted.
Range-Bound Treasuries
Our expectations on yields have come down moderately -- we see fair value for 10-year Treasury yields by the end of the year in a range of 2.5 to 3 percent. If we start to see yields creep up toward 3 percent it might become an entry point to add a bit more high quality duration assets to the portfolio.
Rich Dollar
The greenback will remain relatively range-bound this year, although from a longer-term valuation perspective, the dollar looks a bit rich. We expect there to be a bit more nuance in how the dollar moves relative to emerging-market currencies.
China Risk
We do recognize that there are some upside risks to China should there be resolutions to discussions between the U.S. and China on trade. In the near term though, some of the structural and important issues -- things like cyber security or intellectual property rights -- are going to be hard to resolve.

541,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 05:11AM ET</span>","Standard Chartered resets growth targets with cost cuts, divestment plans","By Sumeet Chatterjee and Lawrence White
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) PLC has unveiled plans to double returns and dividends in three years by cutting $700 million in costs and boosting income, even though the bank missed its previous targets in tough market conditions.
Chief Executive Bill Winters now aims to achieve a return on tangible equity (RoTE) of at least 10 percent by 2021 despite only reaching 5.1 percent last year, short of the 8 percent by 2018 goal he set himself three years ago.
StanChart, which makes most of its revenue in Asia, has seen its fortunes slump as restructuring under Winters repaired a balance sheet hit by excessive lending in the previous decade, but left the bank struggling to lift profit.
The 150-year-old group's latest plans coincide with a risk of a slowdown in its core emerging markets due to the China-U.S. trade war as well as economic uncertainties in China and Britain, two of its main markets.
Winters on Tuesday said selling low-returning business such as ship leasing and private equity, and growing income in markets such as India and Korea, would help StanChart hit the new goals despite tougher global economic conditions.
""We've transformed the bank over the last three years and we're going to transform it again,"" Winters said after the bank published full-year results.
StanChart shares fell 1.2 percent in London following the results, as analysts were disappointed by the bank's full-year profit of $2.5 billion.
RESTRUCTURING
The bank also said its 45 percent stake in Indonesia's PT Bank Permata Tbk, valued at around $835 million, was ""no longer core"", indicating a potential move towards a sale. StanChart did not elaborate on divestment plans.
Top investors in the bank signaled a willingness to back Winters' plan to tweak rather than completely overhaul StanChart's strategy, despite the failure to hit previous goals.
""Never a quick fix,"" said Hugh Young, managing director for Asia Pacific at Aberdeen Standard Investments, StanChart's third largest shareholder.
""The combination of cost containment , tidying (Permata) and revenue growth could (and hopefully will) get them back to that double digit RoTE,"" he said. 
StanChart said it aimed to improve returns in India, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia, four large markets that have been a drag on its financials, accounting for 21 percent of costs but just 13 percent of profit.
Winters ruled out selling any of those four businesses, saying the bank would try to win more affluent customers and partner with financial technology firms to increase market share.
StanChart shares have fallen 40 percent since Winters, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) banker, took over in June 2015. Total returns to shareholders have fallen 35 percent.
Winters was paid 5.95 million pounds ($7.82 million) in 2018, up 27 percent from the previous year as long-term incentives vested for the first time since he joined the bank.
Last year, the bank's London shares dropped 22 percent compared with a 15.6 percent fall for rival  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA).
Winters, in addition to cutting risky lending, has also worked to improve senior bankers' accountability and exit some businesses.
COST TARGETS 
To stimulate growth, StanChart has invested in retail banking and wealth management technology platforms in the last couple of years, which increased costs but has yet to yield significant return.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford told staff in October the bank had made ""virtually no progress"" in meeting cost targets and urged managers to consider cutting jobs, paring back travel expenses and freezing recruitment.
The bank's costs rose 2 percent in 2018 to $10.1 billion. But it said continued cost discipline would enable sustained investments, as well as the potential doubling of full-year dividend by 2021 from 15 cents per share last year.
The bank reported a 5.5 percent rise in 2018 pre-tax profit to $2.55 billion, hit by $900 million in provisions to cover any impact from regulatory investigations in the United States and Britain.

StanChart last week said the provision related to the potential resolution of U.S. investigations into alleged sanctions violations and foreign exchange trades.

The deal would increase Bamboo Airways’ Boeing fleet to 55. The carrier’s parent, property and leisure company FLC Group, agreed last year to buy 24 Airbus SE A321neo planes worth $3.2 billion at list price. The airline began service in January.
A Bamboo Airways representative declined to comment on the potential deal.
FLC shares rose as much as 2.6 percent to the highest level in almost six weeks while the benchmark VN Index fell 0.7 percent.
Bamboo Airways will sign a separate deal deal with Boeing to buy 10 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners worth about $3 billion Wednesday, ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s summit in Hanoi. In June, it signed a commitment for 20  Boeing Co  . 787-9 Dreamliners with a list price of $5.6 billion before customary discounts.
Bamboo Airways said it plans to fly to the U.S. later this year or early 2020, according to a statement on its website. The carrier is considering routes to Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration this month gave its approval to Vietnam’s air-safety system, which will allow the Southeast Asian country’s airlines to fly to the U.S. as it seeks to bolster tourism.

Sweden's public broadcaster alleged last week that money laundering could have occurred in relation to at least 40 billion crowns ($4.3 bln) transferred between Baltic accounts at Swedbank and Danske Bank between 2007 and 2015.
Following the report the Swedish bank appointed EY to analyze material and conduct an external investigation into the claims.
""To secure that the external investigation meets necessary demands Swedbank has today decided to replace EY with Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA),"" it said in a statement.
British-based FRA specializes in forensic accounting, data analytics and financial investigations and has experience in regulatory probes, anti-money laundering and terror financing cases.
""We have noticed some criticism in the media and since we think it is very important that the conclusions, which will come from the external investigation, should not be questioned, we have chosen to replace the investigator,"" Swedbank spokesman Gabriel Franke Rodau said.
Danske is being investigated in five countries over some 200 billion euros of suspicious payments from Russia, ex-Soviet states and elsewhere that were found to have flowed through its Estonian branch.
Swedbank said FRA would report the results of the external investigation to the CEO and board by its March 28 annual general meeting.
Financial regulators in Sweden and Estonia have opened a joint investigation following the Swedish media report.

The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.2 percent by 0842 GMT, in line with France's CAC 40 and Germany's trade-sensitive DAX. The index closed at its highest level since Oct. 9 on Monday.
The FTSE 100 was down 0.7 percent as sterling rallied to one-month highs after reports that Prime Minister Theresa May is considering delaying the March 29 deadline for the country's exit from the European Union. An announcement could come as soon as Tuesday. 
The blue-chips hit their lowest since Feb. 11 in early deals. With the majority of its companies' income coming from abroad, the FTSE 100 is often pressured by a stronger pound.
Broader enthusiasm over trade talks cooled. Even though U.S. President Donald Trump said he would delay a tariff hike on $200 billion of Chinese imports in the clearest sign yet that both sides were making progress, he also said a deal had not yet been sealed and there was still a lack of detail on what emerged from the Washington talks.
Among individual moves, Denmark's Jyske Bank was the biggest faller on the STOXX 600 after its results, while Peugeot owner PSA was on track for its worst day since December as investors locked in profits after the French carmaker's record results. Slightly weaker-than-expected sales also weighed.

AVALON, Australia (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has been shifting spare parts between its distribution centers in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the world in preparation for Brexit, an executive said on Tuesday.
Britain's potential exit from the European Union without a deal has proven a headache for the global aerospace industry which relies heavily on integrated supply chains and parts distribution centers. 
""We are having our spares positioned in the right place,"" Ken Shaw, the head of supply chain management for Boeing's services business, told Reuters at the Australian International Airshow. 
""We are continuously looking at the demand signals because we didn't have to worry about it before between the London distribution center and shipping a part to France. Now we are having to be more purposeful so we are redistributing inventory.""
Airbus SE said this month it had spent tens of millions of euros on stockpiling parts and securing IT systems.
Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) Holdings PLC effectively moved the home for its best-known jet engine designs to Germany last month to avoid regulatory delays or sales disruption after Brexit.
Shaw said Brexit was not expected to have much of an impact on Boeing's manufacturing because its parts from Britain were mostly shipped to the United States and elsewhere rather than continental Europe.
""The underlying supply chain to make it has been a relatively easy thing for us just because of the nature of our product flows,"" he said.
""We are in pretty good shape but we have moved some parts around and we have done some redistribution to put things where we needed to just in case. We are about as ready as we can be not knowing what the outcome is going to be.""
Other challenges for Boeing include ensuring suppliers can keep pace with its rapid production expansion plans as it looks to overcome persistent delays on engines and other issues that have hobbled the 737 factory to varying degrees since last summer.
Boeing is currently building 52 of its top-selling 737 aircraft per month at its Seattle-area factory. The manufacturer plans to speed up to 57 planes per month in June if it can smooth out supplier delays, Reuters reported this month, with the potential to later move to 63 a month if suppliers can keep up.
Shaw said Boeing was taking a disciplined approach to production rate increases, both from an airline demand perspective and a parts supply perspective.

""You get to a point where you have to relax a bit and make sure you are at a good spot before you take that next step,"" he said. ""That is why we do these rate breaks where we will go to a rate and stay there.""

Bonds will likely get a $24 billion boost, while stocks will see a $26 billion outflow by the end of the month, Wells Fargo strategists led by Boris Rjavinski wrote in a Feb. 25 report. Pension rebalancing flows tend to be heftier at the ends of quarters, as not all funds update monthly, the strategists said. But with stocks running laps around bonds, managers may not be prefer to wait that long.
“We expect many funds that would normally wait until quarter-end to join the more frequent ‘monthly rebalancers’ in the next few days,” the strategists wrote. “This would be a significant-size asset reallocation in historical context, and certainly one of the largest non-quarter-end pension portfolio adjustments.”
Most of the equity outflows are projected to be from domestic large-cap and small-cap portfolios, while global developed stocks may see modest selling and emerging markets hardly any at all, the Wells Fargo team wrote. Initial inflows into fixed income will likely be via liquid Treasury futures contracts, they predicted.
“Sizable pension flows from equities to bonds could amplify other market drivers this week,” especially if anything ranging from the U.S.-North Korea summit to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress triggers a risk-off move, the strategists said.

Investing.com -  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) is heading back to the U.S. after a gap of nearly 30 years - and the market doesn't like it.
Shares in the French carmaker are down 4.0% and are at the bottom of both the CAC 40 index in France and the Euro Stoxx 50, lagging a market which is correcting downwards after hitting its highest level in nearly five months on Monday. At 04.00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the Stoxx 600 index was down 0.3% at 371.14.
The market is worried that the group, which has gone from strength to strength under chief executive Carlos Tavares, is biting off more than it can chew. Launch costs will be high, competition fierce, the current business cycle in the U.S. is old and nobody really knows what vehicles will be wanted in tomorrow's 'mobility' market. And it's not the only launch Peugeot is planning: It also wants to break into the Indian market with its Citroen brand, and build out newly-acquired Opel in Russia.
But the company needs to diversify outside of Europe, where it sells more than 75% of its vehicles. The acquisition of GM's European operations has reinforced that geographical concentration - even if it has immediately restored profits to brands that had lost money constantly for 20 years. It expects the European market to stagnate.
On the other side of the channel, U.K. stocks are among the worst performers this morning, partly as a result of the Brexit paradox: news of a possible delay to Brexit has launched sterling higher, which depresses the accounting value of all the dollars that FTSE-listed miners, oil companies and drinks makers generate. The FTSE 100 is down 0.8%, and it's conspicuous that the better performers are those exposed less to global markets, such as retailers  Next  (LON:NXT)and Marks and Spencer (LON:MKS).
Elsewhere, Germany's Dax and Italy's FTSE MIB are both down 0.3%.

The company — which counts  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) Plc, Procter & Gamble Co, L'Oreal SA as customers — also reported pretax profit for the full year that missed estimates.
Croda's shares were down 3.8 percent to 4,870 pence at 0817 GMT and were among the top losers on the UK bluechip index.
The company — which logs 96 percent of sales and 80 percent of production outside the UK — said it was reviewing which ports could be used for moving its products and has full EU recognition for the imports and exports.
Croda also said it was re-registering UK products sold in the EU to ensure compliance, mainly with the EU's Reach program, which requires companies to register the substances used in production.
Reach registrations in the UK may no longer be valid for sale of products in the EU, although the UK government has confirmed that EU-held Reach registrations will continue to be valid in the short term for products coming to the UK.
Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 and Prime Minister Theresa May is yet to secure parliamentary approval for a divorce deal agreed with the EU last year, increasing the chances of a disorderly exit from the bloc.
Croda, which announced a special dividend of 115 pence per share, on Tuesday said an orderly transition of the UK out of the EU is expected to be manageable for the company.
Adjusted profit before tax rose 3.5 percent to 331.85 million pounds ($436.28 million), but missed analysts average estimate of 332.84 million pounds, according Refinitiv IBES.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global private language tutor Education First (EF) is considering selling a part of its China business which could value the unit at over $2 billion, people with knowledge of the situation told Reuters.
The company, privately held by founder Bertil Hult's family, has tapped JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) to work on the potential sale, the people said, cautioning however EF is still weighing which part of the China business to sell and that a process has yet to start. JPMorgan declined to comment.
EF opened its first school in Shanghai in 1993 and now has teaching centers in over 50 cities in China, offering language courses for children of all age groups and adults as well as study tours, its website says.
One of the people close to the company said EF is looking for a private equity investor in its children's business in China only and should be rolling out the stake in about three months.
EF did not respond to a request for comment. The people declined to be named as the information is confidential.
The sale will likely attract interest from private equity firms, the people said, as education assets are usually cash-rich with stable income from prepaid tuitions and other fees.
Last year, Chinese investors spent $7.8 billion on 64 education deals at home and overseas, up from $2.2 billion in 2017, according to Refinitiv data.
China’s overall private education market was worth about $260 billion last year, according to a June note from LEK Consulting, and is growing at around 9 percent a year in the next two years.
The country makes up a big portion of EF's global revenue, with the bulk coming from children's language learning programs, according to two of the people familiar with the company.
Founded in Lund, Sweden in 1965, EF features language travel programs and now has 612 schools in 114 countries or regions, according to its website. It also runs boarding schools and business schools in the United States and Britain.
The company, now headquartered in Lucerne, Switzerland, also boasts sponsorship deals with a number of sports tournaments, including the Olympic Games and a professional cycling team.

The Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier announced late on Monday that January-March profit is set to fall between 65% and 75% year-on-year.
“In addition to a usual weak seasonal quarter, the company’s revenue for Q1 2019 is expected to be significantly negatively affected by reduced orders from customers,” AAC said in a stock exchange filing.
The profit warning came after Apple reported last month that iPhone revenue in the December quarter fell 15% from the previous year, citing weak sales in China.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgraded AAC to ""underweight"" from ""equal-weight"" after the warning, saying the earnings report was worse than expected.
Shares of the company last traded at HK$51.05 by 1:10 AM ET (06:10 GMT), down 13.2% and is on course for its worst single-day drop since July 2017."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares lost steam on Tuesday after scaling a five-month high as investors waited to see if Washington and Beijing can clinch a trade deal, while the pound advanced on hopes UK Prime Minister Theresa May will delay a Brexit deadline.
Spreadbetters pointed to a weak start for Europe with futures for London's FTSE off 0.6 percent even as fears of a no-deal Brexit faded. U.S. stock futures were down too, with E-Minis for the S&P 500 falling 0.4 percent.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.5 percent from its highest since mid-September as U.S. and Chinese negotiators work to hammer out a deal that would end a protracted tit-for-tat tariff battle.
President Donald Trump said on Sunday he would delay a tariff hike on $200 billion of Chinese imports in the clearest sign yet that both sides were making progress in the talks, but he also sounded a note of caution, saying a deal ""could happen fairly soon, or it might not happen at all.""
Tuesday's losses in Asian stock markets came as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts urged investors to ""curb some of their enthusiasm"" over the trade talks, saying the extension to the deadline was a ""foregone conclusion"".
""Most assumed this action would occur,"" they added. ""And it is notable that 1) no new deadline date has been set and 2) there weren't any formal statements published from either side following the talks in Washington.""
Elsewhere, Indian markets were battered amid concerns about flaring border tensions between India and Pakistan, both of which have nuclear arms. The broader NSE stock index skidded, the rupee fell and bonds rose in a flight to safety.
Australian shares lost 0.9 percent, weighed by energy stocks as oil prices tumbled overnight.
Chinese shares see-sawed between positive and negative territory after a sharp rally the previous day.
Japan's Nikkei stumbled 0.4 percent as some selling pressure built ahead of the fiscal year-end.
Investors were also wary of weakening estimates for current quarter earnings, with Wall Street on Monday expecting a 0.9 percent decline in S&P first-quarter earnings per share compared with expectations for 5.3 percent growth on Jan. 1, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
BREXIT DEADLINE
In currency markets, sterling jumped to $1.3149, a near four-week high, in early Asian trade after Bloomberg reported May was expected to allow her cabinet to discuss extending the Brexit deadline beyond March 29 at a crunch meeting later in the day.
The news was a relief to investors who had feared Britain would crash out of the European Union without a deal. However, a delay could anger May's pro-Brexit colleagues who might then support a vote of no confidence in the government, potentially triggering a general election. 
The dollar fell against the safe-haven Japanese yen from its highest since late December. The greenback was last at 110.77. 
The dollar index was mostly flat at 96.399 against a basket of currencies. 
Markets are now awaiting testimony from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to a U.S. Senate committee on Tuesday, after the central bank last month shifted to a more cautious stance on further interest rate hikes.
""The market will be looking for signs the Fed remains comfortable with the current state of policy,"" said Steven Dooley, currency strategist at Western Union Business Solutions. ""The markets will also want to hear details about the eventual end of the Fed's balance sheet reduction program.""
Investors will also keep an eye on a two-day U.S.-North Korea summit this week where leaders of the two countries will try to reach an agreement on Pyongyang's pledge to give up its nuclear weapon program.
Oil prices fell again after posting their largest daily percentage drop this year on Monday as Trump called on OPEC to ease its efforts to boost crude prices, which he said were ""getting too high."" 

U.S. crude was last down 32 cents at $55.16 a barrel while Brent eased 20 cents to $64.56.

The S&P BSE Sensex Index slid as much as 1.4 percent, set for its biggest loss since Jan. 2, after the Pakistan army said India fighter jets violated an agreed border between the two countries. The rupee slid as much as 0.5 percent to 71.3375 per dollar, before paring some losses on suspected central bank intervention, traders said.
“It’s hard to imagine these tensions will subside going into the election period and will remain an ongoing overhang on the rupee,” said Prakash Sakpal, an economist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV in Singapore. “The aberration of the rupee from a positive sentiment in broader EM space is certainty the result of heightened border tensions.”
Indian fighter jets destroyed a major terrorist camp in Pakistan, the ANI news agency said, as tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals rose following a terrorist attack in Kashmir this month. Quoting unnamed sources in the the Indian Air Force, the agency said a dozen Mirage 2000 Indian fighter jets dropped 1000 kilogram bombs on terror camps across the Line of Control, the de-facto border between the two countries in disputed Kashmir.
The rupee is already Asia’s worst performing currency this year ahead of general elections due by May where Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces a tough fight from opposition parties. The yield on the most-traded 2028 bonds was steady at 7.59 percent, while spreads on State Bank of India’s 2024 dollar bonds widened seven basis points.

555,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 26, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>",ZTE's Stunning 5G-Fueled Rally May Still Have Legs in 2019,"(Bloomberg) -- ZTE Corp (HK:0763). went from one-foot-in-the-grave to 2019’s technology superstar. Despite a gain of more than 60 percent that’s pushed its shares well above analysts’ projections, some investors argue that rally still has legs.
ZTE’s embarked on a remarkable comeback. The smaller rival to closely held Huawei Technologies Co. became one of the 10 best performers on the MSCI China Index this year after soaring roughly a third over the past week, propelled by growing optimism over its role in next-generation wireless as well as seeming progress in U.S.-Chinese trade talks. That’s a far cry from 2018, when Washington’s ban on American technology exports briefly brought the company to its knees.
The flip side to the rally is a valuation that has bloated to about 20 times 2019 earnings -- roughly 20 percent above its average over the past three years. And its Hong Kong shares are trading 39 percent higher than their average price target.
Investors are betting China’s largest listed producer of networking gear will be a prime beneficiary for global 5G spending estimated in the hundreds of billions of dollars -- and especially at home, the world’s largest telecommunications arena. After a huge loss in 2018, it’s projected to report net income of more than 4 billion yuan ($600 million) in 2019. Its advocates also argue that, so long as U.S.-Chinese trade negotiations don’t collapse and market sentiment holds up, ZTE will continue to find favor.
“ZTE acts like an option on China-U.S. trade talks. The optimistic views have the upper hand now,” said Zhang Gang, an analyst with Central China Securities Co. “As for if the 5G business will boost the share price, it depends on company’s earnings numbers and the development of 5G projects.”
ZTE regained its footing in 2018 after agreeing to pay a hefty U.S. fine and reshuffle management, and the view is that smoother U.S.-Chinese relations will speed its recovery by keeping open a supply chain heavily dependent on American imports.
“Its turnaround is the best entry point, especially with 5G becoming even more of a force for its business next year,” said Hung Yuting, a fund manager at China Capital New Opportunity Fund who holds the stock. “The value of ZTE may be re-evaluated due to the recent positive news related to the company.”
Bruce Yu, a fund manager with Franklin Templeton SinoAm Securities Investment Management Inc., said the trend for ZTE was positive but he would wait for dips in the stock before buying in. And there’re others even less sanguine about whether demand for 5G gear justifies ZTE’s valuation. It remains a bit player in a market dominated by its far larger domestic cousin, Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Nokia (HE:NOKIA).
“The earnings estimate and contribution of 5G business doesn’t seem to be as big as the public thought,” said Vincent Hsu, a fund manager at Fuh-Hwa Securities Investment Trust Co. “Stock surges related to 5G topics are more like a bull market powered by dreams. The actual gains from the 5G business aren’t big enough to support the price jump.”

The Hong Kong-listed firm late on Monday forecast January-March profit to fall 65-75 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, and said its gross profit margin would narrow.
""In addition to a usual weak seasonal quarter, the company's revenue for Q1 2019 is expected to be significantly negatively affected by reduced orders from customers,"" AAC said in a stock exchange filing.
AAC supplies acoustic and haptic components to Apple, which last month said revenue from iPhone sales in the December quarter declined 15 percent from the previous year. The U.S. tech firm issued a rare revenue warning citing weaker iPhone sales in China where economic growth is slowing.
AAC said profitability would increase due to improvement in its product portfolio, production efficiency and cost control. It also expects customers to upgrade their smartphone offerings.
The announcement comes as fellow Apple supplier Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd late on Monday said 2018 net profit likely rose a 61 percent.
Jefferies analyst Rex Wu said in a research note last month that Luxshare's expected earnings growth reads ""negatively on its peers' order allocation and margin, including AAC"", and that Luxshare's fourth-quarter earnings were likely boosted by the firm winning increased iPhone custom.
The price of AAC shares had risen 29 percent so far this year as of the previous market close.
On Tuesday, the stock fell as much as 13 percent to HK$50.85, versus a 0.7 percent fall for the benchmark Hang Seng Index, and was the fourth most actively traded in early trade.

AAC is scheduled to announce first-quarter earnings at the end of May.

557,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2019 11:21PM ET</span>","SEC seeks contempt charge against Tesla's Musk, says tweet violates deal","By Alexandria Sage
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is pursuing a contempt order against Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc CEO Elon Musk, saying he violated a fraud settlement by tweeting material information without preapproval, sending the firm's shares down 5 percent.
The SEC's request potentially could reopen a turbulent chapter for the electric vehicle maker in which regulators last year accused Musk of fraud for making misleading tweets about plans to take the company private, and demanded that he be stripped of his CEO title.
Musk, Tesla and the SEC settled the lawsuit, and part of the settlement called for any material statements made by Musk on social media to be vetted in advance by the company.
In a court filing on Monday, the regulator pointed to a Musk Feb. 19 tweet: ""Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,"" noting that Musk did not seek or receive preapproval before publishing this tweet, which was inaccurate and disseminated to over 24 million people.
""Musk has thus violated the court's final judgment by engaging in the very conduct that the preapproval provision of the final judgment was designed to prevent,"" the SEC wrote in its motion filed on Monday in federal court in Manhattan.
The motion asks the judge to issue an order that would put the onus on Musk to show why he should not be held in contempt for violating the settlement. 
Musk corrected his tweet four hours later to say that the ""annualized production rate"" at year-end 2019 would probably be about 500,000, with deliveries expected to be about 400,000.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Musk shot back on Twitter on Monday night, tweeting: ""SEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k. How embarrassing …"".
Musk was referring to comments made by him in January to analysts that Tesla would make ""maybe on the order of 350,000 to 500,000 Model 3s, something like that this year"". 
Tesla and Musk agreed in September to pay $20 million each to the SEC, and the billionaire stepped down as the company's chairman but remained as chief executive. In the settlement, the agency pulled back from its original demand that Musk, who is synonymous with the Tesla brand, be barred from running Tesla, a sanction many investors said would be disastrous. 
The settlement was approved by a U.S. judge in October, who can now decide whether its terms have been violated. 
""NO RESPECT"" 
Musk provoked the SEC even after the settlement was signed, calling the agency the ""Shortseller Enrichment Commission"" on Twitter in October.
In a December interview with ""60 Minutes"", Musk said none of his tweets had been censored since the settlement, and that only those that could cause Tesla stock to move would need to be reviewed. 
""I want to be clear. I do not have respect for the SEC,"" he said, adding that he respected the justice system.
In its fourth-quarter shareholder letter, Tesla said that, barring unexpected challenges with the new Shanghai factory, Tesla targeted annualized Model 3 production of over 500,000 units sometime between the fourth quarter, and the second quarter of next year. 
In a response to the SEC's demand for information regarding the Feb. 19 tweet, a lawyer for Tesla and Musk said the CEO's tweet was meant to reiterate information already approved, then disseminated when the company released fourth-quarter earnings results in January.
Although the tweet was not pre-approved, the lawyer wrote, Musk believed its substance had been ""appropriately vetted, pre-approved and publicly disseminated."" Moreover, the lawyer said, the statement was made outside of market trading hours.
It was not immediately clear what the repercussions would be were Musk to be found in contempt, as such a citation does not necessarily mean the original agreement is now null and void.
The SEC could seek a so-called bar order, removing him from Tesla’s board, or could ask for a lesser penalty, like a monetary fine, said Stephen Diamond, a professor of corporate governance at Santa Clara University.
The SEC could also ask the court to reopen the original settlement for renegotiation, he said, perhaps asking that the original charges be reinstated.
""It’s a pretty unusual situation,"" Diamond said, adding that ""all bets are off"".
Tesla's board has added new members as part of the settlement, moves that some outsiders hope will increase oversight of Musk. Board member Robyn Denholm also was made chairwoman after Musk was stripped of that role, but she has not commented on the new incident.
Charles Elson, director of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware, said Tesla's board ""needs to seriously reconsider the company's relationship with Mr. Musk"".

""The board needs to act. End of story. And if they don’t, the question is how responsible are they?""

AVALON, Australia (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is in talks with potential customers globally, including the Royal Australian Air Force, about ordering the new T-X training jet selected by the U.S. Air Force for a $9.2 billion contract in September, an executive said on Tuesday.
""We really do see a fit and need for this across fleets all over the world,"" Thom Breckenridge, Boeing Vice President of International Sales, Strike Surveillance & Mobility, told reporters at the Australian International Airshow. ""We have been in discussions with several customers about the T-X globally.""
Australia, a major Boeing customer, is among the potential buyers of the T-X as it looks to replace its 33 BAE Systems (LON:BAES) PLC Hawk trainers within the next 10 to 15 years, Breckenridge said, declining to name other countries that were interested.
He said Australia had not yet issued a request for proposal but initial discussions about the T-X had been held with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).
""We are very eager to understand RAAF's needs and talk to them about why we see the benefits of T-X,"" Breckenridge said.
RAAF did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Alongside its 2016 Defence White Paper, Australia listed a future project called the ""lead-in fighter training system"" with a program time frame of 2022-2033 and an investment value of A$4 billion ($2.86 billion) to A$5 billion.
Boeing, in partnership with Sweden's Saab AB, in September beat out  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Italy's Leonardo SpA for the U.S. Air Force contract, which includes an initial 351 jets and 46 simulators.
The low price of the Boeing fixed-price contract surprised analysts, but CEO Dennis Muilenburg in October said on an earnings call that the T-X was expected to be a program with production and services opportunities for much of this century.

559,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2019 10:27PM ET</span>",Group of Walmart Mexico workers threatens strike for higher pay,"By Daina Beth Solomon
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A union representing workers at Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Mexico unit said on Monday it would go on strike next month if it did not secure better pay and conditions for thousands of employees.
The National Association of Trade and Home Offices, which holds 121 collective contracts across 10 states with Wal Mart de Mexico, or Walmex, said it was seeking a 20 percent salary hike over 2018 wage levels for the 8,000 workers it represents.
Mexico raised the daily minimum wage last month by 16 percent under new President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has vowed to improve wages as well as fight poverty and deep-seated inequality in the country.
The union also aims to establish a first-ever sales commission for clerks, to be set at 4 percent.
It also alleged that employees were not properly compensated for working overtime and that some staff suffered abuses including sexual harassment from superiors.
Walmex, Mexico's biggest retailer, said it saw the dialogue as positive when asked by Reuters for comment on the demands.
Regarding the allegations of abuse, a company spokeswoman said ""that information is completely erroneous"".
Mexico's conciliation and arbitration board is overseeing the talks, which have a March 5 deadline, said Eduardo Miranda, a spokesman for the union's umbrella organization, CROC.
Walmex has not yet presented a salary proposal during its three meetings with the union over the past month, he added, increasing the possibility of a strike.
The retailer has some 237,055 employees in Mexico and Central America, about 200,000 of whom are in Mexico, Miranda said.
Those represented by the National Association of Trade and Home Offices include janitors, cashiers, pharmacy clerks and warehouse workers. Their 2018 daily salaries ranged between 92 pesos and 169 pesos, or $4.81 and $8.83, Miranda said.

South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.3% by 9:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in Vietnam on Tuesday for a summit with Trump, who is expected to arrive in Hanoi later today.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said earlier that the two would meet for a one-on-one conversation Wednesday evening, followed by more meetings on Thursday.
On Monday, Trump told reporters he and Kim would have ""a very tremendous summit.""
""With complete Denuclearisation, North Korea will rapidly become an Economic Powerhouse. Without it, just more of the same. Chairman Kim will make a wise decision!"" Trump tweeted.
Meanwhile, China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component slipped 0.03% and 0.4% respectively. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.7%.
A trade deal between Beijing and Washington seemed to be edging even closer on Tuesday after Trump said the two sides “are going to have a signing summit” and that they are “getting very very close,” although he cautioned it is possible that the deal ""might not happen at all.""
Chinese stocks recorded the biggest daily gains since 2015 on Monday after Trump announced a delay in tariffs on Chinese goods, citing “substantial progress in trade talks with China.”
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.5%, while Australia’s ASX 200 slid 1.2%.
Looking ahead, a hearing from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to receive some focus as investors await the latest read on monetary policy and discussion of the central bank’s balance sheet.

561,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2019 08:05PM ET</span>",'Loser' vs 'Anemic': Barrick's Newmont bid starts on toxic note,"By Ernest Scheyder
HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (Reuters) - Long-time rivals Barrick Gold Corp and  Newmont Mining  Corp (NYSE:NEM) renewed their animosity on Monday with their chief executives trading insults after Barrick launched an $18 billion hostile bid for the U.S. company, presaging an aggressive battle. 
The tough talk underscored deep personality and cultural differences between the world's two biggest gold producers. Their past attempts to merge ended in acrimony in 2014, and the frictions could scuttle a deal this time too. 
Newmont's financial returns in recent years show its CEO, Gary Goldberg, is a ""loser,"" Barrick CEO Mark Bristow told Reuters. 
Goldberg, for his part, told Reuters that Bristow's ""credibility and experience"" and performance at Randgold (LON:RRS), which he led until last month when it was acquired by Barrick, was ""anemic.""
Adding to the residue of resentment at the mining companies from past merger failures, the current hostile climate between the companies reflects animosity between the CEOs, opposing management styles and clashing visions for how to achieve maximum shareholder value.
The animus between Bristow and Goldberg extended to a dispute over who extended his hand first for a handshake at a BMO Metals & Mining Conference in Florida on Monday. 
For investors, a Barrick-Newmont merger would bring under one roof some of the world’s most compatible gold mines and plants, which sit side by side in Nevada, and create a company likely to appeal to top shareholders seeking a haven for long-only money.
Barrick said there is more logic in a tie-up between the two than in Newmont’s planned $10 billion merger with Goldcorp. 
""I think in an environment of lower gold prices, everyone needs more synergies and the synergies of Nevada - Barrick and Newmont - should have been done a long time ago,"" said Greg Taylor of Purpose Investments, which holds Newmont shares.
Newmont rejected the Barrick bid, saying a joint venture was a better way to extract value from the two companies’ mines in Nevada.
The two CEOs said they have not met to compare financial records on the other's Nevada assets. Each blamed the other for not being willing to share information. 
""I drive trucks past ... processing plants in Nevada, because Gary won't share with me,"" Bristow said.
Goldberg questioned when he was in the state ""given that Bristow's not really spent much time in Nevada to begin with."" 
The Newmont CEO was adamant the Goldcorp deal was best for his company, contrasting it with what he described as Bristow's short-sighted reliance on cost-cutting to pump profits.
""We see great value,"" he said. ""It feels to us that wherever Mark (Bristow) goes, he seems to be just firing people in order to boost returns."" 
David Neuhauser of Livermore Partners, which holds Barrick shares, said the no-premium bid could ""over time suggest a premium multiple, given the long life and cash-generating abilities"" of the combined assets.
Van Eck and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), two large shareholders in both names, did not respond to requests for comment.
Major investors have taken on extra weight in the gold sector since many of the smaller metals funds disappeared after the 2015 to 2016 commodity slump. Those long-only funds, which do not invest in small companies, have largely driven the need for gold consolidation. 
""Passive investors will seal the fate of this deal,"" said Brian Madden of Goodreid in Toronto.
GOLDCORP
The bid now goes to shareholders, with Barrick asking Newmont's investors to approve bylaw changes that would ultimately make its hostile bid easier. 
The big loser would be Goldcorp, only just enjoying a share rally on the prospect of a tie-up with Newmont, which could be left without any potential buyers. 
Goldcorp's best hope is that it gets swept up in the next wave of activity, which many investors and analysts predict as a mighty Barrick sheds some of its assets.
""There is nothing Goldcorp can do to avoid the collapse of their deal,"" a banker who worked on the Randgold-Barrick deal said on condition of anonymity.

""Newmont and Barrick is the deal that should have always happened, at least for the past 20 years.""

564,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2019 06:18PM ET</span>",Warren Buffett says Berkshire overpaid for Kraft Heinz,"By Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer Ablan
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett said on Monday his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc overpaid in the 2015 merger that created Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co, but he had no plans to flee the struggling packaged foods company.
Buffett spoke four days after Kraft Heinz took a $15.4 billion writedown for its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands and other assets, slashed its dividend, and said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was probing its accounting.
Kraft Heinz's share price sank 27.5 percent on Friday, wiping out more than $16 billion of market value, and causing Berkshire to lose $4.3 billion on its stake. Berkshire owns 26.7 percent of Kraft Heinz.
""I was wrong in a couple of ways on Kraft Heinz,"" Buffett said on CNBC television. ""We overpaid for Kraft.""
Buffett did not say by how much Berkshire overpaid, but said the market reacted ""probably quite properly"" to the news.
He also said he has ""absolutely no intention"" of adding to or subtracting from Berkshire's stake in Kraft Heinz, saying the company had ""very, very strong"" brands and that he would be happy to own it a decade from now.
The comments were a rare admission of error by the 88-year-old billionaire on a major investment at his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate.
Berkshire and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz, which they bought in 2013, and own about half of the merged company.
Buffett said he may have learned about the SEC probe seven to 10 days before it was announced.
Greg Abel, a Berkshire vice chairman widely considered a candidate to succeed Buffett as Berkshire's chief executive officer, is a Kraft Heinz director.
Buffett also said he would continue to do business with 3G and its co-founder Jorge Paulo Lemann, calling him ""an absolutely outstanding human being.""
'TOE TO TOE'
Kraft Heinz's disclosure raised questions about 3G's financial strategy for the company, whose brands include Jell-O, Kool-Aid and Philadelphia cream cheese, and whether it is out of step with consumers seeking healthier, fresher alternatives to processed food.
Buffett acknowledged the changes, but said greater pressure is coming from retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST), saying the latter's Kirkland brand outsells all Kraft Heinz products.
Stronger brands can ""go toe to toe with Walmart or Costco"" but weaker brands ""tend to lose out,"" Buffett said. ""The ability to price has changed, and that's huge.""
Still, Buffett added: ""If I had to bet one way or another, I think people will eat more of our products this year than last year.""
Berkshire's own $3 billion writedown related to Kraft Heinz contributed to a $25.39 billion fourth-quarter net loss for Berkshire.
""He monumentally overpaid for Kraft,"" said Doug Kass, founder of the hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management Inc. ""Increasingly, the moats he initially saw in his investments have been damaged.""
The bad news also called into question 3G's signature business model of zero-based budgeting, which requires managers to justify their expenses annually from scratch, rather than use last year as a guide or pursue cost savings on an ongoing basis.
Kraft Heinz's belt-tightening resulted in more than $1.7 billion in annual savings, including the loss of thousands of jobs, mirroring 3G's similar efforts at such companies as Anheuser-Busch InBev and Tim Hortons.
The strategy has resulted in leaner companies, but could backfire if the companies lacked products that people wanted, or failed to spend enough to develop and market those products. 

Buffett said he did not believe 3G underinvested in Kraft Heinz, but it was hard for him to tell. Berkshire is not involved in day-to-day operations.

Earlier this month, the company named Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) Corp's Chief Operating Officer Rosalind Brewer as a director, the second black woman to serve on its board.
Amazon's eleven-member board now has five women including Nooyi, Brewer, Jamie Gorelick, Judith McGrath and Patricia Stonesifer.
The company last year said women and minorities are to be among its board nominees as part of a new policy to increase diversity on its board.
Nooyi, who will be part of the audit committee of Amazon's board, stepped down as the CEO of PepsiCo in October 2018 and as the chairman of the beverage-and-snack maker earlier this year.

566,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2019 05:38PM ET</span>",Wall Street rises after Trump stirs China trade hopes again,"By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's three major indexes ended higher on Monday but well below the session's highs after President Donald Trump said he would delay a planned hike in tariffs on Chinese imports. 
Postponement of the tariff deadline was seen as the clearest sign yet the two countries were closing in on an agreement to end their prolonged trade spat, which has slowed global growth and disrupted markets.
But gains were capped after weeks of advances for the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq, partly due to trade optimism and dovish signals from the Federal Reserve.
""A lot of the good news related to trade is priced in at this point,"" said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. 
""There's only so much we can rally when somebody says we're making progress... The trade stuff is a little bit of a sideshow. If you get back to looking at economic growth, it's clearly slowing.""
The S&P 500 index ended 4.9 percent below its late September record closing high after narrowing the gap to 4.3 percent earlier in the session. 
Investors were also looking ahead to an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell before a U.S. Senate committee on Tuesday.
""In the short term trade got taken off the table today so next up on the calendar is Powell speaking to Congress. It's possible investors are starting to clam up a bit because of what they think Powell may say,"" said Michael Cuggino, portfolio manager at Permanent Portfolio Funds in San Francisco.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 60.14 points, or 0.23 percent, to 26,091.95, the S&P 500 gained 3.44 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,796.11 and the Nasdaq Composite added 26.92 points, or 0.36 percent, to 7,554.46.
Investors were also wary of weakening estimates for current quarter earnings, with Wall Street on Monday expecting a 0.9 percent decline in S&P first-quarter earnings per share compared with expectations for 5.3 percent growth on Jan. 1, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
“It's hard to get valuations to continue to rise in the face of falling earnings estimates,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Boston.
Of the S&P's 11 major sectors, 7 ended the day with gains. 
After advancing as much as 1.4 percent, the financials index lost ground late in the day to close up 0.4 percent. 
The S&P technology index rose 0.5 percent. The Philadelphia semiconductor index climbed 0.8 percent as chip companies have a big exposure to China.
The industrials sector rose 0.4 percent, getting its biggest boost from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, which gained 10.8 percent after announcing a sale of its biopharma business to Danaher Corp (NYSE:DHR) for $21.4 billion. Danaher shares rose 8.2 percent.
A flurry of M&A activity also helped the risk-on sentiment. 
The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index rose 2 percent, its biggest boost coming from shares in Spark Therapeutics Inc, which soared 120 percent after Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding (SIX:ROG) AG agreed to buy it for $4.3 billion. 
The biggest laggards were the S&P's defensive sectors - consumer staples, utilities and real estate. The consumer discretionary sector also ended down 0.3 percent, with the biggest drag from  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), down 1.3 percent, on concerns about a soft housing market ahead of its quarterly results.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.14-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.05-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 58 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 128 new highs and 14 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.36 billion shares, compared with the 7.32 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An appeals court on Monday upheld a judge's decision dismissing a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to fight the practice of brand-name drug companies using a government petition system to delay cheaper, generic drugs from coming to market.
The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a federal court in Delaware had been correct in dismissing the FTC's lawsuit against Shire. Shire was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co last month.
The agency had objected to ViroPharma, which Shire acquired in 2014, filing 46 ""citizen petitions"" and other filings between 2006 and 2012 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding generic equivalents to its antibiotic Vancocin HCl, on the grounds that it resulted in delayed sale of a generic version.
But while the appeals court acknowledged that the delayed entry meant ""hundreds of millions of dollars in profits,"" it said that the petitioning activity had ceased and thus the company was not in violation of the law. This ruling agreed with what the lower court had said in March 2018.

The FTC said it ""regrets the court’s decision and is considering its options."" Shire owner Takeda did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

570,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2019 05:17PM ET</span>",Bank of America drops 'Merrill Lynch' name in rebranding effort,"By Imani Moise
(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) is dropping the ""Merrill Lynch"" name from some of its businesses, phasing out a brand with a long history on Wall Street as part of a multi-year marketing effort, the lender said on Monday.
The investment bank and capital markets business is ditching the 104-year old name to become BofA Securities and its wealth management businesses will collectively be called ""Merrill,"" without the Lynch. 
The individual units, Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, Merrill Edge and Merrill Guided Investing will keep their names. 
U.S. Trust, Bank of America's private bank which caters to ultra-high net worth clients, will become Bank of America Private bank, and Merrill Lynch Private Banking & Investment Group will become Merrill Private Wealth Management, dropping the ""Lynch."" 
In the past, rebranding has faced some opposition. The average age of financial advisers is in the mid- to late-50s, and many feel fierce loyalty to the brand of the firm where they have worked for years.
Before it was bought in 2009 in the throes of the financial crisis, Merrill Lynch was known for its powerful investment bank and ""thundering herd"" of financial advisers. The brand survived over the last decade, unlike other iconic firms like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns whose names faded away once they were acquired. 
Under the new ""Merrill"" umbrella, the firm will launch a new marketing campaign featuring the ""Merrill bull front and center,"" the company told Reuters in a statement. 

The change comes as Bank of America is working to boost morale in its investment bank after a year of declining market share and revenue and a string of departures by senior leaders.

Economists expect that housing starts slipped to an annual rate of 1.250 million units last month from 1.256 million previously.
Building permits, an indication of future demand, are also forecast to show a small decline to a rate of 1.290 million units from 1.322 million.
U.S. consumer confidence, meanwhile, is expected to improve to a reading of 124.7 in February, from 120.2 the prior month. The report will come from the Conference Board at 10 a.m. ET (15:00 GMT).
2. Fed Chief Powell Takes the Stand
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to deliver the central bank’s semi-annual Monetary Policy Report and testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday at 10:00 a.m. ET. (15:00 GMT). He’ll also appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.
Powell is expected to touch on some of the points raised in the Fed's ""Monetary Policy Report"" released on Friday.
The Monetary Policy Report is submitted semiannually to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and to the House Committee on Financial Services, along with testimony from the Federal Reserve Board Chair.
In the report, the Fed said indicators suggested the real gross domestic product increased at a ""solid rate"" in the second half of the year, though consumer spending had moderated toward the year end.
Powell will likely continue to tout ""patience"" on monetary policy tightening, though many market participants will he parsing the comments for any clues about how the central bank plans to end the process of trimming its balance sheet.
The minutes from the Federal Reserve January meeting showed that ""almost all"" market participants were eyeing an end to Fed's balance sheet shrinking program latest this year.

Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia scolded the government and parties late last year for closing the $69 billion dollar merger before the consent order was approved by the court. In response, CVS offered to halt some integration of the two companies.
With the government's request for final approval of the merger, Leon may sign off on the deal with no further ado or may decide to hold a hearing to allow critics to raise their concerns, said Andre Barlow of the law firm Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC, an antitrust expert who has been following the case.
The Justice Department approved the merger of CVS, a U.S. pharmacy chain and benefits manager, and Aetna in October on condition that Aetna sell its Medicare prescription drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans Inc. Both deals have closed. 

CVS declined comment for this story.

Stocks had opened strongly after President Donald Trump pushed backed a planned hike in tariffs on Chinese imports, citing progress in recent talks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.23%, or 60 points after rising as much as 209 points at session highs. The S&P 500 added 0.09%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.36%.
President Trump said the United States and China are ""very, very close"" to sealing a trade agreement. The positive remarks on trade came a day after the president had delayed raising tariffs on Chinese imports, set for Friday, citing ""productive"" trade talks.
With the threat of an escalation in the U.S.-China trade dispute on the wane, trade-sensitive Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) pushed industrials higher.
Still, the current 10% levy the United States has imposed on Chinese imports are expected to remain in place as an ""enforcement mechanism"" until China meets certain commitments like technology transfer, or intellectual property theft.
""While it is possible some tariffs could be removed more quickly as part of such a deal, we expect that some tariffs imposed last year to remain in place as an enforcement mechanism until certain commitments have been met,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note.
Industrial were also boosted by a surge in  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) after the conglomerate sold its biopharma to Danaher Corp (NYSE:DHR) for $21.4 billion. But some said the deal does little to alleviate the company's main problem concerning its power business.
In energy, stocks were pressured by a fall in prices after President Trump lashed out at OPEC, calling on the oil cartel to ""relax"" on prices.
Semiconductor companies, many of which have exposure to China, also saw gains on the positive trade news, ending the day up 0.8%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has gained more than 8% in February and is up 19.1% this year.

575,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2019 03:57PM ET</span>",Barrick CEO defends $18 billion hostile Newmont bid as logical tie-up,"By Ernest Scheyder
HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp's chief executive defended the world's largest gold producer's hostile $18 billion bid for  Newmont Mining  Corp (NYSE:NEM), saying on Monday the deal is ""logical"" for an industry battling high costs and depleting resources.
Barrick, which recently completed a $6.1 billion acquisition of Africa-focused  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS), launched its all-stock bid on Monday, encouraging the U.S. rival to ditch a previously announced $10 billion takeover of Canada's Goldcorp Inc.
""This gold industry needs to become more relevant to investors,"" CEO Mark Bristow said in an interview on the sidelines of the BMO Global Metals & Mining Conference in Hollywood, Florida.
Bristow, known for his straight-talking and hands-on approach in running Randgold before the merger, said this deal ""drives a further rationalization in our industry.""
Gold mergers and acquisitions have been scarce in recent years as companies focused on cutting costs in the face of investor criticism about capital management. But the need to bolster shrinking gold reserves to boost growth and take advantage of rising prices are providing the impetus for consolidation.
Barrick's offer for Newmont has pushed the combined value of unsolicited M&A deals globally to $48.2 billion so far this year, the highest since 2006, according to data from Refinitiv.
Newmont said it had reviewed and rejected possible deals with Barrick and said its own $10 billion planned purchase of Goldcorp made more business sense.
""One has to question what the true motives behind going hostile are: Whether it's really just to get bigger or it's all ego-driven,"" Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg told Reuters at the BMO conference, adding Newmont shareholders ""don't understand it (and) don't see the value potential.""
Barrick said its acquisition of Newmont was contingent on the company scrapping the deal to buy Toronto-listed Goldcorp, adding that its offer was a ""significantly superior"" option for Newmont shareholders.
Goldberg said earlier on Monday a joint venture was a better way to extract value from the two companies' mines in Nevada, the largest producer of gold and silver among U.S. states.
Newmont has 19 mines in the state, adjacent to Barrick's own operations. Reuters had reported https://www.reuters.com/article/us-barrick-gold-newmont-mining/barrick-in-talks-with-newmont-to-combine-nevada-gold-operations-sources-idUSKCN1NA1GC in November that the miners were in talks to combine their operations in the state.
Talks of a joint venture fell through over Newmont's demand for management control, Barrick's Bristow said on a conference call with analysts. The deal marks Bristow's first major strategic move at Barrick since taking the top position in January.
Newmont's board of directors would ""fully evaluate the Barrick proposal and respond in due course,"" the company said.
Gold sector deals took off when Barrick paid $6.1 billion for rival Randgold, a deal that closed last month. That set off a fresh wave of bids, including Newmont's offer for smaller miner Goldcorp, which would make the Colorado-based firm the world's top gold miner if it closes as planned next quarter.
Shares of Newmont fell 0.7 percent to $36.22 at mid-afternoon, while Barrick's Toronto shares dropped 2.7 percent.
Barrick is offering 2.5694 of its common shares for each Newmont share. That translates to about $33 per Newmont share, valuing the company at $17.85 billion, according to Reuters calculations.
The deals come as gold prices are rising, with gains of some 11 percent since October.
Newmont shareholders would hold about 44 percent of the combined company's outstanding shares.

Barrick said the new company would match Newmont's annual dividend of 56 cents per share which, based on the offer, would represent a pro-forma annual dividend of 22 cents per Barrick share.

576,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 25, 2019 03:20PM ET</span>",UBS Forecast Has S&P 500 Climbing to a Record by June,"(Bloomberg) -- The rebound in stocks since Christmas has been breathtaking. Sentiment among Wall Street analysts is being repaired with similar speed.
The latest example is Keith Parker at UBS Group AG. The strategist in January slashed his 2019 forecast for the S&P 500 from the second-highest among those tracked by Bloomberg to below consensus. Now, he says the benchmark will climb to new highs by the end of June, approaching his year-end target of 2,950. The index recently traded close to 2,805, about 4 percent below the record 2,930 reached in September.
A lot of things have changed this year, particularly the Federal Reserve. After raising interest rates in December in the face of one of the bull market’s worst sell-offs, the central bank has tempered its stance on monetary policy. In keeping rates unchanged in January, Fed officials indicated they will be “patient,” a sign to many they’d put rate hikes on hold and were prepared to be more flexible on shrinking the balance sheet.
“A more ‘patient’ Fed helped turn risk sentiment,” Parker wrote in a note to clients Monday. “With the Fed providing a key circuit breaker, we see U.S. equities hitting new highs in the second quarter assuming a positive outcome from U.S.-China trade talks and a recovery in U.S./global growth.”
Parker is the latest strategist floating the idea of record highs as the S&P 500 is off to the best start of a year in three decades. Earlier this month, Savita Subramanian at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) pinned the hope on a trade deal between the U.S. and China while Tony Dwyer at Canaccord Genuity highlighted broadening market momentum as evidence in support of a sustained rally.
UBS economists expect the Fed to end the Treasury runoff in July. That alone would add 1.5 percent to the S&P 500’s price-earnings ratio as investors become more willing to pay up for risky assets such as equities, Parker estimated.
Moreover, implied volatility, or perceived risk, in the bond market has collapsed to record lows while the Cboe Volatility Index, an options gauge for the S&P 500 known as the VIX, stayed relatively elevated. Historically, that’s a bullish sign for stocks, UBS found. As the firm’s data showed, the S&P 500 has tended to rise 10 percent on average over the next six months when equity volatility relative to the bond market has been as high as it is now.
The Fed has shown support for the financial market, but money managers continue to be skeptical about stocks, an indication to Parker that the rally has further to go. From hedge funds to computer-driven traders, their exposure has held one standard deviation below historic average, according to UBS data.
“Investors have money on the sidelines they can put to work,” Parker said. “Positioning has risen from the extreme lows, but it is still supportive of further equity upside, in the event of positive catalysts for equities.”"

""2019 gets off to a strong start in the equipment finance industry... Credit quality is stable,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said in a statement.
Companies signed up for $7.2 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up from $6.9 billion a year earlier. However, borrowing fell 43 percent from $12.7 billion in December.
""Business owners continue to expand their operations and acquire productive assets, even as interest rates edge up ever so slightly, with the Fed signaling a cautious wait-and-see posture for additional interest rate hikes this year,"" Petta said.
Washington-based ELFA, a trade association that reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 76.1 percent in January, down from 77.9 percent in December.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days.

579,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2019 03:00PM ET</span>",Pharma stocks could see turbulence from U.S. Senate drug-price hearing,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare stocks could face more turbulence on Tuesday, after a bumpy early 2019, as top executives from some of the largest pharmaceutical companies are expected to get grilled in the U.S. Senate on the high cost of prescription drugs.
The Senate Finance Committee hearing on drug pricing is likely to turn up the volume on the debate over healthcare costs, an issue looming as a potential negative for the sector's performance in the coming months.
As the 2020 U.S. presidential race heats up, drug companies could become political targets, causing unease for investors who hold the stocks, as was the case ahead of the last presidential election in 2016.
""I think the rhetoric is still going to be pretty harsh,"" said Jeff Jonas, a healthcare portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds. ""I don’t think any actual policy is going to be implemented, but I think the rhetoric is going to be an overhang.""
Chief executives and other top officials are expected at Tuesday's hearing from  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV), AstraZeneca Plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Merck & Co Inc,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA.
""We expect the hearing to be negative for the group, and continue to believe investors are under-pricing the risks,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst David Maris said in a research note.
Kevin Gade, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor focusing on pharmaceutical and biotech stocks, said he expects the executives to point the finger for high drug prices elsewhere in the drug-supply chain, such as at pharmacy benefit managers or insurance companies.
""I don’t think pharma is going to be able to win them over,"" Gade said, adding that ""you can only hope...that anything disastrous is avoided.""
So far this year, the S&P 500 healthcare sector has climbed 7 percent against a nearly 12 percent gain for the overall S&P 500, which is the benchmark index for large U.S. companies. S&P 500 pharmaceutical companies are up only 4 percent with S&P 500 biotech companies overall up 4.8 percent.
Investors said healthcare has underwhelmed this year largely because it was the best-performing major S&P 500 sector last year, as investors sought healthcare as a relative safe-haven when the market became more volatile at the end of 2018.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. health stocks lag in 2019 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2BU892P)
But they added that the political concerns also could be weighing on the group.
Although Republicans control the Senate committee running Tuesday's hearing, drug pricing and the cost to U.S. consumers is expected to get a fresh spotlight with Democrats having taken control of the House of Representatives in January.
Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, last week recommended that investors underweight healthcare stocks in part because the companies ""are in the sights of both Democrat and Republican lawmakers, an important point as the 2020 presidential campaign cycle gets under way.""

""They are an easy target because the electorate really dislikes the American healthcare system,"" Colas said in a note.

580,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2019 02:57PM ET</span>","Madoff trustee can pursue lawsuits against Koch, banks, others","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. federal appeals court said the trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff's firm may pursue dozens of lawsuits to recoup funds from defendants including Koch Industries Inc, long controlled by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, and major banks.
Monday's decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan overturned November 2016 dismissals by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein in Manhattan.
It gives the trustee Irving Picard a chance to add hundreds of millions of dollars to the $13.36 billion he has recouped for former customers of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC.
The trustee has estimated that the customers lost $17.5 billion in Madoff's fraud, which was uncovered in December 2008.
Picard had sued Koch,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), UBS AG and others in 88 lawsuits to recoup funds traceable to the imprisoned swindler, but which had been sent outside the United States.
The lawsuits targeted foreign entities that had received Madoff-linked money from other foreign transferees, including ""feeder funds"" that sent client money to Madoff.
Writing for a three-judge panel on Monday, Circuit Judge Richard Wesley said the later transfers qualified as domestic because the money originally came from Madoff's firm.
He said comity, or the need to let other countries enforce their own laws, and the presumption that U.S. bankruptcy law did not reach foreign activity should not block the lawsuits.
""Congress wanted these claims resolved in the United States, rather than through piecemeal proceedings around the world,"" Wesley wrote.
The defendants had accused Picard of pursuing a ""radical expansion of the reach of U.S. law."" Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
David Sheehan, a lawyer for Picard, said the decision protects victims of Madoff's Ponzi scheme, and recognizes the ""compelling"" U.S. interest in letting domestic bankruptcy estates recover fraudulently transferred property.
Sheehan and Picard are partners at the law firm Baker & Hostetler.
Picard had sued Koch to recoup $21.53 million allegedly sent by Madoff to Fairfield Sentry, a British Virgin Islands-based feeder fund, and then to a Koch entity in Great Britain.
The trustee did not allege wrongdoing by Koch, a privately held industrial conglomerate based in Wichita, Kansas.
Charles and David Koch are each worth $51.9 billion, and tied as the world's 10th-richest people, Forbes magazine said. David Koch stepped down from Koch Industries last year because of health issues.
Madoff, 80, is serving a 150-year prison term in a medium-security North Carolina prison.

The case is In re: Picard, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 17-2992.

581,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2019 02:39PM ET</span>",GE inks $21 billion biopharma sale to Danaher in U-turn under Culp,"By Ankit Ajmera and Manas Mishra
(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) said on Monday it would sell its biopharma business to Danaher Corp (NYSE:DHR) for $21.4 billion in the biggest strategy reversal since Lawrence Culp took over as the industrial conglomerate's chief executive in September.
GE rejected an approach by Danaher for that business a year ago. But its stance changed after Culp was appointed CEO and GE board's became more open to a deal, according to people familiar with the negotiations who requested anonymity to discuss them.
As a result, GE will receive some $20 billion in net proceeds which it will use to trim its debt pile, which stood at $121 billion at the end of December. 
Both GE's and Danaher's shares jumped on news of the deal, though GE still faces significant hurdles in recovering its former corporate glory. It lost two-thirds of its market value in the last two years amid a series of operational and investment missteps.
Among its challenges are mismanagement of orders and operations in its power business, and dealing with its toxic long-term care insurance liabilities in its GE Capital arm. 
""(The GE-Danaher deal) unfortunately doesn't solve the real issues which comes back to power. That's what took the stock down, and that's still going to take some time play out,"" said Richard Grasfeder, a portfolio manager at Boston Private Wealth LLC, which held about 478,204 shares in GE as of the end of 2018, down from 787,600 shares a year earlier.
Culp said on Monday the sale to Danaher, where he was instrumental in revitalizing the company as its CEO, was a pivotal milestone in efforts to turn around GE, a 126-year old conglomerate.
""It demonstrates that we are executing on our strategy by taking thoughtful and deliberate action to reduce leverage and strengthen our balance sheet,"" Culp said in a statement.
The biopharma sale also propelled a broad rally in GE's roughly $120 billion of bonds, which had taken a pounding in late 2018 as it became clear that earlier restructuring efforts were falling short and that the company would need to take more aggressive action to address its debt load in particular.
Larry Culp ""has earned his stripes. It is clear that nobody in his job before him - John Flannery or Jeff Immelt - would have probably been able to pull off this transaction with Danaher,"" William Blair & Co analyst Nicholas Heymann said.
""And the price Danaher is paying GE is two times our expectations. This is a home run. It really turns the page now for GE to address liquidity concerns,"" Heymann adds.
Until recently, the company had plans to spin off the entire healthcare unit. Culp, however, said in January that GE would sell nearly half of the unit.
Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday that GE will put the initial public offering of the unit on hold until the deal with Danaher closes, expected in the second half of the year.
This would mean that GE is likely to retain access to the earnings and cash flows of the remaining healthcare businesses for a longer period of time, alleviating some cash concerns, even as the power business struggles, said Rene Lipsch, lead GE analyst at Moody's.
BOOST FOR DANAHER
The purchase is also the biggest yet for Danaher, which has a history of deal-making, and half of its revenue has come from companies it has acquired in the past seven years. 
The deal will expand Danaher's presence in the biopharma industry, providing it with access to tools for research and development of drugs. Shares of the medical equipment maker rose more than 9 percent to a record $124.07.
Danaher expects to add 45 cents to 50 cents per share to its adjusted profit in the first full-year after the deal closes, and does not expect any ""significant"" anti-trust challenges.
""These are really complementary businesses when you look across the portfolio of the product line on GE biopharma's side and our side,"" said Danaher's Chief Executive Officer Thomas Joyce on a call with analysts.
The biopharma business accounted for 15 percent of GE's healthcare business revenue in 2018. It makes instruments and software that support the research and development of drugs.
The sale leaves GE's healthcare unit with its medical device unit, which makes X-ray, CT scan and MRI machines, and its pharmaceuticals diagnostic unit.
The announcement also further eased concerns about GE's solvency that had grown markedly last year, reflected in a surge in the price for GE credit default swaps (CDS) during the fourth quarter, a form of insurance against default. On Monday, GE's CDS prices sank to their lowest since mid-October.

GE, which reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter profit in January, is expected to provide its 2019 outlook on a call on March 14.

586,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2019 01:27PM ET</span>","Car industry will be big 5G customer down the road, says SEAT","By Isla Binnie
BARCELONA (Reuters) - Carmakers will be big customers for next-generation telecoms networks, helping to justify investment in 5G, but need to be more innovative if the technology is to take off, Spain's SEAT said on Monday.
The deployment of 5G promises to link everything from vehicles to household devices but will require prodigious investment and the telecoms industry is trying to agree on if and how 5G can facilitate enough innovations to be profitable.
Luca de Meo, chief executive of Volkswagen-owned SEAT, said applications were currently ""pretty limited"", before unveiling what he described as Europe's first 5G-connected concept car at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
Still, he said connecting a car with a passenger's mobile phone, or external infrastructure or retailers could lead to billions of possible transactions.
""I think personally the automotive industry will play a big role in justifying the investment so we will be one of the big customers but we need to be creative,"" De Meo told Reuters. 
""We need to experiment and look at functionalities and hopefully the market will say, OK, I want to buy a car like this because it can prevent an accident or it can see around the corner and I value that and I (will) pay for it.""
5G will help to slowly develop autonomous driving, where the costs of installing sensor technology are already falling, De Meo said. That market is expected to be worth as much as $95 billion in 2020.
But ethical questions, issues of infrastructure and how traditional cars will coexist with driverless ones make it very difficult to say when the market will take off, he said.
SEAT expects the next version of the Minimo concept car, an electric model in which one passenger sits behind the driver, to be equipped for autonomous ""L4"" everyday driving in cities. 
""We see the potential in the car-sharing platform,"" De Meo said, adding costs could be slashed 50 percent if cars could be tracked, did not have to be moved and were constantly running and so did not pay for parking. 
In Barcelona, SEAT tested systems like putting thermal cameras in traffic lights to detect the presence of pedestrians and feed the data back to the car.
De Meo said a car can potentially produce as much data as 3,000 smartphones, so should be a ""pillar"" of the so-called ""Internet of things"", whereby everyday objects are linked up by chips that can communicate with each other.

LONDON (Reuters) - Packaged food giant Nestle has hired bankers at Rothschild to sell its Herta packaged meat business, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. 
The mandate follows Nestle's announcement earlier this month that it was putting the processed meat company on the block as it seeks to focus on its faster-growing enterprises. 
One source estimated the business could fetch a ballpark price of around 500 million Swiss francs in a sale. The sources declined to be identified as the situation is private. 
Herta sells processed meat in France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and Ireland. It had 2018 sales of about 680 million Swiss francs ($680.07 million).
""What makes this review a very good and strong option, is the fact that we've seen a very significant recovery in the business, very significant turnaround underway over the last two years that bolstered operating profitability and growth, and really positioned the company quite well,"" Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider said this month on a conference call.
Another source on Monday said Nestle was likely to present the business to other players in the field, which include Germany's Reinert, and private equity firms, especially those like IK Investment Partners that had vied for Kalle, the German sausage casings maker that U.S. buyout house Clayton Dubilier & Rice bought in 2016. 
Nestle is also in the process of selling its much larger skin health business.

Officials at Nestle and Rothschild declined to comment.

The company announced a new flagship Xperia 1 handset at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Monday, which has an HDR OLED screen, optimized using Sony's Bravia TV technology. It also has the ability to take photos and record 4K video in a 21:9 ratio. 
Mitsuya Kishida, president of Sony Mobile Communications, said Sony had a rich heritage of meeting the technological demands of professional filmmakers in both sound and vision.
""Our new Xperia will deliver genuine technologies with a multitude of professional grade features to create entertainment experiences that are only possible with Sony,"" Kishida said at the Congress.
The company has also brought the 21:9 screen ration to two mid-range smartphones: the Xperia 10 and Xperia 10 plus.
Ben Wood from CCS Insight said the handsets were nicely designed but it was hard to see how they would stand out from the crowd.
""We are unconvinced that the 21:9 ratio is differentiated enough despite Sony's strong credentials in content,"" he said.
Industry analyst Paolo Pescatore at PP Foresight said the new devices were a ""step in the right direction, but Sony continued to face monumental challenges in competing with rivals who are rolling out new devices, rich with new features at punchy prices"".
""In particular Asian smartphone makers who are moving at stealth mode and growing market share very quickly, as underlined by latest announcements from Huawei and Xiaomi,"" he said. 
The two Chinese companies both announced 5G devices at the event on Sunday. Huawei, which is challenging Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for the No. 2 spot in smartphone sales, behind leader Samsung (KS:005930), created a buzz with a folding smartphone.

(Reuters) - The Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, admitted on Monday he knew less than he thought about  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL), the company overseen by fellow billionaire Larry Ellison.
Investors were flummoxed earlier this month when Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, revealed that during last year's fourth quarter it had exited a $2.13 billion stake in Oracle that it had taken the prior quarter.
It is rare for Berkshire, which owns some stocks for decades, to unwind an investment so fast. It is also rare for Berkshire to make large investments in the technology sector.
Speaking on CNBC television, Buffett recalled his unsuccessful investment in International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp in determining that Oracle, the company, wasn't for him, though Ellison had done a ""fantastic job"" running it.
""After I started buying it, I felt I still didn't understand the business,"" Buffett said. ""Particularly after my experience with  IBM , I don't think I understand exactly where the cloud is going.""
The Oracle of Omaha is a nickname that Buffett's fans often use for him. His conglomerate is based in Omaha, Nebraska.
Berkshire said it ended the year with $172.8 billion of stocks, including $40.3 billion in iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which Buffett views more as a consumer company.
He said the total may rise in 2019 because it has become tough to buy whole companies to add to Berkshire's portfolio of more than 90 businesses, including the Geico auto insurer and BNSF railroad.
It is unclear why Berkshire's annual report on Saturday omitted a previously included section called ""acquisition criteria,"" including that Berkshire preferred ""simple businesses (if there's lots of technology, we won't understand it).""

Buffett and longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger ceded day-to-day oversight of Berkshire's operating units last year to Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain.

(Reuters) - U.S. auto sales are expected to drop about 1 percent in February from a year earlier partly due to inclement weather, according to industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive.
The consultancies see U.S. total vehicle sales of about 1.29 million units in February.

Retail sales in February are expected to reach 946,600 units in February, a 2.4 percent fall from a year earlier, the consultancies said on Monday.
The industry should expect to receive a slight boost in the coming months with the recovery of any lost sales due to inclement weather, said Thomas King, senior vice-president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power.
However, average transaction price is on pace to reach $33,267, the highest ever.
Elevated transaction prices remain a bright spot for the industry and continue to help manufacturers maintain profitability amid reduced sales volumes, King said in a statement.
LMC also forecast 2019 total light-vehicle sales of 17 million units, a decline of 1.9 percent from 2018, provided there is no material impact from U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.

Earlier this month, the National Automobile Dealers Association announced that U.S. light-vehicle sales fell by 3 percent in January due to the partial government shutdown.

The 11 lawmakers urged the Department of Homeland Security and the Energy Department to prevent Huawei from providing solar inverters, which convert solar energy to power that is usable on power grids for U.S. energy companies.
""Both large-scale photovoltaic systems and those used by homeowners, school districts, and businesses are equally vulnerable to cyberattacks. Our federal government should consider a ban on the use of Huawei inverters in the United
States,"" the lawmakers said in a letter.
The letter was signed by Republican Senators John Cornyn, Richard Burr, James Risch, Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton, Susan Collins, Ben Sasse and Mitt Romney as well as Democratic Senators Mark Warner, Dianne Feinstein and Independent Angus King.
Huawei is a relatively recent entrant to the U.S. power market, but has developed a new generation of low-cost solar inverters, which convert, manage and monitor energy produced by solar panels for home use.

The United States has sought to exclude Huawei from providing equipment like routers and switches to U.S. telecommunications companies, and has accused the firm of conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran and stealing U.S. technology.

HOLLYWOOD, Fla (Reuters) - Freeport-McMoRan Inc Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said on Monday his company has been investing heavily to mitigate any danger from tailings dams and is ""comfortable"" with engineering designs in place at existing dams.
Adkerson's comments come a month after a Brazilian tailings dam controlled by rival Vale collapsed, killing more than 300. 
Investors have grown anxious in the wake of that disaster about the rising risk of tailings dams, which are effectively depositories for the muddy detritus of the mining process. Of the three main types of tailings dams, Vale was using one considered the least safe at the operation in Brazil that collapsed.
""Early on, we recognized this as a major risk area for our company,"" Adkerson said at an industry conference in Florida. ""Fundamentally, we're comfortable with the system that we have been putting in place in managing this risk.""
Phoenix-based Freeport controls 19 active tailings dams in the United States and Peru, and monitors 55 inactive dams, including some first built in the 19th century. None are in Brazil. 
""We've invested significantly in reclaiming"" those old sites, Adkerson said, without providing specific dollar amounts.
Freeport uses a mix of tailings dam designs, including the one used by Vale in the Brazilian disaster. 
Adkerson stressed he feels that Freeport, the world's largest publicly traded copper producer, has a superior inspection system. German firm TÜV SÜD has been faulted by Brazilian officials for faulty inspections of Vale facilities.
""The use of the system that we have designed mitigates the risk of catastrophic tailings failures,"" Adkerson said.
Elsewhere, Adkerson, 72, repeated recent claims that he is not interested in a large-scale acquisition and has no immediate plans to retire.
""I'm enjoying work now a lot more than in recent years,"" said Adkerson, who signed a deal late last year for Freeport to relinquish majority control of the world's second-largest copper mine under pressure from the Indonesian government, even though the company will remain the project's operator. That deal took years to close and had become a major impediment to Freeport's growth options.

""I'm younger than Donald Trump and he's talking about a second term,"" he said.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Europe risks falling behind other regions in rolling out 5G mobile services because of onerous regulation and weak investment rather than any security concerns about Chinese equipment, Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) CEO Borje Ekholm said on Monday.
High spectrum fees, regulatory uncertainty and a lack of investment were more pressing concerns, Ekholm said, alluding to calls by the United States to ban Chinese network vendors on national security grounds. 
""The debate here often becomes: it's the lack of technology for operators, that's what slowed down Europe. And that’s not the case,"" Ekholm said in an interview on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress, the telecoms industry's main annual gathering.
""The reality is that less than half of the countries in Europe have actually given out spectrum for 5G. It's a big uncertainty how much it's going to cost."" 
Ericsson has forecast that 5G subscriber numbers could reach 1.5 billion worldwide by 2024 as consumers and businesses move to next-generation networks slated to bring super-fast connections for everything from computer gaming through to medical surgery.
North America and northeast Asia will adopt the new technology fastest, the company said in a report last year, but 5G is also expected to account for about 30 percent of mobile subscriptions in Western Europe. 
Ericsson has signed 10 contracts for 5G with operators in countries including the United States, Britain, Australia and Switzerland, Ekholm said, but still faces challenges in Europe around the large number of operators and high spectrum fees.
He said Europe had more than 200 operators to contend with, against only a handful in China and the United States, and pointed to 5G spectrum auctions in Italy last year which raised 6.5 billion euros ($7.38 billion) in a ferocious bidding war
The prices in Italy, he said, were equivalent to almost two years' capital expenditure for some operators.
""It's a very heavily regulated sector, so overall the investment climate I think is the key reason why we have been slow,"" he said. 
SECURITY WARNINGS 
Ekholm took no position on calls by the United States for Western countries to bar China's Huawei from their networks over allegations the company and its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying.
But debate is raging in Europe over whether to heed the U.S.-led warnings, even as big telecoms operators say that such a move could set back the deployment of 5G by years.
Huawei has repeatedly denied the accusations of state-spying and no evidence has been publicly produced.
Nokia (HE:NOKIA) CEO Rajeev Suri told Reuters on Sunday any future decision to bar Huawei would not delay the rollout of 5G in Europe, pointing instead to delays in issuing spectrum to operators and high auction costs as the main obstacles.
Asked if he agreed with his competitor's assessment, Ekholm said he was not willing to speculate and it was for individual countries to decide how they managed their national security policy.
Ekholm said Ericsson was preparing for any eventuality by investing in product development and having a supply chain which can ramp up 5G demand if needed. He highlighted his company's announcement on Monday that it was buying the antennas and filter operations of Germany's Kathrein.
""Let's look at it when it comes down. We have to remember the operators ... have a lot of gear in the network, they are financially under a lot of pressure, in Europe especially,"" he said. 
""They're under a lot of pressure here, so how they are going to act if something happens or doesn’t happen I think is very hard to speculate.""

612,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2019 07:48AM ET</span>",Court ruling could help J&J defeat St. Louis talc lawsuits,"By Tina Bellon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Missouri Supreme Court ruling on talc lawsuits could reduce the liability and number of large trials Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) faces over allegations its talc products, including baby powder, cause cancer.
The ruling will likely offer some respite to the healthcare conglomerate as it deals with growing pressure over the safety of its talc products, some defense lawyers said. The company revealed in its annual report on Wednesday that it had received subpoenas from the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission related to talc litigation.
Some plaintiffs' lawyers, however, played down the impact of the ruling.
It was a trial in St. Louis's 22nd Circuit Court, brought by 21 plaintiffs from outside of the city whose cases were joined to that of a single St. Louis resident, that in July produced a record $4.69 billion talc verdict against J&J. The company is facing several more such lawsuits in St. Louis. 
However, Missouri's high court on Feb. 13 ruled in a separate talc case that allowed a non-resident to participate in joined cases was ""a clear and direct violation"" of state law barring the use of joinder - combining two or more cases - to allow courts to hear cases they otherwise could not. 
Most state courts can only hear cases involving plaintiffs or defendants from that state or alleging injuries occurring within their jurisdiction. The U.S. Supreme Court strengthened those restrictions in a 2017 decision.
But the St. Louis court had allowed out-of-state residents to continue to sue New Jersey-based J&J through liberal use of joinder. In the case that produced the July verdict, 18 of the plaintiffs were from outside Missouri and three were from outside the city of St. Louis. Of the roughly 700 talc cases filed in St. Louis, only 40 involve Missouri residents, according to court filings. 
If the Feb. 13 ruling closes off the St. Louis court to non-resident claims, J&J may have a stronger hand defending itself in smaller talc cases spread out among other, potentially less plaintiff-friendly state and federal courts. 
""There's no real way of reading this decision other than this court clearly saying you can't join claims if the injury did not occur in the venue,"" said Mark Cheffo, a New York-based product liability defense lawyer not involved in talc litigation. 
J&J in a statement said it was pleased with the decision. ""One claim that is properly before a court cannot provide a basis for drawing into a trial other claims that are not. We believe that decision is clearly correct, and we continue to believe that the science doesn't support plaintiffs' claims,"" the company said, declining further comment.
IMPACT UNCLEAR
Some plaintiffs' lawyers said the Feb. 13 ruling was not as definitive as Cheffo suggests.
""If defendants are celebrating this ruling as the end of St. Louis mass tort, they have not read the entire Missouri case law,"" said Eric Holland, a St. Louis-based plaintiff lawyer involved in the talc litigation.
Holland pointed to a 2016 Missouri Supreme Court decision that upheld a $38 million verdict in a pharmaceutical product liability case the defendant claimed had been improperly joined. The court let the result stand, saying that even an improper joinder did not render the trial unfair to defendants.
Though the 2016 ruling involved a case already decided, Holland and other plaintiffs' lawyers said they planned to argue its fairness analysis also applies to out-of-state talc claims in cases yet to go to trial. They said they would also argue joining the cases was the most efficient use of judicial resources.
Defense lawyers said the Feb. 13 decision would likely mean dismissal or severing of the out-of-state claims from four upcoming multi-plaintiff cases scheduled for trial in St. Louis. Two of the cases were halted by the Missouri Supreme Court ahead of its ruling.
Holland and other plaintiff lawyers said they would challenge J&J requests to sever or dismiss talc cases by arguing the Feb. 13 decision did not overrule the 2016 ruling.
Cheffo said the 2016 ruling could make it harder for J&J to overturn the July verdict and its record penalty because the company would have to prove the joinder led to an unfair trial.
'FORUM SHOPPING' BY OUT-OF-STATE PLAINTIFFS
The St. Louis court has been a venue for more talc trials and has seen larger verdicts than any other jurisdiction. Outside of St. Louis, the only other significant talc verdicts against J&J to date have come in lawsuits filed by individual plaintiffs in New Jersey and California, where the company is currently facing jury verdicts totaling $142 million. 
A Los Angeles jury delivered a $417 million talc verdict against J&J in 2017, but the judge threw out the award weeks later as unsupported by the evidence. All talc verdicts against J&J are on appeal.
The St. Louis court has a history of issuing large punitive damages against companies and has often been criticized by business groups as allowing ""forum-shopping"" by out-of-state plaintiffs. 
While J&J faces some trials brought by individuals in other jurisdictions, the multi-plaintiff St. Louis cases are the largest and have the most potential to produce additional billion-dollar verdicts.
Plaintiffs allege that the talc in Johnson's baby powder and other J&J products causes ovarian cancer, or that asbestos contamination in the talc causes ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. Asbestos is a known carcinogen linked to mesothelioma.
J&J and its talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, a co-defendant in the litigation, deny the allegations, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown their talc to be safe and asbestos-free.
Reuters on Dec. 14 published a report detailing that J&J knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results it did not disclose to regulators or consumers. (https://reut.rs/2Gh88KO) 
J&J is currently facing roughly 13,000 lawsuits over talc, most of which have been consolidated in federal court in New Jersey. Many plaintiff's lawyers have fought to keep cases out of federal court, which they feel favors corporate defendants.
Three juries have rejected claims that Baby Powder was tainted with asbestos or caused plaintiffs' mesothelioma. Five other juries have failed to reach verdicts, resulting in mistrials.

In a statement, Imerys Talc America said the Missouri ruling affirmed legal arguments it has made in litigation for the last four years. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Feb. 13, saying it lacked the financial clout to defend against talc lawsuits.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche is buying U.S.-based gene therapy specialist Spark Therapeutics for $4.3 billion after developments in this area convinced the Swiss drugmaker to ""step up"", Chief Executive Severin Schwan said on Monday.
Roche will pay $114.50 per share for Spark, more than twice the U.S. company's closing price on Feb. 22, for a portfolio that includes a blindness treatment that has U.S. and European approval and other projects for hemophilia and neurodegenerative disorders like Huntington's disease.
Basel-based Roche is buying Spark as rivals, including Novartis, also move aggressively into gene therapy, where treatments for rare, inherited diseases command some of the highest prices in medicine. Spark's blindness therapy Luxturna is priced at $850,000 per patient. 
""We've been watching this space for quite some time. We just feel it's now the right time to step up,"" Schwan told Reuters in an interview. 
""The fit of Spark and Roche is really excellent. It provides us with a broad portfolio, it provides us with expertise across the value chain.""
Schwan is counting on new medicines, including gene therapies, to help compensate for patent losses on his $21-billion-per-year trio of cancer medicines Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin, that are facing competition from cheaper copies.
Roche, the biggest cancer drugs maker, was late to the game in immuno-oncology where Merck's Keytruda is becoming the dominant player and has eclipsed Roche's own product, Tecentriq, that seeks to harness the body's immune system to fight cancer. 
Bank Vontobel analysts said the Spark deal gives Roche a proven platform for commercializing gene therapies, but did not come without risks -- including getting beaten to market by rivals with similar treatments in the works.
Roche shares were 0.4 percent lower by 1140 GMT.
Gene therapies use specially engineered viruses, or viral vectors, to deliver genetic material into defective cells, in hopes of improving or potentially even curing an inherited condition.
Luxturna, sold in the United States by Spark and elsewhere by Novartis after its approval in 2017, targets a rare genetic disease, Leber's congenital amaurosis, that causes blindness in about 1 in 200,000 people. 
Loss-making Spark had $51.6 million in revenue in the first nine months of 2018 from Luxturna and also had income from a deal with  Pfizer  (N:PFE), which it is partnering on another gene therapy for haemophilia B.
Philadelphia-based Spark's shares are up about 30 percent this year. The U.S.-company's stock tumbled last year after two of 12 patients showed an unfavorable immune response when treated with a higher dose of Spark's haemophilia therapy SPK-8011.
Schwan said Roche was satisfied that the issues that emerged could be addressed with steroid treatment.
HEAD START
Roche's Spark deal, seen closing in the second quarter, follows Novartis's $8.7 billion purchase of U.S.-based Avexis last year, also to gain a platform of gene therapies for disorders including spinal muscular atrophy.
Novartis has made gene therapy one of its focus areas, giving it a head start on Roche. U.S. approval of Novartis's SMA medicine is slated for coming months. 
Among Spark's top drug hopefuls is SPK-8011, for haemophilia A, expected to start Phase 3 trials in 2019. It is also working on treatments for Pompe disease, blindness-causing choroideremia and Huntington's disease.
""The needs of patients and families living with genetic diseases are immediate and their needs vast,"" Spark Chief Executive Jeffrey Marrazzo said.
Roche already sells Hemlibra against haemophilia A that helps stop bleeding in patients with the genetic disorder that prevents their blood from clotting. Hemlibra, approved in 2017, had 224 million Swiss francs ($224.18 million) in sales last year.
Schwan said he was not worried about gene therapy and Hemlibra cannibalizing sales from each other. ""Our best guess is, it is complementary and that actually patients will need both options -- a medicine like Hemlibra, and increasingly over time, gene therapy,"" he said. 
With Spark, Roche enters a crowded haemophilia gene therapy market, as other players - Biomarin Pharma (NASDAQ:BMRN), Uniqure NV and Sangamo Therapeutics - also have gene therapies in the works.

""We view Biomarin likely first to market,"" Vontobel analyst Stefan Schneider said. ""We view the market opportunity big enough to accommodate more than one gene therapy - but a favorable safety profile will likely win gold.""

The two countries had been racing to reach a deal before the original deadline on Friday. With Trump extending the deadline due to the progress on trade talks, a deal between the U.S and China seems more likely.
Trump also tweeted that he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to conclude talks. A note of caution about ""new uncertainties"" from Chinese official news agency Xinhua has, by comparison, gone largely unregarded.

Calvey and the others deny wrongdoing and say the case is being used to exert pressure in a business dispute. 
In an open letter posted on its website, Baring Vostok said it was appealing to Putin to take the case under his personal control to ensure it was investigated objectively.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to delay an increase in tariffs on Chinese goods drove European shares to their highest since October as carmakers and mining companies rallied.
The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.3 percent by 0930 GMT and Germany's trade-sensitive DAX rose 0.5 percent. The STOXX hit 373.18 in early deals, its highest since Oct. 10.
Trump said on Sunday he would delay the March 1 deadline for a tariff increase after ""productive"" trade talks and that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping would meet to seal an agreement if progress continued.
Auto shares jumped 1.6 percent to their highest since early November and basic-resources stocks rose 0.9 percent as the tariff reprieve triggered relief for companies most at risk from slower global trade. 
Car-parts makers  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and Faurecia were among the top performers, up 2.6 to 3.4 percent. Steel companies Arcelormittal (AS:MT) and Norsk Hydro and commodity trader  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) all rose more than 2 percent. 
Investors stayed cautious, though.
""I believe the easiest part is done,"" said Stephane Ekolo, fundamental analyst at Unigestion in Geneva. ""I believe Mr Trump has oversold the positive aspects of the discussions ... the overall deal will be less impressive than what the Chinese and especially Mr Trump are saying about it.""
Disappointing results drove some significant declines. Shares in Bank of Ireland dropped 7.5 percent after the bank cut its outlook for 2019 and reported a weaker fourth-quarter net interest margin (NIM).
""A weaker Q4 NIM and a lower outlook for 2019 weigh on near-term forecasts, while guided regulatory capital consumption is higher than anticipated,"" wrote Davy Research analysts. 
Covestro shares fell 3.7 percent after the German chemicals group said its 2019 core earnings may fall as low as half of last year's level. 
Overall, fourth-quarter earnings have been disappointing, and analysts have been steadily cutting their expectations for European earnings growth. https://tmsnrt.rs/2EtnGIs
However, Italy's FTSE MIB outperformed the market, climbing 1 percent as government bonds jumped after Fitch affirmed the country's BBB credit rating.
Shares in banks, which have significant government bond holdings, jumped 2.3 percent.
M&A was also a driver: French healthcare company Ipsen fell 2 percent after agreeing to buy U.S. peer Clementia Pharmaceuticals in a deal worth up to $1.31 billion.
PostNL surged 9.6 percent, set for its best day in more than two years, after saying it planned to buy its main rival Sandd for an estimated 130 million euros.

Chipmaker AMS climbed 6.6 percent to the top of the STOXX after it introduced a new component for mobile 3D sensing applications.

619,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2019 04:53AM ET</span>",World shares breathe easy as Trump pushes out tariff deadline,"By Tom Wilson
LONDON (Reuters) - Equity markets across Europe and Asia rose on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would hold off on hiking tariffs on Chinese imports, buoying hopes of a resolution to a trade war between the world's two biggest economies. 
European stocks climbed 0.4 percent to their highest since October, led by a 0.5 percent bump in Germany's trade-sensitive DAX, where China-exposed sectors from industrials to autos made ground.
Trump said on Sunday he would delay an increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods planned for March 1 thanks to ""productive"" trade talks, adding that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping would meet to seal a deal if progress continued. 
The U.S. president cited progress in divisive areas including intellectual property protection, technology transfers, agriculture, services and currency.
Trump's tweeted remarks are the clearest sign yet that the United States and China are moving towards a deal to end a trade war that has dragged on for months, dragging on global growth and disrupting markets. 
The remarks were set to embolden larger, risk-averse investors to make solid moves after weeks of guesswork on the direction of the U.S.-Sino trade talks, analysts said. 
""The people sitting on the fence and previously weren't sure have come out,"" said David Madden of CMC Markets. ""We could see a continuation of the upwards move, on a more aggressive rate than we have previously seen it.""
By mid-morning, MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.2 percent to its highest since October. 
The risk-on mood in Europe spilled over from Asia, where MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.7 percent to the highest since October, and is up 10 percent for the year so far.
Chinese blue chips scaled their highest in eight months on the back of a 6 percent gain, their biggest daily increase since July 2015. They are up nearly a quarter this year.
The Japanese benchmark Nikkei also gaining, climbing half a percent to its highest since December.
PATIENT POWELL? 
U.S. stocks were poised to be lifted, too, with the Dow and Nasdaq well-positioned after nine straight weeks of gains.
A dovish shift from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has set aside rate hikes for now, has also helped. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will testify on U.S. monetary policy on Tuesday and Wednesday.
""Expect him to emphasize patience, stating that any more hikes this year would likely require some pickup in inflation,"" wrote analysts at TD Securities in a note.
Participants in currency markets shared that sentiment. 
""We expect more of the same going forward, with Powell generally supportive of risky assets,"" said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Market. 
""We think the mood of optimism and better bid for risk is probably something we live with for the week.""
The trade news was largely priced into currency markets, with the dollar nudging down 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies to 96.518 amid the risk-on mood. 
The euro ticked up 0.1 percent against the greenback, trading around $1.1350, and still within the $1.1213/1.1570 trading range that has held since mid-October.
Sterling was idling at $1.3069, with markets awaiting clarity on the direction of Brexit talks.
Britain's government is considering different options, including possibly delaying Brexit, if parliament fails to approve Prime Minister Theresa May's deal by March 12.
The British premier on Sunday put off a vote in parliament on her Brexit deal to just 17 days before Britain's scheduled March 29 departure from the European Union, setting up a showdown this week with lawmakers.
In commodities, oil prices fell, dragged down by plentiful supply as U.S. exports soar and compete with traditional producers from the Middle East in key markets such as Asia.
International Brent crude oil futures were at $66.99 a barrel, down 0.2 percent from their last close.

Investing.com -- The screens are green all over Europe Monday as the threat of a trade war between China and the U.S. recedes.
President Donald Trump’s announcement via 

 that he would put off imposing new tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, citing “substantial” progress in talks between the two on a range of subjects from bilateral trade volumes to intellectual property rights, has lifted European stocks to their highest levels in over four months.
At 04:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 was up 1.24 points, or 0.3% at 372.48, led by trade-sensitive names such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), and by a raft of banks who have slipped further out of favour in recent weeks as the growth outlook has dimmed. The Stoxx Autos and Parts sectoral index is up by 1.3%.
There are, however, plenty of outliers. U.K. housebuilders are having a shocker after reports at the weekend that the government is about to crack down on companies for sub-standard building and other practices. The sector has been one of the best performing in the U.K. for years, profiting from the generous “Help to Buy” scheme that assured rock-bottom borrowing costs for housing-related loans.  Persimmon  (LON:PSN) is the worst affected, down 5.9%, but  Taylor Wimpey  (LON:TW),  Barratt Developments  (LON:BDEV) and Berkeley Group (LON:BKGH) are all suffering too.
In Switzerland, pharma giant Roche (SIX:RO) is down 0.6% after making what looks like an expensive $4.8 billion bet on gene therapy company Spark Therapeutics. The offer is more than double Spark's market value at the end of last week.
In Germany, meanwhile, the Wirecard (DE:WDIG) saga continues to bubble. The newspaper Handelsblatt reported at the weekend that the short-selling ban from regulator Bafin was issued after the company itself told state prosecutors that someone was about to bribe U.K.-based journalists to put out negative reports on it, which would have rewarded short-sellers. Given that all the critical reporting on Wirecard so far has come in the Financial Times, it isn’t clear why Bafin would take the claims of the company, which has had to face repeated questions about its accounting practices over the years, at face value.
Wirecard is up 2.4% this morning but still down by a third since the FT’s reports started in February."

(Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc on Monday announced 5G networking chips for a range of applications beyond smart phones, aiming to bolster a business that has lost Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a major customer and faces unprecedented levels of competition.
San Diego-based Qualcomm is the world's biggest supplier of mobile phone chips and has told investors it expects a big boost from 5G networks, which will start rolling out this year and feature higher speeds than current 4G networks. Qualcomm chips will supply the 5G connectivity in devices such as Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd's Galaxy Fold smart phone.
But Qualcomm faces challenges in its mobile chip business, with Apple selecting  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) alone to connect its iPhones released last year to mobile data networks. And MediaTek Inc, Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd have all announced plans to make 5G chips, with Samsung and Huawei both planning to use the chips in some models of their own phones, eating into potential business for Qualcomm.
At the Mobile World Congress event in Spain on Monday, Qualcomm announced its plans to get its 5G chips into other markets beyond phones. Qualcomm said it working with Japanese e-commerce retailer Rakuten Inc's mobile division to supply 5G chips for networking gear the retailer is rolling out in Japan.
Qualcomm also has a new chip for personal computers that would connect them to 5G networks, building on Qualcomm's earlier efforts to attack rival Intel in its core market of central processors. Qualcomm also announced chips for so-called 5G fixed wireless stations, which carriers such as  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) are hoping could become speedy enough to replace home broadband connections that many consumers in the United States get from their cable operators.

Qualcomm also announced a new set of chips aimed at automakers on Monday. Qualcomm's existing chips help cars connect to the internet, but the 5G chips are expected to connect cars to other vehicles on the road as well as objects such as traffic signs and signals as vehicles gain new levels of autonomous navigation.

625,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 25, 2019 01:21AM ET</span>",Wall Street Banks Trampled All Over Their European Rivals in 2018,"(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). gained some of the biggest shares in both fixed-income and equities trading last year, solidifying its leadership in one and nearing the top in the other.  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) lost ground in both markets while trying to restructure its business.
JPMorgan’s share of the $77 billion pool of revenue that banks generated handling investors’ bets on bonds, currencies and commodities rose by more than a percentage point. Its cut of the $53 billion market for trading stocks and related derivatives also increased. The fixed-income pie shared by all banks shrank 6 percent from 2017, but in equities it grew 14 percent.
U.S. banks trampled over their European rivals in 2018, gaining ground and holding five of the top six spots in rankings for both markets. Europe’s investment banks had reclaimed some share in 2017 but failed to maintain it, mostly as a harsher trading environment in last year’s second half hurt them more than it did U.S. peers.
Most of Europe’s largest banks are carrying out restructuring programs that have spurred departures of top talent and some clients. Pressure to cut costs is heightened there as interest rates remain negative, squeezing lending margins, and as financial markets remain fragmented
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG lost the most market share in equities trading, dropping to No. 10 from 7 a year earlier. That was followed by Deutsche Bank, which fell to No. 11 from 9. In bond trading,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA lost the most.
JPMorgan made the biggest gain in equities share while  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). led winners in fixed income.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc bucked the trend among European banks, adding market share in both equities and fixed income, albeit much less than at U.S. rivals. Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley promised more buybacks and dividends to shareholders after announcing stronger results than many of its European peers.
Europe’s largest banks handled a majority of capital markets trading before they encountered the dual crises of the U.S. mortgage meltdown and Europe’s sovereign-debt troubles. Since then, the firms have been in constant restructuring mode, trying to slash costs and improve profitability. U.S. banks moved faster to remake their businesses after the 2008 crisis and increased capital levels more aggressively, helping them rebuild customer confidence.
The five largest U.S. investment banks accounted for 58 percent of the trading revenue pool last year, up from 46 percent in 2010. The nine largest European firms saw their share decline to 36 percent from 50 percent.

""Even if stocks retreat in the short term, there’s still room for further gains as leverage is still way below the peak despite the increase,"" said Shen Zhengyang, a Shanghai-based strategist with Northeast Securities Co. ""Investors also have to bear in mind that economic fundamentals are still bad, so in order to avoid getting burned in a likely more volatile market, it’s key to always remain wary.""
The change in investor sentiment has also boosted the yuan, which is the best performer among major currencies since Feb. 1, strengthening 0.9 percent against the dollar. The currency was up 0.41 percent at 6.6879 as of 1:08 p.m. in Shanghai.

628,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2019 11:45PM ET</span>",Two bodies recovered after Amazon cargo plane crashes into Texas bay,"(Reuters) - Two bodies have been recovered from the wreckage of an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Air cargo plane that nosedived into a bay outside Houston on Saturday, and a search was ongoing for a third victim, authorities said.
All three people aboard the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 767 cargo jetliner operated by Atlas Air Worldwide died in the crash as it approached Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Atlas and  Boeing Co  said in statements on Sunday.
Chambers County Sheriff Brian Hawthorne told a news conference on Sunday that two bodies had been recovered and the search continued for the third person as well as the plane's black boxes.
The sheriff's office released a video https:// showing fragments of the aircraft and cargo littering mudflats after the tide went out in the bay, exposing more of the crash site.
U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairman Robert Sumwalt said the agency obtained about five seconds of security video from a local jail that showed the crash.
""The aircraft is in the video as it's descending in a steep descent, a steep nose down attitude,"" Sumwault told the press briefing, adding that there was no distress call.
Asked by a reporter if the incident was ""anything more than a plane crash,"" Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Perrye Turner said, ""that's what we have right now.""
The plane crashed at the north end of Trinity Bay near the small city of Anahuac, about 20 miles (32 km) southeast of the airport around 12.40 p.m. (1340 EST) after taking off from Miami.
""This is a sad time for all of us,"" Bill Flynn, Atlas Air's chief executive officer, said in a statement. ""Our team continues to work closely with the NTSB, the FAA and local authorities on the ground in Houston.""
Atlas Air Worldwide has been operating Boeing 767 freighters on behalf of Amazon following a 2016 deal.
Boeing said in a statement that it had sent a team to provide technical assistance to the NTSB as it conducted its investigation.

629,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2019 11:26PM ET</span>",Caesars in talks with Icahn about new CEO as part of settlement: sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - U.S. casino operator Caesars Entertainment Corp is in talks to offer Carl Icahn a role in selecting its new CEO as part of an agreement that would also give the billionaire investor board seats, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
The negotiations come after Icahn disclosed a 9.8 percent stake in Caesars on Tuesday and said he could nominate a slate of directors to the company's board. 
Icahn also asked Caesars to launch a process to explore a sale. The company responded on Wednesday that all the deals it had explored thus far undervalued it and did not create enough value for shareholders, but noted that it will continue to evaluate strategic alternatives presented to it. 
Icahn has proposed Anthony Rodio, the CEO of privately held casino gaming company Affinity Gaming, as the successor to Mark Frissora, who is due to step down as Caesars CEO later this year, the sources said. Rodio was previously CEO of Tropicana Entertainment Inc, another casino and resort operator that Icahn sold last year to peer Eldorado Resorts Inc for $1.85 billion.
Caesars already has a shortlist of CEO candidates and has indicated to Icahn that it is willing to consider Rodio as well, the sources said. As an alternative, the company could offer Rodio a role in overseeing its operations, some of the sources added.
Caesars does not currently have a chief operating officer, although some of these duties are performed by its president, Tom Jenkin.
Caesars is open to Icahn having a say in the selection of the company's new CEO, as he has requested, the sources said.
Caesars is also open to giving Icahn board representation, the sources said, although the number of board seats and the names and titles of those filling them are still under negotiation, the sources said. Icahn could receive a significant minority of the board's 12 seats as part of any deal, the sources said.
The deadline for Icahn to nominate his own board directors expires on March 1. If an agreement between Caesars and Icahn is not reached this week, the company may extend the nomination deadline or continue to negotiate with Icahn even if he files a board slate for election, the sources said.
The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Caesars and Affinity Gaming declined to comment, while Icahn did not respond to a request for comment. 
Caesars said on Thursday that it expected ""to continue a constructive dialogue"" with Icahn. Clinching a deal with Icahn as early as the end of this week would allow the company to avoid a proxy contest over the composition of its board.
DEAL ATTEMPTS
On Friday, another top investor in Caesars, hedge fund Canyon Partners LLC, also called on the company to run an ""open sale process"". While Canyon supports Icahn's cause, there are currently no talks with Caesars to give Canyon board representation, one of the sources said. Canyon declined to comment.
Caesars, whose casinos include the Harrah's and Horseshoe brands, emerged from bankruptcy in 2017 after failing to cope with some $25 billion in debt. The company now has a market capitalization of $6 billion. Its debt at the end of December totaled $9.1 billion.
Last year, Caesars rejected a merger approach by Tilman Fertitta, the billionaire owner of Golden Nugget Casinos. That deal would essentially have been structured as an acquisition by Caesars given its larger size. Eldorado Resorts, which is also smaller than Caesars with a market value of $3.8 billion, also explored a bid for Caesars last year but never made an offer, according to the sources.

Icahn has owned a number of casinos over the years, although his only remaining property is Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in New Jersey's Atlantic City, which has been closed since 2014.

The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component traded 3.3% and 4.3% higher by 10:15 PM ET (03:15 GMT).
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.2%. Shares of Chinese network equipment firm ZTE Corp (HK:0763) jumped 8%, after leaping as much as 14% earlier.
Trump said on Twitter on Sunday that he will be delaying U.S. tariff hike on China that was initially scheduled to start on March 1.“I am pleased to report that the U.S. has made substantial progress in our trade talks with China on important structural issues including intellectual property protection, technology transfer, agriculture, services, currency, and many other issues,” said the President.
“I will be delaying the U.S. increase in tariffs now scheduled for March 1. Assuming both sides make additional progress, we will be planning a Summit for President Xi and myself, at Mar-a-Lago, to conclude an agreement,” he added.
His comments came after China and the U.S. concluded the latest series of trade meetings in Washington over the weekend.
Despite the positive tweet by Trump, Bloomberg said the two sides have not yet agreed on certain details of the enforcement in a currency deal.
Citing four people familiar with the matter, the report said the U.S. is hoping to ensure Beijing will live up to its promise to not depreciate the yuan, which fell over 5% in 2018.
Trump has previously accused China of deliberately devaluing its currency to gain a competitive advantage.
Elsewhere in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.4%.
South Korea’s KOSPI was little changed at 2,229.98 ahead of a second meeting between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
“Chairman Kim realizes, perhaps better than anyone else, that without nuclear weapons, his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World,” Trump said on Twitter over the weekend as he prepared to depart to Vietnam for the meeting.

631,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 24, 2019 10:00PM ET</span>",Indonesia to Ease Trading Rule to Lure Mom-and-Pop Investors,"(Bloomberg) -- Indonesia’s stock exchange plans to cut the minimum trading price for shares and shrink the lot size in its drive to attract more retail investors and boost volumes.
The bourse will revise the decade-old requirement for stocks to maintain a floor price of 50 rupiah and lower the minimum order size from 100, Laksono Widodo, director of trading and membership at PT Bursa Efek Indonesia, said in an interview.
The Jakarta Composite Index has rebounded from 2018’s selloff to trade near its all-time high reached last February, as foreigners have turned bullish on Indonesian equities after being net sellers in the past two years. That’s as volume and turnover have climbed since the settlement period for stocks was cut to two days from three in November. The bourse is eager to maintain the momentum, Widodo said.
“It’s all about the development of the retail market and deepening of financial markets,” he said. “We need to revise various rules on trading, and hopefully it all can come in the second half of the year.”
Twenty eight of the 637 stocks in the benchmark Jakarta Composite Index stopped trading after their prices fell to 50 rupiah each. Revising the floor price will allow these shares to change hands again at prices that will reflect their fundamentals, he said.
Reducing the lot size will bring high-value shares like PT Gudang Garam with the reach of retail investors. A single transaction in the stock under the existing norms cost 8.2 million rupiah ($586). That’s more than twice the minimum monthly wage in Jakarta.
Also on the cards is easing of rules for companies planning first-time share sales after a record number of IPOs last year, Widodo said.
Volumes on Indonesia’s $523 billion stock market have climbed 23 percent on average in the months after the settlement cycle was pruned in November from the mean 12 months prior, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Daily turnover jumped at least 17 percent in the period and has stayed above the exchange’s 9 trillion rupiah target.
“The exchange has provided a good boost to the market,” said Taye Shim, head of equities capital market at PT Mirae Asset Sekuritas Indonesia, said. “We expect a further increase in retail participation if the reduction in minimum transaction price and lot size were to materialize.”
The benchmark Jakarta Composite Index advanced as much as 0.5 percent on Monday, extending gains this year to 5.1 percent.

632,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2019 07:35PM ET</span>",UK bank CEOs paid 120 times as much as average employee,"By Sinead Cruise and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - The top bosses of Britain's biggest banks are paid on average 120 times more than the median pay of their U.K. employees, bank documents have shown, as a new rule puts pay disparities at the country's big businesses under sharper scrutiny.
Britain's biggest domestic lender Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) has the starkest pay difference, with Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio - the sector's highest-earning boss in 2018 - on 169 times as much as the median paid employee on 37,058 pounds ($48,164), the company's annual report showed last Wednesday.
The gulf widens to 237 times when compared with staff in Lloyds' lowest pay quartile, who received an average pay package of 26,490 pounds in 2018, compared with the 6.3 million pounds Horta-Osorio took home.
The banks made the disclosures alongside full-year results over the past fortnight, ahead of new reporting requirements coming into force next year that oblige firms to set out the ratio of CEO pay to a median UK employee and those in the lowest and upper pay quartiles.
Banking giant HSBC had the next largest pay disparity, with new chief executive John Flint pocketing 4.6 million pounds last year - 118 times as much as its median paid employee in Britain.
""HSBC's pay strategy is designed to appropriately reflect the role, responsibility and skills of the individual and to also be competitive in order to ensure we are able to attract and retain individuals with the appropriate skills for each role,"" a spokeswoman for the bank said.
CEO to median employee pay ratios at rival FTSE 100 lenders Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) were not too far behind, at 97:1 and 96:1 respectively.
Barclays, Lloyds and RBS declined to comment.
Pay disparities have come under closer scrutiny in Britain in recent years, with separate gender pay-gap reporting requirements highlighting wide discrepancies between women and men, particularly in the finance industry.
The pay ratio reporting comes as the City of London Corporation, which manages London's financial district, on Monday launched a campaign against low pay at financial firms. The body is urging companies to pay their staff at least the London Living Wage of 10.55 pounds ($13.73) per hour.
""One in five people employed in the capital don't earn a wage they can live on. I'm calling on City firms to help consign this statistic to the history books,"" said Catherine McGuinness, the City's policy chief.
In its annual report Lloyds said it would pay all its full-time staff a minimum salary of 17,500 pounds from April this year, which it said would mean a raise of up to 9.9 percent for some colleagues.
Lloyds said this salary level was 7 percent above the National Living Wage, but it did not refer to the higher London Living Wage.
Large pay ratio gaps remain despite the four banks showing relative restraint last year, with pay for the quartet of CEOs broadly flat or down on the prior year.
Horta-Osorio's pay packet was down from 6.4 million pounds in 2017, while Flint received less than his predecessor Stuart Gulliver's 6.1 million pounds.

RBS boss Ross McEwan made 3.6 million pounds, up from 3.5 million pounds, while Barclays chief Jes Staley was the lowest paid after earning 3.4 million pounds, down from 3.9 million pounds.

633,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2019 06:15PM ET</span>","Chinese firm behind the 'Amazon Coat' hits jackpot in U.S., eschews China","By Pei Li and Melissa Fares
JIAXING, China/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Kevin Chiu left his job in 2012 to try his luck at starting an online apparel business in a rural Chinese city, his main goal was to carve out more time to spend with his wife and newborn child.
It never entered his mind that his Orolay puffer jacket would become a huge hit, celebrated as the 'Amazon Coat' in U.S. social and traditional media - and held up as a budding rival to premium brand Canada Goose.
Using duck down sourced from China's Hebei and Anhui provinces, the polyester coats are priced between $80 and $139. By contrast, Canada Goose jackets start from about $575 in the United States.
""We made more money in January than we did for the whole of 2017,"" Chiu, 32, told Reuters at his factory in the eastern Chinese city of Jiaxing.
He estimates his firm made $5 million in sales last month and expects to bring in $30-$40 million this year. U.S. sales - almost all of which are sold through Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) - account for 70 percent of total revenue.
Orolay's success is, however, not just a tale of competitive pricing and a design that found favor with U.S. consumers.
Chiu is among a wave of Chinese merchants that have benefited from measures introduced by Amazon in recent years that have made it easy for overseas vendors to sell on its site.
That's provoked concerns among U.S. sellers on Amazon that they are being outgunned. And in industries such as apparel, experts say brick-and-mortar retailers cannot ignore the threat posed by the influx of small brands, many of which are based in China.
""It's the impact, collectively, that's happening in the industry from all of these brands. When you add them up, they're just all taking market share,"" said Robert D'Loren, chief executive of Xcel Brands Inc, whose merchandise is sold at Macy's Inc and on Amazon.com.
Amazon declined to comment on the view that U.S. firms are being undercut by Chinese merchants using its site. It does not break down the number of sellers on its sites by country.
The number of Chinese merchants on Amazon is set to grow further as fierce competition and rising costs have made it less attractive to sell on local e-commerce sites like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd's Tmall, analysts say.
Indeed, Chiu no longer sells in China. Orolay's other markets are Europe, Japan, Taiwan and Australia.
""We did sell on Alibaba in the early days...but competition in China is stiffer,"" he said, adding that increased costs to use local sites was also a factor.
In addition to fees to use Chinese e-commerce sites, sellers also face other costs such as investing in customer service teams. Alibaba declined to respond to Reuters questions about whether costs for vendors had increased.
Analysts say the number of Chinese merchants selling on Amazon's U.S. site began to pick up over the last five years after it introduced measures that allowed sellers worldwide to store products at Amazon warehouses and provided help shipping those goods to customers.
Late last year, the retail giant also started a program that refers China-based sellers to local lenders. By comparison, Amazon offers loans to selected U.S., UK and Japan-based small businesses that sell on its site.
Chiu credits Amazon for much of the firm's success but is thinking of branching out, saying offers from retailers include invitations to sell online from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and U.S. shopping site Rue La La.
A Walmart spokeswoman said the firm had no agreement in place with Orolay. Rue La La did not respond to requests for comment.
Expansion plans include extending Orolay's product line to cotton clothing and men's outerwear. But for now, Chiu is still marveling at how his business has become so successful in a market he barely knows.
""I went to New York for vacation twice last year, and was so excited to see that people on the street are wearing our jackets,"" he said.
""I was very eager to ask them how they like our jackets, but didn't do it because I don't speak much English.""

(Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) is trying to block an investor proposal that calls on the world's largest publicly traded oil company to set targets for lowering its greenhouse gas emissions, two of the investor groups involved said on Sunday.
Exxon in late January wrote to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the proposal, which is set for a vote at its May annual meeting, is misleading and an attempt to “micro-manage the company,"" spokespeople for investors supporting the proposal said.
The Financial Times reported on the letter earlier on Sunday.
The Church Commissioners for England (CCE), the endowment fund of the Church of England, an institutional investor that supports the proposal, as well as New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who manages the state's pension fund that is pushing the proposal, both saw the Exxon letter, officials for both groups told Reuters. 
""Trying to strike out a shareholder proposal from institutional investors with a fiduciary responsibility to manage climate risk is an outdated reflex,"" CCE head of responsible investment Edward Mason said in a statement. ""Our proposal deserves more serious consideration.”
Exxon rivals Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC and  BP  (LON:BP) Plc have taken steps to broaden disclosure on greenhouse gas emissions or tied executive pay to reducing emissions. 
Investors supporting the Exxon proposal manage a total of $1.9 trillion and are led by DiNapoli. 
""Exxon is trying to deny shareholders’ right to vote on a significant climate risk concern,"" DiNapoli said in a statement on Sunday. Exxon's position is ""shortsighted and disappointing.""
Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri said in an email on Sunday that the company did not have anything to share ahead of the company proxy being filed.
The proposal, led by New York state's pension fund, calls on Exxon to start setting targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions that are “aligned with the greenhouse gas reductions goals established by the Paris climate agreement,” including for use of its own products.
But those short, medium and long-term targets would allow shareholders to supervise its ""day-to-day"" considerations, Exxon wrote to the SEC.
CCE spokesman Mark Arena said that Exxon told the SEC that it has already put many of the measures the proposal requires in place. 
The 2015 Paris Agreement which aims to limit a rise in average world temperatures to “well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.
In 2017, DiNapoli spearheaded a campaign that convinced a majority of shareholders to call on Exxon to detail risks it could face from rising global temperatures. 

Exxon produced a report last year outlining how global oil demand could drop sharply by 2040, but critics said the report fell short on areas like how climate policies could affect company finances.

The coffee business has about $400 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and could attract a price of at least $3 billion in a sale, the sources, who were not identified, told CNBC.
The sale of the coffee business will be one in a string of divestitures for Kraft Heinz, the sources told CNBC.
Kraft Heinz spokesman Michael Mullen declined to comment on the CNBC report but said the company was focused on building its business around brands in growing and profitable categories where it feels it has a competitive advantage.
""We will explore asset sales according to this framework and will engage if this alternative is superior to us keeping the business and helps to improve the company's growth and margin trajectory,” he said in an email to Reuters on Sunday. 
Reuters could not immediately reach Credit Suisse for comment, but a spokeswoman declined to comment to CNBC.
Kraft Heinz shares fell to a record low on Friday, a day after it disclosed a $15 billion writedown on its marquee brands. Also on Thursday, the company said it would cut its dividend by 36 percent and disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company's accounting policies.
Brazil's buyout fund 3G Capital and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc together own more than 50 percent of Kraft Heinz.
Kraft's revenue growth has stagnated in the years since it merged with Heinz as consumers shun older, established brands for newer products, cheaper private-label brands and organic food.

The two screens on the new V50ThinQ work independently, so a user can watch a film on one screen while browsing the Internet on the other.
LG, the world's No.7 smartphone maker, saw its sales decline by a quarter last year as Chinese rivals Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi grabbed market share in a slightly weaker global market.
Both announced 5G phones in Barcelona on the eve of the Mobile World Congress, the telecoms industry's main annual get together, with Xiaomi pitching a $680 model and Huawei smashing the price ceiling with $2,600 folding phone.
LG nevertheless retains a following among those who value good video and audio quality.
Addressing those users, LG launched a second phone, the G8ThinQ, which can be unlocked without touching the screen. The handset instead uses light sensors to scan the veins in a user's hand or to recognize their face.
The phone's front-facing camera, which uses a sensor chip developed by Germany's Infineon Technologies , can scan in three dimensions - making it more secure than existing biometric methods of unlocking phones such as fingerprints.
LG product evangelist David Montanya told a launch event it would be harder to 'spoof' than the FaceID feature used in Apple's iPhone X because the vein structure in a user's hand has less than one chance in a billion of being the same as anyone else's. 
Users can also activate features with gestures - for example to play or pause a song or video, or adjust the volume, by twisting their fingers, emulating the character played by Tom Cruise in science-fiction detective thriller Minority Report.

LG did not set release dates or announce prices for the new phones, but said the 5G model should hit stores in the first half of the year.

637,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2019 11:15AM ET</span>",Nokia says 5G would not be delayed by ban on Chinese suppliers,"By Jack Stubbs and Douglas Busvine
BARCELONA (Reuters) - Nokia (HE:NOKIA) does not expect the possible exclusion of Chinese companies on security grounds to delay the rollout of next-generation 5G services in European markets, CEO Rajeev Suri told Reuters.
Debate is raging in Europe over whether to heed calls from Washington to bar China's Huawei Technologies, even as big telecoms operators warn that such a move could set back the deployment of 5G by years.
Suri, however, downplayed concerns that a reduced field of vendors could slow network upgrades. The real reasons for Europe's growing 5G lag behind the United States are hold-ups in issuing spectrum to operators, as well as high auction costs in countries such as Italy, he said.
""I think you cannot say that you know the situation caused by some of this will delay 5G rollout or that others are not capable or ready to provide equipment. That would not be accurate,"" Suri said on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress , the industry's main annual gathering, in Barcelona.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has lobbied European allies aggressively to shut out Huawei, saying the company is too closely tied to the Chinese government and its equipment could be vulnerable to cyber espionage.
Huawei strongly rejects those allegations and Chairman Guo Ping, speaking in Barcelona, reiterated that it would never allow any country to insert so-called back doors in its equipment.
Nokia, the second-biggest networks player behind Huawei, has warned of a weak start to 2019 but expects sales to recover and show growth in 2020 as 5G deployment accelerates.
AUSTRALIA WIN
The Finnish company announced a key win in Australia, which has banned Huawei, saying it would provide a 5G fixed-wireless access network to operator Optus, with 50 sites to go live by March.
In a first, Nokia will provide to a limited number of Optus customers super-fast wireless internet that can support several devices and at the same time deliver ultra-high-definition video to the home, the two companies said.
Nokia also said it had agreed with Korea Telecom to conduct 5G trials for service automation, network virtualisation and slicing, which allows multiple networks to run on top of shared infrastructure.
There are also plans for Nokia to cooperate with Britain's  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) on active antennas to boost 5G capacity and cut costs, plus an agreement with India's Bharti Airtel to conduct a trial of a so-called front-haul solution that will help to speed 5G operations.
The rapid rollout of 5G depends on whether antitrust regulators allow telecoms markets to consolidate, said Suri, adding that this would create stronger players capable of shouldering the vast investment needed to overhaul and upgrade networks.
This applied both to Europe and to the United States, where the $26 billion takeover by T-Mobile of Sprint Corp is being reviewed by regulators. Waving that deal through would be positive for 5G, Suri told a later news conference.

""If you want to accelerate 5G, that merger does allow the possibility to do so, simply with the spectrum and the economics,"" he told reporters and analysts.

A lawsuit by California resident Edwin Hardeman against the company was scheduled to begin on Monday in federal rather than state court. The trial is also a test case for a larger litigation. More than 760 of the 9,300 Roundup cases nationwide are consolidated in the federal court in San Francisco that is hearing Hardeman's case.
Bayer denies all allegations that Roundup or glyphosate cause cancer, saying decades of independent studies have shown the world's most widely used weed killer to be safe for human use and noting that regulators around the world have approved the product.
Under a January ruling by U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria, who presides over the federal litigation, jurors in Hardeman's case will not initially hear all the evidence presented in last year's California trial.
Chhabria called evidence by plaintiffs that the company allegedly attempted to influence regulators and manipulate public opinion ""a distraction"" from the science in the cases. He said such evidence should only go before the jury in a second trial phase that would only take place if they determined Roundup caused Hardeman's cancer.
Evidence of corporate misconduct was seen as playing a key role in the finding by a California state court jury in August that Roundup caused another man's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and that Bayer's  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) unit failed to warn consumers about the weed killer's cancer risks. That jury's $289 million damages award was later reduced to $78 million. 
Bayer's share price dropped 10 percent following the verdict and has remained volatile.
Hardeman began using the Roundup brand herbicide with glyphosate in the 1980s to control poison oak and weeds on his property and sprayed ""large volumes"" of the chemical for many years on a regular basis, according to court documents. He was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system, in February 2015 and filed his lawsuit a year later.
But Hardeman has a history of hepatitis C, a risk factor for developing lymphoma. Bayer in court filings also said the majority of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma incidents are idiopathic, or have no known cause.

Plaintiffs criticized Chhabria's order dividing the trial and restricting evidence as ""unfair,"" saying their scientific evidence allegedly showing glyphosate causes cancer is inextricably linked to Monsanto's alleged wrongful conduct.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnamese carrier Bamboo Airways will sign a deal with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co to purchase 10 planes on the sidelines of this week's Trump-Kim summit, an airline executive said on Sunday. 
The carrier, which is owned by property and leisure company FLC Group and made its first flights in January, placed a provisional order last year for 20 Boeing 787 widebody jets worth $5.6 billion at list prices. 
""We will sign with Boeing a deal to buy 10 more Boeing 787s. This is different from the deal signed earlier for 20 Boeing planes,"" said the executive who declined to be named due to the confidentiality of the matter.
""That means we will have ordered 30 Boeing 787s. The deal will be signed during the summit,"" the executive said.
""This is a firm order valued at nearly $3 billion,"" added the executive. Boeing had no immediate comment.
Bamboo is currently operating 10 Airbus planes.
Bamboo is aiming to open routes to the United States after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration declared Vietnam complied with international aviation standards, in a move that would allow Vietnamese carriers to fly there for the first time and codeshare with U.S. airlines.
U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will hold their second summit in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi on Feb. 27-28. 
Bamboo's first 787 is set to arrive in the third quarter of 2020 and the airline is preparing to launch flights to the United States from late 2019 or early 2020 with leased jets unless Boeing can deliver them earlier, Bamboo's chairman Trinh Van Quyet had earlier told Reuters.
""Direct flights between Vietnam and the U.S. will not only push tourism activities, but also further facilitate bilateral trade and investment,"" he said. ""We are receiving huge support from Boeing to deploy our flights to the U.S.""
Rivals Vietnam Airlines JSC and VietJet Aviation JSC also have ambitions to fly to the United States, although the latter carrier has yet to place an order for widebody jets.
VietJet is also expected to sign a major jet deal with Boeing on the sidelines of the Trump-Kim summit, according to sources familiar with the matter.
VietJet, while not government-owned, increasingly uses state visits to showcase major plane orders balanced between Boeing and Airbus SE. It signed a deal to buy 100 Boeing 737 MAX narrowbody jets when former U.S. President Barack Obama visited Hanoi in 2016.

The airline is likely to finalize next week a separate provisional deal agreed last year at the Farnborough Airshow to buy another 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets worth almost $13 billion at list prices, sources said on condition of anonymity.

643,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2019 06:16AM ET</span>","In a shift, Buffett says focus on Berkshire's stock price","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett has long told investors in his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc they should not pay so much attention to what its stock price is doing.
No longer.
Buffett said in his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders on Saturday that the conglomerate's stock price will over time ""provide the best measure of business performance.""
In conjunction with that, he plans to deemphasize book value, measuring assets minus liabilities, saying changes at Berkshire and the vagaries of accounting rules mean that gauge has ""lost the relevance it once had.""
The shift is something of a retreat from the 88-year-old Buffett's decades of preaching patience and long-term thinking for investors and Berkshire shareholders, the antithesis of what stock prices often represent.
Buffett's business acumen has helped make him the world's third-richest person, worth $82.9 billion according to Forbes magazine, and transformed Berkshire from a failing textile company into a $496 billion behemoth.
For nearly three decades, Buffett has led his shareholder letters with a discussion of book value.
He has also long included tables comparing annual changes in Berkshire's book value and in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, including dividends.
Berkshire's long-term performance has been excellent.
Through Dec. 31, book value per share has gained an overall 1,091,899 percent, or 18.7 percent per year, since Buffett took over the Omaha, Nebraska-based company in 1965.
In comparison, the S&P 500 gained 15,019 percent, or 9.7 percent annually. Berkshire outperformed last year too, up 0.4 percent compared with a 4.4 percent drop for the index.
An evolution in Buffett's thinking surfaced in 2015 when he added changes in Berkshire's stock price to the table, after Berkshire's book value had lagged the S&P 500 in five of six years, .
Buffett said he did this because Berkshire's shift toward operating large businesses such as Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the BNSF railroad and the Geico auto insurer was widening the gap between its intrinsic value and book value.
While stock prices can be volatile, he said they and intrinsic value almost invariably converge over time.
Berkshire's stock has also done well under Buffett, with an overall 2,472,627 percent gain, or 20.5 percent annualized.
Buffett cited three reasons for deemphasizing book value.
First, he said Berkshire's ""major value"" is now in its operating units, and he and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger expect a ""reshaping"" of its asset mix to continue.
Buffett also said accounting rules require Berkshire to value its businesses at ""far below"" current value.
Finally he said Berkshire will likely buy back ""significant"" amounts of stock in future years, causing book value to fall.
""That combination causes the book-value scorecard to become increasingly out of touch with economic reality,"" Buffett wrote.
A possible fourth reason is that changes in the prices of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other stocks in Berkshire's $172.8 billion equity portfolio also affect book value.
Buffett said these holdings will likely grow in 2019 because near-term prospects for acquisitions are ""not good.""

Book value per share fell 7.1 percent in the fourth quarter as stock prices tumbled.

The No.1 U.S. automaker is revamping its operations, which include plant closures and thousands of job cuts, as it looks to boost profitability in the wake of declining U.S. auto sales.
The Hamtramck plant will continue to produce the Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac CT6 sedans until early next year, the company said.
""We are balancing production timing while continuing the availability of Cadillac advanced technology features currently included in the CT6-V - the Blackwing Twin-Turbo V-8 (engine) and Super Cruise (driver assistance system),"" GM said.
The plant has already discontinued production of the Buick LaCrosse sedan and Chevrolet Volt electric hybrid car.
Detroit-based union United Auto Workers' President Gary Jones said GM's decision to continue production at the plant was a relief for the workers as well as their families.

""We commend GM for today's decision and we reiterate the importance of a collective bargaining process in times like these,"" Jones said.

646,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2019 02:17PM ET</span>","Buffett appears to fault Trump, laments deals dearth in Berkshire letter","By Jonathan Stempel, Trevor Hunnicutt and Jennifer Ablan
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday appeared to fault U.S. President Donald Trump for taking too much credit for the nation's economic growth, while acknowledging that market conditions are making it tough for his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc to find more big companies to buy.
Buffett lamented these states of affairs in his widely read annual letter to Berkshire shareholders.
Accompanying the letter was more bad news, that sinking stock prices and a big writedown for the company's Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co investment fueled a $25.39 billion fourth-quarter net loss, and caused Berkshire to post its lowest annual profit since 2001.
But many of Berkshire's more than 90 businesses, such as the Geico auto insurer and BNSF railroad, performed well, and quarterly operating profit rose 71 percent.
Buffett uses his shareholder letters to focus on Berkshire's operating businesses, tout the strength of the U.S. economy, and criticize thinking and business practices that get in the way.
The 88-year-old said Berkshire's success has been in part a product of ""the American tailwind"" that has enabled the country to enjoy ""almost unbelievable prosperity.""
He said that since he began investing in 1942, that prosperity has been overseen by seven Republican and seven Democratic presidents, through times of war and financial crisis, and gained in a bipartisan manner.
Trump often takes credit for upbeat news on the economy and stock market, sometimes tying them to his economic policies. 
Buffett, who supported Democrat Hillary Clinton in her 2016 White House run, said no one person should claim credit when things go well.
""It is beyond arrogance for American businesses or individuals to boast that they have 'done it alone,'"" Buffett wrote.
Buffett also made a possible oblique criticism of Trump's bragging about U.S. economic performance, including relative to other countries such as China, where Berkshire invests in electric car maker BYD Co. 
The United States, according to Buffett, should ""rejoice"" when other countries have bright futures.
""Americans will be both more prosperous and safer if all nations thrive,"" he wrote. ""At Berkshire, we hope to invest significant sums across borders.""
The White House was not immediately available for comment. Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and longtime Berkshire investor, said: ""It sent an extraordinarily strong message about how open markets and free trade end up helping all participants do better."" 
LOOKING FOR ELEPHANTS
Part of the reason Buffett may be looking to invest abroad is that he is struggling to find big investments at home, and does not expect that to change soon.
Berkshire has not make a major acquisition since paying $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts in January 2016.
Buffett said the near-term prospects for more acquisitions were ""not good,"" because prices are ""sky-high"" for businesses that had decent long-term prospects.
While Buffett said the thought of an ""elephant-sized"" acquisition causes his heart to beat faster, the ""disappointing reality"" was that Berkshire would likely in 2019 use some of its $111.9 billion of cash to buy more stocks.
Berkshire ended 2018 with $172.8 billion of equities, but many of these suffered double-digit price declines in the quarter, including a 30 percent slide in its largest holding, iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Those declines were a major factor in Berkshire's huge quarterly loss, and its 91 percent drop in full-year net income to $4.02 billion from $44.94 billion the prior year, when it benefited from a lower corporate tax rate.
Accounting rules require Berkshire to report unrealized stock gains and losses with net income, causing huge quarterly swings that Buffett says are usually meaningless.
Operating profit in the quarter totaled $5.72 billion, or $3,484 per Class A share, topping analyst forecasts, and for the year rose 71 percent to $24.78 billion.
The operating businesses are overseen by Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, freeing Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 95, to focus on capital allocation.
Results also were hurt by a $3.02 billion writedown for intangible assets that Buffett said was ""almost entirely"" attributable to Kraft Heinz, in which Berkshire owns a 26.7 percent stake. 
The packaged food company on Thursday shocked investors when it reported a $15.4 billion writedown for Kraft, Oscar Mayer and other assets, slashed its dividend, and said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was examining its accounting practices.
While dated Saturday, Buffett's shareholder letter is written well in advance, and did not discuss Kraft Heinz's travails or the day-to-day management of that company by 3G Capital, the Brazilian firm and Buffett business partner.

Berkshire bought back about $418 million of its stock in the quarter. It has recouped some losses on its stock holdings this year, though the Standard & Poor's 500 remains 4 percent below where it was at the end of September.

647,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2019 01:09PM ET</span>","Southwest CEO says mechanics deserve new contract, but company wants 'flexibility'","By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co's mechanics, who have been in labor contract talks for more than six years, deserve a new deal that makes them among the best paid in the airline industry, but the low-cost U.S. carrier needs ""more supplier flexibility"" in return, the company's chief executive said.
The labor dispute, one of the biggest to hit a top-four U.S. airline in more than a decade, has escalated with Southwest's daily out-of-service aircraft doubling, forcing the carrier to cancel hundreds of flights since Feb. 15.
Southwest CEO Gary Kelly in an email to the company's employees acknowledged the company was ""in a period of tension and turmoil"" regarding the out-of-service aircraft. Reuters obtained a copy of the email late Friday.
Kelly said the mechanics deserve a new contract and pointed out that the deal the mechanics voted down last year would have made those workers the highest paid in the industry. He said current talks offer the opportunity to offer even higher pay with no impact on job security ""in exchange for more supplier flexibility.""
Southwest already outsources the majority of heavy maintenance work, such as scheduled engine repairs, to external suppliers, but wants the option to send more scheduled maintenance abroad in order to fund compensation increases. The change would not affect the kind of work currently handled by its mechanics, a Southwest spokesman said.
Officials with the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA), which represents about 2,400 Southwest mechanics and has been in contract talks with management since 2012, could not immediately be reached to comment on Saturday. 
The union has disputed the notion that the maintenance issues are driven by the labor dispute, pointing out the company has the lowest mechanic-to-aircraft ratio of any major carrier.
In a Friday email to its members, the union rejected the company's assertion that the maintenance issues were a job action and said mechanics should not allow themselves to be pressured to ignore safety or mechanical issues with a plane.
""If you feel you are being pressured to disregard aircraft damage or shortcut the manuals, then let your airline representative know of such threats,"" union national director Bret Oestreich said in the email. ""But do not get baited into acts of defiance that will be characterized as insubordination.""
Flights by Southwest accounted for more than a third of 777 U.S. cancellations between Friday and Saturday, according to FlightAware.com.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett is hunting for ""an elephant-sized acquisition,"" but he is not optimistic about getting it done.
The billionaire investor wrote in an annual letter to shareholders on Saturday that the prospects of landing a mega-deal for his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc conglomerate are ""not good,"" because ""prices are sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects.""
It is a problem for the Berkshire chairman and chief executive, whose company is sitting on $112 billion in cash and other low-returning assets that it has been struggling to invest for years.
""In the years ahead, we hope to move much of our excess liquidity into businesses that Berkshire will permanently own. The immediate prospects for that, however, are not good: Prices are sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects,"" Buffett wrote. ""That disappointing reality means that 2019 will likely see us again expanding our holdings of marketable equities. We continue, nevertheless, to hope for an elephant-sized acquisition.""
The prospect of such a deal, ""causes my heart ... to beat faster,"" the 88-year-old investor said.
NO ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM 
But Buffet said he would not get caught short of cash that he could use should market conditions deteriorate. Some of Buffett's transactions over the last decade or so have included complex deals with distressed companies, including in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
Buffett's insurance business, meanwhile, collects premiums from businesses and individuals, cash that Buffett and his deputies use to make other investments. 
But the U.S. stock market has been on a stride since the financial crisis a decade ago, leaving little room for the bargain-hunting value investor to make his mark, much as had been the case for Buffett during the run-up in technology stocks in the 1990s.
Buffett often invests in stocks, such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) , when he cannot find whole companies to buy. On Saturday, he said his inability to find a company to buy meant more stock buying is likely in 2019.
The Omaha, Nebraska, investor has also been snapping up more shares of his own stock. Berkshire bought back about $1.3 billion of its common stock in 2018, the company said.
But Buffett slammed corporate bosses who buy stock back when prices are lofty. Stock buybacks ""should be price-sensitive,"" and ""blindly buying an overpriced stock is value-destructive, a fact lost on many promotional or ever-optimistic CEOs,"" Buffett said in the closely watched letter.

Several U.S. lawmakers have proposed restricting share buybacks, saying companies are incurring debt or wasting money to prop up their stock prices, while not making investments in their business or properly paying employees. Companies often argue they are just returning cash they cannot use to shareholders who can put the money to work.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Pushing companies to perform better has earned Third Point a 300 percent return in the last eight years, the hedge fund told investors in a letter on Thursday, praising management at some of its targets for taking the right steps.
The $14 billion firm, run by Daniel Loeb, lost 11.3 percent in 2018 but said corporate activism, including campaigns it waged at Campbell Soup and Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) last year, will remain a priority in the future.
Shorting, or betting that stocks will drop, as well as opportunistic credit investments and identifying mispriced intrinsic value securities, are other areas where Third Point can compete in a world increasingly dominated by computer driven trading and passive investments like index funds.
Loeb pressed management and boards at several companies over the last year and on Thursday he gave a shout-out to Mark Schneider, CEO of food company Nestle SA, as well as Mark Clouse, the newly appointed CEO of Campbell Soup, who was recruited to the position with Third Point's help.
Eight months after publicly pressuring Nestle for more sales and restructuring, Loeb praised Nestle and Schneider for announcing plans to explore alternatives for its Herta charcuterie business and announcing a strategic review of its skin health business. 
""We believe Nestlé can sustain this new momentum beyond 2020, as the company continues to sharpen its strategy, better align its portfolio around key categories, and improve its
organization to become more agile,"" the letter, seen by Reuters, said. Loeb added ""We remain confident in Mr. Schneider’s leadership.""
This is the first time Loeb has spoken extensively about Nestle since admonishing the company in July saying ""This is a call for urgency -- rather than incrementalism.""
The letter also said that Third Point had called on management at United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), where it remains a large owner, to consider a ""value-creating transaction"" for Carrier, and said ""management are receptive to these suggestions.""

Third Point, like many other activist investors, lost money last year, ending the year with a 11.3 percent loss. It was only the second double digit decline in its 24 year history, the letter said. The fund said it has made money this year and is well positioned to benefit when volatility picks up and markets sell off anew.

(Reuters) - Sinking stocks and deteriorating prospects from an investment in Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co pummeled the bottom line of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, which on Saturday reported a huge quarterly net loss even as operating profit soared.
The fourth-quarter net loss was $25.39 billion, or $15,467 per Class A share, reflecting more than $27.6 billion of investment losses, including from stocks Berkshire still owns.
That compared with a year-earlier profit of $32.55 billion, or $19,790 per Class A share, most of which resulted from a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate.
Results included a $3.02 billion writedown for intangible assets that Buffett said was ""almost entirely"" attributable to Kraft Heinz, in which Berkshire owns a 26.7 percent stake.
The packaged food company on Thursday shocked investors when it reported its own $15.4 billion writedown for Kraft, Oscar Mayer and other assets, and said U.S. securities regulators were examining its accounting practices.
Buffett also released his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, which did not discuss Kraft Heinz's recent travails or the day-to-day management of the company by his business partner, the Brazilian firm 3G Capital.
Net results suffered because many of Berkshire's common stock holdings saw double-digit price declines, including a 30 percent decline in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), its largest holding.
Accounting rules require Berkshire to report unrealized stock gains and losses with net income. This causes huge swings in net results, and Buffett has urged investors not to use them as a measure of Berkshire's business performance.
Quarterly operating profit rose 71 percent to $5.72 billion, or about $3,484 per Class A share, benefiting from improved results in many businesses including the Geico auto insurer and BNSF railroad.
Analysts on average expected operating profit of $3,349.04 per share, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data.
The decline in stock prices also pummeled Berkshire's book value per Class A share, which fell 7.1 percent in the quarter to $212,503.
Buffett had long used book value as a gauge of Berkshire's intrinsic worth.
But he told shareholders on Saturday it has ""lost the relevance it once had,"" citing changes in Berkshire's business and investment mix, accounting rules, and the likelihood of additional stock buybacks that could depress it.
Book value, he said, has become ""increasingly out of touch with economic reality.""
Berkshire ended the year with $111.9 billion of cash and equivalents.
For all of 2018, Berkshire's operating profit rose 71 percent to $24.78 billion, while net income tumbled 91 percent to $4.02 billion.

Berkshire Class A shares closed at $302,000 on Friday, about 10 percent below its October record high.

The Justice Department has charged Huawei and its chief financial officer with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran by doing business through a subsidiary it tried to hide. The United States is seeking her extradition.
In a separate case, the Justice Department charged the telecommunications equipment maker with stealing robotic technology from T-Mobile US Inc. Huawei has said the companies settled their dispute in 2017.
Trump told reporters at the White House that U.S. officials are not talking about dropping charges against Huawei.
Huawei will be raised with U.S. attorneys and the attorney general in the coming weeks, Trump said, but ""right now it's not something that we're discussing.""
Last year, Chinese peer ZTE was prevented from buying essential components from U.S. firms after pleading guilty to similar charges, crippling its operations.
ZTE resumed normal business after paying up to $1.4 billion in fines and replacing its entire board, on top of a near $900 million penalty paid in 2017.

It is not clear how ZTE could be involved in any trade agreement.

652,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 23, 2019 03:30AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. Glencore Puts a Cap on Coal
 Glencore  (LON:GLEN), the world’s biggest mining group, bowed before the winds of change this week, saying it plans to cap the amount of coal it produces each year at current levels of around 150 million tons.
The move is, in part, a response to pressure from investors worried that the billions they have at stake in fossil fuels could be at risk.
“To deliver a strong investment case to our shareholders, we must invest in assets that will be resilient to regulatory, physical and operational risks related to climate change,” CEO Ivan Glasenberg said.
That means no new mine developments.
It also means the cash it earns from coal -- $5.3 billion last year before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- will go to fund investment in cobalt, zinc and copper, which all figure prominently in low-carbon energy technologies (especially batteries). Glencore also promised more thorough and regular updates on its own carbon footprint.
But this is no Damascene conversion. Glencore actually plans to increase coal output by 12% this year thanks to two big acquisitions that closed in 2018. Nor does it plan to wind down any current operations ahead of schedule.
In that light, Glencore’s announcement looks more like a prudent decision not to sink billions of dollars into new mines that may not have a market. Global coal demand isn’t widely expected to peak for another decade or two, but China and India’s struggles with pollution -- and the inroads made by renewable energy sources -- clearly have the potential to leave expensive new long-term projects stranded. That’s not a risk that Glasenberg and his team, with still-fresh memories of a scrape with bankruptcy in 2015, are likely to underestimate.
2. U.S and OPEC in Harmony?
When he announced OPEC’s landmark production cut deal in December, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he shared Donald Trump’s vision of continued growth for the U.S. oil and gas industry.
“We have no problem with that,” Al-Falih said. “Hopefully, we can grow together, not one at the expense of the other.’
This week it looked like both the U.S. President and Al-Falih got their wish.
Data on Thursday showed U.S. crude exports hit a record high of 3.6 million barrels per day for the week ended Feb. 15, while achieving all-time peaks in production at 12 million bpd.
And it’s not just U.S. oil exports and production that’s growing.
Midland County, Texas, which sits within the prolific Permian shale basin, had the largest county employment growth in the third quarter of 2018, according to data released this week by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Employment jumped 11.9% in Midland, with 5,824 new jobs in natural resources and mining, a gain of 23.7% year over year.
The Saudis, on their end, are sitting on a near-35% hike in oil prices since the lows of Christmas Eve, thanks to relentless production cuts carried out in the two months since the OPEC meeting.
Seldom have U.S. and Saudi goals for oil aligned like this.
Yet analysts aren’t sure if the game will stay mutually beneficial.
That’s because while Riyadh is closer to its desired oil price of $80 per barrel, it has gotten there by cutting production aggressively -- to the extent of even ceding market share in Asia, its most prized destination.
Underscoring that notion, the Indian Oil Corporation said this week that it has signed a $1.5 billion deal to buy U.S. oil to reduce dependence on traditional suppliers.
In December, Al-Falih said U.S. shale operators were “probably breathing a sigh of relief that we’re providing some certainty and visibility for 2019.”
The Saudis may have provided the American oil industry with a lot more than that.
3. Market Holds Its Breadth
Anyone can get caught up in the euphoria of a swashbuckling market rally or panic selling in a downturn. But whether the move is led by a few stocks or a broad range can be the difference between a trend and a fake-out.
Enter the Advance-Decliners Line, a measure of market breadth.
The New York Stock Exchange’s AD line hit an all-time high on Wednesday, indicating the market breadth has never been better.
With the AD line at record highs and market breadth showing little sign of breaking down, momentum is clearly with the bulls.
But in recent weeks, many have questioned whether the recent run-up in the major averages is overdone, with the S&P 500 about 5% off its all-time highs during a week that saw major economic reports sink to multiyear lows.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's business index fell to its lowest level since May 2016. The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators fell for the second month in a row in January, the first time that's happened since early 2016. Existing home sales slumped to their lowest levels since Nov. 15.
Advancing stocks have also bulldozed decliners thanks to traders covering short positions, but this will soon run out of road, according to analysts.
""Buying to close out unsuccessful bets against U.S. stocks may fade as a source of market resiliency,"" according to Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at Bay Crest Partners. Krinsky cited changes in short interest on S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 index exchange-traded funds.
The number of SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) ETF shares sold short fell 22% in January to a four-month low.
Still, stocks can count on the Federal Reserve's accommodative policy to remain in place. And the gloomy clouds over U.S.-China trade, which many believe is key to either ending the rally or triggering a downturn, have begun to clear.
With the clock running down on the March 1 trade deadline, any whiff of a meaningful deal in the coming days will likely support another wave of buying, staving off the risk the AD line peaks and ODs.

653,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2019 02:15AM ET</span>",Wall St. Week Ahead: May be time for growth to run out of gas,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A return to fashion of growth stocks in 2019 helped lead the overall market out of a year-end shakeout, but another multi-year run of growth performing better than value may not be in the cards. 
The S&P 500 has rallied nearly 18 percent since its Dec. 24 low. During that time the Russell 1000 Growth index has fared even better with a gain of almost 20 percent while the Russell 1000 Value index has lagged with a gain of about 17 percent. 
That marks a reversal from the fourth quarter, when value outperformed as stocks nearly tumbled into bear market territory, a trend some analysts feel will return as the market grapples with several major headwinds such as Brexit and trade negotiations. 
Growth investors typically search for companies that have higher profit growth and margins, while value investors look for stocks that seem inexpensive.
Shortly after the S&P hit its most recent record on Sept. 20, thanks to the outperformance by growth, especially technology stocks, the spread between the Russell 1000 growth and value indexes had surpassed the levels hit during the end of the dot-com era. The fourth quarter selloff helped that narrow but it began to widen again shortly before the new year. 
""The valuation imbalance we have seen between growth and value in the largecap space ... when we have seen that inflection point in the past there has been a very powerful long-term rally where value has outperformed growth and we think that is coming up,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist, at Federated Investors, in New York.
(Graphic: Historic spread between value and growth stocks - https://tmsnrt.rs/2V7L04a
(Graphic: Russell 1000 growth vs value spread - https://tmsnrt.rs/2VgekWh
In a recent note to clients,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) equity strategist Michael Wilson said that the stocks that got hit first and hardest during last year's ""rolling bear market"" would lead the recovery this year and rally the hardest. That prediction appears to be playing out as areas such as transportation, considered cyclical value, have been among the leaders to the upside this year. 
Wilson anticipated the Federal Reserve will hold off raising interest rates further and that the global economy would bottom in the first half. He favors value over growth, with a focus on cyclical over defensive stocks. 
Value stocks also remain cheap relative to growth shares, with their widest forward price-to-earnings ratio spread in over a decade. And while investor worries about a recession, which helped fuel the fourth-quarter sell-off, have abated, a number of headwinds remain that could make value more attractive as market uncertainty rises.
""There are still a lot of headaches coming, whether it is Brexit, China - what is the (trade) package going to look like? - the legal stuff in Washington,"" said Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York. 
The Russell 1000 Value forward PE also sits right at its long-term average of about 13.8 while the Growth index is nearly 20, well above its historic average of 17.5. 
(Graphic: Forward PE of Russell Growth and Value indexes - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ep2nrw)
One challenge, even though value is relatively cheap, is that financials have a heavy weighting in value indexes and a Fed pause will make it harder for those firms to grow profits. 
Even though, as of the last reconstitution of Russell indexes in June, the financial services sector saw the most significant decrease in index weight in the largecap 1000 value index, it still was 29.1 percent. In the Russell 2000 Smallcap Value financials command a weighting of 40.5 percent.
""If value is going to work, it has to be financials,"" said Mark Stoeckle, CEO at Adams Funds in Baltimore in an interview with Reuters. 

""The one thing people were counting on in the first half of 2018 with the Fed was it was going to continue to raise rates, this (was) going to be good for banks – and not so much anymore.""

654,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2019 06:23PM ET</span>",Brazil judge suspends Embraer-Boeing tie-up negotiations: court document,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A Brazilian judge on Friday suspended negotiations for the tie-up of Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer SA and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, according to a court document.
The court issued an injunction suspending an Embraer shareholders meeting scheduled for Feb. 26 that would vote on whether to approve the terms already agreed upon by the two companies. 
The decision will likely be appealed to a higher court. Several previous injunctions blocking the progress of the negotiation have been overruled.
Embraer said in a statement that it will take all available measures to maintain the shareholders meeting' date for Feb. 26. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Federal judge Victorio Giuzio Neto wrote in his decision on a union lawsuit against Embraer that until all alleged illegalities in the negotiating process were evaluated, the shareholders meeting must be suspended.
In the deal, Embraer will sell 80 percent of its commercial plane division for $4.2 billion to Boeing, which will have total control of the new venture.
In the lawsuit, unions representing Embraer workers said the company's management did not respect local legislation for listed companies, particularly in respect to what decisions should have been taken to shareholders instead of being made by the company's management alone.

The Brazilian government, which holds a golden share in Embraer, has already approved the deal.

658,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 22, 2019 05:00PM ET</span>",Trump Says Executive Order to Block Huawei 5G Sales Is an Option,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he may use an executive order to stop Huawei Technologies Co. from selling advanced telecommunications equipment in the U.S.
“Well we’re not doing anything right now,” Trump told reporters when asked about an executive order. “So we do that with the attorney general, if we do anything.”
“I guess there’s a question as to whether or not that’s being included in the agreement,” Trump said in the Oval Office during a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He as trade talks continued.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other members of Trump’s trade team have advised the president to hold off on signing an executive order that would ban Huawei and other Chinese telecoms equipment from U.S. networks because they worry such action would upset the trade negotiations, according to people familiar with internal deliberations.
The U.S. and China are extending the current round of trade talks in Washington after negotiations yielded progress on currency policy but stopped short of a breakthrough.
American officials suspect Shenzhen-based Hauwei’s products could be used by Beijing to spy on Western governments and companies. Huawei has denied being a threat.
Trump on Thursday challenged U.S. companies to boost their efforts to build advanced networks and said leadership should come from competition, not by blocking competitors.
On Friday, he was asked to elaborate.
“I want to have competition with China,” Trump said. “Fair competition. I don’t want to block out anybody, if we can help it. ”
""Now if there’s going to be a security reason or something that we have no choice?” Trump said. “But that is one of the things we’ll be discussing today. We want to have open competition.”
Trump said dropping criminal charges in the case of Huawei’s Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou is not being discussed. Meng is under house arrest in Vancouver and faces potential extradition from Canada to the U.S. to face charges related to violations of sanctions on Iran.

659,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2019 04:54PM ET</span>",S&P 500 posts highest close since November 8 on trade optimism,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 posted its highest closing level since Nov. 8 on Friday as investors clung to signs of progress in the ongoing trade talks between the United States and China.
Investors assessed a slew of headlines on the talks, with top trade negotiators from the two countries meeting to wrap up a week of discussions on some of the thorniest issues in their trade war.
If the two sides fail to reach a deal by midnight on March 1, then their seven-month trade war could escalate.
""People are expecting some sort of positive news on trade and tariffs with China fairly soon,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
""But we won't know until the end of next week,"" he said, and, ""there has been a lack of specifics.""
Optimism on the trade front and dovish signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve have driven the recent gains and left indexes well above their lows of December, when the market swooned on fears of an economic slowdown. The S&P 500 is now up about 19 percent since its late-December low.
The S&P 500 technology index was up 1.3 percent, leading gains among the 11 major S&P sectors, while the trade-exposed industrials index climbed 0.6 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 181.18 points, or 0.7 percent, to 26,031.81, the S&P 500 gained 17.79 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,792.67 and the Nasdaq Composite added 67.84 points, or 0.91 percent, to 7,527.55.
All three indexes registered gains for the week, with both the Dow and Nasdaq posting a ninth week of increases.
The number of New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq stocks hitting 52-week highs hit 367, the most since mid-September and outnumbered those hitting year lows by the widest margin in six months.
Stocks briefly pared gains after U.S. officials briefed on the negotiations said more time is likely needed in the talks given China's resistance this week to American demands for specific steps by Beijing to end forced transfers of U.S. technology and certain other policies.
Afterward, President Donald Trump said there was a very good chance the United States would strike a deal with China to end the trade war, and that he was inclined to extend his March 1 deadline to reach an agreement.
""Right now the downside risk has been not as steep, but there's always a concern that something happens last-minute,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
""Having a Chinese economy that stabilizes is constructive for global markets,"" she said. ""That's what is key in terms of the market looking at the results."" 
Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co tumbled 27.5 percent, and was the biggest drag on the S&P along with a 1.7 percent fall in Class B shares of the company's controlling stakeholder,  Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE:BRKa) 
The packaged food company posted a quarterly loss, disclosed a Securities and Exchange Commission probe and wrote down the value of its iconic Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.99-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.45-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 64 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 112 new highs and 21 new lows.

About 6.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 7.3 billion-share daily average for the past 20 trading days.

660,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 22, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>","Don't Be Fooled, This Boring Week in Stocks Was Full of Drama","(Bloomberg) -- It was a heck of a week, considering nothing much happened.
U.S. stocks just finished marginally higher for the past four days. The S&P 500 Index rose 0.6 percent, having not closed up or down more than 18 points in any session. In fact, the so-called fear gauge for equities, the Cboe Volatility Index, posted the lowest average reading in the past four months.
That won’t ring many alarm bells for investors. After all, the S&P 500 has gained 16 percent over the past nine weeks, so a pause is understandable. No cause for panic. Unfortunately, there are plenty of other reasons for that.
A menace was lurking in plain sight amid this sea of tranquility: Growth fears have sent so many investors into the safety of Treasuries now with benchmark yields not far from the lowest in a year. The term premium has collapsed. Bond volatility is evaporating. And the bad economic omens have appeared by the day.
It raises a question: How long can this kind of stock performance survive?
“The rally definitely has meat on it, no way could it be resilient to that data otherwise,” said John Roe, the head of multi-asset funds at Legal & General with a combined 985 billion pounds ($1.3 trillion) under management. “What we’re now getting is Goldilocks being priced through 2019, with no Fed hikes, growth okay and recession risks fading.”
Yet a Goldilocks scenario requires economic growth to be neither too hot nor too cold. Given the speed at which expansion appears to be cooling, the resilience in equities seems remarkable. Sure, the bond rally is helping valuations and the hunt for yield for now -- but the global data looks ugly.
German manufacturing shrank the most in six years, Japan’s factory sector contracted for the first time since 2016, and South Korean exports tumbled. Shares in the world’s biggest shipping line, a bellwether for trade, plunged on its downbeat outlook for the year.
Numbers in the U.S. were hardly more impressive. Orders placed with U.S. factories for business equipment unexpectedly fell in December, while there was a steep decline in business conditions in the February Philadelphia Fed Survey.
Despite this, retail investors are becoming more bullish on U.S. equities. The share of mom-and-pop investors saying they’re bearish on U.S. stocks in the weekly American Association of Individual Investors survey is near the lowest level since June, while positive sentiment is around the highest since November.
“It’s definitely the case there’s a divergence between the macro data and stock markets,” said Anna Stupnytska, head of global macro and investment strategy at Fidelity International, which manages about $379 billion of client assets. “The risk-on mood in the markets is becoming much sharper and more intriguing.”
It’s probably because for many investors the equation has now changed, thanks to the surprise pliability of Jerome Powell and his counterparts around the world.
The apparent capitulation of policy makers to the turmoil in markets seen late last year -- at January’s rates decision the Fed chair acknowledged that “financial conditions matter” -- means that bad news is now good news. Weak economic readings mean easier monetary policies and that keeps financial conditions loose.
“Central bankers repeatedly remind people that most expansions don’t die of old age, they are killed by aggressive monetary tightening,” said Brian Jacobsen, a senior investment strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management, which oversees about $500 billion in assets. “If aggressive tightening is off the table, recession fears don’t have to become a recession reality.”
Because of this shift in outlook, an irony emerges: The growth fears that sparked the late-2018 selloff are now a necessary part of the rebound. Should economic expansion get back on track, it would increase the chances of a Fed rate hike, tightening liquidity and potentially triggering more losses and volatility.
“We are starting to see a bit of complacency seep into markets,” said William Hobbs, chief investment officer at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Investment Solutions in London. “Too much may be being made of the apparent change of direction from the world’s major central banks.”
Whichever is the bigger threat to the equity rally, higher rates or sliding growth, a consensus seems to be building that there may be limited upside following the recent epic rally.
For all that the bears are being contained, the bulls are hardly rampant. Investors are still not getting into the cheapest stocks, which tend to do well during economic booms, while growth shares are outperforming -- signaling a willingness to pay more for growth because it’s scarce.
“The market is currently in a ‘glass-half-full’ mood,” said Michael Strobaek, global chief investment officer at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG. “This optimism will soon require some fundamental support, either from the micro or the macro side. In the near term, we see the risks for equities as being skewed to the downside. We may have to wait for growth to improve to see renewed support.”
The good news may be that any downside shocks may be limited. Roe at Legal & General said “it’s a bit worrying when bad data gets little response,” but it shows a lack of extreme positioning in the market and that means it’s not very vulnerable to bad news.
Ultimately, perhaps that balance of limited upside and capped downside risk may help explain this go-nowhere week.
“A lot of the good news has been priced in now and for equity markets from here to hold up and to make further gains, they’re going to need a trade deal to be done, for the Fed not to raise rates and for the global economy to continue growing over the next couple of years,” said Mike Bell, a global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management. “There’s a risk that at least one of these things doesn’t happen.”

Following a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, Trump said there was a ""very good chance"" that a deal could happen, adding that the final points on a trade pact would likely be worked out in a potential meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the ""not-too-distant"" future.
In a sign that both sides remained committed to resolving their differences on trade, Liu extended his visit to the U.S. to continue talks with his U.S. counterparts.

The complaints filed on Friday in California involve luxury real estate in London and New York, as well as converted equity in a Kentucky facilities management company, and are tied to 2012 and 2013 bond offerings from the sovereign wealth fund, the department said. 
Earlier this week, Malaysia's home minister said the country may postpone the extradition of a former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) banker wanted in the multibillion-dollar scandal so he can face criminal charges in the Southeast Asian nation first.
The department has estimated that a total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014, including some funds that Goldman Sachs helped raise as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales totaling $6.5 billion.

Goldman has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to it about the bond sale proceeds.

663,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2019 04:00PM ET</span>",Factbox: German exposure to U.S. tariffs on European car imports,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump this week warned EU policymakers that the United States would impose tariffs on European car imports if a trade deal could not be reached.
Washington has said a 25 percent tariff on cars sourced from the European Union could be imposed on national security grounds, a step that European policymakers have called unwarranted. 
German carmakers Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Daimler and BMW, which have large plants in the United States, could be among the hardest hit. 
EXPORTS TO THE UNITED STATES
The United States bought 27.2 billion euros' ($31 billion) worth of German vehicles and components last year, making it the largest export market for the German auto industry, according to statistics released by Berlin's Federal Statistics office this week.
Together the Germans, including VW, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz BMW and Audi, sold 1.34 million cars and vans in the United States last year, according to German auto industry association VDA.
German companies built 750,000 luxury cars at U.S. plants, of which 44 percent were sold locally and the rest exported overseas, including 95,000 cars to China.
Around 690,000 German vehicles sold in the United States last year were imported from factories within the European Union, of which 470,000 came from German plants, VDA said.
DAIMLER 
For Daimler-owned Mercedes-Benz, the United States is the second most important sales market globally, behind China. Around 316,000 Mercedes-Benz vehicles were sold in the United States in 2018, or around 14 percent of the brand's global sales. Parent company Daimler declined to comment on how many cars were exported from Europe to the United States.
Daimler's U.S. factory in Tuscaloosa, Alabama has a production capacity of 300,000 vehicles and employs 3,700 people. It makes the GLE, GLE Coupe and GLS models.
BMW 
The Munich-based carmaker which owns the BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) brands, said it sold 355,000 cars in the United States last year and exported 102,354 cars from its plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, to Europe. The BMW brand on its own sold 311,014 cars.
Around 70 percent of the total production in Spartanburg, which builds BMW X3, X4, X5 and X6 vehicles, is exported outside of the United States, including 48,537 cars to China, 29,205 to Germany and 16,864 to the United Kingdom. 
VOLKSWAGEN
Volkswagen Group, which also owns the Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini and Porsche brands, delivered 638,300 cars in the United States in 2018. 
The multi-brand group imported 301,200 VW and Audi cars from Mexico to the U.S. and a further 236,000 cars from Europe. 
VW brand sold 354,064 cars in the U.S. last year of which 101,100 were built locally at a VW plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. 
VW's premium brand Audi sold 223,000 cars in the United States last year, of which 153,000 were imported from Europe and around 70,000 Audi Q5 sports utility vehicles from Mexico. 
VW's other sportscar brand Porsche sold 57,000 cars in the United States. Neither Audi nor Porsche has a factory in the U.S.

Analysts at Evercore ISI estimate that VW Group faces a 2.549 billion euro impact if the United States goes ahead and imposes a 25 percent tariff on imports from the EU. Daimler, which owns Mercedes-Benz and Smart, faces a 2 billion euro tariff hit while BMW, which owns Mini and Rolls-Royce, will take a 1.7 billion euro blow, Evercore said.

664,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 22, 2019 03:15PM ET</span>",Investors Bet Big on Zillow's Big Move; Stock Soars,"By Charley Blaine
Investing.com - Zillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG) changed CEOs on Thursday and announced it sees big things ahead for its home buying-and-selling business.
And investors were buying into the idea in a big way on Friday, with the stock up 22% on the news, approaching $43. But that's still down nearly 35% from its $65.42 peak last June.
The risks of the strategy are large, which even co-founder Rich Barton conceded. In retaking the reins from Spencer Rascoff, Barton said his challenge will be ""getting investors really excited about taking this journey over the chasm with us.""
In three to five years, Zillow sees itself buying and selling (after some fixing up) upwards of 5,000 homes a month, generating revenue of some $20 billion a year, which would translate into a 1.2% market share nationally, based on sales of about 5 million homes.
Plus, it will originate the mortgages to finance a third of the purchases, a whole new business.
The plan assumes a fairly affluent set of customers. The average house price looks around $333,000. At the end of the fourth quarter, the company owned 509 homes worth roughly $320,000, according to the company's fourth-quarter earnings statement. The median price for an existing home, according to the National Association of Realtors, was $247,500 in January.
The idea is to use Zillow's technology to streamline the home-buying process, right down to the closing. Zillow's online site revolutionized how agents do their business. The goal is to take the revolution to the logical conclusion.
Well and good, but so far the program, available in seven markets, is costing Zillow. It sold homes for $52.4 million and lost $62.4 million doing it. Even on an adjusted basis, where Zillow's main business generated $236 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and other charges, the homes business lost $45 million.
And even if profitable, the business of buying and selling homes is a low-margin business, around 2%. But generating home sales of $20 billion would mean a potential gross profit of $400 million -- if all goes well and business overall is stable. But as the 2008-2009 crash showed, the business can be very volatile and sales in recent months have slowed.
Zillow's revolution is generating growth. Fourth-quarter revenue was up 29% and full-year revenue of $1.3 billion was up 24% from the year-ago period. Results for the fourth quarter mostly met expectations.
Zillow was started by Barton, Rascoff and Lloyd Frink, who started  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE), which wildly disrupted the travel business."
665,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2019 02:50PM ET</span>",Kraft Heinz' problems shine light on controversial budget tool,"By Martinne Geller and Richa Naidu
LONDON/BOCA RATON, Fla. (Reuters) - Mounting troubles at Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), revealed late on Thursday with a triple-punch of bad news, call into question its reliance on cost-cutting as a way to generate profit growth. 
Shares of Kraft Heinz fell 27 percent on Friday to their lowest level since the 2015 merger of the eponymous cheese and ketchup makers that formed the world's fifth-largest food and drinks company.
Late on Thursday, it revealed a $15.4 billion write-down tied to its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands, slashed its dividend by about a third and disclosed an SEC investigation of its procurement accounting practices.
The news validated investors' concerns about the health of the company's brands and its pricing power in an environment of rising commodity and transportation costs and more competition. 
Half of the group's market value vanished over the last two years even before Friday, dampening enthusiasm for its backers, private equity firm 3G Capital, and its notorious embrace of a tool called zero-based budgeting (ZBB), used to keep costs low and profit margins high.
""At some point, having best-in-class margins doesn't matter if the sales growth doesn't eventually come,"" said Guggenheim analyst Laurent Grandet. 
A Kraft Heinz spokesman said the company's ZBB efforts continued to drive savings that can be invested in growing the business.
""In 2019, we will increase brand support, go-to-market with a more innovation than ever and invest in talent… and this will be partially funded by ZBB savings,"" spokesman Michael Mullen said. 3G could not immediately be reached for comment. 
ZBB FIT FOR EVERYONE? 
Zero-based budgeting is an approach requiring corporate managers to justify each item of spending every year, or even build their budgets from scratch, rather than the more common process of using the prior year's budget as a starting point. 
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter wanted to apply it to federal spending, but it never took off and was abandoned. 
It came back into fashion among corporations over the last decade, after 3G Capital used it to great margin effect at brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, whose creation it orchestrated, and then at Kraft Heinz.
Both clocked industry-leading profit margins, and that led more consumer companies to adopt it in recent years as investors' focus shifted to profits from sales, which were slowing amid a slowdown in once-hot emerging markets, new competition from independent challenger brands and weak pricing power due to e-commerce and discounters like Aldi and Lidl. 
At the same time, high-profile activist investors set their sights on the sector, prompting many CEOs to squeeze out costs.
""The cuts can be impressive, and that's a big win,"" said consultants BCG in a report from 2017. They noted, however, that faster growth was not a guaranteed result. ""When it's applied clumsily, ZBB can have a demoralizing impact that distracts the organization from growth and value creation."" 
Kraft on Thursday missed fourth-quarter earnings estimates and forecast a decline in operating earnings for 2019. 
""KHC's EBITDA has not grown over the last five years, its revenue has declined, and its balance sheet has ballooned,"" said analysts at JP Morgan. ""This is not an ideal progression of financial metrics."" 
 Unilever  (LON:ULVR), Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) International,  Diageo  (LON:DGE) and Kellogg are among companies that have used ZBB, though none has seen as bad results as Kraft's. 
""I think it's a black eye for Kraft Heinz management for not implementing it in as a sophisticated way as might be necessary, or maybe they just implemented it too hard, too fast,"" Investec analyst Eddy Hargreaves said. ""I don't think ZBB per se is the problem.""
Others said it was not just cost-cuts that led to the write-down of the Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands. 
""Are these the kinds of things people are buying these days? Are they fresh? Novel? Healthy? They don’t tick any of the boxes,"" said Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt.
The head of investment at a European consulting firm said ZBB was not the answer for problems ailing Kraft and its packaged food peers, which are suffering as consumers eschew traditional staples like macaroni-and-cheese and bologna for fresher, less-processed or healthier options. 

""To catch up with the shift of consumer demand for better-for-you and sustainable food, you have to innovate. And to innovate you simply can't use ZBB,"" he said.

666,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 22, 2019 02:50PM ET</span>",Vanguard Bond ETFs Lose $1.4 Billion as December Buyer Bails,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s been a painful week for a clutch of exchange-traded funds run by Vanguard Group Inc.
Three of its bond ETFs lost a total of $1.4 billion in a single day as one large trader, Beacon Capital Management, decided to sell. The Vanguard Long-Term Bond ETF, ticker BLV, saw its largest daily outflow on record as over $470 million drained away, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Short-term and intermediate-term debt funds also lost more than $400 million apiece.
Beacon is shifting back to 11 of Vanguard’s sector ETFs after volatility late last year prompted the firm to sell stock funds and hole-up in debt, according to Chris Cook, the firm’s president. The firm adheres to a rules-based strategy, and a 10 percent drop in its benchmark spurred the temporary move into debt ETFs, he said.
“We had taken more of a risk-off position in December, and those trades have reversed,” Cook said.
More than $1.3 billion of large block trades in the three funds crossed the tape between 10:38 a.m. and 10:46 a.m. in New York on Tuesday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In addition to BLV, millions of shares traded in the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Bond ETF and the Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF in a matter of minutes. A spokesman for Vanguard declined to comment.
Beacon isn’t the only investor bailing on bonds as stocks rise to an almost three-month high. The $19.6 billion iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, ticker SHV, bled over $1 billion Thursday, the fund’s largest outflow since March 2016. Two trades, totaling 9.4 million shares worth over $1 billion, crossed the tape at 12:46 p.m. in New York. Only Milliman Inc., Transamerica Investment Services and Grupo Financiero Scotiabank Inverlat SA de CV had owned more than 9 million shares, according to their latest government filings.
Officials from Milliman and Scotiabank didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment while a representative for Transamerica wasn’t immediately able to comment when contacted by phone.

667,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2019 02:33PM ET</span>","Kraft Heinz shares fall 28 percent after writedown, dividend cut","By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co shares fell to a record low on Friday a day after the food company disclosed a $15 billion write-down on its marquee brands, raising concern that years of rigorous cost cutting have eroded the value of its Kraft cheeses and Oscar Mayer deli meats.
Kraft's revenue growth has stagnated in the years since it merged with Heinz as consumers shun older, established brands for newer products, cheaper private label brands and non-processed and organic food.
The shares fell as much 28 percent to a low of $34.51, wiping $17 billion off the company's market value. In mid-afternoon trading, shares were down $13.10 at $35.07. 
(Graphic: Kraft Heinz stock crushed by writedown - https://tmsnrt.rs/2BNXPcJ)
Shares of rivals food makers also fell, with  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS), Conagra Brands Inc,  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) and Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) all down between 1 percent and 3 percent. 
Brazil's buyout fund 3G Capital and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc together own more than 50 percent of Kraft Heinz. 3G has advocated the company combat higher transportation, commodity costs and sluggish growth by reining in expenses companywide. But that has come at a price.
""Investors for years have asked if 3G's extreme belt-tightening model ultimately would result in brand equity erosion,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Ken Goldman said.
""We think the answer arguably came yesterday in the form of a $15 billion intangible asset write-down for the Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands,"" said Goldman, who cut his rating to ""neutral"" from ""overweight.""
On Thursday, Kraft Heinz, whose brands include Jell-O gelatin dessert and Velveeta processed cheese, reported a quarterly loss, said it would cut its dividend 36 percent and disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company's accounting policies. 
Ketchup-maker Heinz merged with Kraft in 2015 in a deal engineered by 3G. Under 3G's stewardship, the new company embarked on extreme cost cutting that risked stifling investment in innovation and marketing.
Warren Buffett releases his annual letter to shareholders on Saturday and investors will scour the document for any insight from the billionaire on his Kraft stake and relationship with 3G. 
ZERO-BASED BUDGETING
Under 3G, Kraft Heinz embraced zero-based budgeting, a cost-conscious strategy intended to improve operating margins that requires managers to justify all expenses, from pencils to forklifts. 
Some analysts are now questioning the effectiveness of 3G's model, given that the company's margins before interest and taxes fell to 23.2 percent in 2018 from 27.2 percent in 2015, the year Kraft Heinz was formed.
""We see the 3G model as highly dependent on deal-making and synergy realization and at some point having best-in-class margins doesn't matter if the sales growth doesn't eventually come,"" Guggenheim Partners' analyst Laurent Grandet said in a note.
""Kraft Heinz results confirmed all our worst fears – plus more,"" Grandet wrote in a note.
Stifel downgraded the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy"" and more than halved its price target to $35, well below the current median target of $52. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) cut its price target by $9 to $33, making it the lowest on Wall Street.
""This is not your typical ""reset the base and everything will be fine"" story,"" Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow wrote. 
""The dividend cut, the write-down of the Kraft and Oscar Mayer trademarks, and the guidance for further divestitures demonstrate the hallmarks of a company that has a serious balance sheet problem,"" Moskow said.
The news also hit the company's bond investors. Kraft Heinz's nearly $31 billion of bonds were among the most heavily traded paper in the U.S. corporate debt market on Friday morning, according to MarketAxess, and yields on several of their largest bonds shot higher and their prices dropped by a full point or more.

Spreads on their bonds, or the premium demanded by investors as compensation for holding Kraft paper over safer U.S. Treasury securities, widened by the most ever across a range of the company’s bonds.

669,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2019 01:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Safety problem found at Areva's Finnish reactor before start-up - regulator,"By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos
OSLO (Reuters) - Finland's nuclear regulator has identified a safety issue at Olkiluoto 3, a 1.6-gigawatt reactor built by France's Areva, now renamed Orano, and the problem needs to be fixed before the unit can receive a permit to operate, the regulator told Reuters.
The reactor is due to start producing electricity in January next year after a decade-long delay.
Part of the pressuriser, a primary circuit component of the reactor, is vibrating at levels that exceed safety limits, said Pekka Valikangas, the regulator's section head for nuclear reactor regulation, ahead of an important assessment which is due to be published on Monday.
""The test results show that these vibrations are not approved,"" Valikangas said in an interview.
The safety assessment by STUK, Finland's radiation and nuclear safety authority, is a key report that will influence the government's decision on whether to grant Olkiluoto 3 an operation permit.
""This must be taken care of before the ministry decides on the permit,"" Valikangas said, adding that the regulator would offer two options for a solution. The reactor's owner, Finnish consortium TVO, and supplier Orano would need to choose from those options.
STUK is also expected to publish on Monday its recommendation to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, which decides energy policy and will rule on the reactor's permit.
Valikangas said he could not tell whether the development would lead to further delays, adding it was up to Areva and TVO to fix the problem on time.
""I do not know if it will delay the reactor. There is still time in the testing program to fix it,"" he said.
The part of the pressuriser that needs fixing is the pipeline, which is related to the reactor's cooling system and was supplied by Areva, Valikangas said. This component is responsible for balancing pressure in the reactor.
He did not elaborate on the two solutions STUK had identified and said further details would be made public on Monday.
There was no suggestion that the problem identified at Olkiluoto 3 would affect other reactors.
MULTIPLE DELAYS
The facility in western Finland, already more than a decade behind schedule, has sustained several delays. The latest, announced last November, entitled the Finnish operator to a payment of 18 million euros ($20.4 million) from Areva.
Before that, in March, Areva settled a long-running dispute with TVO by agreeing to pay 450 million euros for cost overruns and delays. It also agreed to pay a further 20 million euros for each additional month of delays from Jan. 1, 2020.
The reactor previously experienced vibration issues which delayed hot testing in the first half of 2018. TVO said then that they would be fixed within few months but STUK said the problem remains ahead of the permit decision.
TVO said it had identified the problem and been working with Areva on a fix, which it expected to have in place during spring.
""We have been testing different options. We have a solution for that. There are two support system options and we have picked the right one ... We need to show STUK that it works,"" a TVO spokesman said.
He could not say whether that would secure the permit TVO needs, adding that Olkiluoto 3 could not start loading fuel before receiving that approval.
Orano was not immediately available for comment.
Finland needs the reactor as it imports more than 25 percent of its electricity from neighboring Sweden and Russia, while its energy needs are growing.

TVO's owners include utility company Pohjolan Voima, its rival and Nordic electricity major Fortum, EPV Energia, Loiste Holding and Kemira.

The company has received legal notices from the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the New York Department of Financial Services, it said in a filing on Thursday.
The United States Securities and Exchange commission had also issued a subpoena on May 14, 2018, regarding disclosure issues relating to the data breach, while the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada has informed Equifax it intends to ""make certain findings and recommendation"" related to the incident.
The company has been named in 19 class action lawsuits in courts across the country, it said, and has spent hundreds of millions of dollars since disclosing the breach.
Regulators in the UK and Australia have also fined the company for the breach that saw personal information such as Social Security numbers, birth dates and addresses of millions of people being stolen by hackers.

Equifax first disclosed in September 2017 that it had been the target of a massive data breach, mostly in the United States.

The No.1 U.S. automaker is revamping its operations, which include plant closures and thousands of job cuts, as it looks to boost profitability in the wake of declining U.S. auto sales.
The Hamtramck plant will continue to produce the Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac CT6 sedans until early next year, the company said.
""We are balancing production timing while continuing the availability of Cadillac advanced technology features currently included in the CT6-V - the Blackwing Twin-Turbo V-8 (engine) and Super Cruise (driver assistance system),"" GM said.
The plant has already discontinued production of the Buick LaCrosse sedan and Chevrolet Volt electric hybrid car.
Detroit-based union United Auto Workers' President Gary Jones said GM's decision to continue production at the plant was a relief for the workers as well as their families.

""We commend GM for today's decision and we reiterate the importance of a collective bargaining process in times like these,"" Jones said.

680,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2019 11:55AM ET</span>",U.S. judge will not block Amazon-Berkshire-JPMorgan health venture's new hire,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday declined to block a UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) unit's former executive from working at a new healthcare venture launched by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
The decision by U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf in Boston came in a lawsuit closely watched in the industry for clues about the future plans of the venture, which was announced in January 2018 with a goal of lowering healthcare costs.
UnitedHealth's Optum unit had sought a court order blocking David Smith from working at the venture, saying he could share trade secrets that would give it a competitive advantage.
But Wolf declined to issue a temporary restraining order preventing Smith from working there pending the outcome of an arbitration, saying Optum had not established Smith was likely violating an agreement to not work for a competitor.
He said the unnamed Boston-based venture, nicknamed ""ABC,"" does not offer products that compete with Optum, and said while it might do so someday, the startup could become a potential Optum customer instead of its rival.
""Any prediction about the future now would be speculative,"" he said.
Wolf said Optum had also failed to show Smith has disclosed any of its confidential information since joining ABC, an allegation Smith denied.
Optum, which provides pharmacy benefit management and other services, said in a statement it would ""aggressively"" pursue its claims against Smith in arbitration.
Smith's lawyer and ABC declined to comment. 
In January, Optum sued Smith, its former vice president of product and corporate strategy, alleging he violated an agreement to not work at a competitor for a year in exchange for stock and options.
Optum claimed Smith, now a director of strategy and research at ABC, misappropriated trade secrets that would give the venture an unfair advantage.
Testifying in court last month, Smith argued ABC was not a competitor but is focused on serving its three founding companies' 1.2 million employees.
Jack Stoddard, ABC's chief operating officer, testified that ABC is examining whether it can ""reinvent what insurance looks like in terms of benefit design.""
Stoddard said ABC had not ruled out developing products. But he said its ""preferred path"" was to partner with companies like Optum to provide services and had no plans to directly compete with Optum in 2019.

The case is Optum Inc v. Smith, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 19-cv-10101.

Volkswagen suffered from an increase in inventories at its Audi and VW brands after a new emissions testing procedure, known as WLTP, took effect in September and delayed road certification for many of its vehicles. 
""The headwinds in key markets are expected to strengthen further in 2019,"" Chief Executive Herbert Diess said in a statement accompanying the earnings.
""Overall, however, we will have to redouble our efforts to meet our ambitious targets in the new fiscal year.”
Volkswagen reiterated it wanted to achieve an operating return on sales of between 6.5 and 7.5 percent for the passenger cars division and the group this year, a step welcomed by analysts.
""The results are pretty solid, and it's positive that they stick to their margin forecast especially when contrasted with rivals like Daimler which was more cautious,"" Nord LB analyst Frank Schwope, who has a buy rating on the stock, said.
VW is proposing a dividend of 4.80 euros a share for ordinary stock and 4.86 euros for each preferred share. 
Vehicle deliveries are expected to rise slightly in 2019, and group revenues are seen up to 5 percent higher, Volkswagen said.
Volkswagen's 2018 operating profit came in at 13.92 billion euros ($15.79 billion), only 0.7 percent higher than the prior year and below 14.53 billion euros forecast in a poll.
VW said it expected positive net cashflow for 2019 thanks to lower penalties and compensation payments related to the company's 2015 diesel-cheating scandal. Last year cash flows from the automotive division rose 59 percent, VW said.

Volkswagen is due to release more detailed full-year earnings on March 12.

685,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2019 10:46AM ET</span>","EU drafting retaliatory tariff list hitting Caterpillar, Xerox, Samsonite: Bloomberg","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The European Union has drafted a list of retaliatory tariffs that would target  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT),  Xerox Corp  (NYSE:XRX) and Samsonite International if U.S. President Donald Trump imposes duties on European cars, Bloomberg News reported on Friday, citing an unnamed senior EU official.
Trump, who is known to have a strong protectionist bent on trade, has said the United States will impose tariffs on European car imports if it is unable to reach a trade deal with the European Union.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said in July that Trump promised he would hold off for the time being while the two sides sought to improve trade relations, such as with a deal to cut tariffs on ""non-auto industrial goods"".
A confidential report by the U.S. Commerce Department sent to Trump last weekend was expected to pave the way for the U.S. president to impose duties of up to 25 percent on imported autos and auto parts by designating them as a threat to U.S. national security.
The European Commission, which coordinates trade policy for the 28-member EU, has said it is preparing a list of U.S. products to target with tariffs should Trump decide EU car imports need to be restricted.
The Commission told national ministers at a meeting about trade in Bucharest that its list was ready, EU diplomats said, although it did not disclose what was in it.
It would go after 20 billion euros ($22.7 billion) worth of U.S. imports, although the list would take the form of categories of products, rather than specific companies.
EU car and car parts exports to the United States are worth around 50 billion euros per year, with the bulk of them coming from Germany.
The EU has already imposed its own import tariffs on 2.8 billion euros worth of U.S. products ranging from bourbon to motor-bikes as a response to U.S. punitive duties on EU steel and aluminium imports, which had been worth 6.4 billion euros.
""Should there be tariffs on cars and car parts, we don't know, but if it happens we have started internally to prepare a list of rebalancing measures,"" EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told a news conference in Bucharest.
""There is full support to do this. Of course if it happens we would immediately publish that list for formal consultation,"" she continuing, adding that U.S. car tariffs would also lead to the end of planned trade negotiations with Washington.
Xerox, Caterpillar and Samsonite did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

686,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 22, 2019 10:11AM ET</span>",Warren Says Wells Fargo Must Fire CEO Before Fed Ends Growth Cap,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren renewed her call for the ousting of  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan, saying the Federal Reserve shouldn’t lift an order restricting the bank’s growth until he’s gone.
A recent report of misconduct in the bank’s wholesale division, which Sloan ran prior to taking the top job, demonstrates that he isn’t the right person to run Wells Fargo, the Democratic presidential candidate said Friday in a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. A 2015 anti-money-laundering consent order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, followed by the alleged altering of documents to satisfy the order, show Sloan’s direct ties to bad behavior, Warren said.
“Wells Fargo is fundamentally broken, and there is no evidence whatsoever that these problems can be fixed under Mr. Sloan’s watch,” the Massachusetts senator wrote. “The Federal Reserve should take no action to remove the growth cap until Wells Fargo replaces Mr. Sloan as CEO.”
The San Francisco-based lender has credited Sloan for leading an overhaul of the bank over the past two years, rooting out and fixing past problems, addressing regulators’ concerns, tightening internal oversight, streamlining structure and taking other steps to improve earnings. The most recent word from the bank’s chair, Betsy Duke, is that the board stands behind Sloan.
Warren has repeatedly criticized Wells Fargo amid customer-abuse revelations that erupted more than two years ago with a phony-accounts scandal. Last year, the Fed imposed an unprecedented sanction on the bank, forbidding it from boosting total assets beyond their end-of-2017 level. Following a letter from Warren, Powell later agreed that the ban would stay in place until the full Fed board determined the bank has made enough progress in fixing its missteps.
Sloan told investors last month the bank plans to operate under the asset cap through the end of 2019, longer than previously forecast.

(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) pulled all its advertising from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube for the second time in two years after a magazine reported the platform displayed ads next to videos that showed the exploitation of children. 
""Until Google can protect our brand from offensive content of any kind, we are removing all advertising from YouTube,"" an AT&T spokesman said in a statement on Thursday. 
The move comes just one month after the U.S. wireless carrier announced it would resume buying advertising on YouTube, after a nearly two-year boycott of the platform. The previous boycott was also due to concerns that its ads could run on videos featuring hate speech or other disturbing material.
The report by Wired magazine that commercials had run alongside offensive videos and comments also prompted food and beverage maker Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) to pause advertising on YouTube earlier this week.
YouTube said it had removed some of the content, which violated its policies against child endangerment, nudity and other behavior it considers inappropriate. YouTube added that it disabled comments on tens of millions of videos that include minors.
""There's more to be done, and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly,"" YouTube said in a statement.
YouTube derives most of its revenue from advertising, and it has been one of Google's fastest-growing units as consumers spend an increasing amount of time watching videos online. 

Google does not specify its revenue from YouTube. Advertising research firm EMarketer estimates YouTube will net $11.4 billion in worldwide revenue in 2019 after accounting for revenue shared with content producers.

The tepid numbers and the change of guard come against the backdrop of a likely drop in sales of new vehicles in the United States this year, as higher interest rates and rising prices may prompt customers to delay their buying plans.
Auto sales in 2018 had benefited from President Donald Trump's overhaul of the U.S. tax laws that put more money in the hands of customers.
AutoNation's net income from continuing operations fell to $92.9 million, or $1.02 per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $151.5 million, or $1.64 per share, a year earlier, when it had a $41 million benefit related to the U.S. tax reform.
Analysts on average expected the company to earn $1.14 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue fell to $5.41 billion from $5.68 billion, largely missing analysts' estimate of $5.63 billion.
The company said new vehicle sales declined 8.3 percent to $3.07 billion, while revenue from used vehicles marginally rose to $1.21 billion.
AutoNation said Carl Liebert will succeed longtime Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson, effective March 11.
Liebert is currently the chief operating officer at financial services company USAA.

The company's shares fell 2.29 percent to $37.5 in trading before the bell.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday, the White House said.

In December a trial of executives at supermarket  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) collapsed, while the agency failed in October to win an appeal against a court ruling that threw out criminal charges against  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc over alleged wrongdoing in 2008. 
The investigation into Rolls-Royce began in December 2013 and did result in a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA)in early 2017 with the company and one of its units in respect of bribery to win business in Indonesia, Thailand, India, Russia, Nigeria, China and Malaysia. 
Rolls-Royce agreed to pay 497 million pounds ($646.65 million) as part of the DPA, clearing the company but allowing for continued investigation and potential prosecution of individuals.
""It is extraordinary the SFO are unable to charge any individual suspects in relation to Rolls Royce given the scale of the allegations in the DPA,"" said Sarah Wallace, a partner at law firm Irwin Mitchell

696,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 22, 2019 06:35AM ET</span>",Bond Volatility Is Eerily Quiet. But Is It Too Quiet?,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Traders in the world’s biggest bond market likely wished for some peace and quiet after the final weeks of 2018. From early November to the start of January, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields tumbled 70 basis points as investors flocked to havens amid a vicious stock market rout.
Now, almost two months later, they’re left to wonder if the $15.6 trillion market has become too quiet. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).’s MOVE Index, which dates back to 1988 and tracks price swings on U.S. Treasury options, came within spitting distance of a record low this week. The index value touched 44.5 on Wednesday, close to the all-time low of 44 in November 2017 and another near-record of 44.3 in October 2018.
Looking at what happened in the months after those lows, it’s easy to see why traders might be skittish. In the first instance, volatility soared as the Trump administration’s tax plan boosted the economic outlook, pushing Treasury yields higher and leading market prognosticators to declare a bear market had arrived. Within days of the second low, stocks began a slide so severe that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called a meeting of top financial regulators to discuss markets.
The difference this time around, of course, is that the Federal Reserve is no longer intent on tightening monetary policy. Chairman Jerome Powell’s pivot around the turn of the year has left Treasuries largely range-bound and trendless. As a result, the only money-making move seems to be selling volatility. Bloomberg News’s Edward Bolingbroke noted that “demand continues to emerge” for selling structures known as strangles, in which a trader sells out-of-the-money call and put options on Treasury futures. They net a small premium up front but face theoretically unlimited losses if prices swing widely. So far, that hasn’t been the case. In fact, the 10-year Treasury yield closed on Thursday within a 10th of a basis point of its 2019 average.
Predictably, the prospect of big losses unnerves some traders. The geopolitical risks that captivate the market daily, from Brexit to U.S.-China trade talks, don’t appear to be going away soon, nor does the fretting over global growth and the prospect of a recession. Mix in the political gridlock in Washington and there are no shortage of reasons to bet that something has to give.
As always, the hard part is nailing down the timing. It reminds me of when Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital’s chief investment officer, cautioned in August that a record short position among hedge funds and other large speculators in 10-year Treasury futures “could cause quite a squeeze.” That didn’t immediately come to pass — the benchmark yield rose from 2.86 percent on the day of his tweet to as high as 3.26 percent on Oct. 9. But soon after that peak, as the market reversed, those speculators unwound positions, sometimes in a hurry.
Mark Kiesel, chief investment officer of global credit at Pacific Investment Management Co., is among those suggesting the time to de-risk is now, for the aforementioned reasons. “Markets are set for more volatility ahead,” he said Thursday in a Bloomberg TV interview. “The market has priced in a lot of good news,” he added, suggesting that investors consider “tilting the portfolio toward high-quality Treasuries” and other lower-risk assets.
I certainly don’t pretend to be any better at market timing, but it feels a bit early to expect the end of the Treasury market’s listless trading, whether based on pure technical analysis or gut feeling. Few seem to want to test the established ranges, instead turning to more esoteric bets like a narrowing Libor/OIS spread. Bloomberg’s Bolingbroke posited that such trades “may become the only game in town if the odds of Fed action stay mired around zero.”
At some point, something will break the Treasury market’s peace. But it could take a while."

The luxury car firms said they would invest more than 1 billion euros ($1.13 billion) to expand the joint venture, shifting beyond manufacturing and car sales toward pay-per-minute or pay-per-mile systems.
Consultancy PwC has said carmakers face marginalization by cash-rich technology firms unless they develop services based on vehicle usage.
Established ride-hailing firms have been expanding. China's Didi Chuxing aims to build its business in Latin America and Uber is gaining a stranglehold on its U.S. market.

The venture has five strands: REACH NOW, a smartphone-based route management and booking service, CHARGE NOW for electric car charging, FREE NOW for taxi ride-hailing, PARK NOW for parking services and SHARE NOW for car-sharing.
""These five services will merge ever more closely to form a single mobility service portfolio with an all-electric, self-driving fleet of vehicles that charge and park autonomously,"" said BMW Chief Executive Harald Krueger.

BMW and Daimler are working to develop autonomous cars, vehicles which could enable them to up-end the market for taxi and ride-hailing services.

NEW YORK - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) is tearing down walls and moving its San Francisco investment bankers onto ""hot desks,"" a space-saving layout that has long been a fixture at tech companies, while redesigning offices in Dallas and other cities.
Shared workspaces have been relatively slow to catch on at banks, but JPMorgan is following recent renovations by some rivals, which designers tout as cost cutting and productivity boosting. Still, bankers who covet the status and privacy of personal offices are in for big changes. 
When JPMorgan renovated two floors at its Mission Street office in San Francisco last month, it replaced many offices with diner-style booths, designated quiet zones and communal tables for the roughly 250 investment bankers and other employees there.
Noah Wintroub, a San Francisco-based vice chairman of investment banking at JPMorgan who focuses on tech and media companies, said he lobbied for the open-desk layout, though it may be a culture shock for some. 
""We have historically been very hierarchical. When you become a managing director you have this kind of office,"" Wintroub said. 
The bank already set up hot desking for investment bankers in Hong Kong, said David Arena, JPMorgan's head of global corporate real estate. It was able to cut costs by putting more people on fewer floors. 
Arena did not say if U.S. renovations will help JPMorgan shrink its real estate footprint. He noted limits to the approach, saying it is ""counter-productive if too many people are squeezed into one space.""
JPMorgan is also redesigning offices in Phoenix and Columbus, Ohio. It did not say if there were any plans to include hot desks at the bank's New York main office, which is currently under construction.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) tore down walls in its New York asset management office in 2017, and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), is redesigning its midtown Manhattan headquarters to move brokers, traders and tech employees closer together, according to media reports. 
Multiple users sharing one workstation has been common at tech and consulting companies for more than a decade, and a 2015 study by industry group the International Facility Management Association found a majority of businesses now use hot desking for at least some staff.
But the layout was slower to take hold in banking, where a cultural resistance stems in part from the need to take confidential calls in private, according to the report. 
Offices were also status symbols, and sitting at a communal table instead of one's own glass office is a big shift for investment bankers.

Some will still have offices, including Wintroub, though he said he prefers to sit with others in the open area and use his office as a conference room.

700,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>",Buyout firms abandon debt-laden ways for pricey deals,"By Carl O'Donnell and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Some private equity firms that are keen to put their swelling cash piles to work are paying for expensive acquisitions of fast-growing companies mostly out of their own pockets and trimming back their reliance on debt. 
U.S. human resources applications provider Ultimate Software Group Inc, U.S. mortgage software vendor Ellie Mae Inc and German online listings company Scout24 AG are among the companies that private equity firms agreed to buy this month using mostly cash from their own investment funds, known as equity, and relatively little debt, people familiar with the transactions said. 
The deals show how private equity firms are expanding beyond the traditional leveraged buyout (LBO) model, which has driven most of their deals for the past 40 years, as they look to deploy the record $1.2 trillion they have raised from their investors. 
In a typical LBO, private equity firms juice up returns by loading up their acquisitions with debt, which is often provided by banks. But in sectors like technology, company valuations are becoming so lofty that banks will no longer finance the majority of some deals.
Without such financial engineering, the buyout firms are relying on the acquired companies' projected high rates of growth to drive healthy returns. 
""You can finance an acquisition with a lot of equity, but you will only make a big profit if your company posts strong growth and its valuation gets a boost,"" said Oliver Gottschalg, founder and head of research at private equity analytics firm PERACS and a professor of strategy and business policy of HEC Paris. 
Private equity firms Hellman & Friedman LLC and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP are paying for their $11 billion acquisition of Ultimate Software with a 70 percent equity contribution. The buyout firms also paid for their 5.7 billion euros ($6.4 billion) purchase of Scout24 with mostly equity, sources said. 
(Graphic: Private equity bulks up on software deals - https://tmsnrt.rs/2UVbTrR)
Private equity firm Thoma Bravo LLC has agreed to acquire Ellie Mae for $3.7 billion with a roughly 60 percent equity contribution.
By comparison, the average equity contribution for North American private equity deals did not exceed 50 percent in 2017, according to the most recent analysis on the subject published by investment management firm Hamilton Lane Inc. For Western Europe, it was 51 percent, according to the analysis.
As a result, Wall Street bankers have been referring to the Ultimate Software, Ellie Mae and Scout 24 deals as equity buyouts, to distinguish them from the traditional leveraged buyouts.
Equity buyouts still account for only a small fraction of private equity dealmaking. And such deals already do pop up sporadically, but at a smaller scale, including in the energy industry, where private equity firms write checks to back oil and gas executives building exploration and production companies.
What distinguishes this month's deals is that they are larger than most private equity deals that have relied on equity funding. 
Given that private equity deals usually take a few years to show returns, some major investors in buyout funds, also known as limited partners, say they are willing to be patient to see how the new strategy plays out.
""The folks who are paying those valuation multiples and writing these larger equity checks are well established and have a following of limited partners that trust them to do the right thing and still get good returns,"" said Robert Hetu, head of U.S. private debt at Canadian public pension fund Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, one of the world's largest investors in private equity funds.
ACHIEVING RETURNS
The technology sector is emerging as a locus of expensive private equity deals. 
The strong growth prospects of these companies make them coveted but expensive acquisition targets. For example, Ultimate Software clinched a sale price equivalent to around 36 times its 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), more than double the software sector's average.
Ultimate Software's revenue has grown more than 55 percent in the past two years, according to its latest annual report. Blackstone and Hellman & Friedman expect that the company's rapid growth rate will allow them to hit an industry-standard performance target of a 15 to 20 percent internal rate of return, a person familiar with the strategy said.
Representatives for Hellman & Friedman did not respond to requests for comment. Blackstone and Thoma Bravo declined to comment. 
Software companies such as Ultimate Software also hold the promise of a lucrative sale to a technology company, said Steven Koenig, an equity analyst at Wedbush Securities. Any number of large players in the enterprise cloud industry, from  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp, to  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL), to  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), could be good fits for Ultimate Software down the line, Koenig said.
In the near term, one way private equity buyers could amp up returns would be to add debt to fund a dividend when the acquired company manages to boost its cash flow. This could require finding banks that are comfortable financing higher-than-average debt loads. 
In the case of Ultimate Software,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG and Nomura Holdings Inc stepped up to provide the equivalent of 11 times its EBITDA, something that many of their investment banking rivals deemed too risky, people familiar with the matter said. 
Leveraged buyouts in the technology sector averaged 7.5 times EBITDA in 2018, according to financial data provider Refinitiv. 

""Ultimately, it is the private equity firm's own investors who will be the arbiters of whether the increased valuation multiples are a good or bad thing for the industry,"" said Scott Phillips, chairman of financial sponsor coverage at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) Group.

HANOI (Reuters) - Fast-growing Vietnamese budget airline VietJet Aviation JSC is expected to sign a major jet deal with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co on the sidelines of next week's Trump-Kim summit, according to sources familiar with the matter. 
U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will hold their second summit in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi on Feb 27-28.
Holding a signing ceremony during Trump's visit would help emphasize strengthening economic and military ties between the United States and Vietnam.
VietJet, while not government-owned, increasingly uses state visits to showcase major plane orders balanced between Boeing and Airbus SE. It signed a deal to buy 100 Boeing 737 MAX narrowbody jets when former U.S. President Barack Obama visited Hanoi in 2016.
The airline is likely to finalize next week a separate provisional deal agreed last year at the Farnborough Airshow to buy another 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets worth almost $13 billion at list prices, sources said on condition of anonymity due to an expected announcement by VietJet.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration declared last week that Vietnam complied with international aviation standards, in a move that would allow Vietnamese carriers to fly there for the first time and codeshare with U.S. airlines. 
VietJet said last week it planned to purchase widebody jets capable of U.S. flights to open routes to cities with large Vietnamese communities in the United States, such as in California. 
It might be too early for VietJet to place a widebody order, said one of the sources.
Another source briefed on the matter said the deal for 100 737 MAX jets was already on Boeing's books, having been firmed up earlier and listed as an unidentified customer. 
Boeing declined to comment. VietJet did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
VietJet finalised a deal in November with Airbus for 50 A321neo jets during a visit to Hanoi by French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe that had also been announced provisionally at the Farnborough Airshow.
VietJet operates 385 flights daily within Vietnam and to places such as Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, China, Thailand, Myanmar and Malaysia. 

However, industry analysts have questioned whether the airline will take delivery of all the aircraft on order as the aerospace industry reaches the peak of an extended growth phase.

703,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2019 05:36AM ET</span>","Kraft Heinz discloses SEC probe, $15 billion write-down; shares dive 20 percent","By Uday Sampath Kumar and Nivedita Bhattacharjee
(Reuters) - Shares of Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC) slumped 20 percent late on Thursday after the food company posted a quarterly loss, disclosed an SEC investigation and wrote down the value of its iconic Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands as it highlighted the tough environment for the packaged food industry.
The gloomy results and forecast from the company, which is one of billionaire Warren Buffett's largest investments, reflect changes in consumer trends away from processed foods to healthier alternatives.
The after-hours slump erased $12 billion from Kraft Heinz's stock market value and left its shares trading at their lowest point since H.J. Heinz Co bought Kraft Foods Group Inc (NASDAQ:KHC) in 2015, to create the world's fifth largest food and beverage company.
""Kraft Heinz results confirmed all our worst fears – plus more,"" Guggenheim Partners' analyst Laurent Grandet said in a note.
The $15.4 billion write-down indicates declining fortunes of the iconic brands and other losses in asset value, meaning the company views those assets as less valuable than before the merger.
""We expect to take a step backwards in 2019,"" Chief Financial Officer David Knopf told analysts on a post earnings conference call, promising ""consistent profit growth"" starting in 2020.
Kraft, which owns Velveeta cheese and Heinz ketchup brands, forecast adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) between $6.3 billion and $6.5 billion in 2019, lower than analysts' estimates of $7.47 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
On a post-earnings call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Bernardo Hees said the entire packaged foods industry will likely remain challenged, blaming the rising popularity of private label brands and higher commodity costs.
""Kraft Heinz is in a worse position than many other consumer packaged goods companies because it has got a very weak portfolio of brands. They are not delivering the level of growth that's needed in this sort of market,"" GlobalData Retail managing director Neil Saunders said.
The company, which competes with  General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS) and Kellogg Co, cut its quarterly dividend to 40 cents per share from around 63 cents per share on Thursday.
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc and Brazil's 3G Capital control Chicago-based Kraft Heinz.
In addition to lower-than-expected earnings, the company disclosed it had been subpoenaed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in October, related to an investigation into its accounting policies, procedures and internal controls related to procurement.
The company said it was working on ways to improve its internal controls and determined the problems required it to record a $25 million increase to the cost of products sold.
""That has really made a bad set of results even worse because it has also thrown some uncertainty into the mix,"" Saunders said.
For the quarter ended Dec. 29, Kraft had a net loss of $12.6 billion. It earned 84 cents per share on an adjusted basis, missing Wall Street estimates of 94 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Net sales of $6.89 billion fell short of analysts' estimates of $6.94 billion in the reported quarter.

704,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 22, 2019 05:15AM ET</span>","MarketPulse Europe: Stocks Higher as Trade, Brexit Hopes Brighten the Gloom","By Geoffrey Smith
Europe’s stock markets are set to end the week near their highest level since October, supported by hopes for a truce in the U.S.-China trade war and a Brexit outcome that avoids the worst-case scenario of the U.K. leaving the EU without a transitional deal.
At 05.00 AM ET (1000 GMT), the benchmark STOXX 600 index was up 0.56 points, or 0.2%, at 370.98, while Germany’s Dax and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 were both up around a quarter of a percent.
The best performers are the beaten-up bank stocks, led by  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) after a report saying it’s preparing big job cuts at its investment bank. Trade-sensitive auto and mining stocks are also up, albeit without any major standouts.
Earlier, the Ifo research institute completed this week’s round of generally grim business surveys, saying its closely-watched business climate index fell to its lowest since December 2014, while the forward-looking expectations sub-index fell to a level it last saw in 2012, when European Central Bank President Mario Draghi had to promise ‘whatever it takes’ to save the euro.
Elsewhere, the German statistics office Destatis confirmed initial estimates that the euro zone’s largest economy stagnated at the end of the year, but at least avoided slipping into a ‘technical recession’ – defined as two successive quarterly declines in GDP – that would have soured the mood.
Realistically, there is no way Europe is in as bad shape now as it was back in 2012. Its banks are much healthier and the auto sector has raked in years of record profits, even if both sectors still face daunting challenges from new technology. The ECB will at least talk about new stimulus measures when it meets on March 7, according to its chief economist Peter Praet, and there have even been tentative signs that Germany is ready to relax its fiscal policy to support growth (although the coalition partners will argue for a long time first over how best to do it).
Sure, the risks of Brexit, Italian public debt, U.S. import tariffs and the side-effects from the U.S.-China trade war are large, but none is certain to materialize. The big question, for the short term at least, is whether the trade talks in Washington can continue to justify the increasing sense of optimism that a devastating new round of import tariffs will be avoided."

The bipartisan senate committee that conducted the inquiry said pay-day lenders and 'buy now, pay later' companies, which offer immediate credit with little or no checks, should abide by the same strict laws that force banks to lend responsibly.
""The 'buy now, pay later' sector is one of Australia's fintech growth stories. This growth has largely outstripped the regulatory response,"" the report said. 
""The committee considers that this regulatory gap should be filled,"" it added. 
Other recommendations include introducing licensing requirements for the industry, prohibiting upfront fees for services, and closing loopholes that allow providers of payday loans and consumer leases to be exempted from the National Consumer Credit Protection Act.
""The committee recommends that the government implement a regulatory framework for all credit and debt management, repair and negotiation activities that are not currently licensed by the Australian Financial Security Authority,"" the report said.
The report's public release came a day after the corporate regulator said it was investigating share trading in Australia's biggest 'buy now, pay later' company Afterpay Touch Group that occurred following the confidential release of the report to lawmakers earlier this week.

Last October, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) watchdog had already given Iran until February to complete reforms that would bring it in line with global norms, or face consequences.
The FATF concluded this week at a meeting that ""there are still items not completed"" and said in a statement it ""expects Iran to proceed swiftly in the reform path"".
""If by June 2019, Iran does not enact the remaining legislation in line with FATF Standards, then the FATF will require increased supervisory examination for branches and subsidiaries of financial institutions based in Iran,"" it said. 
Foreign businesses say compliance and Iran's removal from the FATF's blacklist is key for making investments in the country, especially after the United States re-imposed sanctions on Iran.
France, Britain and Germany have tied this compliance angle with the use of a new channel for non-dollar trade with Iran to avert U.S. sanctions.
Those countries have said they expected Iran would swiftly put into place all elements of its FATF action plan.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Canada's Barrick Gold Corp is considering a hostile bid for  Newmont Mining  Corp (NYSE:NEM) for about $19 billion in stock, in what would potentially be one of the largest-ever mining deals, the country's Globe and Mail newspaper reported.
The paper, which also reported that Barrick would flip some of Newmont's assets to Australia's Newcrest Mining, cited industry sources familiar with the situation.
Under the potential terms, Barrick would keep Newmont's Nevada and African mines, while Newcrest was considering taking over its Australian operations, according to the report.
Barrick, which spent $6.1 billion on buying rival  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) last month, has formed new management teams and cut administrative costs as part of new Chief Executive Mark Bristow's plan to set the combined company firmly apart from peers.
Bristow had said on a post-earnings call that Barrick Gold would continue to look at opportunities for mergers or acquisitions.
Barrick and U.S. company Newmont have long been touted as a potential match, as they have plenty of overlap around their North American operations, said an Australia-based banker.
""(But) there's a danger that Barrick is biting off more than it can chew (by making another large acquisition),"" he said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.
Without such a deal, Barrick could cede its crown as the world's largest gold producer to Newmont, which is due to close its $10 billion buyout of smaller rival Goldcorp Inc next quarter.
If Barrick were to be successful, the merger between Newmont and Goldcorp would not go ahead, and Barrick would be liable for a $650 million break fee, the newspaper reported. 
Bloomberg reported on Thursday that Barrick had studied a bid for Newmont as it looks for ways to boost production, citing people familiar with the matter.
Newmont declined a request from Reuters for comment, while Barrick did not immediately respond to request for comment.
A Newcrest spokesperson said the firm did not comment on M&A speculation. Goldcorp was not immediately available for comment.
AUSTRALIAN FIT?
Newmont has three gold mines in Australia, which have a net present value of $4.5 billion according to AME Group, but none of those are seen as the kind of large 'tier one' developments that Newcrest has said are a prerequisite for any major buys.
""Newcrest has a production hole in a couple of years' time with Cadia going offline,"" said one fund source based in Melbourne, referring to one of Australia's largest gold mines.
""It makes sense that they would be looking, but I would question the 'tier one' nature of the asset."" 
Any deal for the assets would hinge on price and the manner of payment, two other bankers and a fund manager said.
""I wouldn't care if they are not 'tier one' assets,"" said Simon Mawhinney of Allan Gray in Melbourne, which is the top shareholder in Newcrest with a stake of around 9 percent.

""But I would care if they were overpaid for, that would be a big issue.""

 Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA is drawing up plans to cut jobs at its investment bank and find a partner for its cash-equity business, in a bid to offset increasing cost pressure from regulation, people familiar with the matter said.
The bank could cut hundreds or even thousands of jobs at its global banking and investor solutions unit, including roles in support functions such as finance and human resources, one person familiar with the situation said, declining to be identified because the matter is confidential. Management are still weighing up which parts of the business would bear the reductions, they added.
Societe Generale declined to comment.
SocGen’s GBIS unit has more than 20,000 employees. One of SocGen’s main French labor unions said Feb. 8 that the bank is bracing for “important” cuts to trading jobs. Chief Executive Officer Frederic Oudea has said it’s too soon to comment on any headcount decisions.
The Paris-based group is seeking to cut 500 million euros ($567 million) of costs and review less profitable investment-banking activities after a grueling fourth quarter. The organisation said earlier this month that the reductions would focus on some fixed-income and currencies activities.
The bank has so far resisted the trend in France to hive off cash equity and research. However, it is now considering options to set up a joint venture, the person said.
Finding a partner for the stock brokerage business may take weeks or months, and keeping it within the group would be the default solution, the person said.
Several new ventures in equity brokerage could serve as a blueprint. Kepler Cheuvreux SA has partnerships with European banks including  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA to secure distribution of its research. Franco-German banking group Oddo BHF struck a deal with Natixis SA in 2017, which left French equity brokerage and research activities with the former, while the latter took on capital markets.
The reshuffles came as the European Union’s MiFID II directive forces brokerages to charge clients separately for research and trading, leaving smaller players under pressure to consolidate."

Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 gained 0.4%. Shares of Australia's coal miners were under pressure after a Reuters report that China was banning the import of Australian coal in the northern port of Dalian.
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 and South Korea’s KOSPI both traded 0.3% lower.
Sino-U.S. trade talks remained in focus on Friday after Reuters reported on Thursday that Washington and Beijing have begun drawing up memorandums of understanding over trade.
The two sides are trying to reach a trade deal before a March 1 deadline, when additional tariffs on Chinese imports to the U.S. will go into effect.
On Friday, Reuters said U.S. and Chinese officials have struggled this week to overcome differences on specific language on issues related to structural changes in China’s economy, Reuters reported citing sources familiar with the talks.
The issues include an enforcement mechanism to ensure that China complies with any agreements, the report said.
""It's not surprising that this week has been more challenging,"" said an industry source familiar with the talks that were cited by Reuters. ""Once you move from putting together outlines to filling out the details, that is where things would naturally become more challenging.""
Bloomberg added earlier in the day that China is considering buying an additional $30 billion a year of U.S. products including soybeans, corn and wheat as part of the agreement that is currently being discussed by U.S. and Chinese officials.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia sought to calm investors on Friday about the state of bilateral ties with China following a ban on coal imports at the northern port of Dalian, as coal stocks fell and the local dollar remained under pressure.
The Australian currency dropped more than 1 percent to a 10-day low of $0.7070 on Thursday after Reuters reported that customs at the Chinese port had banned imports of Australia's biggest export earner since the start of February.
China is the largest buyer of Australian coal, taking 89 million tonnes last year, worth A$15 billion ($10.7 billion), according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
Ties between the two countries were strained in 2017 when Canberra accused Beijing of meddling in its domestic affairs, and the relationship suffered another setback last year when Australia banned China's Huawei from its 5G broadband network.
Australia has asked its ambassador to China, Jan Adams, to seek urgent clarification, the government said, while lawmakers and the central bank said the port move may not be related to bilateral ties.
""I wouldn't jump yet to the conclusion that this is something directed to Australia,"" Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe told a parliamentary economics committee.
""It may well turn out to be that it's being driven by concerns about the environment in China and the profitability of the coking coal industry in China,"" he said in response to lawmakers' questions.
Shares in Australian coal miners, however, fell at the open on Friday amid broad weakness in the resources sector.
Stanmore Coal fell more than 7 percent at one point as it said was monitoring the situation to determine whether there would be any impact on its coal sales.
New Hope Corp fell more than 4 percent, while shares in Whitehaven were down more than 4 percent and Yancoal more than 3 percent even though both miners said they were not impacted directly. 
Major coal producer  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) ended down 3.2 percent in London overnight, but BHP Group, Australia's biggest metcoal producer, was down just 0.1 percent.
""When decisions like this have been made in the past at local port level, it was related to domestic supply related issues, environmental issues at a local level,"" Mathias Cormann, Minister for Finance told Sky News.
""It was unrelated with anything to do with the bilateral relationship between Australia and China.""

A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said on Thursday that customs were inspecting and testing coal imports for safety and quality, and the move was ""completely normal"".

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Thursday it has hired outside experts to investigate its vehicle fuel economy and testing procedures after employees raised concerns, and did not know whether it would have to correct data provided to regulators or consumers.
The issues involving Ford's testing processes do not involve the use of so-called defeat devices - hardware and software designed deliberately to deceive government emissions tests, Kimberly Pittel, Ford's group vice president for sustainability, environment and safety engineering, told Reuters.
The automaker since last fall has been investigating concerns raised by employees that incorrect calculations were used to translate test results into the mileage and emissions data submitted to regulators, Pittel said.
Ford said it was evaluating changes to the process it uses to develop fuel economy and emissions figures, ""including engineering, technical and governance components."" 
Ford shares dipped slightly in after-hours trading following the disclosure.
Ford has hired the law firm Sidley Austin to lead an independent investigation into possible discrepancies in calculations used to produce emissions and fuel economy figures, Pittel said. The company is using an independent laboratory to conduct testing.
U.S. and California regulators have been cracking down on automakers for emissions cheating following revelations in 2015 that German automaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG had used defeat devices to make models equipped with diesel engines appear to comply with emissions standards when they emitted far more pollution than allowed in real-world driving.
""We have voluntarily shared this information"" with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board, Pittel said. Ford notified the agencies this week, she said.
The EPA said in a statement on Thursday that information from Ford's investigation is ""too incomplete for EPA to reach any conclusions. We take the potential issues seriously and are following up with the company to fully understand the circumstances behind this disclosure.""
The investigation has started with testing of the 2019 Ranger pickup truck, and the company expects data back next week, Pittel said. 
She said it was not clear what impact the review will have on advertised mileage or fuel economy data submitted to regulators, nor is it clear how many vehicles could be affected if Ford is required to revise the data. 
""We cannot predict the outcome, and cannot provide assurance that it will not have a material adverse effect on us,"" Ford told investors in a regulatory filing Thursday.
""We are going to go where the investigation takes us,"" Pittel said.

Ford has been embarrassed in the past by errors in fuel economy claims. In 2013, the automaker cut by seven miles per gallon the claimed fuel economy for its C-Max hybrid model following complaints that real-world mileage did not match the claimed fuel economy. In 2014, Ford lowered fuel economy ratings for six other models and offered compensation to customers.

719,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 09:27PM ET</span>","Farm real estate prices holding up, but USDA worried about a fall","By Humeyra Pamuk and Julie Ingwersen
ARLINGTON, Va. (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture is concerned about a potential decline in farmland real estate prices, but has seen no sign of that happening so far, USDA chief economist Robert Johansson said on Thursday. 
Farmland prices are a key pillar of equity for the U.S. agricultural heartland, which has been suffering from lingering weakness in commodity prices and loss of key export markets such as China due to President Donald Trump's trade disputes.
A potential significant price-drop in farmland is something “we are concerned that may happen,” Johansson told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the USDA's annual forum. ""But land has been consistently able to withstand some of these pressures on farm income over the past five years for sure,"" he said.
A key constituency for Trump, U.S. farmers have borne the brunt of his bitter trade disputes. 
Exports to China have fallen more than 90 percent in the 2018-2019 crop year, according to USDA data, and China has dropped to the fifth biggest market for U.S. farm exports from being the top in 2017.
That has fueled an increase in farm bankruptcies, but not a corresponding drop in land prices so far.
""You still see high-quality farmland selling for higher prices ... Just like the farm bankruptcies, (the) farmland price story is similar: Some states have seen an increase, some see a decrease,"" Johansson said.    
While the federal government does not track large-scale farm bankruptcies, USDA does track a special category of bankruptcies for smaller to mid-sized farms - Chapter 12 filings.
According to federal data, Chapter 12 filings have hit the highest level in a decade in parts of the U.S. Midwest and Great Plains states, where commodity grains, oilseeds and livestock producers have been adversely affected by trade conflicts.
Still, the USDA said the number of these filings remained well below levels seen during the farm crisis of the 1980s, when thousands of farm operations financially collapsed after producers fell behind on high-interest land and equipment loans. This time, farmers’ debt-to-asset ratios have largely held up thanks to land prices withstanding the fall.
Farm incomes and agrarian credit conditions continued to erode in the second half of 2018 and for bankers, one key concern has been the amount of farmland that could come up for sale in the coming months and whether that could trigger an across-the-board fall for land prices.
Although farmland values remained stable - or improved slightly in some areas - increasing stress in the farm sector could put downward pressure on farm real estate values moving forward, according to bankers.
""What if land values fall? Sure that’s going to cause problems, but we just haven’t seen evidence of it,"" Johansson said.

Top U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators were haggling on Thursday over the details of a set of agreements aimed at ending their trade war.

720,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 07:24PM ET</span>",Cryptocurrency companies use 'backdoor' listings to ease into mainstream,"By Alun John and Anna Irrera
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Several cryptocurrency exchanges have moved closer to mainstream markets by buying listed companies, looking to raise funds and present themselves as embedded in the traditional financial services world they once spurned.
In the most recent deal, U.S. crypto broker-dealer Voyager Digital on Feb. 11 achieved a ""backdoor"" listing on Toronto's Venture Exchange after it bought control of mineral exploration firm UC Resources.
Such purchases, also known as reverse mergers, allow companies to offer shares to the public without the rigors and regulatory scrutiny of a full initial public offering (IPO).
""Many (cryptocurrency) exchanges have put a lot of strategic effort into trying to legitimize their operations and their reputations, and for some there's an assumption that having some exposure to the traditional public market will help,"" said Fei Ding'an, managing partner at Ledger Capital, a digital asset investment firm. 
Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) is the only major national regulator so far to have drawn up a definitive framework to govern digital assets and the platforms where they are traded.
In January, OKC Holdings, a company controlled by Star Xu, the founder of crypto-exchange OK Coin, bought 60.5 percent of LEAP Holdings, a Hong Kong-listed construction firm, for HK$484 million ($61.69 million).
Days later, the parent of Korean crypto exchange Bithumb announced plans for a U.S. listing via the purchase of Blockchain Industries.
Last year, investors that included the co-founders of crypto-exchange software producer ANX International bought a controlling stake in Hong Kong-listed marketing firm Branding China, while Huobi, a Singapore based exchange, bought a 72 percent stake in Hong Kong-listed power electrical company Pantronics Holdings.
Voyager said its listed shares could help fund growth. 
""Being a public company enables Voyager to operate with the transparency that the crypto market deserves from its institutions,"" Voyager CEO Steve Ehrlich said in an email.
Neither Huobi nor OKCoin has given details of their plans for the purchases.
ANX International remains separate from the renamed BC Group, but since the change in ownership the listed unit has launched new businesses that include a digital asset trading and exchange platform. 
A spokesman for BC Group said being publicly traded gave clients ""additional confidence in knowing we are a credible company and here for the long game."" 
Spokespeople for OKCoin and Huobi declined to comment.
Neither Bithumb nor its parent Blockchain Exchange Alliance responded to requests for comment. 
LEGITIMACY
Crypto experts said the deals could help the industry gain greater mainstream acceptance.
The reputation of cryptocurrencies, and particularly exchanges, has been hit hard by fears of price volatility and possible uses for laundering money alongside high-profile hacks and infrastructure failures.
Last year, the New York attorney general's office warned that several cryptocurrency exchanges were plagued by poor market surveillance and pervasive conflicts of interest, saying some may be operating illegally.
This month, $137 million in cryptocurrencies was frozen in the user accounts of Canadian digital platform Quadriga after the founder, the only person with the password to gain access, died unexpectedly. 
The crypto market peaked in late 2017, when trading volumes surged and bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, reached a high just above $20,000. Bitcoin's price has fallen more 80 percent since then, and trading volumes have slumped.
Some exchanges may also feel pressure from investors seeking a means of realizing their profits. 
""With the market turning south and regulators not being happy, this is an opportunity to satisfy investors and founders who are looking for an exit,"" said Zennon Kapron, director at financial technology consultancy Kapronasia. 
WRESTLING WITH REGULATORS 
Public listings of cryptocurrency exchanges also pose a challenge for regulators, who are only beginning to grapple with the issues of overseeing the trading of digital currencies.
Japan's FSA became the first major jurisdiction to regulate the exchanges in 2016, but has since refined its rules to allow the industry to largely self-regulate.
In the United States, New York state has, so far, issued a handful of so-called BitLicences for companies doing any sort of virtual currency business.
Both Hong Kong's market watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission, and the Hong Kong Exchange declined to comment.
But the commission is considering whether some cryptocurrency trading platforms are suitable for regulation, a process it hopes to finish this year, its chief executive, Ashley Alder, told legislators on Tuesday.
Hong Kong officials have already questioned the sustainability of crypto businesses when last year, the world's largest makers of cryptocurrency mining rigs did not follow through on IPO plans in Hong Kong, in part because of the questions officials raised.
""It's possible a crypto exchange could incubate a new crypto business inside a Hong Kong-listed company, maintain the listed company's existing operations, and not be treated as a new IPO, but it is a very difficult tightrope to walk,"" said a person familiar with the listing committee's processes, speaking anonymously because he was not authorized to speak to the media on the subject.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Listing Committee must be satisfied that a company's business is sustainable before it can list. The miners' bids were stymied by fears that the falling price of bitcoin made their business models unworkable, sources said. 
Although backdoor listings are permitted in most countries, some regulators, including those in Hong Kong, can review the deals and can in some circumstances require a full IPO instead.
""Crypto companies may struggle to demonstrate suitability for listing given the state of regulation of the industry and uncertain business models,"" said Jason Sung, a Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills.
Exchanges like Bithumb that are looking to the United States could also similar roadblocks. 
The SEC has authority both over U.S. companies selling digital securities and companies conducting a reverse merger in the United States. 

""Depending on what the companies are planning to do they very well might have to seek regulatory approval from the SEC or the CFTC,"" said Richard Levin, chairman of the financial technology and regulatory practice at the U.S. law firm Polsinelli.

721,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 07:05PM ET</span>",How Pemex 'destroyed' $1 billion with erratic business choices,"By Frank Jack Daniel and Stefanie Eschenbacher
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's state-oil company Pemex burned through $665 million at its fertilizer unit, ignored consultants and made high-risk investments with no discernible business strategy, according to a devastating government audit of its 2017 operations. 
The report, published late on Wednesday, offers insight into how Pemex ended up creaking under $106 billion of debt during the six-year term of former President Enrique Pena Nieto. 
Mexico's Federal Audit Office (ASF) used unusually frank language in its assessment of Pemex's use of public resources, particularly with regard to the company's fertilizer subsidiary and a failed power generation unit.
The fertilizer company suffered net losses of $665 million in 2017, and its assets were worth $1.1 billion less over the course of the year. 
""It destroyed value,"" read the assessment, the last of three reports by the audit office on the state of government finances in 2017.
Pemex did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to revive Pemex by clamping down on over-spending, rampant fuel-theft and corruption, but ratings agencies and investors are wary that expansive plans to revamp Mexico's refineries could further weigh on finances.
Fitch downgraded the company's credit rating to one notch above junk last month.
David Colmenares, who has headed the ASF since before last year's election, told Reuters the results showed Pemex needed to be ""re-engineered"" to revive its finances. 
""We believe that if we resolve many of these points, we will be able to recover (Pemex's) finances,"" he said.
He acknowledged corruption in the company, citing examples of contracts given to recently-created companies with no energy experience.
BAD BUSINESS
Many of the problems at Pemex Fertilizers, a subsidiary created under Pena Nieto's liberalization of the energy sector, stem from its purchase of two fertilizer plants in 2013 and 2016, the report said. 
Both plants had previously belonged to Pemex before being privatized in the 1990s by Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
The first plant, ProAgro, was not operational when Pemex bought it back for $475 million. Despite three attempts to revive it, the plant was still not up and running this year, the report said. The second plant, Fertinal, operated well below capacity, the report said.
Before the purchase, international auditors including PWC, warned Pemex's board of directors of the parlous state of the two plants, but the company went ahead and bought them anyway, the report said. 
Similarly, Pemex created a new power generation unit, called Pemex Cogeneration and Services, in 2015, without the board of directors being presented any evidence or studies to show it could be a profitable business, or seeing a business or operation strategy, the report said.
Without any infrastructure to generate electricity, the company lost $19 million in 2017. Pemex closed the unit the following year. 
Wilbur Matthews, founder of Texas-based Vaquero Global Investment, called Pemex's business decisions during the 2013-18 period ""completely incongruous.""
""The way that they were conducting business in the past six years did not make any sense at all,"" Matthews said. 
During Pena Nieto's term, Pemex took on an additional $47 billion in debt, citing the deterioration in finances and commitments to keep up investment levels at a time when the oil prices collapsed. 
Shamaila Khan, director of emerging market debt strategies at AllianceBernstein, which has $550 billion of assets under management and owns Pemex bonds, blamed the company's problems on the federal government charging it too much in taxes.
""The real issue is that the sovereign has taken a lot of money out of Pemex,"" she said.
Khan said the company's management had improved in the last years of Pena Nieto's government.

""The decision to do energy reform, to reduce the burden of expenditures for the company and to try and stabilize the company were actually good decisions from a management perspective.""

722,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 06:45PM ET</span>",GM CEO will not appear before Canada legislators on plant closure,"By Susan Taylor
TORONTO (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra will not come before Canadian legislators to answer questions about the automaker's future in the country, but lower-ranking executives will appear, a lawmaker said on Thursday.
GM said in November it would close its Oshawa, Ontario, assembly plant by year-end, part of a broad restructuring affecting four other plants in the United States, as it cuts costs and invests in electric and self-driving vehicles.
Last month, the Canadian Parliament's Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology approved Vice Chairman Brian Masse's request for Barra to ""explain GM's future and continued commitment to the Canadian automotive and manufacturing industry."" 
Barra's ""complex schedule wouldn't allow her to be there in a reasonable period of time,"" said GM spokesman David Paterson. He added that two ""subject matter experts"" - GM Canada President Travis Hester and Vice President of North American Manufacturing Gerald Johnson - would likely appear before the committee in March.
Masse, a member of the opposition New Democrats, said it was frustrating that Barra would not attend because she is the ""principal strategist"" behind GM's restructuring and could explain why Oshawa did not merit investment.
""We need to understand the future jobs and commitment of General Motors because we need to better understand how we fit in their global operations,"" Masse said.
Canada's auto union, which represents 2,600 assembly line workers in Oshawa and 1,800 workers at plants supplying the operation, has waged a high-profile campaign aimed at convincing GM to keep the plant open until September 2020, when the current collective agreement ends.
GM Canada has said repeatedly it will not change its business decision. 

An Ontario Labour Relations Board hearing on Thursday reviewed an application by GM to halt ""unlawful strike activity."" A decision was expected shortly.

(Reuters) - File sharing and storage company Dropbox Inc forecast a drop in current-quarter operating margins from a year earlier, sending its shares down nearly 11 percent in extended trading.
The weak margin outlook overshadowed a better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, and current quarter revenue forecast that came in above estimates.
""Margin guidance reflects conservatism,"" DA Davidson analyst Rishi Jaluria said.
Some investors might be picking on the net additions of 400,000 paying customers, which was above consensus but fewer than last year, Jaluria said. Dropbox added 580,000 paying customers in the year-ago quarter.
Shares of the San Francisco-based company, which rallied more than 25 percent so far this year, were down 10.5 percent at $22.90 in extended trading.
Dropbox forecast first quarter adjusted operating margins between 7 percent and 8 percent, compared to 10.9 percent last year.
The company, which competes with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) as well as Box Inc, forecast current-quarter revenue between $379 million and $382 million. Analysts were expecting $377 million.
Dropbox said it had 12.7 million subscribers as of Dec. 31, beating analysts' average estimate of 12.54 million, according to FactSet.
The company reported average revenue of $119.61 per user, beating estimates of $118.8, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Started as a free service to share and store photos, music and other large files, Dropbox now offers a range of enterprise software services and is betting on international expansion for user growth. 
Last month, the company said it would buy electronic signature company HelloSign for $230 million in cash, aiming to expand its portfolio of workflow-related products.
Quarterly loss narrowed to $9.5 million in Dropbox's fourth financial report as a publicly traded company, from $37.7 million a year earlier. The company is yet to turn a profit, which is common for startups that invest heavily in growth.
Excluding items, the company earned 10 cents per share, beating estimates of 8 cents.

Total revenue rose 23 percent to $375.9 million, above estimates of $370 million.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The top three U.S. carriers announced bids for new slots at Tokyo's Haneda International Airport on Thursday as part of a push to increase daily nonstop flights to the Japanese capital ahead of the 2020 Olympic Games and beyond.
The extra slots for U.S. airlines were unlocked after Japan reached an agreement with the U.S. Air Force to open up new flight paths around a nearby U.S. air base, a move needed to boost Haneda movements in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
Haneda is located closer to downtown Tokyo than the capital's other international airport Narita, and flies to more destinations throughout Japan, making it attractive for both business travelers and tourists.
United Continental Holdings Inc is bidding for six slots, Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) for five slots and American Airlines Group Inc for four. 
Thursday is the deadline for applications to the U.S. Department of Transportation.
Completion of an aviation agreement between the United States and Japan is expected later this year, United said. The new routes would launch for the 2020 summer flying schedule, once the U.S. Department of Transportation awards the slots.
United wants to fly to Haneda from its hubs at Newark Liberty, Chicago O'Hare, Washington Dulles, Los Angeles International, Houston George Bush and Guam. The flights from Newark, Los Angeles and Guam would be new routes operated by Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 and 787 aircraft, while the flights from the other three hubs would be shifted from Narita.
Under the proposal, United said it would connect to 37 destinations in Japan from Haneda with its joint venture partner All Nippon Airways (ANA).
Industry analysts say a recent sale of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to ANA may have weighed in the decision to grant more flying rights for U.S. airlines into Haneda, which airlines compete for aggressively due to the airport's proximity to the Japanese capital, a major center for global commerce.

Delta is proposing daily flights from Seattle, Detroit, Atlanta and Portland, Oregon, and twice-daily service between Haneda and Honolulu. American has requested a daily flight from Las Vegas and Los Angeles and twice-daily from its hub in Dallas.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Weak economic reports pressured U.S. stocks on Thursday after the market's recent run of gains, and a drop in healthcare shares added to the bearish momentum.
The Commerce Department said new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in December, pointing to a further slowdown in business spending on equipment that could crimp economic growth.
Separate data showed the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's gauge of U.S. Mid-Atlantic business activity declined in February to its weakest level since May 2016, while another report showed U.S. existing home sales dropped last month to the lowest level since November 2015. 
""We've had a tremendous run in the market, and we had weak data that allowed investors to take some profits,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.
Still, he said, ""I was a little surprised by some of the weakness in the data. Some of it is weather related and some trade related, so it's hard to get a good feel for how it would be,"" without those factors.
Recent gains in the market have been driven by hopes of progress in U.S.-China trade talks and dovish signals from the Federal Reserve. Despite the day's losses, the S&P 500 hovers near two-month highs and is up about 18 percent since its late-December low.
The United States and China have started to outline commitments in principle on the stickiest issues in their trade dispute, marking the most significant progress yet toward ending a seven-month trade war, sources told Reuters. The two sides were trying to reach agreement before March 1, Reuters reported.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 103.81 points, or 0.4 percent, to 25,850.63, the S&P 500 lost 9.82 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,774.88 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 29.36 points, or 0.39 percent, to 7,459.71.
The S&P 500 snapped a three-day streak of gains.
A sharp slowdown in global growth, especially in China and Europe, along with fading fiscal stimulus and trade tensions have fueled recent worries about the economy.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow forecast model now shows the U.S. economy likely expanded at a 1.4 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter.
The S&P healthcare index slid 0.9 percent, weighed down by Johnson & Johnson's 0.7 percent fall. The healthcare giant said it received subpoenas from U.S. regulators related to litigation involving alleged asbestos contamination in its signature baby powder product line.
Adding to the day's weakness, the S&P 500 energy index fell 1.6 percent. 
Also, Domino's Pizza shares tumbled 9.1 percent after it missed analysts' estimates for quarterly same-store sales.
 Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) shares were down 1 percent after the company's sneaker worn by emerging basketball star Zion Williamson split in half during a game.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.71-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.39-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 68 new highs and 14 new lows.

About 6.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 7.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days.

730,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 04:46PM ET</span>","Consumer Reports yanks recommendation for Tesla's Model 3, citing reliability","By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - Consumer Reports on Thursday pulled a recommendation for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's Model 3, citing reliability problems, and the influential U.S. magazine turned up the pressure on other automakers to include crash-avoiding automatic braking as standard equipment.
The magazine's decision to withdraw its endorsement for the Tesla Model 3 less than nine months after recommending the electric sedan highlighted questions about quality that Tesla has faced since the vehicle's difficult launch. Tesla shares fell 3.4 percent to $292.19 in afternoon trading Thursday on the Nasdaq.
Low scores for the Model 3 hurt the brand's overall standing, knocking it down 11 spots to No. 19 out of 33 brands in Consumer Reports' 2019 annual rankings.
Millions of prospective auto buyers consult the magazine’s rankings, which are based on road testing, reliability, safety and owner satisfaction scores.
Despite reliability problems, Model 3 owners said they love their vehicles, said Jake Fisher, the magazine's senior director of automotive testing.
""We have already made significant improvements to correct any issues that Model 3 customers may have experienced that are referenced in this (Consumer Reports) report,"" a Tesla representative said in an email, ""and our return policy allows any customer who is unhappy with their car to return it for a full refund.""
Earlier this month, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said during a call with investors that the company is focusing on improving customer service and quality.
Consumer Reports' refusal to endorse cars that lack technology that automatically applies brakes disqualified a wide swath of popular brands and models, including General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's Chevrolet. 
""We've been pushing for this feature for a long time because it's very good at preventing crashes,"" Fisher said in a phone interview. ""We have telegraphed for some time that this was coming.""
A growing number of new vehicle models now include automatic emergency braking, often called AEB, as standard, including Subaru Corp's Ascent, Consumer Reports' 2019 top pick for the midsize SUV category.
Subaru was ranked as Consumer Reports' top car brand, followed by Hyundai Motor Co's luxury Genesis then Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG units Porsche and Audi in third and fourth place, respectively. Toyota's luxury Lexus brand ranked fifth.
GM, which constantly stresses it is aiming for ""zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion,"" did not respond to a request for comment.
This year's top picks included several wins for Toyota Motor Corp, including for its full-size Avalon hybrid electric sedan and the Toyota Prius hybrid. Subaru won for its compact Forester SUV and its midsize Ascent SUV.
GM's Chevrolet brand was ranked 23rd, while the Cadillac brand ranked 26th and GMC 27th.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's Ford brand ranked 20th and its Lincoln brand 8th, but its best-selling F-150 pickup truck was named best pickup.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's Chrysler brand ranked 22nd, with its Dodge brand 25th and Jeep brand in 29th place. 

The automaker’s Fiat unit finished last among 33 brands rated.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.40%, the S&P 500 lost 0.35%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.39%.
Fresh signs the U.S. economy may not be as robust as many believe prompted traders to rein in their bullish bets as they digested a slew of economic reports, some of which sank to multi-year lows.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's business index fell to its lowest level since May 2016 and the Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators fell for the second month in a row in January, the first time that's happened since early 2016.
There wasn’t much to cheer on the housing front, meanwhile, as existing home sales slumped to their lowest levels since Nov. 15.
The negative reports overshadowed optimism on trade, with China and the U.S. reportedly working toward drafting a memorandum of understanding to tackle structural issues, including forced technology transfers, cybertheft, market access and currency.
The high-level trade talks come just a week before the March 1 deadline when, in the absence of a deal, the U.S. could impose higher tariffs on Chinese imports. But President Donald Trump fueled speculation the deadline could be extended, saying earlier this week that March 1 was not a ""magical date.""
The U.S. has slapped tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, about half the value of U.S. imports from the country. China has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion worth of American exports.
In healthcare, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) continued to add to losses from a day earlier, when the drugstore and healthcare company reported fourth-quarter revenue that missed expectations and guided earnings short of estimates.
Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), meanwhile, fell 4% after Stifel downgraded the stock to hold from buy and cut its price target to $346 from $397, citing ""decreased confidence in Alzheimer's, a looming Tecfidera legal saga and well-documented competitive threats to Spinraza.""
On the earnings front, Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) fell 9.15% after reporting quarterly results that missed estimates provided by Investing.com. But  The Cheesecake Factory  (NASDAQ:CAKE) rallied 5% as its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue miss was overshadowed by above-consensus comparable store sales growth of 1.9%.

By Jonathan Saul and Maiya Keidan
LONDON (Reuters) - A growing number of hedge funds are moving into shipping debt, an asset class few have invested in before, looking to buy up loans and bonds as banks cut their exposure to the troubled sector.
World economy worries and cost pressures are dampening prospects for a proper recovery in many segments of the shipping 
sector, which has struggled with tough markets for a decade. 
Meanwhile European banks, particularly German lenders, are trying to offload distressed and performing loans to the industry which attracts high capital requirements. 
The European Central Bank's banking supervisor has flagged troubled non-performing loans in 2019 as ""a concern for a significant number of euro area institutions"". 
Hedge funds clocked up hundreds of millions of dollars in losses from investments in mainly equities when the shipping industry first turned sour a decade ago – and have made limited forays for the most part since. 
Last year some equity-focused funds bet on a recovery for the global shipping industry through the stock and futures markets but many are now retrenching after heavy losses in the fourth quarter. 
Debt-focused funds are hoping for more luck.
""There is more hedge fund buying interest in shipping debt than in equity now. I don't think anyone believes the (shipping) market will recover any time soon,"" said Basil Karatzas of New York based shipping finance advisory firm Karatzas Marine Advisors & Co.
""So, if you buy equities the upside potential is limited. You can more easily make double-digit returns through credit risk investments."" 
Hedge funds looking at distressed loans include York Capital Management and Cross Ocean Partners, the sources said. 
A spokesman for York Capital declined to comment, while Cross Ocean Partners did not respond to requests for comment. 
One deal expected to generate hedge fund interest include a portfolio of distressed shipping loans that Greece's Piraeus Bank is seeking to sell, finance sources said.
A source close to the Piraeus Bank deal said the portfolio of shipping loans, called Nemo, was made up of non-performing and performing loans with a nominal value of 500 million to 600 million euros. The source said a sale was expected to close in the second quarter of 2019, declining to provide any details on potential bidders. 
Och-Ziff Capital Management was amongst the suitors for a 2.7 billion euro distressed portfolio of shipping loans that was sold this month by ailing German state bank NordLB, which sources said was bought by private equity firm Cerberus. 
Och-Ziff did not respond to requests for comment.
NordLB plans to wind down its remaining non-performing shipping loan portfolio of nearly 4 billion euros almost completely by the end of the year, which sources said is still likely to involve some loan sell-offs and expected to generate hedge fund interest.
Germany's No.2 lender DZ Bank is also trying to offload over one billion euros of toxic shipping loans from its troubled transport financing division DVB Bank, although there have been multiple delays with the sales process, finance sources said. 
Others though have opted for other types of investments, viewing toxic debt as too risky now. 

""Hedge funds need to step in to shipping but it's a bit early for the distressed cycle. It's a question of timing,"" said Louis Gargour, chief investment officer at hedge fund firm LNG Capital, which has around 10 to 15 percent of its total exposure focused on bond issuances by shipping companies.

Puma announced it was replacing German rival Adidas (DE:ADSGN) as Porsche's partner last month, and they presented the first shoes and garments at an event at a nightclub in Berlin on Thursday, which will go on sale on March 1.
Porsche Design hopes Puma will draw a younger audience to its stores, while the sportswear brand expects to attract some of the car brand's big spending customers, noting strong demand for high-end sports gear in markets like China and Japan.
""This is a joint attempt to strengthen both brands over the long term,"" Puma Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden told Reuters. 
""We can do more innovative things because customers are prepared to pay for them... In our sector, you are always under price pressure.""
The deal comes as many luxury and premium labels - like Germany's Hugo Boss and Kering's Gucci - are seeking to capitalize on the ""athleisure"" trend by launching pricey sneakers.
Shoes in the Puma-Porsche collection will retail for up to 250 euros ($283)and jackets for up to 450 euros and be sold in 150 Porsche Design stores worldwide and online.

""We have common values in terms of our design orientation and innovation,"" said Porsche Design chief Jan Becker.

Wendy’s Co. got customers in the door late last year with a $1 any size French fries promotion -- but the discounting ultimately came at the expense of margins, Chief Financial Officer Gunther Plosch said on a Thursday morning conference call.
“We saw traffic but traffic was basically not enough to totally overcome and make this promotion totally profitable,” he said when asked about the deal. He cited a competitive environment and called the cheap fries one of “the main drivers why we slightly missed our restaurant margin guidance for the year.”
Wendy’s also cited “pressure” on its lower priced burgers, and said it’s trying to convince shoppers who come in for “4 for $4” deals to trade up into more premium $5 offerings. Its hamburger sales growth is “softer” than other items, Chief Executive Officer Todd Penegor said, especially as competition from fast-food Mexican and fried chicken restaurants heats up.
The U.S. restaurant industry has been locked in a battle for months to win customers with cheap prices, and many are touting deals coming in at $5 dollars or less. Taco Bell recently said comparable sales rose a better-than-expected 6 percent in its latest quarter, helped by new $1 Grande Burritos. KFC, which recently started advertising two sandwiches for $3, also slightly beat expectations in the latest quarter.
Wendy’s isn’t alone in feeling the squeeze. Jack in the Box Inc.’s Chief Executive Officer Lenny Comma cited a “value-centric environment” in the latest quarter, adding that the company has been trying to avoid the deepest discounting. "

The government fears Germany's strict labor laws, which make it difficult for employers to dismiss workers without reasonable justification, would put Frankfurt at a disadvatange in the race to attract big banks wanting to relocate from London.
The law only applies to employees with a yearly salary of more than 221,400 euros ($250,890) without bonus, and employed by companies with balance sheets of more than 15 billion euros.
The government estimates that about 5,000 workers, mainly in the finance industry, fall under this criteria.
The amendments give employers the power to lay off such workers in return for severance packages without having to produce convincing arguments that justify their dismissal, a requirement that currently applies to all workers in Germany.
Should Britain leave the EU as planned on March 29, banks based in Britain will potentially lose so-called passporting rights that allow them to do business across the EU from their London base.
Some banks have already moved staff or set up offices in the EU as part of contingency plans ahead of March 29.
Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and Dublin are all seeking to attract banks and staff from London, the region's biggest financial center.
Germany's association of foreign banks last year said it expects about 20 banks to expand their presence in the country, creating some 5,000 news jobs over two years, mainly local hires.

Investing.com - Changes at the top may be afoot for Newell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL), which shouldn't come as a surprise to investors who've seen the stock dive while the company showed little traction in its turnaround plans.
The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Newell's board, mostly made up of activist shareholders, is thinking of replacing CEO Michael Polk, who's been in his job since 2011. A decision is not imminent, the Journal said, because it's possible that a turnaround will succeed. If Polk can make it happen, he'll reap lucrative rewards.
Newell, a consumer goods conglomerate best known for Rubbermaid products, Sharpie markers, Elmer's Glue, Graco baby strollers and Mr. Coffee coffee makers, has had a horrible run as a stock.
The shares peaked at $55.06 in June 2017 and were trading at $17.14 in the early afternoon today. That's a decline of 68%. The S&P 500's performance over the same time frame is a gain of about 14%.
For shareholder activists, this is manna from heaven, a chance to push management to unload underperforming assets and streamline operations. Carl Icahn controls three board seats. Starboard Value, another activist investor, has two. A number of top executives have left as a result of their prodding.
The problem is that the stock has yet to respond to the company's turnaround plan, which is focused on selling businesses that represent 35% of total sales. In fact, a disappointing fourth-quarter earnings report last Friday -- and a forecast for more bad news in 2019 -- caused the stock to fall 21% that day. The company said it was hurt by the U.S. trade war, higher costs and the bankruptcy of Toys 'R' Us, a key outlet for baby strollers.
Newell is demonstrating the risk all conglomerates potentially face: buying too much and then not being able to get results. Newell, then known as Newell Rubbermaid, bought Jarden Corp. for $15 billion in 2016. The deal brought in such brands as Rawlings sporting goods, K2 Sports, Mr. Coffee, outdoor equipment company Coleman and Diamond Match.
The problems emerged almost immediately. And Newell has been unloading many of its businesses, including Rawlings, K2 Sports, Diamond Match, and Waddington Group, a packaging manufacturer."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The city of Philadelphia has filed an antitrust lawsuit accusing seven major banks of conspiring to inflate interest rates for a type of bond used by cities, towns and other public entities, costing them potentially billions of dollars.
In a complaint filed on Wednesday night, Philadelphia accused Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Royal Bank of Canada and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co of secretly manipulating rates for tax-exempt bonds known as VRDOs, or variable-rate demand obligations.
Philadelphia, which said it issued more than $1.6 billion of the bonds, said the banks colluded to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fees they did not earn, reducing critical funding for public services such as hospitals, power and water supplies, schools and transportation.
""The alleged misconduct of the defendants potentially resulted in Philadelphia - and entities across this country -paying above-market interest rates for years,"" City Solicitor Marcel Pratt said.
Philadelphia also said the banks' conduct is the subject of a preliminary criminal probe by the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust division, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has contacted four of the banks. The Bond Buyer reported the Justice probe in September, citing unnamed sources.
Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman, JPMorgan, RBC and the SEC declined to comment on Thursday. The other banks and the Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
VRDOs are long-term bonds that let issuers borrow at lower short-term rates because they contain a ""put"" feature.
This lets investors redeem bonds early by tendering them to banks, such as the seven being sued. The banks then remarket the bonds to other investors and charge issuers for their services.
According to the complaint, the banks secretly agreed in person, by phone and electronically not to compete with each other for remarketing services from February 2008 to June 2016, when they controlled about 70 percent of VRDO remarketing.
Philadelphia said the banks did this to keep rates artificially high, ensure investors would not exercise their put options, and collect fees ""for doing, essentially, nothing.""
The city is represented by Daniel Brockett, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan who has filed several antitrust lawsuits against banks in the Manhattan court.
That court is home to a wide array of private litigation accusing banks of conspiring to rig various financial markets, interest rate benchmarks and commodities.

The case is Philadelphia v Bank of America Corp et al, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 19-01608.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. banking sector recorded $59.1 billion in profits in the fourth quarter of 2018, down slightly from the third quarter's record level but still up significantly from the prior year, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
U.S. bank profits were up 18.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to one year prior, after adjusting for changes spurred by the 2017 tax law. The FDIC said the profits were driven by lower taxes and higher operating revenues.
Due to one-time accounting changes driven by the new tax law that forced banks to log significant losses at the end of 2017, bank profits were up in the fourth quarter of 2018 by 133.4 percent without adjusting to account for the tax quirk.
Banks have by and large benefited from the tax overhaul, enjoying record profits since its enactment, driven in part by their lower effective tax rate.
In the third quarter of 2018, banks reported a record $62 billion in profits.
The FDIC also reported that the number of ""problem banks"" had fallen from 71 to 60 in the fourth quarter, marking the lowest number of struggling institutions since the first quarter of 2007.
""The banking industry continued to report strong results,"" said FDIC Chairwoman Jelena McWilliams in a statement.

However, she cautioned that competition for loans and low interest rates had led some banks to reach for yield, and urged banks to maintain prudent risk management.

Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.86 a share on revenue of $225.2 million, topping estimates compiled by Investing.com for earnings of $1.69 a share on revenue of $225 million. Its shares rose more than 14%.
The above-consensus results were driven by depletions growth of 11% for the fourth quarter and 13% for the full year. Depletions are the rate at which beer is sold from a distributor to retailers. The company credited strong performance in its Truly Hard Seltzer, Twisted Tea and Angry Orchard brands.
The brewer of Sam Adams touted frothy performance for the current year, targeting double-digit top-line growth and a ""significant"" increase in operating income.
""We expect first quarter shipments growth to be significantly higher than depletions as we manage our supply chain and capacity to ensure our distributor inventory levels are adequate to support drinker demand for our brands during the peak summer months,"" said Dave Burwick, the company's President and CEO.
The company guided full-year earnings in the range of $8 to $9 a share.
The upbeat outlook comes as the beer market got off to a strong start for the year, with volume up 3.7% during the first four weeks of 2019, compared with last year, according to market research firm IRI.
Boston Beer’s Sam 76 grew dollar sales 77.8% during the period, while its off-premise multi-outlet and convenience retail channel universe (MULC) store sales rose 22.3%, the report showed."

""We have obtained seven months to avoid any problem,"" Spanish Industry Minister Reyes Maroto said. ""We have more time for the company to decide which changes it opts for.""
Spain's national flag carrier Iberia is majority-owned by Britain-based Anglo-Spanish group IAG (LON:ICAG).
Maroto was referring to a provisional deal reached in Brussels to ensure, among other things, that companies can continue to provide scheduled flights for seven months after the date of application of post-Brexit air traffic regulations.
Airlines that will no longer be majority owned by EU nationals once Britain leaves the bloc face the threat of losing their right to fly within the EU after Brexit due to share ownership rules. 
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29 there would be no transitional period in which the airlines could sort out their shareholdings.
""This is solved, we have been given a moratorium of seven months in the regulation that will be approved, and we are working with the company to find a definitive solution,"" Maroto told reporters.
The provisional agreement referred to by Maroto needs approval from member states' ambassadors in the EU Council's Permanent Representatives Committee.
Iberia carries 19 million passengers a year and is a major employer in Spain with almost 17,000 workers. 

IAG, which also owns British Airways, is registered in Spain but headquartered in Britain and has shareholders from around the world.

The United States has blocked appointments at the WTO appellate body, which hears appeals in trade disputes between countries, threatening the biggest crisis in the 24-year history of the WTO.
The organization normally has seven members but currently only has three, and two of those are set to complete their mandates in December.
""What is clear to me is that the clock is ticking,"" WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo told a news conference in Bucharest before meeting EU ministers responsible for trade over dinner.
Azevedo said there would be a significant slowdown of cases and ""eventually paralysis down the road"".
The European Union has made proposals for WTO reform, agreeing with China, India and other countries on changes to the WTO's dispute settlement. However, it has struggled to engage the United States on the topic.
Azevedo said there was at least clarity about U.S. concerns, some of which were also shared by other WTO members.
""But what is not clear yet is what solutions can we find to fix those problems,"" he said.

""I would say there is a consensual view that we need to address this, that this is a big priority. But I don't have at this point in time any signals that I could use to say we have a light at the end of the tunnel. At this point in time, I don't see that.""

751,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 12:45PM ET</span>","Engie to scale back overseas, cut costs to boost revenues: sources","By Geert De Clercq and Benjamin Mallet
PARIS (Reuters) - Utility Engie is poised to cut back its geographical spread of businesses and focus on grids and renewables in a 1 billion euro cost-cutting drive to bolster revenues, sources familiar with the matter said. 
Engie has been criticized for being too complex and conglomerate-like and CEO Isabelle Kocher is expected to address this in a 2019-2021 corporate strategy plan to be announced next Thursday, when the company also releases 2018 results.
Two sources with knowledge of the company's plans said Kocher was likely to scale back the number of countries Engie operates in - it is present in some 70 countries - notably in central Europe.
Both said Kocher would focus the gas and power group more strongly on grids and renewables after selling some 15 billion worth of fossil-fuel related assets in 2016-18.
One of the two sources, a union official, said Kocher would aim to cut costs by 1 billion over three years, extending a 1.3 billion euro cost reduction plan in 2016-18.
Daily business newsletter La Lettre A had first reported that Engie was targeting a billion-euro profit-boosting plan.
Engie will also need to acquire at least one well-established, cash-generating business too make up for cash flow lost in its move away from fossil fuels, two sources, including a banker, said. 
""The plan will have to involve major acquisitions. The planets are aligned, but the target remains to be decided,"" one of them said. 
Potential targets include the Transportadora Associada de Gás pipeline owned by Petrobras, Dutch renewables utility Eneco, or the U.S. renewable energy assets of Portugual's EDPS, sources said. 
Engie cut is net debt to core earnings ratio to 2.2 at the end of 2017 from 2.5 two years earlier. It can further boost its financial firepower by selling part of its 75 percent stake in French gas transport firm GRTgaz, which will become possible under the government's new ""Loi Pacte"" law. 
Engie declined to comment on strategy or potential targets ahead of next week's presentation. 
ACTIVIST INVESTORS
More than anything, Kocher and new chairman Jean-Pierre Clamadieu have to come with plan that reduces Engie's conglomerate discount and boosts its shares. This is because the government's plan to cut its 23.64 percent holding will remove Engie's best defense against activist investors.
""For now, the state's presence is a deterrent for activist investors, but once it leaves, Engie becomes a possible target,"" said an investment banker familiar with the company's thinking. 
Activist investor Elliott Management's acquisition of a 2.5 percent stake in drinks firm  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) in December has focused minds across France's CAC40 bluechip index on the need for a clear strategy, attractive valuation and close relationships with major shareholders.
At German rival Uniper, the presence of Elliott and activist investor Knight Vinke has become a source of tension in the company's relationship with Finnish shareholder Fortum.
BELGIAN POISON PILL
Engie's deeply discounted stock price shows the valuation potential of splitting off some of the group's assets. 
With a 0.95 price/book ratio, Engie is the second-most undervalued share in the Stoxx European utilities index, with only Uniper more undervalued by that measure, Refinitiv Eikon data shows. 
More focused utilities trade at much higher multiples, with renewable energy group Orsted and Innogy around 2.5 times book and grid pureplays like Red Electrica and Terna trading at nearly three times book. 
""Engie's conglomerate discount is due to its complexity,"" one banker said.
A large UK-based institutional investor said the company was ""a black box"", incomprehensible to investors. 
Bankers and advisers say Kocher's biggest problem - Engie's nuclear assets in Belgium - may offer its strongest defense against an activist attack. 
Belgium plans to phase out nuclear energy by 2025, which will leave Engie the decades-long expensive task of decommissioning its seven nuclear plants there.

""When an activist takes aim at a company, it is usually because he sees something that management doesn't. But I don't see what solution an activist could bring for Belgian nuclear,"" the banker said.

752,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 12:20PM ET</span>","For Sainsbury and Asda, watchdog's analysis leaves merger in serious doubt","By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - Sainsbury's planned 7.3 billion pound ($9.5 billion) takeover of Walmart's Asda can only be salvaged if Britain's competition regulator fundamentally changes its analysis of Britain's grocery market, experts said on Thursday.
That's unlikely, say competition lawyers, analysts and company insiders, so the proposal will most likely fail.
The Competition and Market Authority's (CMA) provisional view, published on Wednesday, was the deal should be blocked in the absence of the sale of a large number of stores, or even one of the brands. 
It acknowledged the two companies were unlikely to be able to address its concerns. 
""The only way you get there is you have to have the CMA do a fundamental u-turn on the way they’ve appraised it,” said one person familiar with Sainsbury's thinking. “And if they (the CMA) are playing the politics, then there’s no chance they’re going to do that.""
Sainsbury and Asda have until March 13 to respond to the CMA's provisional findings and until March 6 to respond to its suggested divestment remedies. The CMA will then publish its final report by April 30.
Competition lawyers said there are few precedents for the CMA to dramatically revise its findings between provisional and final reports.
Sainsbury and Asda's key argument has been that Britain's grocery market is changing rapidly, driven by the growth of online and a broader range of competitors, most notably discounters Aldi and Lidl.
However, the CMA effectively said that while new entrants are a force, it is the big four grocers - market leader  Tesco  (LON:TSCO), Sainsbury, Asda and Morrisons - who are most in competition with each other, making the Sainsbury-Asda deal a ""four to three"" merger.
Lawyers said Sainsbury and Asda would have to come up with new evidence to change the CMA's thinking.
WRONG FIGURES 
""Sainsbury’s-Asda would need to pull something out of the bag, or they'd need to show that the CMA has completely got its figures wrong,"" said Alex Haffner, partner and head of competition at law firm Fladgate LLP.
    ""All they can realistically hope to achieve between now and the CMA’s reporting deadline is to eat away at the size of the divestments required. They are undoubtedly facing an uphill challenge to make it work,"" Haffner said.
Analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said prior to Wednesday's ruling they had assumed a 67 percent chance of the deal proceeding. They now see a minimal chance of success.
They highlighted the CMA's view that any ""remedy stores"" would have to be sold to a single buyer, would have to be solely Sainsbury's or solely Asda's, not a mix, and be accompanied by the sale of either the Sainsbury or Asda brand name.
""Any one of these constraints would be painful - together they leave us skeptical that any viable package could be found,"" they said, arguing Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was the only company they could imagine being interested in buying so many stores. 
But they cautioned that facilitating Amazon's scaling up in UK grocery might cost Sainsbury more in the long term. Amazon declined to comment.
If the CMA's final report differs little from its provisional findings, Sainsbury's and Asda's last chance would be to challenge the ruling through the Competition Appeal Tribunal, a specialist judicial body.
Sainsbury Chief Executive Mike Coupe has said the company would take that route if it believed any ruling was not backed up by published evidence.
Coupe, as the architect of the deal, could come under investor pressure if it fails. However, analysts speculated Sainsbury would be reluctant to jettison him given Chairman David Tyler is due to step down in March, or soon after, to be succeeded by Martin Scicluna.
Meanwhile failure of the deal would block one potential exit route from Britain for Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Analysts have said the U.S. group might instead consider a stock market listing of Asda or try to sell it to private equity.

BREMEN, Germany (Reuters) - Ariane 6, Europe's next-generation space rocket, is expected to win its first two commercial launch orders in coming weeks, company officials said, a key milestone as the European launcher vies for orders against Elon Musk's U.S. competitor SpaceX.
Operator Arianespace faces increased competition from SpaceX and Blue Origin, owned by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos. Japan and India also pose a growing challenge.
Ariane 6 has three institutional orders in hand from the European Commission and France and is close to signing deals with two commercial customers, said Mathias Spude, spokesman for ArianeGroup, a joint venture of Airbus and  Safran  (PA:SAF), that is the majority stakeholder in Arianespace.
ArianeGroup has invested 400 million euros of its own funds in the 3.4-billion-euro development of Ariane 6 - a project key to ensuring Europe's independent access to space and a market valued at over $1 trillion by 2040.
Manufacturers say the rocket will be more versatile than Ariane 5, able to carry out missions from placing as many as 90 small satellites in low-earth orbit to taking classic spy satellites to far higher perches in geostationary orbit.
But the business case depends on drumming up enough commercial business to augment the 5-6 institutional launches expected in Europe annually in coming years, about a quarter of those planned in the United States.
European governments also face industry pressure to use Ariane 6 even if they could get cheaper rides using SpaceX.
""Europe continues to need its own access to space - the market of the future,"" said Matthias Wachter with the BDI German Federation of Industry. ""It doesn't make sense to use European tax money to develop our own rocket but then launch satellites with competitors from the United States or Asia.""
Ariane 6, due for a first launch in 2020, was designed to save significant costs compared to Ariane 5, but industry experts say it will still cost around 70 million euros per launch - well above the rate offered by SpaceX, which uses reusable rocket technology and can count on larger U.S. orders.
Ariane 6's designers insist innovative production techniques will favor the European launcher when the commercial market recovers from a recent slump.
""When it wakes up ... we will be on the market with a rocket that is 40 percent cheaper, and will continue to reduce costs after that,"" Spude told Reuters at the Ariane 6 production site.

Still, experts say SpaceX is widely credited with jolting the overall market with a keen focus on cutting costs, forcing Europe to shake up its launch industry.

LONDON (Reuters) - Wholesale prices for lab-grown diamonds have fallen by up to 60 percent since De Beers began selling synthetic stones for jewelry in September, CEO Bruce Cleaver said on Thursday, adding margins for the sector would continue to fall.
De Beers, part of mining group  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), shocked the diamond industry last year when it announced it was reversing a decades-old policy of selling natural diamonds only for jewelry and synthetic stones for industrial uses. 
Its Lightbox brand, created for the new synthetic venture, is starting small, selling 20,000 carats by the end of 2019, but De Beers has invested in a synthetic diamond factory in the U.S. state of Oregon, which should produce more than half a million rough carats a year when fully operational in 2020.
Already, the impact on synthetic pricing had been huge, Cleaver said, citing De Beers' analysis that showed an up to 60 percent fall in wholesale prices. He said the slide would continue as improved technology increases the quality and volume of lab-grown diamonds.
""The margins that were out there are not sustainable,"" Cleaver told Reuters in an interview. ""I like to compare it to a flat screen TV. The first ones were very expensive and the quality was poor.""
Cleaver however denied synthetic diamonds were cutting into the price of natural stones, which he says are a different product. ""It's a perfectly legitimate business. It's just a different business,"" he says of lab-grown diamonds. 
Much of the aim of De Beers, the world's leading diamond seller by value, in launching Lightbox is to differentiate diamonds grown in a laboratory from those found in the earth.
In contrast to the commodities that form the bulk of Anglo American's portfolio, demand for diamonds, which is listed in its results statement as among the company's ""principal risks and uncertainties,"" is reliant on marketing.
Without giving numbers, Cleaver said De Beers would boost its marketing budget for natural stones this year, which already in 2018 was the highest in a decade at $166 million.
While Anglo American's overall core earnings for 2018 rose by 4 percent, De Beers' underlying EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) fell by 13 percent.

Cleaver attributed the fall to expenditure, including on Lightbox, as well as volatile market conditions, although he said the biggest markets for diamonds, the United States and China, were robust.

LONDON (Reuters) - Huawei will present a plan to address British security concerns about its equipment by the end of the first half of this year, a senior company executive said on Thursday, following criticism the Chinese firm has not moved fast enough to fix the issues.
British intelligence officials said on Wednesday they had not yet seen a ""credible"" plan by Huawei to resolve issues raised in a critical government report last year, which found that technical and supply-chain problems with the company's equipment had exposed national telecom networks to new security risks.
Huawei previously said the problems will take 3-5 years to resolve and Ryan Ding, head of Huawei's carrier business group, told reporters on Thursday a ""global and comprehensive"" plan was expected to be approved internally by the end of March.
""In Q2 we will talk to all our stakeholders, including UK stakeholders, about such a plan and hopefully by the end of the first half of this year we will complete the high level design of such (a) plan,"" he said, speaking through a translator.
Britain has emerged as a key battleground for Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment, in its efforts to resist U.S. calls for allies to ditch its equipment over fears that it could be used by Beijing for spying.
No evidence for such claims has been produced publicly and Huawei has repeatedly denied them, but the espionage allegations have led several Western countries to restrict the company's access to their markets.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday the United States, which is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group alongside Britain, would not be able to share information with countries that decide to use Huawei equipment due to the security implications. 
HUAWEI F.C. 
Ding said Huawei was committed to achieving ""trustworthiness"" in eight key areas, including software and hardware engineering, management of third-party components and company culture. Huawei will also spend more than the $2 billion originally earmarked globally for the effort, he said. 
Huawei's spending pledge, announced in December, followed a series of strained meetings with officials at Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), who raised the security issues in the government report last July.
A new British report is expected in coming weeks. People with knowledge of the matter said it will likely further criticize Huawei's perceived slow response to the British concerns. 
Ding said he believed assurances by the NCSC - part of Britain's GCHQ intelligence agency - that its findings were not politically-influenced.
Asked whether he was worried that political pressure would prevent Huawei from being used in Britain's next-generation 5G networks, Ding said it was for operators to decide which equipment vendors they used but excluding Huawei would be like barring top-flight teams from English soccer.
""I believe that a 5G market without Huawei is just like the English Premier League without Manchester United,"" he said.

The European firm is in detailed talks with airlines over the price and timing of the longer-range design - known as A321XLR - and has pencilled in some orders subject to a formal launch, expected this year, industry sources said.
Airbus is looking for 200-300 draft orders before committing to build the A321XLR, in a move that would limit the space available for a mid-market alternative that Boeing hopes to launch in a gap between medium-haul and long-haul jets.
""Every A321XLR that Airbus sells, means one less potential sale for the NMA (Boeing's proposed New Mid-sized Airplane),"" an industry source said.

Same-store sales at Domino's company-owned U.S. outlets rose 3.6 percent, the slowest pace in at least four years, while franchises posted 5.7 percent growth in the fourth quarter, both well below Wall Street expectations.
Analysts on average had expected same-store sales to rise 6.60 percent at company-owned U.S. stores and 7.25 percent at franchise stores, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Domino's has led the way among pizza chains with investments in technology, cutting delivery times below 30 minutes and making its overall operation more efficient as it faces the threat of delivery ""disruptors"" like GrubHub and UberEats.
The tech-led changes in delivery have still hurt it and rivals Papa John's and Yum Brands' Pizza Hut by making more restaurants' food easily accessible to customers sitting at home on the couch.
Higher investments in tech initiatives and other strategic areas led to a near 15 percent rise in general and administrative expenses for Domino's in the quarter.
U.S. restaurants have been also been facing stagnant sales and weak traffic as they face rising food and wage costs, hurting their profitability.
Revenue from the international business, which is run by franchisees but provides Domino's with revenue from ingredients, equipment and royalties, fell nearly 3 percent on the back of gains for the dollar.
International same-stores sales rose yet again, but growth of 2.4 percent was below expectations of 4.14 percent.
The company operates 5,876 stores, both company owned and franchises, in the United States and over 10,000 outlets in international markets.

Total revenue rose to $1.08 billion but fell short of analysts' average estimate of $1.10 billion for the second consecutive quarter.

The latest batch of data suggest the economy may be starting to slow, increasing the case for the Federal Reserve to continue pausing rate increases. New orders for durable goods, excluding volatile items, fell unexpectedly in December, while business activity in the mid-Atlantic region declined to its weakest level since May 2016, according to the Philadelphia Fed's monthly survey.
The S&P 500 fell 6 points or 0.22% as of 9:33 AM ET (14:33 GMT), while the Dow lost 21 points, or 0.08%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite decreased 8 points, or 0.11%.
""The numbers on Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing and durable goods are volatile, indicating that the economy is slowing,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.
""Overall, it is showing that the economy is not as strong as it was in the summer of 2018.""
Meanwhile, the U.S. and China appear to be moving closer to ending their trade war, increasing the chance that the two sides can make a deal before a tariff increase on Chinese goods on March 1 comes into force.
The two largest economies in the world have made the most significant progress to date, outlining commitments in areas such as intellectual property rights, services, currency and agriculture barriers to trade, Reuters reported.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was down after the morning bell, falling 0.7%, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) dipped 0.3% and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) slipped 0.4%.  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) decreased 1% after Duke basketball player Zion Williamson was injured when his Nike shoe split during a game.

766,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 09:10AM ET</span>",State Street Finds Insurers Still Wary of ETFs After Rule Change,"(Bloomberg) -- Many insurance companies are steering clear of exchange-traded funds even after a high profile rule change designed to make them easier to own.
Almost 40 percent of insurers aren’t using ETFs more than a year after the National Association of Insurance Commissioners rewrote its accounting rules in an attempt to loosen the restrictions, according to a new survey sponsored by  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT). and conducted by Greenwich Associates. For more than a third of non-users, internal policies and state regulations are to blame, the study showed.
That’s a setback for ETF issuers like State Street, the third-largest in the U.S., that want to attract some of the trillions that insurers manage. BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) forecast two years ago that as much as $300 billion would flow into debt-focused funds by 2022 thanks to the regulatory shift, which was supposed to make it easier to compare debt ETFs to bonds. But so far, it’s been slow going.
“It’s still lower than I would think it would be at this point but we’re excited to see the prospects,” said Chad Nettleship, an insurance specialist for State Street’s ETF business. “The regulatory changes are fairly recent.”
Greenwich Associates interviewed 52 insurers overseeing about $1.9 trillion between September and October last year. About 40 percent of those companies were life insurers, and another 40 percent were property and casualty companies.
Patchy Reform
The patchwork nature of U.S insurance regulation seems to be at least partly responsible. Insurers are regulated state by state, with the NAIC making model laws that state officials then decide whether to adopt. Limits remain on the amount of exposure insurers can have to a single issuer, a problem given that more than 80 percent of ETF assets are in funds run by just three issuers.
Meanwhile less than half of insurers surveyed have embraced the new valuation system, which is more akin to the way bonds are accounted for.
Still, it isn’t all bad news for companies that offer the funds. Insurers that do own ETFs are using them instead of cash and to create equity and fixed-income portfolios, according to the study. And 42 percent expect to use ETFs to capitalize on specific debt opportunities in three years time, up from 29 percent now, the survey showed.
Even the holdouts may come around, eventually. Of the 11 non-users that responded to a question on whether they would ever reconsider ETFs, more than 80 percent said they would. But for more than a quarter of those, that’s unlikely to happen within the next three years."

The card, which will be linked with Apple's Wallet app, will allow users to set spending goals, track rewards, and manage balances, WSJ said. 
The new cards will be rolled out to employees for testing in next few weeks and will be launched later this year.
The deal will benefit both the companies tap into new income sources. Apple has been sharpening its focus on its services business, including the App Store, mobile payments and music streaming after a recent dip in iPhone sales, which generate most of the company's profit.

Goldman Sachs has already started adding customer-support call centers, and building an internal system to handle payments, a project that could cost the bank $200 million, WSJ said, a time when banks are focused on reigning in expenses to boost their bottom lines.

The Wall Street bank could eventually offer other financial products, such as Marcus loans and wealth management services, to Apple customers, WSJ said.

The world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment is under scrutiny in the West over its relationship with the Chinese government and U.S.-led allegations of enabling state espionage, with Washington asking allies not to use Huawei's technology.
Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegations and did again at a news conference in Vienna on Thursday.
Joe Kelly, Vice President of Corporate Communications said at the news conference: ""We have never been asked by any government or any authority anywhere in the world... to do anything that would compromise or jeopardize... the security of customer networks."" 
""If we ever are asked to do so, we will refuse,"" Kelly said.
Huawei has deals with all three major Austrian telecoms groups: A1 Telekom Austria, controlled by Mexico's America Movil, Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile Austria and Hutchison Whampoa's Drei Austria. 
The company is ready to help them build 5G infrastructure for the next generation mobile networks, the CEO of Huawei's Austrian business said.
""We are more than ready to support Austria on its way to becoming a 5G pioneer with our know how and our solutions,"" Pan Yao said. 
Austria, a laggard in the European Union for fast broadband connections, wants to become a 5G pioneer in Europe. It is among the first in the European Union to auction the licenses. Results of the 3.4 to 3.8 GHz band auction, which will mainly speed up data services in densely populated areas, are expected within weeks.
The allegations against Huawei have led several Western countries to restrict the company's access to their markets and the European Union to consider proposals that could amount to a de facto ban.
Austria's technology ministry on Thursday reaffirmed it was aiming for a European stance on whether or not to allow the Chinese firm to equip 5G networks.
""Our priority is to protect our networks,"" a spokesman for the technology ministry said, adding that he was not aware of concrete suspicions against Huawei.
Huawei, which says it is the second biggest smartphone seller in Austria with a market share of 28 percent, said it was considering whether to invest in research and development in the country but did not provide any details.

It plans to open its Vienna flagship store in the summer.

774,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>",Ford's Brazil shutdown highlights automakers' woes with excess capacity,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's oldest factory in Brazil, slated for closure later this year, was a giant among auto plants, occupying a sprawling 12 million square feet (111.5 hectares), bigger than many of the automaker's U.S. facilities.
But in terms of spare capacity, the most important indicator of factory profitability, the historic Sao Bernardo do Campo plant, which still employs 3,000 workers, had become a dwarf. Closed more often than it was open, the plant's production lines sprang to life just three days a week. 
Ford announced on Tuesday it will close the factory and exit its heavy commercial truck business in South America as part of a global restructuring. 
Overall, Ford's Sao Bernardo plant produced 33,000 cars and heavy trucks in 2018, or just 11 vehicles per employee.
An industry rule of thumb says an auto factory struggles to turn a profit unless it uses at least 80 percent of its capacity. In 2018, Ford used 12 percent of its car production capacity at the Sao Bernardo plant. In Brazil as a whole, Ford used 58 percent of its total production capacity last year, leaning heavily on a plant in the northeastern state of Bahia, where it receives significant tax incentives. 
Productivity troubles in Brazil are perhaps most severe at Ford but plague the industry as a whole, even as Latin America's largest economy rebounds from its deepest recession ever with double-digit growth in car sales.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), now Brazil's sales market leader, produced cars equivalent to 78 percent of its capacity in 2018, up from 56 percent two years earlier, according to Reuters calculations based on capacity figures GM disclosed and production figures from local industry association Anfavea. 
Still, GM executives warned workers earlier this year that the company was experiencing ""a critical moment"" in the country amid heavy losses. 
Another top domestic producer, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, produced cars equivalent to just 47 percent of its overall capacity, up from 36 percent in 2016, according to a similar calculation.
Ford's heavy truck business, which will be discontinued in South America, operated at 19 percent capacity, according to Ford's own figures. The company said it could find ""no viable path to profitability"" for the unit. 
""We know Brazil has excess capacity,"" said Leticia Costa, a Brazilian consultant and auto industry expert. ""This is a global problem for the auto industry but it's particularly true for emerging markets.""
BOOM DAYS IN BRAZIL
Brazilians' mushrooming disposable income, along with hefty import barriers, encouraged automakers - led by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG - to set up shop there and produce cars locally starting in the late 1950s. That turned Sao Paulo's industrial suburb of Sao Bernardo into the epicenter of what for a time was one of the world's top five auto producers. 
Volkswagen, whose Beetle was the market's sales leader in the industry's early boom days, did not respond to a request for comment on its capacity. 
But the high costs of local production and dependence on what turned out to be a fickle domestic market also sowed the seeds of the industry's hollowing out and dispersal into newer plants in far-flung states. The severe economic recession that began around 2013 hammered local producers. While the industry is recovering, it is still far behind its peak.
But some plants can now build cars more efficiently. Ford's second plant in Bahia produces six times more cars than the Sao Bernardo plant, with 53 percent more workers, according to the company's website.

""Fixed costs at that scale are sky-high,"" said David Wong, a management consultant and Brazilian auto industry expert.

775,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 07:09AM ET</span>",Canadian auto union faces Catch-22 in General Motors fight,"By Susan Taylor
TORONTO (Reuters) - Jerry Dias, the leader of Canada's auto union, is unsparing in his rhetorical attacks on General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's decision to close its Oshawa, Ontario, assembly plant and lay off thousands of union workers by year-end.
But when it comes to action, Unifor's president has been far more circumspect. 
Dias promised ""drastic measures"" to compel GM to extend production of sedans and pickups, including the Silverado, to Sept. 21, 2020, when the current labor contract expires.
For more than a century, GM's complex in Oshawa, a city east of Toronto, has been an economic engine for Ontario and Canada, anchored by thousands of highly paid manufacturing jobs. 
After GM's November announcement of a broad restructuring, including Oshawa, the union backed brief production disruptions, a call to boycott GM's Mexican-made vehicles and a ""solidarity"" concert for workers by British musician Sting.
But Dias has not yet deployed the biggest weapon in his arsenal – a general strike to fully halt production of Silverado and Sierra pickups, vital to the Detroit automaker's profitability. 
Dias concedes there is mixed support for a walkout among union workers. Some Oshawa workers fear that shutting down GM Canada would hurt them much more than the company.
Unifor represents 2,600 assembly-line workers at GM Oshawa and 1,800 workers at plants supplying the Oshawa operations, whose contracts typically have lower pay, benefits and security. Some 1,500 work at feeder plants that are entirely reliant on Oshawa.
That is a sharp drop from the mid-1990s, when Unifor's predecessor union counted 14,750 hourly members in Oshawa.
""We're working in the GM plant, but we're not GM,"" said Sheri Steel, a forklift driver at CEVA Logistics. ""Whenever GM shuts down, we do too. We get sent home and we lose pay.""
Strikes can be a ""dangerous tactic"" when plants face closure, and could drive GM to an earlier exit, she said.
Workers are pressing for talks on closure terms, which can improve on guaranteed worker provisions in a contract, said CEVA local Chairperson Keith Poulin. Unifor has declined those requests, saying it intends to keep the plant open, he said.
""We live paycheck to paycheck,"" said Poulin's wife, Jean Poulin. More than seven years ago, the couple were hired by companies supplying the GM plant for C$14 an hour.
Over time, their wages rose to C$20.50, but the 51-year-olds say that with limited severance, no pension and no savings, they cannot afford to retire.
""With a mortgage and bills, we are scared,"" said Jean, who delivers parts for Syncreon Automotive.
'THEY DON'T SCARE ME'
Some union members are nervous about their future, Dias told Reuters in an interview, but he is not. ""They've got a lot of power,"" he said of GM. ""But they don't scare me at all."" 
Unifor has laid the groundwork for tougher action. It charged GM with breaking terms of the 2016 collective agreement, committing it to keep Oshawa open until the deal ends in 2020. It filed a grievance that is proceeding to arbitration.
GM Canada says the agreement notes that market conditions may arise beyond the company's control. ""The union has also been aware since 2016 that Oshawa truck production was temporary and ending in 2019,"" said spokesman David Paterson. 
So far, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has refused to retreat from her restructuring plans despite criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, Canadian politicians and unions in both countries. She has also declined to meet with Dias.
""We have a lot more cards to play,"" Dias said. ""But I'm not going to find a solution playing solitaire.""
Dias has looked for support from his U.S. counterparts in the United Auto Workers union. The two unions, which broke apart more than three decades ago, discussed cooperating on their campaigns to save plants, but provided no details.
In the past 23 years, there have only been two autoworker strikes in Canada, said Unifor's director of research.
""We used to have strikes at every round of bargaining among auto assemblers right from the beginning in 1937,"" said Bill Murnighan. ""But Canada now has a very low number of strikes compared to past eras and compared to other countries.""
A GM THAT CAN SAY NO
GM's decision to end production at Oshawa and four U.S. plants is emblematic of a global shift, as automakers restructure and invest in next-generation vehicles, including electric and self-driving cars. With North American sales projected to flatten or decline, automakers are also wary of maintaining unnecessary capacity in the region.
Politicians on both sides of the border have reminded GM that the U.S. and Canadian governments rescued it with public money a decade ago.
After contributing more than C$10.5 billion to the 2009 GM bailout, the Canadian and Ontario governments sold their final equity stakes in 2015. A set of financing commitments, including domestic production, expired one year later, GM's Paterson said.
Trump has threatened to cut all GM subsidies, a tough stance that Unifor has asked Canadian officials to adopt. But politicians from Ottawa and Toronto have taken a more moderate approach, saying there is nothing more they can do without GM's cooperation. Dias calls their response inadequate.
""That couldn't be further from the truth. ... We have been having conversations repeatedly,"" said a federal government official. ""I don't think the solution is just throwing money at the company."" 
The provincial government agrees. 
""We've asked many, many times - and offered all kinds of different things - What can we do, as the government of Ontario, for you to change your mind?"" said Economic Development Minister Todd Smith. ""And the answer has always been: 'Nothing.'""

Danske is already under investigation in several other countries and the threat of hefty fines has sent its shares plunging almost 50 percent since March last year. 
The SEC is now also carrying out inquiries, adding to an ongoing criminal investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) in relation to the case of possible money laundering at Danske Bank’s Estomia branch.
The announcement sent its shares down 4.3 percent by 1020 GMT.
Danske is also under investigation in Denmark, Estonia, France and Britain over 200 billion euros ($226 billion) in payments found to have flowed through its Estonian branch from Russia, ex-Soviet states and elsewhere.
""We have no information about when the investigations conducted by DoJ and SEC are expected to be completed, nor do we know what the outcome of these will be,"" said interim CEO Jesper Nielsen, who stepped in after predecessor Thomas Borgen was ousted as the scandal unfolded last year.
The new investigation came only two days after Estonia's financial regulator took the unexpected step of demanding that Danske close its branch there and repay customers' deposits within eight months, overturning the lender's plan to scale back but keep business in the country.

779,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>",Barclays Tries to Outrun an Economic Slowdown,"(Bloomberg Opinion) --  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley clearly thinks his bank's shares are too cheap. But the British lender’s latest results make arguing that case no slam dunk.
Compared with struggling rivals like  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), Barclays is clearly doing a better job of generating acceptable shareholder returns. That, and the promise of buybacks, was enough to push Barclays shares up 4 percent in early trading on Thursday. But there are signs of a turn in the economic cycle that should give investors pause.
First, the good news. For the full-year, return on equity – at 8.5 percent, once you strip out litigation and charges – is creeping toward the lender’s goal of 9 percent to 10 percent. Costs as a proportion of income fell to 66 percent, from 68 percent, again provided you strip out one-time legal costs. The promise of more cost cuts and buybacks are a sign of confidence – even if, on an absolute basis, a return on equity of close to 10 percent is hardly something to shout about.
Staley’s overhaul of Barclays is a story of continual cost savings and operational tweaks, rather than the more radical surgery an activist like Edward Bramson might have in mind. The consumer bank’s strong profitability and asset sales helped to cushion the costs of eliminating jobs and businesses in the corporate and investment bank. With the investment bank focused on more lucrative businesses like leveraged loans and a consumer business ramping up lending, in theory, all Barclays had to do was keep a lid on costs and profitability would follow.
But there are signs that the economic cycle is about to put pressure on this strategy. Barclays is trying to defend market share and margins in the U.K. mortgage market, and has ramped up its loan book accordingly since 2017. But impairment charges are rising in Britain: they hit 296 million pounds ($387 million) in the fourth quarter, the highest level in at least two years. At home, Barclays's return on tangible equity was 9.6 percent in the last quarter of 2018, actually lower than in the year-earlier period.
At the investment bank, a long-running drag on the bank's earnings and a key target for Bramson, the story is still one of managed decline. While revenue in fixed income and equities trading certainly held up better than expected, the market’s unit’s quarterly income of 945 million pounds was still the lowest in at least two years. The division's return on tangible equity was slightly less than zero in the fourth quarter.
Staley's offer of buybacks should be set against the threat of Brexit surprises, too. The bank set has aside 150 million pounds to cover the risks, a reasonable cushion, and is preparing for the worst-case outcome. But the impact on U.K. interest rates – and consequently Barclays’s profitability – of a Brexit-induced recession can’t be ignored.
Barclays shares trade at a roughly 50 percent discount to the book value of the bank’s assets – better than Deutsche Bank, which trades at a 75 percent discount, but worse than large French rivals and other turnaround stories like Switzerland's  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG.
Staley would argue that the British bank is valued too cheaply. But with Brexit looming and an activist circling, he is walking a fine line between confidence and bravado."

Bookmakers lengthened the odds on Juventus progressing to the quarter-finals after two late goals from defenders Jose Gimenez and Diego Godin gave Atletico the advantage ahead of a second-leg clash in Italy on March 12.
The Turin-based side known as “la Vecchia Signora,” or The Old Lady, is now eighth-favorite to win the tournament, according to Bet365, down from fourth favorite on Monday. The bookmaker offers odds on Juventus progressing to the quarterfinals of 16/1, implying a probability of 5.9 percent.
Champions League quarter finalists receive an extra 10.5 million euros ($11.9 million) in prize money, with another 31 million euros potentially at stake if clubs progress further. Success in Europe’s most prestigious tournament also tends to bring greater leverage with sponsors.
The signing of Ronaldo, 34, from Real Madrid last year was a reflection of Juventus’s Champions League ambitions, as well as the obvious commercial benefits, many commentators said at the time. The team reached the final in 2015, but lost to Spain’s FC Barcelona in Berlin.
Even after Thursday’s slump, Juventus is still up about 24 percent since being added to the FTSE MIB benchmark index in December. A deal to sign Arsenal’s Welsh midfielder Aaron Ramsey on a free transfer has also helped lift the stock this year.

782,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 05:33AM ET</span>",Johnson & Johnson receives federal subpoenas related to baby powder litigation,"By Chris Kirkham
(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) said Wednesday it has received subpoenas from the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) related to litigation involving alleged asbestos contamination in its signature Baby Powder product line.
The company said it intends to ""cooperate fully with these inquiries and will continue to defend the Company in the talc-related litigation.""
The disclosure in Johnson & Johnson's annual report on Wednesday is the first time that the company disclosed it had received subpoenas from federal agencies regarding its talc powder products.
The Justice Department declined to comment and the SEC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A Reuters report on Dec. 14 revealed that Johnson & Johnson knew for decades that small amounts of asbestos, a known carcinogen, had been occasionally found in its talc and powder products, according to tests from the 1970s to the early 2000s - information it did not disclose to regulators or the public. 
The Reuters article prompted a selloff in Johnson & Johnson shares, erasing about $40 billion from the company's market value in one day, and a public relations crisis as the healthcare conglomerate faced widespread questions about the possible health effects of one of its most iconic products. 
Johnson & Johnson said that the federal inquiries ""are related to news reports that included inaccurate statements and also withheld crucial information"" that had already been made public.
The company added that ""decades of independent tests by regulators and the world’s leading labs prove Johnson & Johnson’s baby powder is safe and asbestos-free, and does not cause cancer.""
Johnson & Johnson faces lawsuits involving 13,000 plaintiffs who allege use of its talc products, including Baby Powder, caused cancer.

Last month, U.S. Democratic Senator Patty Murray sent a letter to J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky seeking documents and information related to testing of its talc products for the presence of carcinogens and ""how it presented that information to regulators and consumers.""

LONDON (Reuters) -  Barclays  (LON:BARC) reported a lower than forecast attributable profit of 3.5 billion pounds ($4.56 billion) for 2018, as it set aside cash to cushion against Brexit losses and its trading business weathered a difficult fourth quarter.
Barclays did show signs of progress in its under-pressure investment bank, where profit for the full year increased 15 percent to 2.6 billion pounds as its equities trading unit saw income rise 25 percent.
The bank's shares were up 4.3 percent by 0820 GMT.
Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley is locked in a high-profile tussle over the bank's strategy with activist investor Edward Bramson, who believes the lender should ditch a costly plan to grow its investment bank and focus on other less risky parts of its business.
Bramson on Feb. 5 sought to ratchet up pressure on the bank by tabling a resolution that would see him win a board seat, a bid which investors said was unlikely to succeed but which has sharpened focus on the performance of the investment bank.
The results gave ammunition to both sides in the debate. Staley could point to the investment bank's return on tangible equity -- a key measure of profitability -- rising from 2 percent to 7 percent in 2018, close to the overall target of 9 percent for the group in 2019.
The bank's fixed income, currencies and commodities trading business weathered the volatile markets of the fourth quarter better than its Wall Street rivals with revenue down 6 percent compared with double digit falls at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Citi and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). 
For critics of the investment banking-led strategy, however, there were signs that other parts of the lender are suffering as profits fell 3 percent in the Barclays UK division.
The bank also saw a 20 percent decrease in corporate lending income, which it attributed to resources being deployed to higher-returning business elsewhere.
BREXIT DOWNSIDE
Barclays' 150 million pound Brexit provision followed similar moves by HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) in recent days.
Barclays said the provision reflected the lesser of two downside economic scenarios, in which growth would slow to 0.3 percent and the country's unemployment rise to 5.7 percent.
Barclays paid a dividend of 6.5 pence per share and signaled intentions to return more capital via dividend increases and buybacks when it was practical to do so.
The bank however reported its core capital ratio fell to 13.2 percent from 13.3 percent a year ago, a dip which is likely to renew a debate over its ability to return more capital to shareholders at a time when rivals Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) and RBS are ramping up payouts.
Staley's total pay package for 2018 fell to 3.36 million pounds, down from 3.87 million pounds the previous year. He was the lowest paid among the four biggest British bank bosses. 
Including conduct and litigation charges, the bank's profit of 1.4 billion pounds against a 1.9 billion pounds loss in 2017.
Barclays' International division, which houses its investment bank, reported a profit before tax of 3.9 billion pounds, in line with analysts' expectations of 3.95 billion pounds.

LONDON (Reuters) - Signs the United States and China were tackling some of the stickiest issues in their trade war kept world shares near a four-month high on Thursday, though it could not prevent a favorite Chinese proxy, the Aussie dollar, hitting the skids.
A brief rise in the euro [/FRX] and bond yields after some slightly brighter French data and some poor company earnings (EU) made for a low key start for the main FTSE, DAX and CAC 40 bourses. (EU)
Asian trading had been far more eventful though. MSCI's main Asia-Pacific index rose to a 4-1/2 month high after sources told Reuters U.S. and Chinese negotiators were drawing up six ""memorandums of understanding"" to solve their trade feud.
They include forced technology transfer and cyber theft, intellectual property rights, services, currency, agriculture and non-tariff barriers to trade, the sources said, adding the sides were pushing for an agreement by March 1, the deadline after which U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports will ratchet up.
The big mover though was the Aussie dollar.
It slumped more than 1 percent after one of the country's big banks, Westpac, called for two RBA rate cuts this year and Reuters reported that the Chinese port of Dalian had banned imports of Australian coal. Coal is Australia's biggest export earner.
""It is hard know how much of this is in the price considering the fall we saw from the Aussie dollar last year,"" said State Street's EMEA Head of Macro Strategy, Tim Graf.
It is still up this year, however, which means ""there is totally scope for further downside"".
The Aussie was last trading at $0.7105, down 0.8 percent on the day but it was not the only one struggling. The Kiwi dollar got bundled down 0.5 percent and the euro had given back its early gains to stand at $1.1320.
French PMIs had been reassuring but were then followed by news that euro zone factory output had unexpectedly slammed into reverse last month as activity in Europe's manufacturing powerhouse Germany declined again.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite euro zone Purchasing Managers' Index, which is seen as a good guide to economic health, rose to 51.4 this month from a final January reading of 51.0, above a Reuters poll median expectation for 51.1 but still below where it has been for much of the past four years.
""The euro zone economy remained close to stagnation in February. The general picture remained one of a more subdued business environment than seen throughout much of last year,"" Chris Williamson, IHS Markit's chief business economist said.
Williamson said the results pointed to first-quarter euro zone growth of just 0.1 percent, below the latest Reuters poll estimate for 0.4 percent. They come soon after the European Central Bank ended its more than 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase stimulus program. 
FED AFFIRMS ""PATIENT"" STANCE
The slide in the Aussie dollar had helped its share market close at a six-month high. Japan's Nikkei had ended 0.1 percent stronger too and though Chinese shares sagged, the ""offshore"" yuan firmed to its strongest level since July on the trade hopes.
Sterling shrugged off Fitch putting its UK credit rating on a formal downgrade warning amid uncertainty about whether the country's parliament will be able to agree a transition deal before next month's planned Brexit date.
U.S. stock futures were up 0.2 percent after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday affirmed it would be ""patient"" on further interest rate rises and that the economy remained fundamentally strong.
The central bank also signaled it would soon lay out a plan to stop letting go of $4 trillion in bonds and other assets, though policymakers are still debating how long their newly adopted ""patient"" stance on U.S. rates will last.

Investing.com - “Money doesn’t stink,” is one of the oldest principles in business. The first-century Roman emperor Vespasian first coined the phrase to defend raising taxes on the urine extracted from Rome’s sewers.
But the idea that money isn’t tainted by its origins is one that Europe’s banks have taken too closely to heart in the past, and they are suffering for it now in a big way.
Switzerland’s UBS (SIX:UBSG) is down 2% this morning after a French court fined it 4.5 billion euros ($5 billion) for helping its clients avoid taxes, a sum that will swallow around 80% of last year’s pretax profit.
Meanwhile, Sweden’s  Swedbank  (ST:SWEDa) is down another 8.2% - after losing 15% on Wednesday on allegations linking it to Danske Bank's (CO:DANSKE) funnelling of illicit funds out of the former Soviet Union. Broadcaster SVT said the bank was linked to $5.8 billion of questionable transactions, including some linked to the case involving Sergey Magnitsky, the lawyer who died in prison after helping to expose money-laundering by Russian officials.
Swedbank’s Scandinavian rival Nordea (HE:NDAFI) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) are also under pressure. Arguably the only thing that smells worse this morning is the lingering whiff of Juventus' (MI:JUVE) defending in the Champions League defeat in Madrid last night. Its shares are down 8%.
Despite all that, the Stoxx 600 index was down only 0.2% at 370.80 by 05:00 AM ET (1000 GMT). That’s because flash readings of IHS Markit’s purchasing managers indexes suggest the euro zone economy may be bottoming out in February – even if it’s still on course for only 0.1% growth in the first quarter.
Swedbank's CEO Birgitte Bonnesen acknowledged ""there is a risk"" that some payments could have gone unnoticed by its internal controls, but said she ""does not recognize"" the scale of the payments alleged by SVT. UBS meanwhile has said it will appeal the French fine. But it will be some time before any of the banks involved can hope to draw a line under the affairs.
Of course, when they finally do, they’ll find shareholders are a forgiving bunch after all. The U.K.’s  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) is up 0.2% Thursday morning after setting aside ‘only’ $900 million to settle allegations of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran and manipulating foreign exchange rates."

""If you exclude a market leader, and Huawei is a market leader in new technology, and knowing that you have almost all operators having Huawei equipment, this will bring some difficulties, this is clear. This could end up in a delay,"" Andreas Maierhofer, CEO of T-Mobile Polska, told a news conference. 

The Polish government is considering excluding Huawei equipment from its future 5G network over concerns first raised in the United States that Huawei technology could be equipped with back doors to allow access by the Chinese government, sources told Reuters in January.

Danske is being investigated in five countries over some 200 billion euros ($226 billion) of suspicious payments from Russia, ex-Soviet states and elsewhere that were found to have flowed through its Estonian branch.
Swedish TV said on Wednesday that documents showed at least 40 billion Swedish crowns ($4.30 billion) had been transferred between accounts at Swedbank and Danske in the Baltics between 2007 and 2015, prompting Estonia to investigate the allegations.
Analysts said that one of the biggest risks that Swedbank faced was that Bill Browder, once the biggest foreign money managers in Russia who is now campaigning to expose corruption, might file a criminal complaint as he had in Danske's case.
Browder has, through his firm Hermitage Capital Management, sent information to and pushed various government authorities to bring money laundering cases against Danske and has even lodged accusations against Swedbank rival Nordea.
""We see the prospect of a criminal lawsuit from Bill Browder and any potential U.S. investigation as the price-sensitive issues,"" Jefferies analysts said in a client note.
Swedbank CEO Birgitte Bonnesen told analysts late on Wednesday that Browder had told her that he would not be filing a lawsuit. Browder, however, was quoted by Bloomberg shortly after as saying that he could not rule out making a formal complaint against Swedbank.
Swedbank shares were down 7.2 percent at 169 Swedish crowns at 0823 GMT on Thursday, while Nordic peers SEB and Handelsbanken were down 2.3 percent and 0.05 percent. Nordea's stock was down about 2 percent as well.
On Wednesday, the Swedbank stock shed almost 14 percent, the heaviest daily fall for the shares since the financial crisis. 
Bonnesen also said she was comfortable with the safeguarding systems that had been in place throughout the years and Swedbank had reported any suspicious transactions it caught, but could not offer assurances that it had not missed any.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said Swedbank's answers to queries about the report revealed little new reassuring information. 

""As such we do not see sufficient reassurance to drive an immediate recovery in the shares,"" the analysts said in a note.

Moeller-Maersk fell 8.7 percent after meeting fourth-quarter expectations, while TechnipFMC also tumbled more than 7 percent as the oil services company posted a fourth quarter loss.
Prysmian was another heavy faller, down 9 percent, after the Italian cable maker said a system failure was detected in its Westernlink Interconnection.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) rose 4 percent. Even though the UK bank reported a lower than forecast attributable profit, it did show signs of progress in its under-pressure investment bank, where profit for the full year increased as its equities trading unit saw income rise 25 percent.

791,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 03:29AM ET</span>",Remain or leave? Carmakers confront hard Brexit choices,"By Costas Pitas and Joseph White
ST ATHAN, Wales/GAYDON, England (Reuters) - In three cavernous former Royal Air Force hangars at an old airbase in Wales, luxury carmaker Aston Martin is forging ahead with construction of a new vehicle assembly plant.
The paint shop is in, robots are being unpacked, and production of the company's critical new sport utility vehicle is on track to start this year – Brexit deal or no deal.
""I still have to believe that we'll get to a proper and right decision because a no-deal Brexit is frankly madness,"" Aston Martin CEO Andy Palmer told Reuters at the company's Gaydon headquarters in England, where designers are working on a diverse lineup of vehicles for the 2020s and beyond.
Headlines have focused on plant closures and job losses ahead of Britain's divorce from the EU.
Nissan has scrapped plans to build its new X-Trail SUV in the country, while Honda will close its only UK car plant in 2021 with the loss of up to 3,500 jobs - though it said the decision was not related to Britain's exit from the EU.
However many auto companies - from luxury marques like Aston Martin to mass-market brands such as Vauxhall - are working on ways to survive after March 29.
On the outskirts of London, workers at Vauxhall's operation in Luton are preparing to produce a new line of commercial vans following fresh investment from the brand's owner PSA which they are counting on to sustain over 1,000 jobs.
While post-Brexit market conditions remain a big unknown, Vauxhall boss Stephen Norman told Reuters Britain's exit from the European Union could present an opportunity to increase the brand's market share. He is pursuing a marketing campaign to boost demand for the company's modestly priced cars and SUVs.
The continued investment by some carmakers and the potential sales upside seen by Vauxhall reflect the conflicting decisions and opportunities that brands face depending on their size, their customers and where they are in the production cycle.
All automakers in Britain will anyway have to find ways make Brexit work, even if only in the short term. 
Nissan builds nearly 450,000 cars and multiple models, making it hard to pull out of the country any time soon. Toyota builds just one model in Britain, the Corolla, but has only just started making it - in an industry where vehicles tend to have a seven-year production life cycle.
RACKS OF DASHBOARDS
Aston Martin and Vauxhall are as different as two auto companies can be. Now Brexit has thrown Palmer and Norman into the same precarious boat as, like their rivals, they seek to minimize the potential harm of a disorderly British exit.
The two companies have significant British manufacturing operations and together have thousands of employees in the country. Palmer and Norman both said in interviews that the impact of Brexit would be more complicated, more pervasive and take longer to play out than policymakers and the public appreciated.
For Aston Martin, which sells sports cars at prices well above 100,000 pounds ($130,380), new European tariffs on British-built cars are not a significant concern, Palmer said.
Like other smaller players such as Bentley, Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) and McLaren, Aston has much larger margins on its cars and extra costs can be more easily passed onto wealthy customers. That's not a luxury enjoyed by mass-market players.
What concerns Palmer more is the disruption to his company's network of suppliers and its meticulously scheduled production system.
As he walks through Aston's Gaydon factory, Palmer points to several rows of dashboards mounted on carriers and crowded into a corner of the plant.
Aston is building stockpiles of key parts in case an abrupt, no-deal Brexit results in trucks with components getting delayed by chaos at British ports. It is increasing the days of stock it holds from three days to five days and could fly in parts if ports become clogged up after March 29.
Aston receives many of its engines from a Mercedes-Benz factory in Germany, and new border checks and tariffs could delay those shipments.
Reverting to a regime of cross-border tariffs and World Trade Organization rules, after decades of free trade, would force Aston and its suppliers to trace and document where all the parts in a vehicle come from, Palmer told Reuters.
""When you've got 10,000 parts on a car and then you've got all of the sub-parts and the sub-parts, you quickly get up to hundreds of thousands of parts. And do you honestly know where they've all come from? Often not,"" he said.
That's one reason why Palmer said he hired a supply chain chief, an appointment announced last month. ""His obsession right now is planning for Brexit,"" he said.
The Brexit vote in mid-2016 came as Aston Martin was pursuing a multi-year strategy, unveiled in 2015, to go from making about 3,500 sports cars a year to building up to 14,000 sports cars and SUVs annually.
The St Athan plant will start building DBX SUVs, and then is expected to begin assembling a new line luxury electric vehicles under the Lagonda brand early in the 2020s.
Scrapping that investment is not Aston's plan.
""People have asked me: what keeps you awake?"" Palmer said. ""It very much is the supply chain and the capability of that supply chain to absorb all the macroeconomics that are thrown at them.""
Aston is not alone in this concern: Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), the biggest car seller in Britain, and Honda have both said they are stockpiling parts while Jaguar Land Rover has been talking to warehousing companies and Bentley has leased storage space.
IN CHAOS, OPPORTUNITY?
At Vauxhall, boss Norman said Brexit could be an opportunity for a brand that struggled under its former owner, U.S. automaker General Motors (NYSE:GM), and is charting a new strategy under French group PSA.
Vauxhall believes a no-deal Brexit would lead to as much as a 20 percent fall in British new vehicle demand but a bigger market share for Vauxhall.
PSA has committed last year to fresh investment to launch new models at its Luton van factory. But it faces a decision next year on whether to keep Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port plant open after the current run of Astra Sports Tourer ends.
That decision is not a simple one, Norman said.
""It would not be true to say that a hard Brexit automatically means the closure of plants in the United Kingdom, neither for us, nor for other manufacturers, but it would certainly mean they come under greater scrutiny,"" he said.
British workers would have to deliver productivity gains that offset tariffs and supply chain friction.
Currently Vauxhall, which was bought by Peugeot parent company PSA in 2017, accounts for 7.5 percent of British car sales.
Added to the group's Peugeot, Citroen and DS brands the total rises to 13 percent, making PSA one of the biggest sellers in Europe's No.2 auto market.
If the market takes a hit, Vauxhall's emphasis on functional, economically priced models could be an advantage, Norman said.
""People will look very long and hard,"" he said. ""And they will say: do I need this enhanced brand strength which I'm actually paying for that has no material value or should I not look more seriously at the offer from Vauxhall ... and have just as good a vehicle and not have to pay through the nose for the privilege.""

SINGAPORE/DUBAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco plans to sign preliminary deals to invest in two oil refining and petrochemical complexes in China during the Saudi Arabian crown prince's visit this week, sources familiar with the plans said, as Beijing seeks expanded ties with Riyadh.
The Saudi delegation, including top executives from Aramco, arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a two-day visit, part of the crown prince's Asia tour, during which the kingdom has pledged $20 billion of investment in Pakistan and sought additional investment in India's refining industry.
Mohammed bin Salman will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has made stepping up China's presence in the Middle East a key foreign policy objective, despite its traditional low-key role there. China has given few details about the visit.
Saudi Aramco, the world's top oil exporter, will sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to build a refinery and petrochemical project in the northeastern Chinese province of Liaoning in a joint venture with China's defense conglomerate Norinco, said three sources with knowledge of the matter.
Aramco is also expected to formalize an earlier plan to take a minority stake in Zhejiang Petrochemical, controlled by private Chinese chemical group Zhejiang Rongsheng Holding Group, said two sources with knowledge of this particular deal. Zhejiang Petrochemical is building a refinery and petrochemical complex in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang.
The investments could help Saudi Arabia regain its place as the top oil exporter to China, which it has relinquished to Russia for the past three years. Saudi Aramco is poised to bolster its market share by signing supply agreements with non-state Chinese refiners. 
BUILDING BLOCK
It is not clear what new details will be in the MOU with Norinco expected during the visit, as the two companies first announced an alliance in May 2017 during Saudi ruler King Salman's visit to Beijing.
Under that earlier MOU, the companies agreed to build a refinery capable of processing 300,000 barrels per day of crude and a facility that would make 1 million tonnes per year of ethylene, a building block for petrochemicals, at an estimated cost of over $10 billion. 
A senior Aramco executive said last June that he expected the front-end engineering for the Norinco project to be finished by mid-2019, following which the company will take a final investment decision.
Norinco public affairs officials were not immediately available for a comment. 
Aramco officials did not reply to a request for comment sent by email. 
All the sources declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Meanwhile, the Zhejiang agreement would give Saudi Aramco control of the 9-percent stake in the project held by the Zhejiang provincial government. 
The agreement follows an earlier MOU that Aramco signed in October to invest in Zhejiang's project, which is planned as a refinery to process 400,000 bpd of crude and associated petrochemical facilities in the city of Zhoushan, south of Shanghai. 
Reuters was not able to immediately reach Zhoushan Ocean Development and Investment Co Ltd, which holds the 9-percent stake in Zhejiang Petrochemical for the provincial government, for a comment.
China has had to step carefully in its relations with Riyadh due to Beijing also having close ties with Saudi's regional foe Iran.

On Wednesday, the day before the crown prince arrives, Xi told the speaker of Iran's parliament that China's desire to develop close ties with Iran will remain unchanged, regardless of the international situation.

The allocation is in line with the company's plans to invest 600 billion yen ($5.4 billion) in imaging sensors over the three years through March 2021, or half of the group's planned capital expenditures.
Sony controls more than half of the imaging sensor market for smartphones, and the sensor business was a key driver of a turnaround for the conglomerate which in its heyday led the world in consumer gadgets.
Investors are looking for the next profit pillar as Sony's gaming business shows signs of slowing, with its popular PlayStation 4 (PS4) console nearing the end of its lifecycle.
But the company cut its annual profit outlook for imaging sensors this month to 130 billion yen, accounting for just 15 percent of the group's overall profit, due to weakening global demand for smartphones.
Sony plans to hire 320 new engineers annually in Japan this year and the next, up from 250 in 2018. The figures do not include those to be hired by overseas units.
Chipmakers have mostly maintained their long-term investment plans as they look to new technology such as fifth-generation (5G) communication networks and artificial intelligence to fuel growth in the industry.
SK Hynix Inc on Thursday said it would spend $107 billion building four memory chip factories in South Korea beginning 2022.

795,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 01:52AM ET</span>","Exclusive: SpaceX, Boeing design risks threaten new delays for U.S. space program","By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - NASA has warned SpaceX and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co of design and safety concerns for their competing astronaut launch systems, according to industry sources and a new government report, threatening the U.S. bid to revive its human spaceflight program later this year. 
NASA is paying SpaceX $2.6 billion and Boeing $4.2 billion to build rocket and capsule launch systems to return astronauts to the International Space Station from U.S. soil for the first time since America's Space Shuttle program went dark in 2011.
Just ahead of the first scheduled un-manned test flight slated for March 2 under NASA's multibillion-dollar Commercial Crew Program, NASA's safety advisory panel cited four ""key risk items"" in its 2018 annual report earlier this month.
For Boeing, they include the capsule's structural vulnerability when the heat shield is deployed. For SpaceX, the report mentioned the redesign of a SpaceX rocket canister following a 2016 explosion and its ""load and go"" process of fueling the rocket with the crew already inside the capsule. ""Parachute performance"" remained an issue for both companies. 
""There are serious challenges to the current launch schedules for both SpaceX and Boeing,"" the report said. 
For an interactive version of this story, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2V6pXyN
Two people with direct knowledge of the program told Reuters that the space agency's concerns go beyond the four items listed, and include a risk ledger that as of early February contained 30 to 35 lingering technical concerns each for SpaceX and Boeing. Reuters could not verify what all of the nearly three dozen items are. But the sources familiar with the matter said the companies must address ""most"" of those concerns before flying astronauts and, eventually, tourists to space. 
The NASA risk database is updated routinely during the course of NASA's stringent certification process, which includes data collection, tests and collaboration with SpaceX and Boeing, the people said. The Boeing and SpaceX systems have already been delayed several times in recent years, which is common in this sector given the complexity of building multibillion-dollar spacecraft capable of shedding earth's gravity. 
NASA spokesman Joshua Finch deferred all technical questions on Boeing and SpaceX systems to the companies, citing confidentiality, but said: ""Flying safely always takes precedence over schedule.""
Boeing spokesman Josh Barrett said the company ""closed out"" the capsule's structural vulnerability risk when it completed its structural test program in January. While Boeing is working through a number of other issues, they ""are not driving any major architectural system changes."" 
""Our numbers show we are exceeding NASA's safety requirements,"" said Barrett.
SpaceX spokesman James Gleeson said the company, working with NASA, has developed ""one of the safest, most-advanced human spaceflight systems ever built.""
""There is nothing more important to SpaceX than safely flying crew,"" said Gleeson, calling it ""core to our company's long-term goal of enabling access for people who dream of flying to space."" 
Founded by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk, SpaceX has cut the cost of rocket launches with its pioneering reusable rocket technology, while Boeing traces its space business back to the first U.S. human space missions of the 1960s and is also the world's largest planemaker.
The clock is ticking. The U.S. has been paying Russia about $80 million per ticket for a ride to the International Space Station, a $100 billion orbital research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (402 km) above Earth. 
There are no seats available for U.S. crew on the Russia spacecraft after 2019 given production schedules and other factors. NASA said last week it was considering paying for two more seats to the space station for this fall and spring 2020 to ensure U.S. access.
The NASA plan for extra seats came a week after its safety panel said Congress should come up with a ""mitigation plan"" in case delays threaten U.S. access to the space station - echoing earlier concerns from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. 
NASA is set to conduct a flight readiness review on Friday for SpaceX's mission without a crew on March 2. NASA will decide whether to approve the test flight without a crew, while SpaceX addresses the issues raised for a human mission. 
PARACHUTE WEAKNESSES
Three people familiar with the project say the U.S. space agency has identified some design discrepancies between earlier SpaceX capsules designed to haul cargo to the International Space Station, and a newer version designed to carry humans. 
Some of the risks - such as those identified in the designs of the enormous parachutes that deploy when the capsule plummets back to Earth at supersonic speeds - are uncommon given how close SpaceX is to test flights, two of the people said.
The timing of deployment of the SpaceX parachutes and the interaction of the parachutes themselves have raised concerns about parachute performance, and potentially whether they will be able to slow down the capsule enough to ensure the crew's safety, two people said. 
SpaceX has completed 17 parachute tests for the Commercial Crew Program so far, with an additional 10 tests planned prior to Crew Dragon's second demonstration mission, Gleeson said. He also said its parachute systems are designed with redundancy so the vehicle can still safely splashdown in the event that one parachute fails.
NASA's safety panel said in its report that SpaceX may be required to re-design its parachute system. A re-design would likely trigger more testing and potentially weeks or months of extra delays, two of the people said.
NASA also found design problems with the system that helps orient SpaceX's capsule in an upright position once it lands in the ocean, raising the risk of taking on excessive amounts of water, according to two industry sources and confirmed by a NASA official.
SpaceX's Gleeson said Crew Dragon's outer shell is water-resistant, and the spacecraft itself is buoyant and does not pose a risk to crew members after splashdown.
RISK OF MORE DELAYS
NASA announced earlier this month that SpaceX was now targeting March 2 instead of Feb. 23 for its un-crewed Crew Dragon test flight, with its astronaut flight planned for July. NASA explained the delay by citing vague concerns for both contractors, such as the need to complete hardware testing and other work. 
NASA said Boeing's un-crewed Starliner would fly ""no earlier"" than April, with the crewed mission currently slated for August. This is the schedule now at risk, according to the NASA report. 
The challenges in front of Boeing include last year's failure during a test of its launch-abort engines, which spilled caustic fuel on the test stand, Boeing's Barrett said. The accident was caused by faulty valves which Boeing has re-designed and re-ordered from the supplier, though the new valves must be re-tested, Barrett said. 
The test flights are also part of collecting the data needed to close out some risk items, NASA said.

""SpaceX and Boeing both have challenges, both comparable, from a safety perspective,"" said one U.S. government source.

796,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 01:16AM ET</span>",SK Hynix plans to spend $107 billion building four memory chip plants,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's SK Hynix Inc on Thursday said it would spend $107 billion building four factories, as the memory chip maker seeks to maintain its competitiveness in the face of Chinese efforts to become a leading chipmaking nation.
The chip fabrication plants will be built on a 4.5 million square meter site south of Seoul beginning 2022, complementing two existing domestic factories that will receive a separate 55 trillion won ($49 billion) investment over the next decade.
The plans for the factories, producing DRAM and next-generation chips, come as chipmakers prepare for a surge in demand to power new technology such as fifth-generation (5G) communication networks and artificial intelligence, even as a slowdown in smartphone sales kills off a two-year chip boom.
""Though there is not enough chip demand for autonomous cars now, I believe there will be much more demand for self-driving vehicles in the next 10 years or as early as in 2023 or 2024,"" said analyst Kim Young-gun at Mirae Asset Daewoo.
""That will create more chip demand for SK Hynix,"" as will the commercialization of 5G networks over the next few years, Kim said.
The plan also intensifies an arms race between South Korea, the world's biggest exporter of memory chips, and China, which has been aggressively encouraging chipmaking investment to curb reliance on imports amid a trade spat with the United States.
China is the world's largest chip consumer, importing $270 billion worth in 2017 - more than its total imports of crude oil.
SK Hynix said the investment plan, subject to approval from local authorities, will see over 50 domestic and foreign suppliers join at the site in Yongin, 40 km from the capital.
The chipmaker, which has a third plant in the Chinese city of Wuxi, said it had not yet determined the increase in production capacity.
""It is indeed a long-term investment plan and our strategy may change depending on market conditions,"" spokeswoman Olivia Lee told Reuters.
Shares in SK Hynix were up 1.5 percent, while those of domestic peer Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd - which announced a new smartphone late on Wednesday - were almost flat.
SK Hynix was a member of a consortium led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital which bought the majority of Toshiba Corp's memory chip business last year. On Wednesday, people familiar with the matter told Reuters Bain had chosen banks to manage an initial public offering of Toshiba Memory as early as September.

798,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 12:50AM ET</span>",Asia's Tumbling Exports Signal Trade Pain Has Room to Run,"(Bloomberg) -- Key Asian exporters Singapore, Japan and South Korea provided fresh evidence this week that the slump in global trade has further to run, and is beginning to spread to factories.
South Korea’s exports tumbled by 12 percent during the first 20 days of February, data released Thursday showed. A day earlier Japan reported that exports fell 8.4 percent in January from a year earlier, the first back-to-back fall since 2016. Singapore started the week by reporting January exports fell the most in more than two years.
“We’re looking at a decidedly ugly Q1 2019 external demand picture for the region and that is especially bad news for export-dependent countries in Asia,” said Trinh Nguyen, senior economist at Natixis Asia Ltd.
One common denominator: falling shipments to China as that nation’s cooling economy, the U.S.-China trade war, and a slowing of the global technology cycle all take a toll on key Asian economies.
Japan’s exports to China dropped 17 percent in January, while Korea’s fell 14 percent in the first 20 days of February. Shipments to China were likely distorted somewhat by the Lunar New Year holiday, but the slumps are in line with the longer-term trend.
Economists already had been eyeing the end of “front-loading” -- businesses boosting orders ahead of threatened higher tariffs. And broader signs of a global growth slowdown -- including at factories and in overall growth figures -- corroborate the weakness in exports.
The slowing of trade is hurting Japan’s factory sector, with manufacturing activity contracting this month for the first time in two and a half years, according to preliminary data released Thursday. Net exports were already a drag on gross domestic product growth during the fourth quarter, according to data released last week.
The end of an electronics super-cycle is hitting key suppliers. South Korea’s exports of semiconductors, a key driver of growth, fell 27 percent in the first 20 days of February.
Korean exports are likely to drop further in the second quarter as chip prices continue to slide, said Stephen Lee, an economist at Meritz Securities Co. in Seoul. Korean exports fell 5.8 percent in the full month of January.
Taiwan Next
Trade talks between the U.S. and China are continuing in Washington and are scheduled to run through Friday.
While the slowdown in China is expected to deepen in the first quarter, analysts are seeing signs of stabilization after that as government support measures kick in.
For now, trade data in Asia will get the final test of this week when Taiwan reports on Friday. Economists are projecting a third straight year-on-year drop in shipments, which would mark the worst losing streak since mid-2016.

799,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 21, 2019 12:30AM ET</span>","Samsung's $2,000 Galaxy Fold Sparks Mixed Comments","(Bloomberg) -- This year’s rally in shares of Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. paused following the highly anticipated debut of its $1,980 foldable Galaxy handset.
The world’s largest smartphone maker’s stock was little changed Thursday amid mixed comments from analysts and Twitter observers regarding the Galaxy Fold’s high price tag, functionality and sales prospects. Samsung is still up more than 20 percent in 2019, rebounding from a drop of over 20 percent last year.
“The phone seems to be pretty good, in terms of price and design, as I thought it would be $3,000,” said Park Sung-shin, fund manager at KTB Asset Management. “Shares of Samsung and its suppliers are falling just for profit-taking after the event.”
Suppliers’ shares were mixed, with Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co. and Partron Co. declining as much as about 3 percent while Power Logics Co. and Elk Corp. each surged at least 5 percent. The standout was Finetek Co., which jumped more than 20 percent for a second-straight day in Seoul. Finetek was the first South Korean company to develop equipment for “bonding” components in flexible screens, according to a spokesman.
The Fold’s technology is impressive enough that Samsung Display targets sales of flexible-screen panels to clients in China, though it may wait about a year or so in order to prevent rival smartphones from catching up with its parent’s flagship product too quickly, Samsung Securities said in a report.
“While shipment volume in absolute terms is not significant, we believe that its role as a pioneer in changing smartphone form factors is noteworthy,” Peter Lee, an analyst at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets Inc. wrote in a note. Citi estimates Samsung will ship 1 million foldable phones this year, with total shipments for its new GS10 line of devices reaching 37 million compared with about 40 million “historically” for a smartphone series.
“It’s an important step in opening the market of foldable phones,” Lee Dongju, an analyst at KTB Investment, wrote in a note. “The debut is meaningful in itself.”

Citing sources familiar with the negotiations, Reuters reported that “the broad outline of what could make up a deal is beginning to emerge from the talks.” However, sources said China has not yet met the demands requested by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on issues related to structural changes to China’s economy.
They also added that officials from both sides are drawing up six memorandums of understanding on structural issues that include forced technology transfers and non-tariff barriers to trade.
Despite the positive development, one of the sources warned that the talks could still end in failure.
The U.S. and China are hoping to reach an agreement by a March 1 deadline. Trump has said he would increase the tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10% if the deadline passes without a deal.

803,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 07:41PM ET</span>",UK investor body to apply red warning if a company's board lacks women,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's top companies face a red warning if they don't have more than one woman on their board, the Investment Association said on Thursday, adding to pressure for more female representation at top levels of management.
The body which represents big asset managers said it was expanding its traffic light system which guides big investors on whether a company is complying with best practice in areas of governance such as executive pay.
The IA said it would apply a red alert to a top 350 listed company if there are none or only one woman on the board
Ratings on all aspects of a company's governance are done three weeks before its annual shareholders' meeting. Currently there are no red tops related to the number of women on boards, but some are expected, an IA spokesman said, without giving any further detail.
A red top represents the highest level of warning and is reserved for companies where shareholders should have the most serious concerns, the IA said, though it has no formal power over how investors vote on company policies.
An amber top would be applied where there is more than one woman, but less than 25 percent of the board are women.
Repeated calls for more women on boards have been made in recent years and in 2011 for instance a government report said companies in the FTSE 100 should aim for at least 25 percent female board member representation by 2015, yet progress has been slow. 
At the highest chief executive level a study released in 2018 on International Women's Day found women CEOs in the FTSE 100 were outnumbered by chiefs called David.
The IA also said it was making its grading of company pension arrangements for executives more stringent.
A company will be ""red topped"" if it does not explicitly state that any new executive director will have their pension contributions set in line with the majority of the workforce.

The aim is to stop pensions being used as a mechanism for increasing total pay.

(Reuters) - U.S. health spending is expected to grow at an average rate of 5.5 percent every year from 2018 over the next decade and will reach nearly $6 trillion by 2027 as more people become eligible for Medicare, a government health agency said on Wednesday.
Rising income levels, better employment rate and more people enrolling for Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people aged 65 and above and the disabled, will cause healthcare spending to rise to 19.4 percent of the U.S. economy by 2027, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) said. 
In 2017, healthcare spending accounted for 17.9 percent of the country's gross domestic product. 
Annual spending growth for Medicare is expected to average 7.4 percent over the 10-year period, CMS said.
That number exceeds spending projections for Medicaid -- the government insurance program for low income Americans -- and private health insurance plans, which are expected to average 5.5 percent and 4.8 percent respectively, over the same period.
The CMS said it expects Medicare enrollment growth to peak at 2.9 percent in 2019. 
Prescription drug spending is also expected to rise and average 5.6 percent annually between 2018 and 2027 as employers and insurers push patients with chronic conditions to adhere to medications better, and as new and expensive drugs enter the market.
Hospital spending growth is projected to average 5.6 percent per year between 2018 and 2027.
By 2027, federal, state and local governments are expected to fund 47 percent of national health spending, compared with 45 percent in 2017, according to the report.

The CMS said that all projections are reflective of current laws and do not take into account policy changes under consideration.

808,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 05:20PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Housing Demands Attention
The first real numbers about the U.S. housing market will come from the National Association of Realtors tomorrow, which will release its report on January existing home sales at 10 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
Forecasts compiled by Investing.com expect the report to show sales running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.01 million units, up 0.4% from December. The sales rate hit a rate of 5.87 million units in December 2017 and has moved lower.
One reason for the slide was higher mortgage rates in 2018. A bigger reason was pure affordability, a subject of some discussion at the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Seattle, one of the hottest markets in 2017 and into 2018, suddenly saw sales and prices fall in the latter half of 2018. Sales cooled off in a large number of other markets as well.
Online real-estate brokerage Zillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG) will doubtless have comments on the question when it reports fourth-quarter results  after Thursday's close. Analysts polled by Investing.com are expecting earnings of 2 cents a share on revenue of $351.2 million. A year ago, Zillow reported a loss of 53 cents on revenue of $282.3 million. Shares are up 10.5% this year after falling 23.3% in 2018.
Next Tuesday, the Census Bureau will report on housing starts and building permits for December. Construction on new residential homes (starts) is expected to dip to an annual rate of 1.245 million, while permits are forecast to drop to 1.28 million.
At 8:30 AM ET, the government will report the delayed December durable goods orders. Economists are predicting a rise of 0.8% for the month, with a core durable goods orders rise of 0.2%.
2. Crude Stockpiles Seen up 3 Million
The weekly oil inventories data arrive tomorrow, a day later than usual because of Monday’s Washington’s Birthday holiday.
The Energy Information Administration will report on U.S. inventories of crude, gasoline and distillates at 11:00 AM ET (16:00 GMT).
The market is looking for crude oil stockpiles to have risen by a little more than 3 million barrels for the most recent week, according to analysts’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Oil prices are facing a tug-of-war of late as OPEC and OPEC-plus members continue to pledge cuts in supply, but expectations for more U.S. output from shale rise.
""(O)ur forecast of more subdued growth in demand in the coming months, coupled with persistently strong U.S. output, suggests that prices will fall back,"" Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics, said.
The April West Texas Intermediate contract settled at $57.16 a barrel, up 71 cents.
3. Initial Jobless Claims Expected to Dip
The Labor Department will issue its weekly report on  initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET (13:30 GMT) The consensus estimate for the week ended Feb. 16, compiled by Investing.com, is for 220,000 new claims, down from 239,000 a week earlier.
An upside number would surprise financial markets but confirm the Federal Reserve's decision in January to leave interest rates steady for the time time being.
Jobless claims have ranged from just under 200,000 a week to 260,000 since the end of 2017. That's a far cry from recession-bound 2009 when claims approached 700,000. They've been shrinking steadily ever since."
809,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 05:16PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Lyft plans to launch its IPO roadshow week of March 18 - sources,"By Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Lyft Inc plans to launch the roadshow for its initial public offering during the week of March 18, making it the first U.S. ride-hailing company to debut in the stock market, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
Lyft's larger rival Uber Technologies Inc still needs several more weeks for its IPO preparations, the sources said, putting it behind Lyft. The two IPOs' being far apart could allow Lyft to pitch investors without fretting about being overshadowed by Uber. 
Lyft now expects to be valued at between $20 billion and $25 billion in its IPO, the sources said, adding that the roadshow is expected to last about two weeks. The sources cautioned that the plans were still subject to change and market conditions. 
Both Lyft and Uber declined to comment.
Uber has received estimates from IPO bankers that have pegged its value at up to $120 billion, sources have said. If Lyft gets to list first, it would avoid being judged by the valuation metrics that will be applied to Uber, which remains the undisputed king of ride-hailing in terms of size. 
Uber operates in about 70 countries and also has businesses in freight hauling, autonomous driving, food delivery, air taxis and artificial intelligence research. In contrast, Lyft is available only in the United States and Canada and has stayed tightly focused on its core ride-hailing service. 
Lyft has benefited from a spate of scandals that rocked Uber in 2017, including allegations of sexual harassment made by its female employees, the forced resignation of its chief executive officer and its use of illicit software to deceive regulators. 
A #DeleteUber campaign surged on social media. The negative publicity helped Lyft attract new drivers and riders without spending much on marketing.
Uber's full-year revenue for 2018 was $11.3 billion, up 43 percent from the prior year. Its losses before taxes, depreciation and other expenses were $1.8 billion, an improvement over the $2.2 billion loss posted in 2017. 

Given that both Uber and Lyft are still losing money, investors will be focused on their growth and potential for future profitability. Lyft has prepared some earnings metrics it hopes will persuade investors that it will not be in the red for long, Reuters reported last week.

810,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 04:57PM ET</span>",Trump-California rift widens as auto emissions talks fail,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. federal officials have decided to end negotiations with California over the Trump administration's plans to roll back fuel economy rules designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a government official said on Wednesday.
California and 19 other states have demanded the Trump administration abandon a proposal made in August to freeze fuel efficiency standards after 2020 and strip California of the ability to impose stricter rules.
Aside from the threat of increased pollution, Detroit automakers have the greatest financial interests at stake. 
General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles generate most of their global profits from sales of fuel-thirsty large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in the United States. All three have discontinued or planned to drop small and medium-sized sedans from their lineups to focus on trucks and SUVs.
The rules to require automakers to roughly double average fuel efficiency by 2025 – with a corresponding decline in carbon dioxide emissions – were one of the Obama administration’s most significant climate policy actions. 
Since taking office, Trump has worked to roll back a broad range of Obama environmental policies that were opposed by the oil and coal industries. 
As the 2020 election cycle heats up, the fight over automotive emissions promises to be a dividing line between Trump and Democrats, many of whom are embracing a platform of aggressive action to curb climate emissions in what they call the Green New Deal.
Scrapping the talks also comes as power struggle between California and Trump grows. The Trump administration on Tuesday canceled $929 million in federal funds for a California high-speed rail project. California's governor quickly linked that move to California leading a 16 state coalition challenging Trump's national emergency to obtain funds for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. 
The California Air Resources Board (CARB), California’s top clean air regulator, has been meeting with officials from the White House, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation Department over Trump administration efforts to stop California from tightening vehicle emissions rules in the state.
The government official offered no further details on the end of the talks and it was not immediately clear when an announcement would be made.
California officials already have filed suit to block the Trump administration proposal to roll back federal fuel economy targets for 2022-2025. It is not clear how the industry would respond to the formal adoption of Trump’s proposed freeze, and likely litigation by California and other states.
CARB Chair Mary Nichols last year said the state was willing to give automakers more flexibility to comply with vehicle greenhouse gas limits. 
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler and Nichols met two weeks ago in San Francisco but there were no substantive discussions, said CARB spokesman Stanley Young. 
""The administration broke off communications before Christmas and never responded to our suggested areas of compromise -- or offered any compromise proposal at all. We concluded at that point that they were never serious about negotiating,"" Young said.
A source familiar with those discussions said EPA officials did not work on the rule during the government shutdown. ""There was no real effort to get to yes,"" the source said.
Trump's EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed a rule in August that would maintain emissions standards at 2020 levels rather than requiring that they improve.
Scientists have linked rising fossil fuel emissions to higher temperatures that have worsened drought conditions in California blamed for devastating fires. 
California officials and environmental groups have said the Trump administration proposal would deal a blow to efforts to contain that damage.
 Ford Motor Co  on Wednesday said it was ""disappointed"" in reports the talks had fallen apart. ""The auto industry needs regulatory certainty, not protracted litigation,"" Joe Hinrichs, Ford’s president of global operations said in a statement. 
Fiat Chrysler declined comment. General Motors and the Alliance for Automobile Manufacturers did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
Trump's proposed freeze would result in 500,000 barrels per day more oil consumption by the 2030s. The administration says it would reduce regulatory costs for automakers by more than $300 billion over the next decade.
The administration was supposed to finalize the new rules by the end of March in order for the softer requirements to take effect by the 2021 model year, but some automakers and officials have questioned if it will meet that deadline.

Most automakers oppose freezing the requirements but also want relief from standards approved during the Obama administration that called for a roughly 5 percent annual reduction in carbon emissions - targets that translate to fuel efficiency requirements for various classes of vehicles.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht SA next week will ask its bondholders to accept losses of more than 70 percent from their bonds' face value as part of a restructuring, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.
Around $3 billion in outstanding Odebrecht Finance Ltd bonds will be affected, the sources added, asking for anonymity to disclose private plans. 
The exact size of the haircut is still undefined, but the person said it could be between 70 percent and 80 percent of the bonds' value.
The restructuring proposal, which will also include a grace period for payments and extension of maturities on the bonds, will be presented by Odebrecht's advisers, U.S. investment bank Moelis & Co and law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, in a meeting in New York next week.
Moelis and Cleary Gottlieb press representatives did not immediately reply to requests for comment. In a statement, Odebrecht said it “is keeping constructive talks with bondholders"" and declined to comment further on the specifics of the restructuring proposal.
The corruption-ensnared conglomerate, best known as a provider of engineering and infrastructure, decided not to pay $11.5 million in interest on the 2025 bonds that were due last November. The bonds, related to the conglomerate's construction unit known as OEC, were traded at 12.25 cents to the dollar this week, according to Refinitiv data..
The proposal to bondholders is being drafted as part of a larger renegotiation of the conglomerate's 70 billion reais ($18.83 billion) in debt. Odebrecht also wants to extend maturities in its debt with local banks, a source with knowledge of the matter said last month.

Odebrecht proposed in January that its local creditors in Brazil take over its sugar and ethanol unit, Atvos Agroindustrial Participacoes SA, in exchange for reducing the company's 12 billion reais in debt, Reuters reported.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended higher on Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting reaffirmed for investors that the U.S. central bank would be ""patient"" with respect to further interest rate hikes.
But policymakers gave little sense of how long their ""patient"" stance on the U.S. rate policy would last, according to minutes from the Jan. 29-30 meeting, resulting in jumpy afternoon activity and stocks trading on both sides of unchanged.
""The minutes largely echoed the Fed's cautious statement from its last meeting,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. ""I get the sense that rates are on hold until later this year. ... But the Fed stopped well short of closing the door to a rate hike later this year if the downside growth risks subside.""
Policymakers also promised ""before too long"" a plan for their $4 trillion balance sheet, the minutes showed.
The U.S. central bank surprised markets last month by suspending a three-year campaign to raise rates, saying it would be patient about making any adjustments to its target range for short-term interest rates, now at between 2.25 percent and 2.5 percent.
A dovish Fed and progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations have helped the S&P 500 rise about 18 percent from its lows in December, when the market swooned on fears of an economic slowdown. The index is trading about 5 percent below the record closing high it hit in late September.
The rate-sensitive S&P financial index added to gains following the release of the minutes and ended up 0.6 percent.
But the S&P materials index, up 1.7 percent, led percentage gains among the major 11 S&P sectors, boosted by gains in commodity prices. Shares of CF Industries Holdings Inc (NYSE:CF), Mosaic Co and FreeportMcMoran rose.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 63.12 points, or 0.24 percent, to 25,954.44, the S&P 500 gained 4.94 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,784.7 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.30 points, or 0.03 percent, to 7,489.07.
Investors also took in more news on the trade front, with President Donald Trump on Wednesday saying the United States would impose tariffs on European car imports if it cannot reach a trade deal with the European Union.
On Tuesday, Trump said trade discussions with China were going well and suggested he was open to extending the deadline to complete the negotiations, saying March 1 was not a ""magical"" date.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co slipped 5.7 percent after the carrier said it would take a $60 million hit from the partial U.S. government shutdown.
The carrier dragged down shares of other airlines, sending the Dow Jones US Airlines index down 2.6 percent.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.73-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 38 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 99 new highs and 17 new lows.

813,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 04:34PM ET</span>","U.S.-China trade war rattles agribusinesses, especially Bunge","By Karl Plume
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with China has roiled agricultural markets and given the world's top grain merchants the one thing they have long claimed was essential to turn a trading profit: volatility.
And yet, Archer Daniels Midland Co, Bunge Ltd, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co, the so-called ABCDs of grain, have not performed as well as expected - and, in some cases, failed to deliver the profit windfall promised by company executives, investors and analysts said.
If anyone should have been a winner in the Trump administration's sweeping trade war, it should have been the ABCDs, said industry analysts. Investors had expected these international grain traders to benefit from market volatility and shifts in global grain flows resulting from a trade war between the world's two largest economies.
But as China imposed steep tariffs on a raft of U.S. goods including grain and soybeans in July, the traders have struggled to capitalize on moving goods from areas of surplus to areas in need. The reasons are varied and company-specific, from bad political bets to supply-chain gaffes.
If not for the silver lining of solid soy processing results due to strong global crush margins in 2018, their earnings would have been far worse.
""Benefiting from trading opportunities and arbitrage and dislocations around trade ... that, overall, turned out to be a more difficult landscape to navigate, which ultimately hurt these companies,"" said Chris Johnson, director and agribusiness lead for Standard & Poor's.
Bunge, which reports its fourth-quarter results on Thursday, has arguably fared the worst of all as at least two trade-war-related bets backfired, leading to the removal in December of the company's chief executive, Soren Schroder.
Bunge had already been conducting a strategic review after pressure from activist investors, and was the target of takeover attempts from ADM and global commodities trader  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc after an earlier string of weak profits.
BAD BETS
In its first notable trade war misstep, Bunge took long positions in soybean futures, betting on a prompt end to Chinese tariffs on U.S. soybeans in the second quarter of 2018. It led to a $125 million mark-to-market loss in the quarter. 
Then, as the trade war dragged on, Bunge increased purchases of Brazilian soybeans to meet accelerated demand from China, only to see their value drop as U.S.-China tensions eased following a trade detente on Dec. 1. That strategy led Bunge to cut full-year earnings for its large agribusiness segment, historically responsible for about 80 percent of company revenue, estimating earnings would come in $90 million to $100 million below the low end of its earlier forecast.
The troubles came after Schroder said in May that ""our global footprint is built for this type of environment"" and the shifts in trade flows ""play to our strengths.""
Fitch Ratings and Moody's have since both downgraded Bunge's long-term debt rating to one notch above junk, while S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings revised its outlook for the company to negative from stable.
Bunge's ill-timed bets frustrated investors.
Bunge shares are down more than 32 percent from a year ago, compared with a 3 percent loss in that time by its publicly traded peer ADM.
""If you can't control the variables, don't make big bets,"" said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer for Capital Innovations, which holds shares of both Bunge and ADM.
Still, Capital Innovations expanded its position in Bunge in the past quarter, expecting a turnaround at the 200-year-old company. Underhill has a share price target of $70 for the stock, which is currently trading in the low $50s.
Analysts, on average, expect Bunge to report fourth-quarter earnings of 20 cents per share on Thursday, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. That compares with a loss of 48 cents per share a year earlier, which included restructuring charges.
RIVALS STUMBLE
Bunge was not alone in its trade war stumbles.
ADM's CEO Juan Luciano had been more cautious in its forward-looking statements, calling the trade tensions ""manageable in the near term."" The company's chief financial officer, Ray Young, was more emphatic: ""We actually feel very, very confident about our prospects.""
Still, the company's fourth-quarter net income dropped by more than half to $315 million due to ""rapidly changing trade, geopolitical and market conditions,"" its worst fourth-quarter result in seven years. 
Cargill last month reported a 20 percent drop in fiscal second-quarter profit due partly to global trade war tensions that hurt its global shipping business.

Louis Dreyfus posted lower profits for the first half of 2018, citing a negative $65 million mark-to-market hit from oilseed hedging along with greater unpredictability in markets as the U.S.-China trade war began. The company said a stronger second half would boost full-year earnings.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.24%, the S&P 500 added 0.18%, while the Nasdaq Composite tacked on 0.03%.
The release of the minutes triggered volatile action in stocks as investors attempted to weigh up the Fed's somewhat downbeat outlook on the U.S. economy against its dovish stance on monetary policy.
""Participants noted that maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate for a time posed few risks at this point,"" the minutes said. ""The current level of the federal funds rate was at the lower end of the range of estimates of the neutral policy rate.""
The Fed flagged ""softening in consumer or business sentiment"" and ""a reduction in the outlook for foreign economic growth"" as headwinds to tightening monetary policy.
On the balance sheet, the minutes showed that ""(a)lmost all participants thought that it would be desirable to announce before too long a plan to stop reducing the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings later this year.""
In the height of financial crisis the Fed bought government and mortgage bonds to boost the economy. But it has allowed as much as $50 billion a month of maturing securities to roll off its balance sheet as part of plan to reduce its balance sheet.
Beyond monetary policy, materials stocks also propped up the market amid growing expectations an escalation in the U.S.-China trade war will be averted when the current truce expires on March 1.
CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF), Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) and DowDuPont (NYSE:DWDP), which are sensitive to rising raw materials costs brought on by U.S. tariffs imposed on Chinese imports, rose sharply.
President Donald Trump hinted Tuesday that the March. 1 trade deadline was not set in stone, saying it was not a ""magical"" date.
Health care stocks were pressured by a plunge in CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) after it was punished for delivering results that missed on top line. Full-year guidance for earnings per share and revenue also fell short of estimates, with company expecting 2019 to be a year of ""transition"" as it seeks to integrate Aetna (NYSE:AET).
For 2019, CVS forecasts adjusted earnings in a range of $6.68 to $6.88 per share, below the $7.41 per share analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected.
Healthcare stocks fell 0.13%.

Investing.com - Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) shares are doing well -- maybe too well.
The company is selling off its entertainment assets to Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) in a $71 billion deal expected to close this summer.
Basically it's keeping its Fox News and Fox Sports broadcasting businesses. And there's a huge question about whether the sports business in particular is vulnerable to new ways of reaching customers.
The stock (whether Fox or Fox A shares) hit new 52-week highs Wednesday. The non-voting A shares (NASDAQ:FOXA) were at $50.72, just off their high of $52.75. The voting shares (NASDAQ:FOX), which trade at a slight discount, hit a $50.34 peak. The A shares are up 4.5% this quarter. The Fox shares are up 6.1%, slightly lagging the market.
In fact, the shares, up nearly 37% over the last year, are looking frothy. Several technical indicators suggest the shares are overbought and vulnerable to any kind of market turmoil.
The Fox News business is very profitable with its stable of conservative commentators and provocative programming. The sports business, including Major League Baseball, the National Football League and its FSI sports network, is big and growing, but growing expensively.
The company, dominated by Rupert Murdoch and his sons, has been paying up to get programming, particularly with Major League Baseball (a $5 billion investment over seven years). It bought the rights to the Thursday night NFL games. That was $3 billion over five years, compared with $900 million over two years paid by CBS and NBC under an earlier two-year deal.
The company also benefited from the 2017 tax bill.
But the broadcasting business is changing. Streaming is potentially real competition and it's not clear how any broadcaster will compete, given their huge investments in infrastructure to support broadcasting and cable.
Still, investors seem to be buying into the scenario that, if you own the rights, someone will buy the advertising and all will continue to be well."
818,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 02:10PM ET</span>",Get Ready for China’s M&A Era,"(Bloomberg Markets) -- Hu Xiaoling has been eagerly waiting for China’s debt clampdown for more than a decade. Hu, a co-founder of Beijing-based alternative-asset firm CDH Investments, says some of her industry peers worry that China’s deleveraging campaign will sabotage private enterprise. But she thinks it will only harm companies that are overleveraged. With a view that banks would eventually roll back excessive lending, Hu says CDH has been targeting businesses with good cash flows and has avoided the temptation to invest in overvalued companies. CDH was started in 2002. Before that, it was part of China International Capital Corp., a foreign securities venture with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and other partners. As of June, CDH managed $18 billion in assets, having expanded into areas as diverse as credit and wealth management. The firm, with more than 150 investment professionals on staff, has invested in more than 200 companies. Hu’s biggest deals include the $6.8 billion buyout of Belle International Holdings Ltd., China’s largest women’s footwear maker, in 2017. In an interview with Bloomberg Markets, Hu says CDH has been preparing for a correction in the Chinese market, and it looks like the bet is beginning to pay off. Public company valuations have already cooled in China; private markets tend to follow suit. Hu says CDH is now ready to seize M&A opportunities at bargain prices. 
Cathy Chan: You were one of six co-founders of CDH in 2002. What’s the biggest lesson you’ve learned?
Hu Xiaoling: We never follow the herd. In the past 10 years, starting from 2008, the Chinese A-share market has given a particularly high valuation to mediocre companies. Because they are small and so easily driven by market hype, valuations can reach 50 to 100 times price-earnings multiples. In fact, some funds have been investing in these mediocre companies, betting on an A-share listing, and are making particularly gigantic returns. 
CC: How does CDH respond to the market frenzy?
HX: This temptation is actually quite big. We do have team members voicing their frustration after seeing rivals invest pre-IPO in A shares and make good fortunes. As an organization, you have to resist this temptation. Unlike venture capital, our PE funds have zero tolerance for losses. We may have one or two problematic investments out of a few dozen we made over time, and we discover every time that if we don’t have absolute persistence, there is a problem.
CC: Has CDH missed any boats?
HX: A lot. There must be some misses. If you don’t miss some, that implies you must also have already made a lot of mistaken investments. 
CC: What’s changed the most in the past two decades?
HX: Before 2007 a very unexceptional consumer-goods company could post a 20 to 30 percent profit increase, and a good one might have 50 percent to 60 percent because they had much better cash flow. After 2008 the lackluster companies are barely making profit, and their debts continue to rise, leading to overleveraging and potential bankruptcy problems today. These are the seeds buried in the past years. These companies simply did not know how to manage major resources, because they were not good enterprises.
CC: China’s economy has experienced tremendous growth since the early 1990s. What role has private equity played in that?
HX: The rapid growth of Chinese companies is mainly a result of China’s economic development. If I say private equity and its capital have promoted China’s economic growth, I think my statement is rather arrogant. What private equity does is effective resource allocation, which is why this industry was created. When resources are allocated to companies and people who have no capability to deploy them efficiently, PE industry professionals should feel guilty about it. Capital itself does not create GDP. Our role as a PE investor is to allocate resources to entrepreneurs and companies with good vision, capability, and acumen. But in the past few years, because of the immature investment visions of some people, I have seen a lot of mismatched resources. 
“I think the biggest concern this year is the impact of deleveraging rather than trade wars” 
CC: What has prevented the efficient allocation of resources in China? Why are some Chinese companies still not properly run and unprofitable despite the country’s high economic growth?
HX: Before 2007 we noticed many companies had been growing rapidly for 15 years and it was easy to make a fortune in China. After 2007, because of the emergence of better companies, the more troubled ones were starting to struggle. We have said China may be entering the era of M&A. We thought we would have reached that stage [by now], but because the government pumped 4 trillion yuan [$593 billion], some say 10 trillion yuan, in the system, those who were prepared to surrender were given more bank loans. This is a resource mismatch and is already leading to the bigger problems today.
CC: Public company valuations have come down quite a bit. Private markets tend to lag behind. How much of a decline are you expecting in terms of private valuations?
HX: We believe China valuations in certain areas have been excessively high since 2014, and we don’t think constant financing at high valuations is a thing that will last forever. Maybe I am a bit overconservative or foresee the impact of possible deleveraging too early, but we have been looking to invest in companies with particularly good cash flow since then. I’ve told our cash-rich portfolio companies to keep their money, because there will be very meaningful opportunities during the process of deleveraging. You’ll be able to do more with less money and buy more of the target at a lower price. As a private equity investor, we look at things in a three- to five-year horizon. I personally made preparations over the past two to three years for the upcoming corrections. I hope that through the next two or three years, our companies, which have good cash flow, can take advantage of this opportunity to do better M&A deals. 
CC: What’s the outlook for 2019?
HX: We haven’t made a big move yet, because we think the current prices aren’t right. Over the last few years, M&A EV/Ebitda multiples in the U.S. were 9.5 times, and China cross-border acquisitions in consumer and manufacturing sectors were 12 times to 14 times. I think 7 to 8 times multiples are more reasonable. Now there are ample [M&A] opportunities, but since there are so many, we feel like we have more bargaining power to pick the best. Deleveraging has kick-started this process. There is also systematic change, with many founders, entrepreneurs, and management seeking successors after starting their businesses in the ’90s. 
CC: With private enterprises under more pressure due to China’s deleveraging efforts, does that translate into more opportunities for private equity investors?
HX: There are some saying that deleveraging will sabotage the entire private enterprise segment, but what I see is that the [government] measure only targets overleveraged companies. These companies are the ones that were allocated capital but failed to run their businesses properly. Now they’re hardest hit because an order [from the government] is being put in place. In July hundreds of A-share companies saw their stock losses exceed collateral underlying stock. These companies are the ones that were assigned excessive valuations by the A-share market and claimed to be 10 to 20 billion [yuan] companies. They made acquisitions beyond their appetite. They found these targets couldn’t be digested and have now started to dispose of them. Our team is now seeing a lot of these targets available in the market. In fact, I had been planning to acquire some companies in the 2008-2009 period after the financial crisis hit, but the banks kept giving loans to the problematic companies, allowing them to survive and making them reluctant to sell. 
CC: Your firm specializes in investing in companies that cater to consumer demands. Do you think consumer sentiment has been impacted by the U.S.-China trade war? 
HX: I think the biggest concern this year is the impact of deleveraging rather than trade wars. 
CC: How are consumer demands changing in the retail sector in China, and how does this compare to the U.S.?
HX: In the U.S. it may take 60 to 70 years to witness changes in consumer habits, from mass consumption to brand consumption, and then to quality consumption, but China only needs 20 to 25 years, or about one-third of the time.
China’s cities and regions are numerous and diversified. Different regions have different stages of development, and you just can’t generalize. I expect 30 percent of the population will gradually move to quality consumption, and maybe one-third of this mass-market population is gradually entering the consumption category defined by brand loyalty. The rest will stay in the mass-­market category for a while.
CC: Why is China experiencing a faster consumer transformation than the rest of the world?
HX: It has something to do with globalization, because information [about products and services worldwide] is more freely available. Second, the Chinese want to grow even faster, because they were hungry before. As there are too many people in the country, everyone will make stronger efforts to survive.

""One thing is clear, our cost base is too high,"" Audi CEO Bram Schot was quoted as saying. 
He reaffirmed a target for a total of 15 billion euros ($17 billion) in cost savings through 2022.
Audi said in December it would invest 14 billion euros through 2023 in electric mobility, digitalization and autonomous driving.
The division is at risk of losing its position as VW's leading development center as the parent explores potential technology alliances with Ford and other rivals.

Audi aims to reduce the number of engine types by one third and it is also in talks with shop stewards about stopping the night shift at its Ingolstadt factory, Schot was quoted as saying by Handelsblatt.

823,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 01:23PM ET</span>",Southwest shares drop as mechanics labor dispute escalates,"By Tracy Rucinski and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co's shares fell as much as 6 percent on Wednesday after the low-cost carrier said it was investigating whether a conflict with its mechanics union was leading to a spike in flight cancellations.
The escalating labor dispute comes as the airline on Wednesday cut its first-quarter growth forecast for revenue per seat mile due to a higher-than-expected impact from the recent U.S. government shutdown and weak passenger bookings. 
Dallas-based Southwest has canceled hundreds of flights since Feb. 15, due to a mixture of weather and unscheduled maintenance issues that have put an unprecedented number of aircraft out of service. 
Southwest said there was no common theme among the maintenance issues, which followed the latest round of negotiations with the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA). AMFA represents about 2,400 Southwest mechanics and has been in contract talks with management since 2012.
On Tuesday, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Mike Van de Ven said the low-cost carrier would investigate why the number of aircraft unable to fly due to mechanical issues had doubled.
In a response posted on its website, AMFA said that Southwest's linking of aircraft disruption to collective bargaining negotiations ""is simply an attempt to divert attention away from the airline's safety issues.""
Shares of Southwest were down more than 5 percent at $54.70 on Wednesday afternoon, off an earlier low at $54.19. 
Earlier on Wednesday, Southwest said it expected a $60 million sales hit from the recent U.S. government partial shutdown, four times its previous estimate.
While the 35-day U.S. shutdown ended on Jan. 25, Southwest spokeswoman Brandy King said passenger demand and bookings continued to suffer due to uncertainty over a potential second shutdown before a government deal was reached on Feb. 14. 
As a result, Southwest trimmed its first-quarter growth forecast for revenue per available seat mile to a range of 3 to 4 percent from a previous range of 4 to 5 percent.
Southwest, which flies more domestic flights than legacy peers like American Airlines Group and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), said it is hopeful that first-quarter demand softness is temporary.
However, the more than month-long hiatus in U.S. government decision-making has delayed the federal authorization process for Southwest's plans to launch service to Hawaii, which it had hoped to begin early this year.
That process is currently under way, though the carrier has as yet been unable to announce a launch date. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said this means the airline will have a shorter window to sell tickets to Hawaii, forcing it to discount heavily at a time when most rivals expect an improvement in ticket prices. It issued a ""sell"" recommendation on the stock.
Meanwhile, flight cancellations by Southwest continued on Wednesday, accounting for about 22 percent of total cancellations across the United States, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware.com.

King said the next round of contract talks with the mechanics union is scheduled for March 12.

826,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 01:15PM ET</span>",Business jet deliveries rise 3.8 percent in 2018: industry group,"(Reuters) - Business jet deliveries worldwide rose 3.8 percent on an annual basis to 703 planes in 2018, lifted by demand from North America and the introduction of new models, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) said on Wednesday. 
Forecasters and corporate plane makers expect higher business jet deliveries in 2019, fueled by the recent entry into service of new aircraft like Bombardier's Global 7500 and U.S. rival Gulfstream's G500.
Demand for business jets has slowly rebounded following slumping sales after the 2009 global economic crisis.
Deliveries are a closely watched metric since that is the point when customers pay the bulk of the cost of a new plane.
General aviation aircraft deliveries rose across all segments in 2018 for the first time in five years, helped by demand for new models, GAMA said.
Global airplane deliveries increased to 2,443 planes in 2018, up 4.7 percent on an annual basis, according to data from Washington-based GAMA. Rotorcraft deliveries rose 5.4 percent to 976 aircraft.
“This is the first year since 2013 that we’ve seen all segments up in deliveries,” said GAMA President and Chief Executive Pete Bunce in a statement. 

The ""impacts"" of a 35-day, partial U.S. government shutdown that ended on Jan. 25 are ""still being felt and assessed,"" GAMA said. The shutdown affected the certification program for Gulfstream's new G600 corporate plane.

829,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 12:15PM ET</span>",Stretch your retirement with this tax-saving strategy,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Retirement strategy is about more than just how you will spend the money you have saved – it matters where that money is coming from too.
Bill Reichenstein spent his career teaching finance and creating strategies that help people maximize the amount coming from Social Security. The Baylor University finance professor is a principal in Social Security Solutions, Inc., a software firm that helps people work the system.
But since Reichenstein, 66, retired a few months ago, he has been thinking about how to orchestrate the rest of his retirement accounts and he came up with a plan. 
Each year until he is 70, he will convert some of the money that is in his IRA and 401(K) accounts into a Roth IRA. He will pay income tax on whatever he withdraws, but once the money is in the Roth, he never will owe on it again, as the growth is tax-free.
Reichenstein figured out that the conversions will give him more than a couple hundred thousand dollars more than he would have had for retirement because of those tax savings.
At a recent Financial Planning Association Conference, Reichenstein urged financial planners to get retirees in their 60s to adopt the same practice; especially if they have put virtually all their retirement savings into 401(k)s and IRAs. 
The driver for this strategy is to protect as much money as possible from taxes that can jump sharply after age 70-1/2. This is when individuals are required by the government to withdraw prescribed sums from IRAs and 401(k)s each year and pay taxes on the distributions, known as required minimum distributions (RMDs). Roth IRAs are not subject to these requirements, and also have easier rules for heirs.
“It makes most sense [to convert] when you quit working and before starting Social Security,” said David Oransky, a certified public accountant and financial planner who serves on the American Institute of CPA's Personal Financial Planning Executive Committee.
For example, Frank Corrado, a Holmdel, New Jersey financial planner and president of the Alliance of Comprehensive Planners, is helping a retired couple do Roth conversions every year for 12 years before hitting 70 and starting Social Security. The couple had adjusted gross income of $141,105 when working, but after retiring at 58 it dropped to about $69,600 as they live on pensions and investments. 
With their relatively low income now, they are in the 12 percent tax bracket and can stay within it even though they are converting $32,000 a year to Roths. Over the 12 years before age 70, they will convert about $384,000 of their original $2 million IRA into a Roth. During retirement that should leave them with about $50,000 more to spend, Corrado said.
MORE SAVINGS
The tax saving is about more than just income. Social Security benefits are taxed each year based on a retiree’s other income. So if a person must take a large withdrawal from an IRA, his income will rise and likely lead to more taxes on Social Security benefits.
Medicare premiums are affected too. Most people pay $135.50 a month to have Part B Medicare coverage for doctors and medical tests. But after an individual’s income goes above $85,000 or a couple’s over $170,000, the premium jumps to $189.60 a month per person. As income rises, premiums become as high as $460.50 a month.
During tax season, Oransky suggested thinking about conversions and finishing them the following November when annual income is clear. But people who are planning to move from high tax states to no-income tax states in retirement, may delay a conversion until after the move.

(This story corrects that he will finish conversions at 70, not retire then in paragraph 4 and corrects Oransky's title in paragraph 8)

830,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 12:12PM ET</span>","Bristol-Myers says Starboard nominated five directors, bought shares","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co said on Wednesday that activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP intends to nominate five directors to the U.S. drugmaker's board, one month after it announced a $74 billion deal to acquire peer  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG).
Reuters reported last week that Starboard was working with a proxy solicitor to gauge the level of support among Bristol-Myers shareholders for the Celgene deal. If it finds enough discontent, Starboard could agitate against it.
Bristol-Myers said Starboard informed the company it had bought roughly one million of its common shares. That is equivalent to a roughly $50 million stake, a small sliver of the company's $84 billion market capitalization. 
Starboard has submitted regulatory filings that would allow it to acquire additional stock. In the meantime, its small position in Bristol-Myers' stock and its proposed director slate give the fund the option to explore other changes at the company.
""Starboard Value sent Bristol-Myers Squibb a notice of nomination in connection with Bristol-Myers Squibb's 2019 annual meeting of stockholders,"" Bristol said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday, adding that the hedge fund proposed five directors, including Starboard co-founder Jeffrey Smith.
Besides Smith, the hedge fund proposed the following as directors: pharmaceutical industry veteran Janet Vergis; James Tyree, an adviser to Starboard; healthcare and technology veteran Steven Shulman; and John Leonard, who had been chief scientific officer at global pharmaceutical company AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV).
The hedge fund asked to speak with Bristol-Myers management when it submitted its nomination notice and also requested that any meetings and its notice be kept confidential. Bristol said the two sides have met ""on multiple occasions."" 
Bristol-Myers shareholders will vote on the Celgene deal in April.
Starboard did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.
Bristol-Myers shares dipped 0.5 percent to $51.09. 
The presence of an activist investor can encourage potential deal interlopers to step in. However, no rival suitor has so far emerged publicly, either for Bristol-Myers or for Celgene.

Starboard has a track record of opposing deals. It tried to block Virginia-based meat giant Smithfield Foods' sale to Chinese company Shuanghui International in 2013, as well as aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) Inc's acquisition of B/E Aerospace two years ago. Both deals were done.

835,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 11:26AM ET</span>",UAE eases Qatar shipping ban amid continuing dispute,"By Alexander Cornwell, Lisa Barrington and Eric Knecht
DUBAI/DOHA (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates has eased a ban on the shipping of goods between it and Qatar enforced under a political and economic boycott of Doha, according to port circulars and an industry source.
The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain severed diplomatic, trade and transport ties with Qatar in June 2017 over allegations it supports terrorism, a charge Doha denies.
An Abu Dhabi Ports circular dated Feb. 12 canceled previous directives that banned cargoes of Qatar origin from UAE waters and ports and those of UAE origin from Qatar. 
It maintained a ban on vessels flying the Qatar flag, owned by Qatari shipping firms or nationals. UAE-flagged vessels still cannot call at Qatar ports.
An industry source told Reuters the circular applied to all UAE ports. Government authorities in both Gulf Arab states did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
Liberian flagged container ship MSC ELSA 3 arrived at Dubai's Jebel Ali Port on February 20 from Qatar's Umm Said, according to Refinitiv data.
It was not clear if the move was linked to complaints filed to the World Trade Organisation related to the Gulf dispute.
Qatar filed in July 2017 a wide-ranging legal complaint at the WTO to challenge the trade boycott. Last month, the UAE filed a complaint against Qatar at the WTO saying Doha has imposed a ban on Emirati products.
On the political front, there has been no indication of a thaw. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have said the dispute is not a priority and that Qatar must accept a list of conditions before ties are restored. Qatar has said that although it would like the matter resolved it is moving on and last year quit oil producer group OPEC, of which Saudi Arabia is de facto leader.
Diplomats in the Gulf say the boycott has raised costs for companies operating in the region, with vessels forced to call at ports in third countries when sailing between Qatar and UAE.
Qatar's economy has largely weathered the boycott thanks to the tiny country's vast wealth, which was swiftly deployed by the government to support the financial sector. 
The world's largest natural gas exporter also forged new trade links to meet domestic demand, including basic goods such as food, and construction material as it prepares to host the 2022 World Cup.

Butswinkas, who joined Tesla in December and was reporting to Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, will return to his previous role as the company's outside counsel at law firm Williams (NYSE:WMB) & Connolly. 
Jonathan Chang, Tesla's vice president of legal department, will replace Butswinkas effective immediately, the company said in an email statement to Reuters. Before joining Tesla in 2011, Chang was its outside counsel at law firm Latham & Watkins.
Tesla hired Butswinkas as an outside counsel last year to help settle a case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after Musk tweeted that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share.
Musk later settled the charges with the U.S. regulator by agreeing to pay a $20 million fine and relinquishing his position as Tesla's chairman for three years.
Butswinkas is the latest among the dozens of high-profile executives to leave Tesla over the past two years even as the carmaker struggles to ramp up production of Model 3 sedans, which is seen as crucial for the its long-term profitability.
Tesla, which last month missed Wall Street profit targets for the last quarter of 2018, said Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja would leave after 11 years with the company.
Tesla is facing increased competition from new electric vehicle entrants and was last month forced to cut U.S. prices for all its vehicles to offset lower green tax credits, a move that could impact its margins. 
In a bid to save capital and produce cheaper Model 3 cars, Tesla has cut jobs and ended a customer referral program.
Investors continue to worry whether Tesla, which has never posted an annual profit, would be able to ramp up production of Model 3 cars. 
In a tweet on Tuesday, Musk estimated that Tesla would make around 500,000 Model 3s in 2019. He quickly clarified that the delivery target this year would be 400,000 cars.

Shares of the company were down 1 percent in morning trading.

840,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 11:01AM ET</span>",UBS to appeal after fined 4.5 billion euros in French tax fraud case,"By Inti Landauro and Emmanuel Jarry
PARIS (Reuters) - A French court found Swiss bank UBS AG guilty of illegally soliciting clients and laundering the proceeds of tax evasion, ordering it to pay 4.5 billion euros ($5.1 billion) in penalties.
Shares in the Swiss bank fell as much as 3.2 percent after the ruling on Wednesday. UBS, which has denied any wrongdoing, said it would launch an appeal.
""The court can only conclude that (UBS) consistently put its own financial interests over the sovereign rights of the French state,"" the court's president Christine Mee said in her ruling.
""Hence, the crimes are exceptionally serious,"" she added.
The case shows how French courts are taking a hard line on financial misconduct in general, and tax fraud in particular. 
The trial will be scrutinized by European bankers who have come under pressure from regulators to tighten compliance with money laundering rules since the financial crisis.
""This is a clear signal to all financial intermediaries: you will be punished severely if you don't behave,"" said banking law professor Thierry Bonneau from Paris Pantheon Assas University.
""They will have to be excessively prudent on all these questions of tax fraud.""
The penalties, which exceed the bank's net profit last year, included a 3.7 billion euro fine and additional damages of 800 million euros to the French state. UBS last month reported a 2018 net profit of $4.9 billion. 
""This decision is incomprehensible, we will appeal,"" UBS general counsel Markus Diethelm told reporters outside the courtroom. ""We have seen no facts and no evidence."" 
An appeal could see the case drag on for years and the bank will not have to pay anything until all appeals are heard. 
The combined penalties are a record for France and more than double the $2.46 billion the bank has set aside to cover potential losses from litigation and regulatory requirements.
The bank may have to increase its provisions in the coming weeks, Citi said in a note to investors and its plan to buy back as much as $1 billion worth of shares this year is at risk, it added.
""INDUSTRIAL"" SCALE LAUNDERING
The French trial follows a similar case in the United States, where UBS accepted a $780 million settlement in 2009, and in Germany, where it agreed to a 300 million euro fine in 2014.
The penalty is high by European standards, although in the United States judges have levied higher fines including the $8.9 billion a U.S. court in 2015 ordered  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) to pay for violating U.S. economic sanctions against Sudan, Cuba and Iran.
The size of the penalty in the UBS case will push banks to accept settlements in future cases, a standard practice in the United States that is rare in France, Bonneau said. 
The ruling marks the culmination of a seven-year investigation and aborted settlement negotiations.
French prosecutors said UBS sent Swiss bankers to golf tournaments, classical music concerts and hunting parties to solicit new clients illegally and advised them to park their money in Switzerland and offered them methods to shield activities from the French taxman.
UBS was ""systematic"" in its support to tax-evading customers and that the laundering of proceeds from the tax fraud was done on an ""industrial"" scale, the prosecutors had told the court.
UBS's lawyers have said the prosecution failed to show material evidence of specific cases of clients advised to evade tax payments. 
Under French law, those convicted of money laundering can be ordered to pay a fine totaling half the amount laundered. The prosecution estimates UBS's customers hid billions of euros from the French tax authorities.
Prosecutors told the court that UBS's bankers would hand over business cards without any logo and used computers which carried software allowing data to be quickly erased. 
Lawyers for UBS have previously said the case had become politicized. The bank turned down a settlement offer of 1.1 billion euros.

UBS's French unit was also convicted to pay 15 million euros, while five of the six former UBS executives charged were given suspended prison terms and fines ranging from 50,000 euros to 300,000 euros.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has rejected  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG's bid to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the Swiss bank of defrauding shareholders about its risk appetite and risk management before taking $1 billion of writedowns on souring debt.
The decision by U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan was made public on Wednesday.
Schofield said investors who lost money in Credit Suisse's American depositary receipts could pursue claims that the bank, Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam and other defendants intended to mislead them, by touting its ""comprehensive"" risk controls and ""binding"" limits on its exposure to risky and illiquid debt.
Credit Suisse took two writedowns in early 2016 on $4.3 billion of collateralized loan obligations and distressed debt, contributing to its first full-year loss since the 2008 global financial crisis.
The bank's share price fell 11 percent after news of the first writedown. Other defendants included Chief Financial Officer David Mathers, and Thiam's predecessor Brady Dougan.
Credit Suisse had no immediate comment. A lawyer for the defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The lead plaintiffs are four pension and retirement plans in suburbs of New York City and Chicago, and in Birmingham, Alabama. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Since becoming chief executive in 2015, Thiam has repositioned Credit Suisse as a bank for ultra-wealthy and entrepreneurial customers, while shrinking its investment bank.
Though Schofield dismissed some claims in the lawsuit, she cited Thiam's own statements about the bank's rising risk appetite in explaining why the case should proceed.
""Thiam himself stated that continually raising the internal risk limits led to larger exposures to illiquid CLO and distressed debt investments and resulted in the writedowns,"" Schofield wrote. ""Thiam stated to the Wall Street Journal, 'A limit that keeps moving is not a limit.'""
Schofield said statements such as these could suggest that investors ""were lulled into believing that the risk levels were contained and acceptable.""
The defendants had said there was no fraud or intent to defraud, and that prior courts had found no liability for similar actions by other banks and corporate officers.

""It is too early to say exactly when the aircraft will be airborne, but our goal is to fly the aircraft back to Scandinavia within the next week,"" he added.
Norwegian Air has previously said that the paperwork needed to service the plane had taken longer than usual, partly because the company had to familiarize itself with regulations in Iran, where the firm does not operate.

Almost 30 percent of respondents to the bank’s poll cited a worldwide economic slump as their largest concern, the strongest consensus for any single risk since June 2017. No one cited rising bond yields or higher inflation as their top worry, while only 2 percent said it was Brexit, according to analysts led by Barnaby Martin.
European investors have been piling into credit so far this year, adding corporate hybrids, insurance and subordinated bank debt alongside defensive positions in utilities, according to BAML. That’s pushed cash allocations down to 3.5 percent and left a majority of investment-grade money managers feeling that spreads are too tight, the bank said.
Investors are also skeptical that another round of cheap central bank funding for European lenders from the ECB will provide much of a boost -- they reckon the policy has been so well signaled that it’s now priced in. Even so, almost a quarter of respondents expect tighter senior bank spreads as a result.

The company's shares fell 7 percent as it also revealed a $2.2 billion goodwill impairment charge related to the business, which houses the Omnicare unit, in the fourth quarter, taking the total charges at the unit to more than $6 billion in the past year.
The Omnicare business, which the company bought for about $10 billion in 2015, provides prescription drugs to nursing homes and other long-term care centers. It has been hit by lower occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities and reimbursement pressures in the past few quarters.
""The long-term care business has continued to experience industry wide challenges that have impacted our ability to grow the business at the rate that was originally estimated when the company acquired Omnicare,"" the company said in a statement.
CVS said the unit's final budget for 2019 showed a significant deterioration in its forecasts for 2019, resulting in further updates to its long-term forecast beyond 2019.
""We are taking comprehensive actions to move past them,"" Chief Executive Officer Larry Menlo said.
The company, which bought health insurer Aetna (NYSE:AET) last year, forecast full-year 2019 adjusted profit of $6.68 per share to $6.88 per share, while analysts on average currently expect $7.41 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Evercore ISI analysts said the main issues with the company appeared to be long-term care challenges, pharmacy reimbursement pressure, lower drug price rise and questions around rebates.
For the fourth quarter, CVS Health earned $2.14 per share excluding items, beating the average estimate of $2.05 per share.
Same-store sales at the company's pharmacies that sell prescription drugs rose 7.4 percent in the quarter, compared with an expected 6.1 percent rise forecast by analysts.
The company booked a net loss of $419 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a net income of $3.29 billion, a year earlier when it benefited from changes to U.S. tax laws.

Revenue rose to $54.42 billion in the quarter from $48.39 billion a year earlier.

LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays' former chairman, giving evidence in a landmark London fraud trial, said he first saw a document detailing agreed fees for Qatari investors in the British bank four years after the payment was agreed.
Former  Barclays  (LON:BARC) chief executive John Varley and some of his most senior former colleagues - Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath - are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation over side deals struck with Qatar during an 11 billion pound-plus emergency fundraising over a decade ago.
Marcus Agius, the bank's former chairman, told the trial on Wednesday that he did not know how 280 million pounds ($365 million) of extra fees for Qatar were negotiated or how the figure was arrived at in October 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. 
""Not only did I not see the document, I was not aware of its existence,"" the veteran banker, who is giving evidence for the prosecution, told Southwark Crown Court on his second day in the witness box. He said he first saw the document in 2012.
Agius was not cross examined by the defense.
Qatari investors plowed around 4.0 billion pounds into Barclays during two fund raisings at the height of the credit crisis in 2008 that allowed the bank to avoid a state bailout.
The Serious Fraud Office, which is prosecuting the case, alleges the four former Barclays' executives misled shareholders, the market and other investors by not disclosing that Barclays paid an extra 322 million pounds to Qatar through two ""advisory service agreements"" over a decade ago.
The former executives - the most senior bankers to face a jury trial in Britain over credit crisis-era conduct - deny wrongdoing.
Varley and Agius had been jointly handed full authority to carry out a second capital raising after a meeting of a board finance committee, established by Barclays on Oct. 28, 2008. This included approving fees that were ""fair and reasonable"", according to documents presented to the court.
""Matters were moving almost on an hourly basis,"" Agius said, noting that a smaller decision-making group was more practical to secure strategic investors as markets gyrated in the credit crunch.
Agius, the first prosecution witness to give evidence, said he had been aware of underwriting fees and a 66 million pound payment for Qatar for helping bring on board Abu Dhabi investors in the October fundraising.
Qatari investors have not been accused of wrongdoing.

The trial is scheduled to last for up to six months.

Bengaluru (Reuters) - European aircraft maker Airbus deliveries of its A320neo aircraft are back on track in India with fewer problems being seen with the narrowbody jet's Pratt & Whitney engines, a senior company executive said on Wednesday.
""Pratt has informed Airbus that engine issues have come down by a factor of four in the last 12 months,"" said Airbus' India head Anand Stanley, on the sidelines of the Aero India airshow in Bengaluru.
Last month, India's aviation safety watchdog forced airlines to make extra checks on their Airbus A320neo aircraft fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines, as part of new safety protocols after temporary grounding orders affected the planes last year.
IndiGo, India's biggest carrier by market share, and its low-cost rival GoAir, both fly the A320neos. 
The aircraft, which entered service in early 2016, boasts significant fuel efficiency benefits, but it has been plagued by teething issues with its engines that have forced Interglobe Aviation-owned IndiGo and Wadia Group-owned GoAir to regularly ground a number of the planes.
This caused a backlog in deliveries of the planes by Airbus.
IndiGo has over 60 A320neos in its fleet and is one of Airbus' biggest global customer with over 400 more A320neo and A321neo jets on order. GoAir has about 30 A320neos in its fleet and over 100 more of the jets ordered.

Stanley said that the reliability rate on A320neo engines is now 99.6 percent and that it has retrofitted engines of about 95 percent of the A320neos in service. It expects to finish work on the remainder in the next two months.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks hit a four-month high on Wednesday on hopes of progress in trade talks between the United States and China, with a dovish backdrop at major central banks also helping push markets back into the black. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said negotiations with China were going well and suggested he was open to extending the deadline to complete them beyond March 1.
Up to now, it was assumed U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports would rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if no trade deal was reached by then.
Asian shares soared on Trump's comment, and European stock indices also strengthened, with a pan-European index gaining 0.3 percent, pushing the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, to a four-month high. 
U.S. stock futures suggested that Wall Street would hold on to Tuesday's strong gains, and open about flat. (N) 
""I'd say the market is very much pricing in a deal at this stage, and there's some merit to this as I don't think you engage in such a solid period of talks over a number of weeks unless you feel you are getting somewhere,"" said Craig Erlam, chief market analyst at OANDA, an FX brokerage. 
""The talk of an extension suggests Trump is positive about the direction of travel.""
He added, however, that the market remains vulnerable to any further setbacks. 
DOVISH CENTRAL BANKS
While hopes for a trade deal between the world's two largest economies are seen as the primary driver for world stocks, dovish central bank messages are also playing a part. 
New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) on Tuesday said he was comfortable with the level U.S. interest rates were at and that he saw no need to raise them again unless economic growth or inflation shifted to an unexpectedly higher gear.
Investors are also looking to the release on Wednesday of minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting, at which policymakers effectively signaled no further rate hikes and possible tweaks to its balance sheet normalization.
In Europe, expectations have been growing that the European Central Bank will restart a program to provide long-term cheap loans to banks to boost a faltering economy, while the Bank of Japan has flagged its readiness to ease further.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose as much as 1.1 percent to mark its highest levels since Oct. 2.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained as much as 1.3 percent to six-month highs, while Korea's Kospi and Taiwan's index recovered to levels last seen in early October. Japan's Nikkei added 0.6 percent to two-month highs.
On currency markets, the dollar steadied against a basket of major currencies, after suffering its biggest one-day loss of the month on Tuesday. It had also recorded big slides against the euro and sterling. 
The greenback strengthened 0.2 percent against the yen after Japan recorded its biggest annual drop in exports in January for more than two years, and on recent dovish Bank of Japan signals. 
Markets were also focused on newsflow on the Brexit front, with sterling holding most of its gains following a 1 percent surge on Tuesday as British Prime Minister Theresa May headed to Brussels to try push negotiations forward.
The yuan rose as much as 0.6 percent against the dollar, its biggest intra-day gain in more than a month, after Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the United States was seeking to secure a pledge from China that it will not devalue the currency as part of a trade deal. 
Oil prices came off 2019 highs, hit by U.S. production and expectations of an economic slowdown. [O/R]

International Brent crude futures dropped 0.65 percent at $66.02 per barrel, having hit a three-month high of $66.83 per barrel earlier this week, supported by OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.

LONDON (Reuters) - Trade talks between the world's two biggest economies helped European shares rise modestly on Wednesday, while the threat of a blocked merger sank shares in British supermarket Sainsbury's.
Germany's trade-sensitive DAX led the way with a 0.4 percent gain and the pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.2 percent after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that trade talks with China were going well.
Although autos, which are vulnerable to rising protectionism, jumped 1.3 percent, investors remained cautious.
""There's no big material news out there that will give us a sustained uptick to markets,"" Gary Waite, portfolio manager at Walker Crips Investment Management, said. 
The top gainers -- Glanbia, Simcorp, and German healthcare firm Fresenius -- were boosted by strong results. 
Fresenius shares jumped 5.9 percent after it said it expects earnings to grow faster than sales from 2020 after investments dent profit this year.
The company's separately-listed dialysis business Fresenius Medical Care gained 6.8 percent after announcing a 1 billion euro share buyback.
Irish nutrition company Glanbia jumped 10.7 percent after its fourth-quarter results, while Danish software company Simcorp also rose 7.4 percent after announcing strong results and a share buyback program.
""Glanbia’s FY results confirm a strong finish to 2018 and were ahead of forecasts at the revenue, EBITA and EPS reporting lines,"" said Davy Research analysts, adding they upgraded their full-year 2019 EPS forecasts by 5 percent. 
However, British supermarket chain Sainsbury's and Swedish lender Swedbank marred the positive picture overall. 
Sainsbury's shares sank 12.5 percent after Britain's competition regulator said its merger with Asda should either be blocked or need significant concessions.
Swedbank shares fell 5.6 percent after a Swedish television program said it had uncovered documents linking the lender to a money laundering scandal involving Denmark's Danske Bank.
""Whilst these headlines are unhelpful, there isn't anything so far to change our view that Baltic AML [anti money-laundering] represents a low tail-risk,"" said KBW analysts.
Shares in Norwegian salmon farmers Salmar and Mowi fell 3.6 percent and 2.7 percent after antitrust regulators raided their and other salmon farms in several European Union countries in an investigation over alleged violation of rules prohibiting cartels.
Overall, analysts have been overwhelmingly negative on European earnings, downgrading their estimates consistently.
""While the earnings season is OK, if you look at forward looking guidance it doesn't strike me as if there's a reason to be too bullish on markets going beyond the end of this year,"" said Walker Crips' Waite.

Honda said on Tuesday that the move was not related to Brexit and that it needed to focus manufacturing in regions where it expects to sell most cars, after struggling in Europe.

But the announcement about the plant in Swindon in southern England comes after a series of warnings from Japan that it would pull investments if they are no longer economically viable after Britain leaves the bloc.

The charge follows a $3.9 billion hit for the same business line only six months ago. It overshadowed a set of results that were otherwise largely in line with expectations, but also hinted at a challenging year as it digests the $70 billion acquisition of Aetna (NYSE:AET).
The shares fell 5.1% to $66.30 in premarket trading in response.
""The LTC business has continued to experience industry-wide challenges that have impacted our ability to grow the business at the rate that was originally estimated when the Company acquired Omnicare,"" CVS said in a statement.
It said it had decided to write off more goodwill after ""LTC management submitted an updated final budget for 2019 which showed significant additional deterioration in the reporting unit’s projected financial results for 2019.""
The company forecast that adjusted earnings per share will fall this year to a range of $6.68 to $6.88, from $7.08 in 2018, due in part to a higher debt burden after the Aetna acquisition. It expects operating cash flow of between $9.8 billion and $10.3 billion, up from $8.9 billion in 2018.
""2019 will be a year of transition as we integrate Aetna and focus on key pillars of our growth strategy,"" chief executive Larry Merlo said in a statement.
""We are fully aware of the need to address the impact of certain headwinds that are having a disproportionate impact in 2019 compared to prior years, and importantly, we are taking comprehensive actions to move past them,"" he added in a nod to the LTC unit's troubles.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) offered India on Wednesday a new combat jet to be made locally, the F-21, in an attempt to win a large military order worth more than $15 billion. 
The U.S. defense firm had previously offered its F-16 fighter used by countries around the world for the Indian air force's ongoing competition for 114 planes to be made in India.
But Lockheed, unveiling the plan at an air show in the southern city of Bengaluru, said it was offering India a new plane configured for its needs. 
It would carry technologies from its fifth generation planes, the F-22 and the F-35, the firm said.
""The F-21 is different, inside and out,” Vivek Lall, vice president of Strategy and Business Development for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, said in a statement. 
The company will build the plane in collaboration with India's Tata Advanced Systems, the firm said. 
Lockheed is competing with Boeing's F/A-18, Saab's Gripen, Dassault Aviation’s Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon and a Russian aircraft for the air force order. 
The deal to replace the Indian Air Force's ageing fleet of Soviet-era fighter jets is one of the biggest contracts for such planes in play. 
India has a lengthy procurement process, and no decision is expected until well after a national election due by May. 
Lockheed has offered to move its F-16 production plant at Fort Worth, Texas, to India, if it wins the order in a boost for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Make-in-India plan to build a domestic military industrial base and create jobs.
It said it expected to export planes from the proposed plant in India on top of the Indian requirements for an overseas market that it estimated at $20 billion.
But the Indian military has had concerns over the F-16 as an old plane and in an earlier competition it lost out to the eventual winner, the Rafale built by Dassault.
But Lockheed said the F-21 could be India's pathway to the stealth F-35 fighter, which has entered U.S. service in one of the world's most expensive defense programs. 
""The F-21 has common components and learning from Lockheed Martin’s 5th Generation F-22 and F-35 and will share a common supply chain on a variety of components,"" the company said.

It said production in India would create thousands of jobs for Indian industry as well as support hundreds of U.S.-based Lockheed Martin engineering, program management and customer support positions.

862,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>","Saudi Arabia to meet banks on export-credit finance plans, sources say","By Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will soon discuss with international banks its plans to use export-credit agencies in other countries to help it finance infrastructure projects, sources familiar with the matter said.
Saudi Arabia has embarked on an ambitious economic transformation plan involving infrastructure projects worth billions of dollars, in areas ranging from housing to transport.
But it has accumulated almost $60 billion of debt in just over two years, and that has not included financing linked to the infrastructure projects.
In January last year, the country's debt-management office said it had asked banks to submit proposals for potential financing backed by export-credit agencies (ECAs). Those agencies offer loan guarantees and sometimes financing to encourage trade and lower the costs of international business.
Some Saudi entities have already used such financing. Aramco, the state-owned oil company, last year signed a $2 billion line of credit with UK Export Finance, the British ECA.
But more than a year after requesting proposals, the government has not appointed a financial adviser, the sources said. Nor has it said what specific projects the financing would support.
The debt management office did not respond to a request for comment.
INFRASTRUCTURE
Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on mega-projects over the past decades, but a slump in construction and delays in payments to contractors have stalled existing developments. At the same time, lower oil prices have squeezed the state budget.
Work on King Abdullah Financial District, for example, a $10 billion project in Riyadh, began in 2006. But it has run into construction delays, cost overruns and doubts about an initial economic feasibility study.
The kingdom said last month it planned to start developing the first area of NEOM, a high-tech $500 billion business zone, in the first quarter of 2019.
ECA-backed financing could be useful for similar large projects requiring foreign equipment and contractors, as well as cheap debt financing over long periods, the sources said. But, they added, the government has not started talks yet on ECA-backed financing for NEOM.
The government has taken some steps toward project funding. Last November, the debt management office appointed as a temporary adviser MUFG banker Hirofumi Sakioka, who is the deputy head of ECA Finance EMEA at MUFG Bank.

The sources said his appointment was aimed at coordinating ECA financing requirements from various Saudi ministries.
About two years ago, the government asked ministries to review billions of dollars' worth of unfinished projects with a view to shelving or restructuring them.
Many of the projects are relics of an era of high oil prices and lavish state spending, which ended when oil prices began to fall in mid-2014, making it increasingly difficult for Riyadh to find the money needed to complete them.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn's new lawyer took aim at Nissan, prosecutors and courts on Wednesday, dismissing the charges against the ousted chairman as an internal company matter and saying Japan was out of step with international norms by keeping his client in jail. 
""This should have been dealt with as an internal matter,"" Junichiro Hironaka, nicknamed the Razor, said at his first press briefing. 
Ghosn, who was arrested in November over alleged financial misconduct and remains in detention in a Tokyo jail, picked a new team last week with long-time defense attorney Hironaka as a key member to replace Motonari Otsuru, a lawyer who once ran the prosecutor's office investigating him.
Hironaka's combative style contrasts with the low-key approach adopted by a media-shy Otsuru. 
Ghosn's switch to an aggressive legal strategy came after his attempts to win bail failed and just before lawyers were due to sit down with prosecutors and judges for the first time to hash out a schedule for pre-trial discovery meetings, where prosecutors will reveal evidence and submit a list of witnesses. 
Hironaka said he didn't know why Ghosn picked him, but added that Ghosn probably wanted an experienced criminal lawyer as the case moved toward trial. 
The 73-year-old defense attorney is reputed for winning high profile cases, including the acquittal of a senior lawmaker, Ichiro Ozawa, on financial misconduct charges. He also helped free a senior bureaucrat Atsuko Muraki who was jailed for four months on corruption charges fabricated by prosecutors. 
Yet, even with greater legal firepower the former Nissan Motor Co boss faces a criminal justice system where only three out of every hundred defendants pleading not guilty are acquitted. Neither does Japan have a plea deal mechanism that would allow Ghosn to agree to lesser charges for a lighter sentence.
""The change in lawyers means a change in style, but the legal strategy will still be the same,"" I don’t think it increases Ghosn’s chance of an acquittal,” said Masashi Akita, a defense lawyer at Shin-Yu Law Office in Osaka, ahead of Wednesday's comments by Hironaka.
Ghosn has lost his perch atop an automotive alliance trio of French car maker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Japanese automakers Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Attempts to win bail, including an offer to wear a GPS ankle bracelet and hire security guards to stop him trying to tamper with evidence, failed.
Ghosn stands accused of underreporting compensation spanning eight years to the tune of $82 million. He also faces breach of trust charges that he shifted personal losses to Nissan and improperly steered $14.7 million to a Saudi Arabian businessman’s company to help him navigate the problem. Ghosn denies all the charges.
""He is innocent of all the charges,"" Hironaka said. 
LEGAL GAMBIT
In January, former attorney Otsuru outlined some of the defense arguments in a lengthy statement prepared when the former executive requested a court hearing about his detention. Ghosn took the step, rare in Japanese legal proceedings, to profess his innocence and challenge his imprisonment. 
That hearing could end up backfiring, according to some Japanese legal experts because it established a legal strategy before his lawyers had looked at evidence gathered by prosecutors. Critics of that approach include defense lawyer Takashi Takano, a new member of Ghosn's legal team who spoke to Reuters before he was hired. 
""They have shown their hand. That is not something they should have be doing at that stage,"" Takano, who runs his own criminal law practice, said ahead of comments by Ghosn's new lawyer on Wednesday. ""It's like playing rock-paper-scissors and the defense lawyers lost.""
""It is an unusual strategy,"" said Professor Colin Jones, a lawyer and expert in Japan's legal system at Doshisha University in Kyoto. ""There is no plus side to a client statement, all could be used as evidence,"" he added.
Wrangling over witnesses and evidence during pretrial discovery could take as long as a year with a subsequent trial stretching through 2020, the legal experts said. Ghosn's best chance for bail may come about halfway through that process when evidence tampering concerns, the reason given by the court to keep him locked up, ease, they added.
Hironaka said it was difficult to predict when Ghosn will be released. Hironaka and Takano will be joined by Hiroshi Kawatsu from Kasumigaseki Sogo Law Offices to defend Ghosn.

""I have been called the Razor, but it is not a nickname I particularly like. I would rather be known as gentle Hironaka,"" he said.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Wix.com, which helps small businesses build and operate websites, posted higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit and forecast a 25 percent rise in revenue in 2019.
It reported on Wednesday a net profit of 42 cents per share excluding one-time items, up from 16 cents a year earlier. Revenue grew 39 percent to $164 million.
Analysts had forecast adjusted profit of 33 cents a share on revenue of $162 million, I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv showed.
Israel-based Wix offers free basic features for setting up websites but users must pay for extra services such as shopping carts, individual web addresses and site traffic analysis.
The company has 142 million registered users. During the quarter it added 147,000 paid users to reach 4 million premium customers, up 24 percent from the end of 2017.
Wix projects 2019 revenue of $755-$761 million, up 25-26 percent from 2018. Analysts were forecasting revenue of $761 million.
Chief Financial Officer Lior Shemesh said Wix expects to generate free cash flow of about $155 million, from which it will use $15-$20 million for new growth initiatives.
""If there will be upside from those investments it's not part of our guidance. Potentially there's an upside,"" he told Reuters, noting 2018 was a record year for product launches.
The company has seen strong demand for its paid set of tools Ascend, which was launched in December and allows businesses to connect with and manage customers.
President Nir Zohar said Wix's main competitor is Squarespace, a private New York-based firm. There has been some recent M&A activity in the sector, with the $2 billion acquisition of Web.com by Siris Capital and Square (NYSE:SQ) Inc's $365 million purchase of Weebly. 

For the first quarter Wix, whose shares have jumped nearly 70 percent in the past year, estimates revenue of $172-$173 million, up 25-26 percent from a year earlier.

866,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 05:10AM ET</span>",Tencent to maintain aggressive investment stance in face of challenging 2019,"By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings Ltd said investment is central to its overall strategy and so it will maintain its scale of investment after an aggressive 2018, brushing aside near-term risks such as the bursting of China's tech bubble as economic growth slows.
In the first detailed review of investment performance, President Martin Lau also said 2018 was Tencent's best year as a record 16 portfolio companies went public, and that it had invested in more than 700 companies over the past 11 years.
The comments come as Tencent battles investor concerns of slowing growth in the video game and social media giant's core businesses as the government increases scrutiny of online content and services. 
Speaking at a closed-door investor conference in Beijing last month, Lau said business conditions in China's internet sector are challenging and are likely to worsen before improving, according to a transcript of his speech reviewed by Reuters on Wednesday.
""Every time after major crises or bubbles, those who survive become the best companies,"" Lau said. ""So in my view, short-term pressure may intensify, but I'm optimistic for the long-term... Even though now is a relatively bad time, the best time awaits afterwards.""
Tencent was unable to make money from new games due to regulatory change for most of last year, during which time its stock lost 23 percent or $114 billion in market value after peaking in January 2018.
China's top content regulator has stopped accepting new applications to monetize video games as it processes a backlog built up during a nine-month hiatus last year, Reuters reported on Wednesday citing sources. The move could further delay the revival of gaming revenue growth at companies such as Tencent.
Though the decline of Tencent's market capitalization last year was staggering, Lau referred to 2018 as Tencent's best year in terms of investment since the department was formed in 2008, citing the number of IPO exits. He said 63 of its portfolio companies over the past 11 years are now listed, and 122 are ""unicorns"" valued at more than $1 billion. 
The combined market value of companies in which Tencent holds a stake of 5 percent or more has exceeded $500 billion, he said. Tencent's own market capitalization now stands at $409 billion, making the firm Asia's second-largest after New York-listed  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding.
Lau dismissed criticism that Tencent had ""turned into an investment bank"" that prioritizes investment than growing its core business. ""Investment is a core strategy for Tencent"" and allows it to focus on its core business, he said. 
As such, he said Tencent ""would not scale back"" investment in 2019 regardless of challenges such as economic slowdown in China and competition that is set to ""increase pressure for the entire (tech) sector"".
Tencent in November posted a better-than-expected 30 percent quarterly profit rise, as investment gains offset the impact of the freeze on new game approvals. 

It is due to report full-year earnings figures on March 21.

Investing.com -- The U.K. grocery business retail is tough: the margins are thin and the pressure from discounters such as Germany’s Lidl and Aldi – to say nothing of online disruptors – is relentless.
J  Sainsbury  (LON:SBRY) had looked to shore up its position by buying Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) U.K. subsidiary Asda, a move that would have combined the second- and third-largest players in the market and overtaken  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) as the biggest player in the sector, with a market share of over 31%.
However, the deal is in tatters this morning after the Competition and Markets Authority said in a preliminary review that it’s inclined to block the sale.
Normally, if antitrust watchdogs are concerned by mergers, they can order the parties involved to sell a package of assets to competitors, but today the CMA said it’s struggling to find a way to do even this.
Sainsbury’s shares are cratering as a result – they’re down 15% and on course for their worst one-day drop in 11 years. But they’re not the only victims. Rival WM Morrison (LON:MRW) is also down 4.9%, as its chances of snapping up some decent assets cheaply evaporate. Tesco also fell initially but was up 0.3% by 0500 AM ET (1000 GMT). While the CMA wouldn’t have let Tesco buy any of Sainsbury-Asda’s castaways, its might have benefited from consolidation in the sector.
This is, of course, why the CMA blocked it: bureaucrats aren’t going to get any points from their political masters by letting food retailers pad their margins just as a hard Brexit threatens to create shortages of fresh imported food.
For comparison, the broader U.K. FTSE 100 index is up 0.1% after early trading, with big buyback programs from Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank and miner  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) lifting the mood. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600, meanwhile, is up 0.2% at 369.62.
Curiously, the one company that may not suffer too much is Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Although investors will be disappointed that it won’t after all make a quick, clean exit from a struggling market, they’ll be much more focused on the stellar results  that it posted from its core U.S. business on Tuesday."

The home of Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche generated a surplus of 22 billion euros ($25 billion) in automotive trade with U.S. last year, according to a breakdown of data from the Federal Statistics Office. That’s roughly in line with the previous two years, but down from the 27 billion-euro surplus in 2015.
Cars remained the most important export product for Europe’s largest economy, and the U.S. was the biggest market, importing 27.2 billion euros worth of German autos and parts in 2018. By comparison, Germany imported just 5.2 billion euros of equivalent U.S. goods.
If Trump decides on permanent tariffs of 25 percent, German car exports to the U.S. could fall by almost 50 percent in the long term, according to a study by the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute. Such tariffs would reduce Germany’s car exports by 7.7 percent, or the equivalent of 18.4 billion euros, Ifo Director Gabriel Felbermayr said.
Chancellor Angela Merkel gave an impassioned defense of the country’s car industry over the weekend, calling the Trump administration’s suggestion that European autos are a threat to U.S. security a “shock.” The European Union has vowed swift retaliation if Trump follows through on his threat and has prepared tariffs on a total of 20 billion euros in U.S. goods.

871,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2019 04:49AM ET</span>",Sainsbury's-Asda deal in doubt as UK regulator raises big objections,"By Paul Sandle and Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's competition regulator has dealt a potentially fatal blow to Sainsbury's planned $9.5 billion takeover of Walmart's Asda, saying it was unlikely the companies would be able to address its ""extensive"" concerns about the deal.
Shares in Sainsbury's plunged as much as 16 percent on Wednesday after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said its provisional view was the deal should be blocked or require the sale of a large number of stores, or even one of the brands.
""Close to the worst possible outcome (for the companies),"" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne.
Sainsbury's, Britain's second-biggest supermarket group, and number three Asda agreed the deal last April, aiming to overtake market leader  Tesco  (LON:TSCO). They hope their combined buying power would help them better compete with fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl, an enlarged Tesco after its purchase of wholesaler Booker and online retailers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The deal, which would create a company with annual revenue of about 51 billion pounds ($66 billion), more than 2,800 stores and a grocery market share of 31.2 percent, also gave the world's biggest retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) a way to exit the British market, one of the weakest performers in its portfolio.
But the CMA said it had ""extensive"" concerns about the plan as it could lead to a worse experience for in-store and online shoppers through higher prices, a poorer shopping experience and reductions in the range and quality of products offered.
It was ""likely to be difficult for the companies to address"" those concerns, it said, adding it was also worried prices could rise at a large number of Sainsbury's and Asda petrol stations.
Sainsbury's said it fundamentally disagreed with the findings. ""We will fight right the way through the process,"" its chief executive Mike Coupe said.
At 0850 GMT, Sainsbury's shares were down 13 percent at 250.8 pence. Smaller rival Morrisons, which could benefit from two of its rivals being distracted by a takeover and the exit of Walmart, fell 4 percent, while Tesco's shares were little changed.
MOVING GOALPOSTS
The CMA will now seek responses and submissions from all interested parties ahead of a final report due by April 30.
Bernstein's Monteyne said the provisional findings were likely to lead to a closer focus on Sainsbury's underlying trading performance, which has been weak, and the challenges it would face as a standalone company.
""Enough worries to make the shares nearly uninvestable in the next few months,"" he said.
The CMA's objections contrast with the relatively easy passage given to Tesco's takeover of Britain's biggest wholesaler Booker, which rivals and some analysts had argued would give Tesco an almost unassailable position in UK retail.
""The CMA has moved the goalposts and its analysis is inconsistent with comparable cases,"" Sainsbury's said.
""We will be working to understand the rationale behind these findings and will continue to make our case in the coming weeks.""
Under the takeover plan, Walmart would receive 3 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) and take a 42 percent stake in the combined business. Walmart has the option of selling down to 29.9 percent after two years and exiting completely after four.
The two groups have said they would lower prices on ""everyday items"" by around 10 percent, financed by cost savings from big suppliers.
Both companies have declined to say how many forced store disposals would make the deal unattractive, but a source with knowledge of the two firms' thinking has told Reuters a figure ""into the hundreds"" could scupper it.

UBS, Sainsbury's house broker, has said the deal's economics can absorb at least 132 store disposals and potentially dozens more.

The disappointing performance in the trading unit is a blow for Glencore, which has always said its traders can make money in any kind of market. The company touts the unit as a differentiator from other big miners, cushioning the ups and downs of the commodities cycle.
Still, Glencore’s shares rose with other miners in London after it announced a new $2 billion buyback program and said it plans to return another $1 billion after selling non-core assets over the course of this year. The commodities giant also pledged to cap coal production in response to investor pressure for action on climate change.
Glencore rose 0.8 percent as of 9:05 a.m. in London, as the FTSE 350 Mining Index gained 1.1 percent.
Glencore is coming off a tough year that included news of a U.S. corruption probe and being caught up in the fallout from U.S. sanctions on Russia. The company’s shares have underperformed rivals and the latest buyback follows $2 billion of repurchases announced last year.
Chief Executive Officer Ivan Glasenberg told investors last year that the company was focused on cutting debt and returning money to shareholders, with little of interest on the acquisition front. The CEO echoed those sentiments on Wednesday, saying there’s not much to do with Glencore’s cash other than buying back shares.
“Glencore remains in a strong financial position, but the sell-off in its shares relative to peers clearly leaves it feeling a little defensive,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Edward Sterck said in a note. “The share buyback reinforces this perspective and does seem like the most sensible option.”
Glencore’s trading earnings before interest and taxes dropped to $2.4 billion, down 17 percent from a year earlier, missing the company’s forecasts from just two months ago. The trading earnings before interest and taxes is the lowest since 2013. Glencore pointed to cobalt and alumina trades for the drop, but the marketing profit was weaker in many of its other key commodities, including a 25 percent drop in energy trading. Glencore is the world’s largest cobalt trader.
Glencore’s challenges in the Democratic Republic of Congo have also continued to pile up. The company took a $600 million writedown on its Mutanda mine in the country and will halve copper production at the operation this year, producing just 100,000 tons.
The company has been laying off workers at the site as it considers a plan to stop mining oxide ores. However, the decision comes after the country implemented a new mining code that raises taxes and royalties and as cobalt prices fall sharply.
Glasenberg said the company’s limits on coal production will tighten the market, which bodes well for prices. There’s very little new coal supply coming, but demand is still growing, the CEO said on a call after earnings.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco's Chief Executive Officer Amin Nassar said on Wednesday that the company is in talks with India's Reliance Industries Ltd for possible investments and is seeking other opportunities in the country. 
Saudi Aramco signed an agreement in April with a consortium of state-owned Indian refiners to participate in a $44 billion refinery project on the country's west coast. 
""We are looking at additional investment in India so we are in discussions with other companies as well, including Reliance and others,"" Nasser said in a panel discussion in New Delhi.
""We are looking at it. We are not limited to that investment which is the mega refinery,"" Nasser said, referring to the west coast project, which would process 1.2 million bpd of crude and produce 18 million tonnes per year of petrochemicals.
Nasser is part of the entourage traveling with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is in India for a one-day visit.
Reliance Industries, controlled by Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani, is India's biggest refining and petrochemicals company and runs a 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) refinery in western India. It plans to expand the capacity to 2 million bpd by 2030, according to plans shared with the Indian government. 
Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude oil exporter, is keen to expand further into oil refining and petrochemicals.
India would provide a fast growing market for oil and fuels and is already a steady buyer of Saudi oil. 
""India is an investment priority for Saudi Aramco. India takes from us almost 800,000 barrels a day and by 2040 India's total consumption will be around 8.2 million barrels per day,"" Nasser said. 
India is currently world's third-biggest crude oil consumer with demand of 4.7 million bpd, according to government figures.
However, Aramco is already facing delays for the refinery project, planned for the western state of Maharashtra, as thousands of farmers have refused to surrender land for it.
Reuters reported on Tuesday the Maharashtra government is looking to move the refinery location.
Yousef al-Benyan, the chief executive officer for SABIC, the Saudi Arabia-based petrochemical company that is the fourth largest in the world, was also on the panel. He said SABIC wants to expand its business and presence in India.

As Nissan and  Renault  (PA:RENA) seek to repair their 20-year alliance in the wake of ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn's arrest, the selection of his successor at the Japanese firm remains a sensitive issue, and the latest consideration is likely to increase tensions between them.
""This option would not be very welcome,"" one of the sources told Reuters, while another person familiar with the issue has said that such a move ""could create a conflict of interest"" as a single person will oversee both Nissan and Renault.
They declined to be named as the discussions are private and the committee has not reached a decision on its recommendations.
The committee, due to make recommendations next month on corporate governance including procedures for executive appointments and compensation, is also considering other alternatives, the people said.
Those include appointing an external chairman and limiting the chairman's responsibilities largely to a liaison role with other alliance members. It is also looking at setting up a group of internal and external members which would nominate the chairman, audit the process and determine how much board members get paid, the people said.
Nissan has vowed to break away from its current executive structure, a legacy of Ghosn who concurrently served as chairman of Renault, Nissan and partner Mitsubishi Motors, and CEO of Renault.
Such attempts could stoke concerns at Renault and particularly the French government, Renault's biggest shareholder which has said that it would like to see the chairmanship of Renault and Nissan held by the same person.
During a visit to Japan last week, Renault's newly appointed Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard told reporters that it was not the time to discuss whether he would also take over as chairman of Nissan. He is expected to be named to Nissan's board, given Renault's 43 percent ownership of Nissan.
Nissan said it was not in a position to comment on the ongoing deliberations of the committee.
""The committee is independent from Nissan,"" a Nissan spokesman said. 
Since Ghosn's arrest in November, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa has blasted the once feted executive for holding too much power in the company. After Renault rescued Nissan from near bankruptcy in 1999, Ghosn has spent the majority of his time at Nissan as CEO and chairman.
The automaker accuses Ghosn of using company funds for personal purposes and making secret arrangements to receive additional compensation upon retirement, and that a lack of accountability facilitated such activity. Ghosn has denied the accusations.

Some Nissan executives have long been unhappy with what they see as Renault's outsized influence over larger Nissan, and Ghosn's push for a deeper tie-up between the automakers, including possibly a full merger, despite reservations at Nissan. The Japanese automaker holds a 15 percent, non-voting stake in the French firm.

Roger Ng has been detained in Kuala Lumpur since Nov. 1, soon after the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) filed charges against him for allegedly laundering funds siphoned from the fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
Last week a Malaysian court ruled for Ng to be extradited to the United States, pending an order from the home affairs ministry.
""We will carry out the extradition, but we want to make sure that this case in Malaysia will be completed first,"" Home Affairs Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said on Tuesday.
Malaysia's attorney-general had advised that Ng remain in the country until he has been tried on the separate criminal charges, he added.
""That is the advice of the attorney-general and we will likely follow it,"" Muhyiddin said in an audio recording of his news conference heard by Reuters.
Ng's lawyer, Tan Hock Chuan, was not immediately available to comment. The attorney-general's office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. 
Malaysian authorities and the DoJ are investigating Goldman Sachs for its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB. 
Ng was charged in Kuala Lumpur with four counts of abetting the bank to provide misleading statements in the offering prospectus for the bonds the bank helped sell for 1MDB.
The DoJ has estimated that a total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped raise. 
Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to it about the bond sale proceeds.
Tim Leissner, another Goldman Sachs official, and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho have also been charged in the United States over the scandal. Leissner has pleaded guilty.

880,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 10:29PM ET</span>",Tokyo's drive to expel zombie stocks hits small caps,"By Hideyuki Sano and Tomo Uetake
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Tokyo Stock Exchange's push to weed out small and weak firms from its main board could take years, but some fund managers are already ditching small-caps for fear they could be excluded from benchmarks.
Asia's second largest stock exchange is expected to unveil a plan in coming months to revamp its stock market structure, in part a response to criticism that it has too many listed firms on the main board, seen as the blue ribbon segment of the bourse, and its Topix index.
""It's good that the TSE wants to do something about the Topix index, which appears to be making Japan look full of zombie companies,"" said Toru Ohara, chief investment officer at Okasan Asset Management.
""A stock market benchmark is a strategic product for a country. Having a strong stock index is one of the cheapest ways to boost the economy,"" he said.
In November, there were 2,119 firms on the TSE's first section - that compares with 292 in Euronext's compartment A and 500 in London Stock Exchange's Premium Listing. 
And it's not far off the 2,434 in the New York Stock Exchange in the United States, whose economy is almost four times bigger than Japan's.
Unlike the main bourses of Wall Street and elsewhere - where the numbers of listings have shrunk due to mergers, failures to meet listing standards and bankruptcies - Tokyo's list of counters has risen over the last three decades.
Additionally, there has been less shareholder pressure in Japan for companies to boost profits while the exchange's exit rules are considered relatively lax. 
As a result, about a third of main board's counters are now valued at below the 25 billion yen ($226 million) mark the exchange itself sets as a minimum for new listings. Many of them also trade below their book value.
SMALL CAP WHACK
Some fund managers have already started to take the TSE's reform drive into consideration.
""That is something investors keep in some corner of their mind,"" said Yas Iwanaga, chief investment officer at Amundi Japan. 
Indeed, small caps have underperformed the overall market since November, when an external panel set up by TSE to look into the issue proposed the exchange should consider having stricter rules for companies to stay on the main board.
The Topix Small, an index of all listed firms excluding top 500 companies, has fallen 5.4 percent, compared with a 2.6 percent fall in the Topix.
The Topix Small Value fared worse, falling 5.6 percent.
""I wouldn't say small cap shares will be deserted forever. If they become cheaper, there will be some buying,"" said Amundi's Iwanaga. 
Japan small cap shares: https://tmsnrt.rs/2BAcF6k 
While some analysts attribute the small cap underperformance to global demand for bigger stocks, most agree a major change at the TSE would have a huge impact on markets.
""It would be such an easy, tradable idea. Small, value shares would come under major pressure,"" said Masahiro Suzuki, senior quantitative analyst at Daiwa Securities.
At the same time, many investors believe attempts to trim the main board would meet corporate opposition given the prestige such listings hold in Japan.
Main board firms have better access to bank loans and are seen attracting top talent more easily. 
""It even affects staff at those companies, because it is easier for people working for the main board companies to get housing loans for instance,"" said an executive at asset management firm, who declined to be identified as he is not authorised to speak publicly on the matter. ""You should expect very strong resistance.""
It would also be difficult to get consensus on criteria for the main board. Many investors worry that market capitalisation thresholds would exclude some promising companies.
Given likely resistance, some market patcipants think a better solution for the TSE would be to create a new elite market above the first section, rather than kicking out existing companies.
Akira Kiyota, CEO of Japan Exchange Group, which runs TSE, has said he personally thinks there are too many markets now, noting the current four: the first and second sections and two start-up markets.
But he has so far steered clear of saying how he wants to streamline and when he plans to make changes, citing ongoing discussion at the panel.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component both gained 0.4% by 9:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT), while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index advanced 1%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged up 0.2% even after the Ministry of Finance's data showed the country’s exports recorded their biggest decline in more than two years in January.
Exports fell 8.4% in the year to January, versus the expected 5.5% annual drop and followed a revised 3.9% year-on-year drop last December.
Elsewhere, South Korea’s KOSPI was up 1.0%. Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 was down 0.4%.
The gain in Asian shares came after Trump said on Tuesday that trade talks with China are going well, and that the current March deadline is not a ""magical date.""
Last week, he told reporters that he is willing to extend the deadline if China and the U.S. get closer to a deal.
His comments were in contrast with the White House’s earlier remark, in which March 1 was referred to as a “hard deadline.”
The world's two largest economies began their latest round of trade talks this week in Washington to resolve their trade spat. High-level discussions are scheduled to happen later in the week, the White House said Monday.
In other news, Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi told the delegation of U.S. business leaders on Tuesday that the U.S. needs to respect China’s right to develop.
""Just like the United States, China also has the right to development, and the Chinese people also have the right to have a good life,” said Wang.
""The U.S. side should recognize that China's development is in the world's interest, as well as the United States'. Only by seeing China's development as an opportunity for the United States can this help resolve certain problems, including trade and economic ones,"" Wang added."
883,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 09:20PM ET</span>",The Reasons Why China's Stock Rally Is Nearing $1 Trillion,"(Bloomberg) -- As suddenly as it rolled in, the crisis of confidence that shook Chinese stocks last year may be ending.
The rally since January has added more than $893 billion to the value of the country’s equities, lifting Shenzhen’s risky startups and state-backed giants alike. The rebound has been so quick and widespread that it’s already triggered signs of overheating in four of China’s major benchmarks. The CSI 300 Index’s 14 percent rally is its best start to any year in a decade, and turnover across all exchanges is the highest since March.
While valuations have been low for months, Chinese equities really took off only after another set of weak economic data made monetary policy easing almost a certainty. Gains intensified when the new securities watchdog eased restrictions on trading, encouraging an increase in leveraged bets. Ample liquidity and a streak of foreign buying have fueled volumes.
“It’s essentially a reflection of change in investor expectations,” said Wang Chen, a Shanghai-based partner with XuFunds Investment Management Co. “The rally’s been driven by a return in risk appetite and a valuation catch-up.”
The recovery is an about-face from 2018, when the government’s deleveraging campaign triggered a liquidity crunch and record bond defaults. Sentiment was so bearish after the equity market’s $2.3 trillion rout that average turnover was down to nearly the lowest in four years by December.
Traders are quickly moving on from last month’s deluge of profit warnings and China’s weaker economic growth, focusing instead on all the reasons why the outlook should improve. An interest-rate cut from the People’s Bank of China is on the cards, while next month’s annual gathering of top-level officials may spawn more supportive policies. Even Chinese state media has chimed in, highlighting the growing bull case for stocks.
Next week’s decision by MSCI Inc. on whether to include a broader array of A shares in its indexes may also provide another catalyst.
The concern is that China’s equity rebound is on shaky ground, underpinned mostly by fickle investor sentiment. Evidence of speculative trading has popped up in some of the riskiest parts of the market, and traders are borrowing more cash to chase the rally. Skeptics say only a better-than-expected recovery in profit growth will drive the next leg up.
“The rally lacks fundamental support,” said Jeff Chang, chairman of Cathay Securities Investment Trust Co. in Taipei. “It’s hard to see the indexes move up much higher unless earnings turn out better than expected.”
Depressed valuations keep attracting dip buyers for now. The CSI 300 still trades at less than 11 times projected earnings -- about a quarter lower than last year’s peak. Even the ChiNext Index of small caps is 35 percent cheaper than its five-year average. That means there are still plenty of opportunities in China even if the rebound isn’t as broad going forward, according to Arthur Kwong, head of Asia Pacific equities at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management in Hong Kong.
“Prices have already rebounded quite a lot and it’s time to be more selective, rather than to buy a whole basket of stocks,"" he said.

To win approval for the $2 billion deal, the companies agreed to sell NxStage's bloodline tubing set business, the agency said. Fresenius and NxStage together dominate the market for the single-use plastic tubes used during dialysis, the agency said.
The five FTC commissioners split along party lines in voting on whether to approve the merger. The three Republicans, Joseph Simons, Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson, voted ""yes,"" while Democrats Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Slaughter dissented.
A spokesman for Fresenius was not available for comment outside of European business hours.
Fresenius and rival DaVita Inc dominate the U.S. market for dialysis clinics. Fresenius, which has 2,200 U.S. dialysis clinics, struck the deal to buy NxStage in August 2017 as a way for it to move into cheaper home dialysis. It has served 190,000 U.S. patients, according to its website.
Simons and the Republican commissioners defended the settlement by arguing that since most patients cannot use in-home dialysis, the two services do not compete against each other, among other reasons.
Chopra and Slaughter, in separate statements, noted that the clinic dialysis market was already concentrated and that the merger could lead to higher prices for people with kidney ailments.

886,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 08:30PM ET</span>",Huawei Issue Opens Rift Between U.S. and Global Carriers,"(Bloomberg) -- A group representing top U.S. mobile service providers disagreed with European and Asian counterparts over alleged security threats from Chinese equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co. ahead of a conference that will highlight a U.S.-Europe divide on the issue.
A Feb. 14 release from GSMA, a London-based wireless industry group, urged European lawmakers not to ban Huawei as a supplier. But CTIA, a Washington-based group, responded Tuesday with its own statement saying the GSMA “does not represent the views of all wireless operators or all regions.”
The divergent statements underscore a fissure opening between Washington and carriers and regulators around the world, who’re starting to re-evaluate U.S. warnings that China’s largest technology corporation aids Beijing in espionage. This week, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern left the door open for Huawei to play a role in the rollout of next-generation networks, while a senior Italian government official dismissed the issue.
European carriers offered to cooperate with their governments in devising steps to ward off vulnerabilities. CTIA, with members that include U.S. market leaders AT&T Inc (NYSE:T). and  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ)., has urged U.S. regulators to go slow in crafting rules on equipment security.
“It looks like they’re scared of the impact of European policy-making on the rollout of their 5G networks” that will offer advanced speeds, said Gigi Sohn, a fellow at the Georgetown University Law Center Institute for Technology Law and Policy, said of the U.S. group. “It seems they’re concerned that if Europe does so, it would become the de facto standard.”
Beyond U.S.-Chinese bickering, economics plays an important role in what gear goes into future 5G networks, the advent of which are expected to galvanize everything from smart cities and self-driving cars to fully automated homes. Huawei’s technology is considered on par with the likes of Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) or Nokia’s, but more cost-effective. LG Uplus, the smallest of Korea’s carriers, is an open supporter and its patronage helped the country become the largest initial market for Huawei’s 5G equipment.
A GSMA spokesman in an emailed comment Tuesday said its “initial statement was clearly focused on activity in Europe and does not reflect the views of all GSMA members globally.” The group says it represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide. The group lists AT&T and Verizon as members.
The U.S. government is increasing the size of its usual delegation to the GSMA’s annual industry conference, MWC Barcelona, to be held next week. Huawei is also bolstering its presence at the event, setting the scene for a showdown as both sides try to win over the chief executives of the world’s biggest carriers.
The U.S. and China clashed Saturday at a security conference in Munich over whether Huawei’s equipment should be banned from future 5G networks. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said the company is required to turn over data to Beijing’s security officials. Chinese politburo member Yang Jiechi was up next on the same stage, and said his country’s law doesn’t require companies to collect intelligence. Yang urged Europeans to consider whether the U.S. had their interests at heart, or its own.
Shenzhen-based Huawei has denied wrongdoing and long maintained it doesn’t provide back doors for the Chinese government, pointing out that no one has provided evidence to support such concerns.
CTIA didn’t specify what was objectionable in GSMA’s 800-word statement.
“We can achieve our 5G ambitions with a secure global supply chain that reflects national security concerns,” the CTIA said. “We caution against a patchwork approach of different rules for different regions which would result in less competition in supply chains.”
GSMA on Feb. 14 said “mobile operators are ready to work with European agencies in charge of promoting certification and security requirements.” It recommended that “governments and mobile operators work together to agree” on a testing and certification regime for Europe.
The FCC should “work with other expert agencies to conduct a thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of the costs and benefits of various approaches before taking action” on network security, CTIA said last year in a filing at the agency. The FCC is considering whether to bar spending of U.S. subsidies on companies deemed a security risk.
Jilane Rodgers Petrie, a spokeswoman for CTIA, didn’t return a telephone call and email.
The Feb. 14 statement from GSMA didn’t mention Huawei by name. Restricting access to a network equipment maker would handicap Europe’s progress in developing artificial intelligence, the “internet of things” and so-called big data, the group of more than 750 companies said. The technology promises to deliver data to phones 10 times faster than 4G and to connect people, cars, factories and household objects.
The joint appeal follows individual warnings from companies such as Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn),  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) Plc and BT Group (LON:BT) Plc and underscores how alarmed the companies have become that they may not be able to use one of their biggest suppliers. In Asia, carriers from South Korea to the Philippines have said they plan to continue using Huawei equipment.
The GSMA on Feb. 14 said its members had found no evidence of wrongdoing even though they have been “meticulously” testing mobile infrastructure for years. The group said it would create a task force to find ways to strengthen existing security testing.
(An earlier version was corrected to say AT&T, Verizon are members of the GSMA.)

887,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 07:55PM ET</span>","Ford to close oldest Brazil plant, exit South America truck biz","By Marcelo Rochabrun, Alberto Alerigi and Ben Klayman
SAO PAULO/DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Tuesday it will close its oldest factory in Brazil and exit its heavy commercial truck business in South America, a move that could cost more than 2,700 jobs as part of a restructuring meant to end losses around the world. 
Ford previously said the global reorganization, to impact thousands of jobs and possible plant closures in Europe, would result in $11 billion in charges. 
Following that announcement, analysts and investors had expected a similar restructuring in South America. Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett said last month that investors would not have to wait long for the South American reorganization plan.
The factory slated for closure is in Sao Bernardo do Campo, an industrial suburb of Sao Paulo that has operated since 1967. It first produced a number of auto models before being switched predominantly to trucks in 2001. It makes the F-4000 and F-350 trucks, as well as the Fiesta small car, a sales laggard.
The factory closure may mean Ford is refocusing on the core of its car business in Latin America's largest economy, based in a much newer factory in the northeastern state of Bahia. But the job cuts in Brazil's industrial heartland represent a psychological blow for the new administration of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, which is battling an unemployment rate above 11 percent. 
Ford's latest cuts come as investors watch for signs of progress on the company's alliance with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG, which already encompasses commercial vans and pickup trucks but may soon expand into electric and self-driving cars. The two automakers have also pledged to work together on other projects, which could include combining capacity in regions like South America.
Ford shares closed up 3.4 percent at $8.83 in New York. 
""You can’t cost cut your way to prosperity in the long term,"" said David Kudla, who heads Michigan-based Mainstay Capital Management, a firm that previously owned Ford stock. ""We want to hear about the future, what you’re doing for mobility services and autonomous vehicles.""
The closure is also a blow to the industrial outskirts of Sao Paulo, where Brazil's automotive industry was born and which long drove its industrial growth. It is also where imprisoned former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva came to fame as a union leader who organized massive strikes that helped harken the end of the military dictatorship.
The union in Sao Bernardo did not have an immediate comment. But Sao Bernardo Mayor Orlando Morando complained angrily that Ford gave no warning and failed to discuss the closure with the workers.
""The 2,800 families directly affected and another 2,000 indirectly affected deserved a chance to react. This is an act of cowardice,"" Morando's office said in a statement.
A Ford spokesman declined to provide a precise figure for job cuts but acknowledged there would be ""a significant impact"" and said the automaker would work with unions and other affected parties on ""next steps.""
Ford South America President Lyle Watters said on Tuesday the automaker remains ""committed"" to South America, a region where it is not currently profitable.
SLOW GROWTH 
Sales of Ford cars and light trucks grew by 10 percent between 2017 and 2018 in Brazil, lagging a 15 percent post-recession increase for the industry as a whole. 
In the trucks business, it ranked fourth, with sales less than half those of Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen.
Ford said in October it would stop building its Focus compact cars in Argentina in May 2019 as part of efforts to end its losses in the region.
Kleiton Da Silva, an employee and union representative in Ford's surviving Bahia plant, said the carmaker was in talks to cut 650 of its workforce there, which the automaker has said totals 4,604.

The No. 2 U.S. automaker expects to record pre-tax special charges of about $460 million, with most of that recorded this year, it said in the statement.

The Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday said it had settled three reverse payment fights with units of Teva, which will be prohibited from making similar agreements with competitors in the future. 
The FTC has long fought against so-called ""pay for delay"" settlements, in which a brand-name drugmaker pays or otherwise compensates a generic rival to delay releasing a cheaper version of its product. The deal is often struck to resolve patent litigation.
""This broad settlement prevents the world’s largest manufacturer of generic drugs from entering into collusive agreements that prevent price competition by keeping generic drugs off the market,"" FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a statement.
""We are very pleased to put these litigations against the FTC behind us,"" said Brendan O’Grady, a Teva executive vice president.
The FTC believes that paying rivals to stay off the market is a violation of antitrust law and fought one case to the Supreme Court, which agreed that it could be in some circumstances.
The agency has said that the deals cost consumers billions annually in higher drug costs.
In Congress, Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat now running for president, and Senator Chuck Grassley, the Republican chair of the Judiciary Committee, introduced legislation in January to make such deals explicitly illegal.
The oldest of the three cases settled on Tuesday dates to 2009, when the FTC sued  Solvay  (BR:SOLB) Pharmaceuticals for paying off Watson Pharmaceuticals, Par Pharmaceutical Co and Paddock Laboratories to delay bringing out a generic version of AndroGel, a testosterone cream. Watson is now owned by Teva.
The second case dates to 2014 and also involves AndroGel. In this instance,  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV), which had acquired the drug, was accused of paying off Teva and another generic maker to again delay bringing out a cheaper version of the medicine.
In the third case, Endo Pharmaceuticals was accused of paying generic companies, including Watson, to refrain from bringing out a generic version of Lidoderm, which is used to relieve nerve pain. Endo settled with the FTC in 2017.

FTC litigation continues against Solvay and other of the brand name drug companies. The agency also said it would press on with a lawsuit accusing AbbVie and a partner for filing baseless patent litigation claims.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed on Tuesday to expand a rule that allows companies to sound prospective investors out privately before going public.
The move forms part of a broader push by SEC chairman Jay Clayton to make it easier for companies to go public by relaxing rules, amid worries that a 50 percent decline in U.S. listings over the past two decades is hurting investors.
The so-called ""testing-the-waters"" proposal, currently restricted to smaller firms preparing to go public, would be extended to all prospective issuers hoping to gauge broader market interest before filing registration statements for initial public offerings (IPOs), the SEC said.
Clayton said in a statement that the proposal, which is subject to consultation and a final vote by the agency's commissioners, would allow companies to better identify information that is important to investors in advance of a public offering.
Clayton has floated other proposed changes to make life easier for public companies, including overhauling rules governing shareholder voting. 
Tuesday's proposal would expand a provision first introduced by the 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) that currently applies only to small growth companies.
""This will benefit issuers as it provides a realistic window into the level of investor interest in an IPO as well as more accurately priced IPOs. Currently, the process is somewhat opaque,"" said Dina Ellis Rochkind, a lawyer with Paul Hastings LLP who helped draft the JOBS Act when she worked on Capitol Hill.
""Expanding these provisions to all potential issuers is another step in the right direction.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.03%, the S&P 500 added 0.15%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.19%.
With less than two weeks until the current 90-day trade war truce expires, President Donald Trump hinted the March 1 deadline could be extended, saying it is not a ""magical date.""
The United States and China kicked off another round of talks as they look to reach a deal before the deadline.
Trade-sensitive names like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) ended the session in the red.
In the run-up to the talks, Trump said in tweet: “Big progress being made on soooo (sic) many different fronts!”
Dow component Walmart (NYSE:WMT) rose 2% after it reported fourth-quarter results that topped estimates from Investing.com on the bottom line, supported by a 43% surge in e-commerce.
The upbeat report from Walmart comes a week after the U.S. Census Bureau said retail sales in December fell by the most since 2009, which fueled fears that the strength of the U.S. consumer was on the wane.
In tech, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) came under fire as U.K. lawmakers dubbed the social media company a ""digital gangster,"" claiming it had knowingly violating data and privacy laws in the country.
Other FANG stocks, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ended the day higher.
Energy also propped up the broader market as oil prices settled higher despite a report from the Energy Information Administration forecasting a jump in shale output.
U.S. oil output from seven major shale plays is forecast to climb by 84,000 barrels a day in March to 8.398 million barrels a day, according to a report from the EIA.
Concerns about global growth, however, kept a lid on gains in the broader market.
The World Trade Organization warned its outlook on trade growth could be revised downward if trade conditions continue to deteriorate. Trade growth is currently forecast to slow to 3.7% in 2019 from an expected 3.9% in 2018.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks gained ground on Tuesday as upbeat results from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) boosted investor sentiment and high-level U.S.-China trade talks resumed in Washington. 
All three major U.S. equity indexes closed higher, with the Nasdaq ending its seventh consecutive day in the black. 
Stocks pared their gains late in the session, however, after a Reuters story quoted New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) saying a different economic outlook would be necessary for the U.S. Federal Reserve to resume its interest rate hikes. 
""(Williams) did say (the Fed was) going to be drawing down the balance sheet for some time,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""Perhaps that caused some concern in the markets.""
Consumer discretionary stocks, led by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), provided the biggest lift to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, while Walmart Inc headed up the blue-chip Dow's advance.
Walmart reported a better-than-expected jump in same-store sales during the holiday quarter, sending shares of the world's largest retailer up 2.2 percent. 
""Walmart is the big story today,"" said senior market strategist for Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management in Minneapolis. ""You take a look at what we had last week with weaker-than-expected retail sales, and now Walmart's coming in saying they had the best Christmas season in some time.

The minutes are expected to reaffirm the central bank's statement last month that it would be ""patient"" with respect to further rate hikes after markets swooned late in December on fears of an economic slowdown.
Indeed, in the quarters ahead, analysts see a slowdown in corporate profit growth. While fourth-quarter profits are expected to have increased by 16.3 percent, the outlook going forward grows cloudier.
First-quarter 2019 earnings are now seen dropping by 0.6 percent from last year, which would mark the first annual decline since the earnings recession that ended mid-2016.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 8.07 points, or 0.03 percent, to 25,891.32, the S&P 500 gained 4.16 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,779.76 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.36 points, or 0.19 percent, to 7,486.77.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but healthcare and industrials closed in positive territory.
Amazon ended the session up 1.2 percent, bouncing back from a two-day sell-off following news that the e-commerce giant's China unit is in merger talks with Chinese shopping site Kaola.
Shares of Freeport McMoRan jumped 6.6 percent after  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) raised the stock to ""buy"" from ""neutral.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gold prices rose to a 10-month high on Tuesday as concerns over a global economic slowdown spurred a safe-haven bid and were also supported by a weaker U.S. dollar, which fell on optimism for a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks.
A gauge of global stock markets rose modestly along with gains on Wall Street, while Europe sagged under falling bank shares and concerns that a car tariff could hurt the region's exports to the United States.
Traders kept a close eye on the new round of talks between the United States and China to resolve their trade spat. Separately, the World Trade Organization warned that a slump of its leading indicator of world trade in goods to its lowest reading in nine years could foreshadow a broader economic downturn, as it highlighted the need to reduce trade tensions.
""The rivalry between the U.S. and China is deep-seated, and tensions will remain even if the current round of talks succeed,"" Vincent Heaney, a strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a client note.
""With global growth and earnings also slowing, we favor only a modest overweight to global stocks.""

The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.22 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.20 percent.
Emerging market stocks rose 0.13 percent. MSCI's index of Latin American equities bucked the trend in stocks globally with a 1.2 percent increase, mostly on the back of a 1 percent gain in the Brazilian market.
Gold prices surged to a near 10-month high driven by concerns over slowing global growth as dovish signals from Japan and Europe's central banks followed weak data from the United States and China.
Spot gold added 1.1 percent to $1,341.02 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 1.66 percent to $1,344.10 an ounce.
In currencies, the yen was little changed even after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank was ready to ramp up stimulus if the stronger yen derails the path toward its 2 percent inflation target.
The offshore Chinese yuan touched its strongest level against the dollar since Feb. 1 following a Bloomberg TV report that the United States is pressing to secure a pledge from China that it will not devalue its yuan as a part of a trade deal.
The dollar index fell 0.41 percent, with the euro up 0.28 percent to $1.134.
""We are hoping to hear more positive news on trade,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto. ""The dollar should come under pressure as it loses some safe-haven appeal.""
Sterling rose over 1 percent versus the greenback on hopes that Prime Minister Theresa May will make progress in seeking changes to her Brexit deal with the European Union, although some traders struggled to explain the size of the move.
The British currency was last trading at $1.3063, up 1.10 percent on the day.
The Swedish crown pared losses against the dollar after hitting a more than two-year low of 9.417 after inflation data came in decidedly weak just two months after a milestone rate hike, dimming prospects of further tightening. The crown lost 0.46 percent versus the U.S. dollar at 9.303.
U.S. crude rose 0.79 percent to $56.42 per barrel and Brent was last at $66.47, down 0.05 percent on the day.

898,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 03:10PM ET</span>",Can IBM Shares Continue Their Roll?,"Investing.com - It may shock, but  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) shares are on something of a roll. The question is how long the roll will last.
The stock is up 21% this year, second among the 30 stocks in the Dow. Boeing (NYSE:BA) is tops, in part because Airbus Group (PA:AIR) is struggling and because traders are betting a U.S.-China trade deal will get done.
But IBM? This is a stock that fell 25% in 2018 and 7.6% in 2017 and has struggled to show revenue growth for years.
Maybe IBM has a few things going for it.
Most important is that, for now, investors seem willing to wait to see if CEO Ginni Rometty's bet on building a real cloud business comes to fruition. The business has been growing, but maybe not as quickly as some investors want. Revenue for the business grew 12% in the fourth quarter to $19.2 billion.
But IBM faces intense competition from players like Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure business and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud Platform.
The key is IBM's pending $34 billion acquisition of open-source cloud developer Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), expected in the latter half of the year. It's seen as the big fuel for the cloud business.
Add to that continued investments in analytics and artificial intelligence.
And IBM has real and long-standing relationships with the biggest players in the financial services industry that at least provides stable service revenue.
The stock began the year on the cheap side after hitting a 52-week low of $105.84 during the December market meltdown. Even now, its $1.57-a-share quarterly dividend represents a 4.6% yield, compared with the S&P 500's yield of about 2%. And the dividend doesn't seem to be at risk.
Technical indicators mostly rate the stock a buy. Its relative strength index, a measure of a stock's momentum, is about 60. A reading above 75 suggests it's overbought and vulnerable to a selloff.
But the proof ultimately will be real results, which may explain why the stock's up 2.7% in February, about even with the S&P 500 but trailing the Dow's 3.7% gain."

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's tax police have carried out a seizure order for more than 700 million euros ($794 million) as part of a probe targeting the country's top four banks over alleged fraudulent diamond sales, two sources close to the matter said on Tuesday.
Milan prosecutors have been investigating two diamond brokers and four banks -- Banco BPM with its Aletti unit,  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), Monte dei Paschi and UniCredit -- over sales of diamonds to customers as an investment. 
All four banks declined to comment.
Diamond brokers have been using Italian banks to sell high-quality investment diamonds in a business that totaled at least 300 million euros in sales in 2015, according to broker data.
The sources said the seizure order concerned Banco BPM and Aletti for 83 million euros, Monte dei Paschi for 35 million euros, UniCredit for 32 million euros and Intesa for 11 million euros.
The banks were placed under investigation as part of the fraud probe due to an Italian law that renders companies liable for the actions of their employees, one of the sources said.
Banco BPM is being investigated also for alleged obstruction of regulators, the source added. 
A TV report in 2016 first shed light on alleged mis-selling of diamonds to the public.
Consumer associations also said they had received complaints. In several cases, people have told Reuters that diamonds they had bought as an investment were valued at a much lower price than they paid for them.
Diamond sales have taken off amid negative interest rates which have curtailed bank revenues and made several other investments unattractive for clients.
Banks make a one-off commission of at least 10 percent on diamond sales, in return for putting the diamond brokers in touch with their clients, between whom the contract is signed.
The business usually accounts for no more than 2 percent of a lender's total fees.

The Advanced Turbine Engine Co (ATEC) joint venture filed the protest with the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), ATEC said in a statement. 
""In our review of the evaluation, we clearly offered the best value through a combination of a highly rated and technically superior engine that was judged to be much lower risk, and believe we did so significantly under the government's budget,"" ATEC President Craig Madden said.
The U.S. Department of Defense said on Feb. 1 it had awarded GE a six-year contract to engineer and manufacture the new engines, known as T901, covering thousands of helicopters.
GE said the Army had ""conducted a comprehensive and well-organized (bidding) process with clearly defined requirements and a level playing field for both competitors."" 
The company added that it was ""very confident the Army's very thorough review and evaluation of the competing bids will be upheld and that the T901 will prevail.""

902,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 01:42PM ET</span>",Allergan should explore selling itself: Appaloosa's Tepper,"(Reuters) - Billionaire hedge fund manager David Tepper stepped up pressure on Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc, saying on Tuesday the drugmaker should consider selling itself if management is unable to turn around recent lagging performance.
Tepper's hedge fund Appaloosa LP wrote to Allergan's board, just hours after the Botox maker announced it added a former industry executive to its board but would split the roles of chairman and chief executive only when the person who now holds the positions is replaced.
""While we appreciate the input of Appaloosa as we do all of our shareholders, we strongly disagree that an immediate separation of the CEO and Chair positions is warranted,"" Allergan's board said in a statement.
Appaloosa has since last year pressed Allergan to separate the roles — currently held by Brent Saunders, who joined the company in 2014 — and recruit an outsider to oversee its board.
""If in fact (Allergan's) Board is unable or unwilling to hold management accountable for its shortcomings or find a suitable replacement, it is your fiduciary obligation to explore other options, including a merger or sale of the Company,"" Tepper said in the letter.
Splitting the chairman and CEO roles has become a favorite call for some investors who feel it would help companies be run better.
Earlier this month Appaloosa argued that by adding an independent chairman, Saunders might receive the help he needs to improve returns.
Allergan, however, said on Tuesday implementing Appaloosa's recommendations would be ""highly disruptive"" to the company's operations and impact Saunders' ability to continue to execute its current strategy.
Appaloosa, which oversees about $12 billion, cut its stake in Allergan by some 42 percent to nearly 1.2 million shares at the end of December, regulatory filings showed last week.
Allergan's shares have been lagging those of its industry peers — they have fallen 15 percent over the past year — since it dropped plans to sell some businesses, gave a disappointing revenue outlook for 2019 and as it faces rising competition for several important drugs.

The company earlier on Tuesday named Robert Hugin, a former CEO of U.S. drugmaker Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG), as a director, saying the appointment reflected its commitment to ""active board refreshment.""

906,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 01:34PM ET</span>","Walmart holiday-quarter sales jump, says consumers still spending","By Nandita Bose
(Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc posted its strongest holiday quarter in at least a decade on Tuesday, boosted by higher grocery and e-commerce sales, and said it saw no signs of weakness in U.S. consumer spending despite recent signs of a slowdown. 
Shares of the world's largest retailer rose more than 3 percent on Tuesday in a broadly flat market, putting them up 7 percent so far this year. 
Walmart and rival  Target  (NYSE:TGT) Corp's unexpectedly strong growth in holiday sales reflected the health of the U.S. consumer as spending remained robust due to a strong labor market and cheaper gasoline prices.
""We still feel pretty good about the consumer. We haven't seen much of a change,"" Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters. ""The data we are seeing still looks pretty healthy. Gas prices are down year over year, which helps.""
Investors and Wall Street analysts have been expecting U.S. spending to slow this year, against a backdrop of rising debt, trade tariffs and economic uncertainty. Walmart's results settled nerves, but some doubts remain. 
""There are definitely some storm clouds on the horizon,"" said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, which owns Walmart shares. ""A big example would be delinquent loans in the auto sector which are rising ... the consumer may be on hard times and in 2008 that was the prelude to the global economic slowdown.""
U.S. retail sales recorded their steepest drop in more than nine years in December, the government reported last week, as receipts fell across the board, suggesting a sharp slowdown in economic activity at the end of 2018.
However, overall sales for the 2018 U.S. holiday shopping season hit a six-year high as shoppers were encouraged by early discounts, according to a Mastercard (NYSE:MA) report in late December.
Walmart sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 4.2 percent, excluding fuel, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31. The gain exceeded analysts' expectations of 2.96 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Sales were boosted by federal officials distributing food stamp aid early during the partial government shutdown. The demise of retailer Toys R Us also helped Walmart gain toy market share, the company said.
Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.41 per share, beating expectations of $1.33 per share, according to Refinitiv. But the retailer's gross margins declined for the seventh consecutive quarter due to higher transportation costs and e-commerce investments.
ONLINE SALES JUMP
Online sales jumped 43 percent in the quarter, in line with the previous quarter's rise, helped by the expansion of Walmart's online grocery pickup and delivery services and a broader assortment on its website.
But the company reiterated that it expected e-commerce losses to increase this year due to ongoing investments. Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said on a conference call the company was focused on getting return customer visits and strengthening product assortment. 
The company has expanded a program that allows customers to order groceries online and pick them up at its U.S. stores, a move the retailer said helped expand market share in the category. It said it will have the service at 3,100 stores by next January. At the end of the fourth quarter it was offered at more than 2,100 stores. 
Walmart will offer grocery deliveries to about 800 more stores by the end of the year, bringing the total to 1,600 stores. 
Grocery sales currently make up 56 percent of total revenue for the retailer. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is trying to crack the food category, especially since it bought organic supermarket chain Whole Foods. 
Walmart is partnering with third-party couriers and working with so-called gig, or freelance, drivers, who are cheaper than full-time employees, to push down costs, Reuters recently reported. 
Google-backed Deliv, a Walmart delivery partner in Miami and San Jose, ended its relationship with the retailer, Reuters reported last week.
The U.S. retailer, which overtook Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to become the third largest e-commerce retailer last year, is likely to capture a 4.6 percent share of the U.S. e-commerce market, behind eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Amazon, according to research firm eMarketer.
Walmart repeated its forecast that fiscal year 2020 earnings per share would decline in the low single digits in percentage terms, compared with last year. Excluding the acquisition of Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart, it sees an increase in the low- to mid-single-digits.
McMillon said the company was disappointed in India's revised e-commerce regulations, which ban companies from selling products via firms in which they have an equity interest and also bar them from making deals with sellers to sell exclusively on their platforms.
He said the Indian government didn't consult with Walmart and other U.S. companies before it changed the rules. ""We hope for a collaborative regulatory process going forward, which results in a level playing field,"" he said. 
Walmart expects fiscal year 2020 comparable sales growth of 2.5 percent to 3 percent, excluding fuel and online sales growth of 35 percent.
Total revenue increased 1.9 percent to $138.8 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $138.65 billion. Walmart has recorded 18 quarters, or over four straight years of U.S. comparable sales growth, unmatched by any other retailer.

The stock rose 3.7 percent to $103.68. Target and Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) were both up more than 1 percent.

Navient (NASDAQ:NAVI) surged 6% after rejecting the $12.50 a share offer from fund managers Canyon Capital Advisors and Platform Equity Advisors claiming it undervalued the company.
Canyon explained in a letter to Navient that it was prepared to raise the offer price if ""issues"" that were uncovered in due diligence were addressed.

LONDON (Reuters) - Policies bought by European Union customers from British insurers would still be valid if the UK crashes out of the bloc next month with no deal, the EU's insurance watchdog said on Tuesday.
The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published recommendations for national insurance watchdogs on how to treat policies that EU customers have bought from UK-based insurers.
The Bank of England has warned that ""contract continuity"" problems could arise, such as it becoming illegal to pay out on a claim, if the EU made no contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit.
With fewer than 40 days to go, Britain has no deal with the EU to ensure a smooth exit and avoid a rupture in business ties until new trading terms are agreed.
EIOPA said that in principle, insurance contracts concluded before March 30 by British insurance companies in the EU27 remain valid after that date.
""However, the insurance undertakings would not any more be authorized to carry out insurance activities with regard to these cross-border insurance contracts,"" EIOPA said in a statement.
The guidance goes some way to reciprocating steps already being taken by Britain, whose ""temporary permissions"" regime would allow EU27 insurers to continue serving UK customers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
""Besides the fact that UK insurance undertakings have taken appropriate measures for most of the cross-border insurance into the EU27, there is a residual amount of business that would become unauthorized when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union,"" said EIOPA chair Gabriel Bernardino.
This residual business is worth 7.4 billion euros ($8.4 billion) and centered on a handful of UK insurers, EIOPA said in November.
Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said the guidance helps reduce legal uncertainty over paying some insurance contracts post-Brexit.
""Allowing contracts signed before Brexit to run off and extra time for insurers to transfer portfolios into the EU27 are also pragmatic decisions which we welcome,"" Evans added.
 Aviva  (LON:AV), Britain's second largest insurer, said on Tuesday it had obtained court approval to transfer around 9 billion pounds in assets to a new Irish company at 2259 GMT on March 29.
Several insurers are transferring policies of EU based customers to new hubs in the bloc, though Lloyd's of London won't complete the transfer of business to its new Brussels subsidiary before March 29.
The EIOPA guidance said that provided a transfer of a portfolio to the EU was begun before Brexit, national regulators in the bloc should allow it to be finalised.

914,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 12:50PM ET</span>","Barclays hoped 2008 cash call would drive international growth, court told","By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) -  Barclays  (LON:BARC) believed deals with strategic investors during the 2008 financial crisis would help to provide a springboard for its international ambitions, the bank's former chairman told a London criminal trial on Tuesday.
Marcus Agius, called as a prosecution witness in the fraud trial of four former senior colleagues, said the bank had hoped to secure partnerships that would reinforce the bank's global ambitions by granting Barclays ""favored nation status"" for future business opportunities with investors such as Qatar.
""That was how it was put and that was how the board understood it,"" the veteran banker told a packed courtroom.
Former Barclays' chief executive John Varley and three former senior executives Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath, deny conspiring to commit fraud by false representation when the bank raised more than 11 billion pounds ($14 billion) from investors in 2008 to avert a British state bailout.
Prosecutor Edward Brown alleges the men did not properly disclose an extra 322 million pounds in fees paid to the Qatari investors through so-called ""advisory service agreements"" during the financial crisis and that other investors that took part in the two capital raisings - from Abu Dhabi, China, Singapore and Japan - would have expected the same terms.
Agius, in a light gray suit, told Southwark Crown Court that in June 2008, Barclays initially thought a deal with Qatar would be desirable, but not essential. But markets became increasingly febrile towards the end of that summer.
In October 2008, just four months after an initial capital raising, Barclays turned again to Qatar - and Abu Dhabi - for a second emergency fundraising to stave off state control.
Agius said he did not remember frenetic to-ing and fro-ing between the bank's executives and Qatari investors about fees, but said that the board wanted to avoid the restrictions of a British government sector-wide bailout - and that a deal with investors such as Qatar seemed ""sensible"", if complex.
Asked if he remembered being told that the Qataris had laughed at Barclays officials, who, according to Oct. 22 board meeting minutes, had offered them 120 million pounds in fees, Agius replied: ""No.""
The case marks the Serious Fraud Office's first criminal charges filed in Britain against such senior bankers over financial crisis-era conduct.
The trial has charted how the Barclays executives battled to clinch a deal with Qatari investors who made tough demands. Varley described the investors as ""new cocks of the roost"" in an email to Agius on June 5, 2008, which was shown to the court.
Agius said his relationship with Varley was ""always excellent"" and that he considered him creative and courageous with a formidable work rate. ""I regarded him as a man of utmost integrity, high intelligence ... someone committed to see the bank succeed,"" he said.
Qatar Holding, part of the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund, and Challenger, an investment vehicle of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, which invested in Barclays in 2008, have not been accused of wrongdoing.

The trial is scheduled to last up to six months.

917,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 11:45AM ET</span>",Honda to close British car plant as Brexit looms,"By Costas Pitas and Naomi Tajitsu
LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Honda will close its only British car plant in 2021 with the loss of up to 3,500 jobs, a major departure of Japanese investment announced just over a month before the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union.
The automaker, which builds more than a tenth of the 1.5 million cars made in Britain, said the move was not related to Brexit and it needed to focus activities in regions where it expects to sell most cars, after struggling in Europe.
But the timing of the announcement about the Swindon plant, just 38 days before Brexit, comes after a series of warnings from Japan that it would pull investments if they are no longer economically viable after Britain leaves the bloc. 
""We had to consider the rise of electrified vehicles, and the different speeds at which electric vehicles will be taken up in North America and Europe,"" said Honda Chief Executive Takahiro Hachigo. ""This decision was not informed by Brexit.""
Honda, which builds its Civic in Britain and Turkey, said it would stop making the model in both countries. The announcement comes just over two weeks after fellow Japanese carmaker Nissan reversed a decision to build a new SUV in Britain. 
Most of the Civic hatchbacks built in Britain are for export to the United States rather than Europe. Europe's expected faster take-up of electric vehicles could be supplied from China and Japan, where Honda already plans to produce at scale. 
Britain's business minister said Honda's decision was a major blow and illustrated how much was at risk from Brexit.
""Decisions like Honda's this morning demonstrate starkly how much is at stake,"" said Greg Clark, who supports a Brexit deal agreed between the UK government and EU, but which has so far failed to win over a majority of British lawmakers. 
""This news comes on top of months of uncertainty that ... manufacturers have had to endure about Brexit, about our future relationship with the EU,"" Clark said. 
He said it was unacceptable that business did not have clarity on future trading terms ahead of the March 29 departure. 
Honda, Britain's fourth-biggest automaker, will cease production at Swindon in southern England, which made 160,000 cars in 2018. 
It follows decisions by Japanese electronics companies Sony and Panasonic to move their headquarters from Britain into the EU, while Hitachi put a $28 billion nuclear power project in Britain on hold in January. 
'DEVASTATING DECISION' 
Some 1,000 Japanese firms are based in Britain, employing around 140,000 people, and have invested about 60 billion pounds ($78 billion), according to the Japanese embassy in London. 
Nissan, Toyota and Honda were encouraged to come to Britain in the 1980s as a pro-business gateway to the EU and have helped turn around an ailing domestic car industry. 
The trio build half of Britain's cars and hundreds of thousands of engines at production sites across the country, but a no-deal Brexit could destroy the free and unfettered trade manufacturers rely on. 
The loss of such a major employer in Swindon, which backed Brexit in the June 2016 referendum, risks a further 10,000 jobs in the supply chain, which could have knock-on effects for other carmakers due to the interconnected nature of the sector. 
For Honda, declining demand for diesel vehicles and tougher emissions regulations have also clouded its manufacturing prospects in Europe, which accounts for just 3 percent of its global sales. 
The company said in October 2017 it would stop making vehicles at its Sayama plant in Japan by 2022 as it grapples with a shrinking domestic market, while it has a tiny share of less than 1 percent in Europe. 
The outlook in Europe looks gloomy as sales in every major country fell in January, according to industry data, with a double-digit drop expected in Britain, Europe's second-biggest auto market, if there is a disorderly Brexit. 
U.S. automaker General Motors (NYSE:GM) has already pulled out of the continent while Ford is conducting a major restructuring. 
A recently agreed EU-Japan trade deal also means tariffs on cars from Japan to the bloc will be eliminated, while Britain is struggling to make progress on talks over post-Brexit trade relations with Tokyo. 
Honda said this was not part of the decision-making process but its boss said it would benefit from the EU-Japan deal. 
Britain's largest trade union Unite said it would continue to consult with the company and fight to keep the site open, blaming the handling of Brexit for making it harder for companies to keep investing in the country. 

""We believe that the uncertainty that the ... government has created by its inept and rigid handling of the Brexit negotiations lurks in the background,"" said national officer for the automotive sector Des Quinn.

918,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 11:44AM ET</span>",Medtronic quarterly profit beats on strength in surgical products,"By Saumya Joseph and Manojna Maddipatla
(Reuters) -  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT) Plc beat analysts' estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday, boosted by sales of its surgical products, and the largest U.S. standalone medical device maker raised the upper end of its full-year earnings forecast.
The company has been building its minimally invasive and robotic surgery device businesses through acquisitions to make up for slowing growth in its top-earning unit that makes stents and heart pumps.
The minimally invasive therapies business, which makes surgical instruments such as those used to treat hernias and kidney disease, brought in revenue of $2.12 billion in the third quarter, above estimates of $2.08 billion.
Medtronic said its robotic spine surgery system, Mazor X, which the company added through its purchase of Mazor Robotics, witnessed strong sales since its launch in January. 
Mazor X also helped the restorative therapies unit, which makes medical devices and implants to treat neurological disorders and conditions affecting the spine, beat analysts' estimates for quarterly revenue.
""Generally speaking, robotics is an important and growing field ... over time it will help Medtronic better penetrate its existing customer base and perhaps attract new ones,"" said Edward Jones analyst John Boylan. 
Company executives during the post-earnings conference call also highlighted the potential of its upcoming cardiac, robotic surgery and diabetes devices to power sales. 
""When launched, all of these new products are expected to create multiple new multibillion-dollar growth opportunities,"" Chief Executive Officer Omar Ishrak said. 
Most of the products are expected to launch in the later half of next year.
The quarter was good, but investors are focusing more on the upcoming strong pipeline of products, said analyst Boylan. 
The cardiac and vascular unit, which makes pace-makers, heart valves and stents, reported revenue of $2.79 billion, in line with analysts' estimate, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The company competes with Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX) and Edwards Lifesciences Corp (NYSE:EW) for a bigger share of the lucrative transcatheter heart valves market.
Medtronic said it expects full-year earnings to be in the range of $5.14 to $5.16 per share, up from the prior forecast of $5.10 to $5.15 per share. Analysts had expected $5.12 per share.
The company now expects 2019 organic revenue growth of 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent, but said a strong dollar would impact full-year revenue by about $425 million to $475 million. It previously forecast organic revenue growth to range between 5.0 percent and 5.5 percent.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.29 per share, beating expectations of $1.24.
Revenue rose 2.4 percent to $7.55 billion and beat analysts' estimate of $7.52 billion. 

Shares rose 1.7 percent to $93.88 in morning trading.

921,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 11:16AM ET</span>","Aviva, NatWest to join 'Brexodus' of business to EU","By Huw Jones, Simon Jessop and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - England's High Court on Tuesday gave  Aviva  (LON:AV), Britain’s second largest insurer, approval to transfer around 9 billion pounds ($11.69 billion) in assets to a new Irish company just before the starting gun is fired on Brexit.
The move, timed for 2259 GMT on March 29, is part of a wider withdrawal of business and money by financial companies seeking to keep contracts and policies within the European Union even after Britain departs. Brexit formally takes effect at 2300 GMT on March 29.
London has yet to agree a divorce settlement with the bloc but banks and insurers are shifting hundreds of billions of pounds in assets regardless of the form Brexit takes, reversing decades of European financial market integration and chipping away at the City of London's dominance of it.
The High Court in London approved the transfer of policies after a hearing on Aviva's application last week to move life insurance assets. It had previously secured court approval to move around 1 billion pounds in general insurance assets.
""The current state of extreme and intensifying uncertainty regarding the terms of United Kingdom's departure from the European Union renders the need for certainty of provision all the more pressing,"" Martin Moore, Aviva's counsel, told the court.
On Friday, NatWest, part of Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS), is due to ask a court in Edinburgh to approve its application to move 6 billion pounds in assets and 7 billion pounds in liabilities from Britain to its Dutch hub.
Aviva and NatWest are moving assets under a legal process known as Part VII transfers, taking up to 18 months and now coming to conclusion.
""Insurers have set up their European insurers and have transferred or are transferring their European business,"" said Ashley Prebble, an insurance partner at Clifford Chance law firm.
""These are not transfers that will be reversed in the event that a transition period is agreed; this is the new environment.""
So far, the amount of business being moved is a small part of the UK financial sector, where total premium income was 224.5 billion pounds in 2016, with banking assets totaling 8.1 trillion pounds in 2018, according to TheCityUK.
Consultancy EY has estimated that 800 billion pounds in assets are being moved from Britain to EU hubs ahead of Brexit.
Most of the policies being moved by Aviva were written in branches across Europe, with just 100 million pounds or so of policies written in Britain. 
Aviva said it would move an additional 303 million euros in capital to Dublin as part of the transfer of assets, to cover its life insurance policies, and 89 million pounds to cover those for general insurance.
MONEY MOVES FASTER
For now, money is moving quicker than jobs. A Reuters survey published earlier this month found only around 2,000 jobs in financial services are expected to be moved or created in other EU cities to deal with Brexit.
But the quiet shift of money means less business will be processed in Britain and less tax will be raised by the country's financial sector, currently the biggest source of corporate tax revenue.
Trading in euro-denominated stocks and bonds, along with clearing in euro repurchase agreements, will move to the continent next month.
The Association of British Insurers said insurers operating from Britain have made 36 Part VII applications representing 20 million contracts, using figures from the Bank of England.
Among banks, Britain's  Barclays  (LON:BARC) secured court approval last month to move 190 billion euros in assets to a Dublin subsidiary.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) has transferred $44 billion in assets to its Dublin based subsidiary, while UBS has secured approval to shift 32 billion euros from London to its German unit.
Japan's Nomura said it would re-allocate $300 million in capital from its London-based subsidiary to other members of its group, while  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said it had moved $200 million of assets and liabilities to its German unit.
Most of the largest international banks are keeping their asset and capital transfer plans confidential, with JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Citi all eschewing Part VII applications in favor of repapering contracts client by client.
Aviva was among the last of the big insurers to secure court approval for shifting chunks of life, general, property, casualty and motor insurance policies to EU hubs.
 Prudential  (LON:PRU) and AIG (NYSE:AIG) were among the first out of the block, the former moving 76 million pounds in assets to Dublin, and the latter shifting 5.6 billion pounds in assets to a Luxembourg hub last year.
Phoenix, a specialist life insurer, will transfer some 18 billion pounds in assets from Britain to Dublin, subject to a hearing in March, representing 582,000 policies.
Lloyd's of London, the world's oldest commercial insurance market, looks set to be among the last and probably the biggest of all, saying it won't complete its coordination of Part VII transfers on behalf of its syndicates until the end of 2020.

CHICAGO(Reuters) - As the possibility of a no-deal Brexit looms, Kellogg Co is taking measures to protect Britons from a potential shortage of Pringles, the UK's second-favorite brand of chips.
With Britain at risk of leaving the European Union on March 29 without a divorce deal - known as a 'hard' Brexit - several big companies have begun to prepare for the disruption that could ensue.
Kellogg is opening new warehouses and stocking up on its snacks and cereals, hoping to mitigate damage from friction at the UK border and tariffs on imports, Chief Executive Steve Cahillane said in a recent interview.
Kellogg is also working with suppliers to make sure it has enough raw materials at its plants, Cahillane said ahead of CAGNY, a major food and consumer products event held this week in Boca Raton, Florida.
""We're making plans and spending real money to mitigate impact. That's things like opening new warehouses, building inventory, preparing ourselves in the best possible way,"" Cahillane said. 
Cahillane said Kellogg's supply chain left it exposed. For instance, Pringles, the UK's No. 2 chips (crisps) brand after PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc's Walkers, are made in Belgium. Pringles, which could last up to 15 months in storage, banked UK retail sales of $342.6 million last year, according to Euromonitor.
In Europe, Kellogg's cereal business - which makes Coco Pops and Bran Flakes - is sourced primarily from the UK, Cahillane said.
""In an EU environment that's just fine, but in a customs environment, in a 'hard Brexit' environment, it's going to change and we have to prepare ourselves for that.""
Kellogg's cereal business is the biggest in Western Europe with a 23.2 percent share of the market last year and retail sales $1.68 billion, according to Euromonitor. Europe accounted for nearly 18 percent of Kellogg's total sales in 2018.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Britons could face shortages of fresh food, price rises and less variety if the country leaves the European Union next month without agreeing to trade terms.
Earlier this month, Kellogg said $3 million in Brexit planning costs were partly to blame for lower fourth-quarter earnings. This compounded surging input costs that have plagued the packaged food industry over the past year. In addition, Kellogg has been spending more on advertising to boost demand for cereals among health-conscious consumers.
""Everyone has this problem. Kellogg's competitors have it too. Brexit's not their core problem,"" said Jerry Storch, CEO of Storch Advisors, a U.S.-based consulting firm for retailers and consumer goods companies.

Anglo-Dutch consumer goods maker  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) said in January that it was stockpiling ice creams in Britain and deodorants in continental Europe to guard against potential supply disruptions in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

924,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 10:42AM ET</span>","Danske Bank pulls out of Russia, Baltics after money-laundering backlash","By Tarmo Virki and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen
TALLINN/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank will pull out of Russia and the neighboring Baltic states, the Danish lender said after Estonia ordered it to close the branch at the center of one of the largest-ever money laundering scandals.
Danske is under investigation in Denmark, Estonia, Britain and the United States over some 200 billion euros ($226 billion) in payments from Russia, ex-Soviet states and elsewhere that were found to have flowed through its Estonian arm. 
On Tuesday, Estonia's financial regulator took the unexpected step of demanding Danske close its local branch and repay customers' deposits within eight months, overturning the lender's plan to scale back but keep business in the country.
Danske said last year it hoped to serve subsidiaries of Nordic customers in the Baltics.
It made an about-turn minutes after the announcement from Estonia's regulator, publishing a statement to say it would close down its business in Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and Estonia.
Danske's operations in those four countries earned 657 million Danish Crowns ($100 million) of income, according to its 2018 annual report. 
It has more than 3,000 staff in those countries, although many will stay because Danske will not close its large administrative back-office operation in Lithuania.
In ordering Danske to leave Estonia, Kilvar Kessler, the head of Estonia's regulator Finantsinspektsioon, was heavily critical of the bank and deflected blame onto Denmark for mishandling the case.
Kessler said the bank's alleged flouting of money-laundering rules had ""dealt a serious blow"" to the reputation of the Estonian financial market. 
The Estonian regulator was ""the only institution in Estonia or Denmark to react to the activities of Danske Bank"", Kessler said, reflecting rising tensions with Denmark over who is responsible for the scandal.
He said that he was ""not convinced that such activities would not continue in Danske"", telling journalists that the Danish regulator had handled the bank with ""silk gloves"". 
Danske Bank, which saw its profit tumble by more than a quarter last year, said that its decision to close operations in Russia and the Baltics was in line with its refocusing on the Nordics. It said it has stepped up anti money-laundering efforts.
The Danish Financial Authority had no immediate comment.
The Estonian ultimatum was made public as Danish and Estonian regulators found on Tuesday they are being investigated by the European Union's own banking watchdog over a possible breach of EU law relating to alleged money-laundering at Danske Bank.
The Danske case, which focuses on money moved between 2007 and 2015, has raised questions about supervision of the Danish bank, prompting the EU's executive European Commission to ask the European Banking Authority (EBA) to investigate. 

The EBA's investigation will take two months. If it finds a breach of EU law, it can make recommendations to the two regulators to address failings.

U.S. stocks pared early losses to trade mixed as investors awaited fresh clues on the outlook for global trade and monetary policy. Treasuries advanced.
The S&P 500 paused the post-Christmas rally of 18 percent as the next round of trade talks between America and China restart in Washington this week. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. surged after it announced the best holiday quarter in a decade, countering concerns about retail sales and lifting consumer sectors. European shares retreated after two days of gains, led by banks following disappointing earning from  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) and increasingly dovish signals from the region’s central bank.
Automakers were also under pressure as the European Union vowed prompt retaliation if the U.S. imposes tariffs on imported vehicles. The dollar was steady against major currencies, while Treasuries traded around 2.65 percent ahead of a slew of speeches from Federal Reserve presidents and the release of last month’s FOMC meeting minutes Wednesday that should shed more light on the central bank’s turn to a more dovish tone.
“Think back to what we’ve gone through with China, which is still in process, neither side benefits from these tariff wars,” Thomas Digenan, head of U.S. intrinsic value equities at UBS Asset Management, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. The possible tariff on cars is “just one more bargaining chip and one more ball juggling in the air.”
With earnings season nearing its end, the latest minutes from both the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank due this week and U.S. President Donald Trump weighing an extension of the deadline for a trade deal with China, investors have plenty to ponder right now. Uncertainty over the outlook for global growth hangs over everything, and traders will be hoping for some good news from the world’s two largest economies when talks resume in Washington on Tuesday.
In Asia, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told parliament the central bank would consider extra monetary easing if required, helping lift the Topix index and sending the yen lower. Shares in China were little changed as equities in Hong Kong dropped.Elsewhere, the pound advanced as U.K. and European officials work on new legal text for the contentious Irish border backstop.

LONDON (Reuters) - The chief executive of mining group BHP has no plans to quit and will focus on the ""nuclear level of safety"" needed to avoid any repeat of the Vale dam collapse in Brazil, as well as on transforming his own company.
Speculation about the future of CEO Andrew Mackenzie, 62, has swirled since 2017 when activist investor Elliott Advisors began campaigning for change and Ken MacKenzie was appointed as chairman.
Asked about how long he planned to stay, Mackenzie, in the role since 2013, said he was not thinking about moving on.
""I've got a lot to do right now and I've got a lot to do on tailings dams,"" he told reporters in London.
As the tailings disaster in Brazil in January overshadows the mining industry, BHP has the experience to lead change as its Samarco joint venture with Vale was involved in a previous dam collapse in November 2015 that left 19 dead.
Following Samarco, the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) issued updated guidelines to try to safeguard tailings dams that store waste from mining operations.
But the ICMM is industry-led and Mackenzie has called for an independent body to oversee dams.
""We have to acknowledge the deficiencies in the scientific and technical understanding,"" the Scotsman said.
""You need to think about this with the best possible science and engineering in the world. It has to have a nuclear level of safety now.""
Mackenzie said mining companies were needed to provide society with resources and to support a transition to a low carbon economy that will spur demand for minerals such as copper, used in electrification.
After the commodities crash of 2015-16, the mining industry has repaired balance sheets and handed cash to shareholders. The next steps are less obvious as old ore bodies become depleted and new assets are often in politically unstable countries.
BHP on Tuesday said its first-half underlying profit was down 8 percent from the same period a year ago and it cut its forecast for productivity gains to flat for the financial year, mainly because production outages meant $460 million in savings was not achieved.
Mackenzie said he was excited to be leading a ""transformation agenda"" to help with the next phase of growth and maximize the productivity of operations.

""The transformation agenda is the biggest lever we have got to play. It's reporting direct to me. I'm getting a lot out of it,"" Mackenzie said.

A combination of sluggish global growth in the first half of the year, a possible decline in tech earnings in 2019 and high foreign investment in the sector all point to likely underperformance from technology companies in Taiwan, Goldman strategists led by Richard Tang wrote in a note Monday. They said the tech bounce appears to be part of the “laggard rotation occurring in the region,” which is unlikely to last.
“On a relative basis, we recommend investors to favor non-tech, and believe that any rotation into tech may not sustain as we do not see any solid fundamental arguments,” the strategists, who are underweight Taiwan within Asia, wrote.
Taiwan’s Taiex index has risen 4.4 percent this year, with the Electronic Parts/Components and Optoelectronic indexes gaining the most among 28 industry groups. That’s a change from 2018. Goldman says the non-tech sector has outperformed tech by 30 percent since late 2017.
Companies such as CTBC Financial Holding Co. and Mega Financial Holding Co. could outperform as valuations and positioning normalize, according to Goldman, while investors should be “cautious” on firms like Nanya Technology Corp. and Asustek Computer Inc. They also recommended focusing on stocks with high dividends and low earnings volatility.
“Bottom line: we fade the tech bounce, and expect non-tech to maintain its leadership,” the strategists said.

At 09.35 AM ET, the S&P 500 was down 3.9 points or 0.1% at 2771.68, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 16.04 points or 0.1% at 25,687.21. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was up 1.78 points, essentially unchanged from Friday’s close.
""Monetary policy does not appear to be far behind or far ahead of the curve,"" Mester told an event at the University of Delaware.
Her comments filled a vacuum as participants wait for news from the latest round of U.S.-China trade talks which begins today.
They came less than a week after a surprisingly weak retail sales report for January that raised concerns about the strength of the U.S. consumer. However, there was better news on that front at a company level Tuesday as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) reported earnings well ahead of expectations in the three months through January. It also upheld its existing guidance for its fiscal 2020 year.
Walmart led the market higher at the opening, rising 3.1% to $103.43. Rival  Target  (NYSE:TGT)also ticked up 1.4%, while medical device maker  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT) also rose 1.4% after a strong quarterly report.
Elsewhere, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) opened 0.6% higher after an upgrade from brokerage Stephens, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) opened 0.6% lower after a U.K. parliamentary report sharply criticized it and called for new regulation."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union agreed on Tuesday to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from new trucks and buses by 30 percent by a 2030 deadline as part of its commitment to cut its output of greenhouse gases.
The European Parliament and the Council, which represents the 28 EU member countries, struck a compromise in the early hours that will reduce average CO2 emissions compared with 2019 levels, the European Commision said in a statement.
There is also an interim 15 percent reduction target for 2025 and incentives for manufacturers to make low and zero-emission trucks. The 2030 target is also subject to a review in 2022.
""For the first time binding CO2-reduction targets for trucks at the EU-level, including a clear stimulus for zero and low-emission trucks,"" Bas Eickhout, a Greens lawmaker who had negotiated on behalf of the European Parliament, said on Twitter. 
The EU currently has no limits on emissions from heavy-duty vehicles, unlike the United States, China, Japan and Canada. Trucks account for almost one quarter of the bloc's transport-related emissions.
The EU agreed in December on targets for cutting emissions from cars and vans.
Curbs on the transport sector, the only one in which emissions are still rising, aim to help the bloc meet its overall goal of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 under the Paris climate accord.
Germany is home to Europe's largest truck manufacturer, Daimler, as well as Volkswagen's MAN. Other producers in Europe include Volvo, Italy-based Iveco, Paccar and Scania, also part of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
Environmental campaigners say that trucks, while making up less than 5 percent of vehicles on the road, account for 22 percent of vehicle emissions. 
The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) said EU countries must improve charging and refueling infrastructure, which was non-existent for electric and hydrogen trucks and ""very low and patchy"" for trucks powered by natural gas.
It believes the potential for electrification is far lower than for cars, particularly for long-haul transit, and questions whether transport operators will really want to buy zero-emission trucks.

The provisional deal reached on Tuesday will need support from the Council and be subject to a vote in parliament.

933,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 08:50AM ET</span>",Enter the ‘Twilight Zone’ as Stock Nightmares Meet Credit Dreams,"(Bloomberg) -- By one measure, it’s been decades since stock traders were willing to pay so much for the strongest companies out there -- just as credit investors rush to the weakest balance sheets.
U.S. firms with solid financials now trade close to the highest valuation relative to their fragile peers since the dot-com era of 2003, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). indexes.
Juxtaposed against falling premiums on speculative-grade bonds to power the best start to a year since 2009, it suggests beneath the surface of the S&P rally that equity and debt investors are placing opposing bets on the business cycle.
How long the divergence can last is anyone’s guess. But one thing’s for sure: There are no shortage of Wall Street voices touting quality stocks to buffer portfolios from a market meltdown, including the likes of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management and  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Asset Management.
At Kempen Capital Management NV, Roelof Salomons is riding both sides of these seemingly helter-skelter markets. He’s holding onto stronger equities while bidding up high-yield debt in a tactical bet on Goldilocks.
“We’re in this twilight zone of low growth, low inflation and low rates,” he said. “This benefits companies that have long duration because bonds aren’t moving anywhere. Growth won’t slow to the extent that we’ll have a recession but it’ll be slow. In this scenario, you want to own defensive equities.”
Safe Space
Sure, dovish monetary projections, benign technicals and low defaults can justify the rush for junk credit in concert with defensive wagers in stocks and Treasuries. But something has to give within the next six months at the latest, reckons Salomons. Either rates go up or growth craters, hitting levered assets along the way, according to the Amsterdam-based investor.
For now, the hunt for safety in equities goes on. Bank of America’s February fund manager survey shows angst over corporate debt is the highest since 2009. Traders have sunk some $1.85 billion into the iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF this year.
“Investors place higher scrutiny on leverage as we approach the end of the cycle and companies with stronger balance sheets are often preferred even if they are more expensive,” said Vincent Juvyns, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.
Don’t get the wrong impression, levered companies have rebounded from the market hellfire in December, and continue to find a bid. It’s just investors keep on pumping up quality equities on the belief that stable earnings and lower debt will reduce the volatility of their portfolios, and help them outperform in any economic downturn.
That’s raising an uncomfortable question: Are they worth it?
The premium between global quality and value stocks is jumping back to multi-year highs. U.S. equities with strong balance sheets trade at about 25 times forward estimated earnings, compared with 12.5 times for those with weaker financial profiles, Goldman Sachs indexes show. The kind of valuation gap sits in the 94th percentile based on data going back to 1980, the bank said in a note this month.
All that combined with firmer risk appetite spurred Goldman strategists to reverse their two-year overweight recommendation on strong balance sheets earlier this month.
Hunker Down
At Legal & General Investment, Andrzej Pioch is staying neutral on quality firms, a factor with a wide range of definitions from low debt to strong earnings prospects. The money manager at the $1.3 trillion firm is sanguine on valuations, particularly on cash flows and book value, but market sentiment makes him “uncomfortable.”
Surveys Pioch cites suggest investors haven’t been this optimistic about the factor since late 2015, when deflationary fears stalked the world economy.
In other words, more money managers are becoming price-agnostic in their rush to hedge.
“I think it’s less about projecting where the market is going and what’s going to be the big winner, and more about building resilience into a portfolio in an event of a potential downturn,” said Holly Framsted, head of U.S. factor ETFs at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).
Michael Hunstad of Northern Trust Asset Management is playing defense. He’s helping to screen the fund’s $1.1 trillion of assets overall for equities that offer balance-sheet strength as well as asset turnover, a measure of corporate efficiency.
“It’s a good idea to buy high-quality stocks,” the head of quantitative strategies said. “I wouldn’t put all my chips on strong balance sheet. That’s why you need a collection of indicators to make sure you aren’t buying something that’s significantly gone up in price.""
The good news is that quality stocks have traded at richer levels in absolute terms.
In Europe especially, there are plenty of reasonably valued shares with robust financial profiles in industrials, luxury goods, consumer discretionary and healthcare sectors, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). The MSCI Europe Quality Index is trading at 17.1 times forward earnings, compared to about 18.5 times for the S&P 500 Quality Index.
“Avoiding companies with strong balance sheets is a high-risk strategy, given the recession risk is still around,” said Olivia Engel, the chief investment officer for active quantitative equities at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors. All the same, investors “shouldn’t pile into safety at any price. Balance is key,” she said.

938,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 07:25AM ET</span>",Activist Bramson's unlikely Barclays board seat bid sharpens scrutiny of bank,"By Sinead Cruise and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - Activist investor Edward Bramson's bid to join the  Barclays  (LON:BARC) board is destined to fail, shareholders told Reuters, though he has sharpened scrutiny of its investment banking strategy that Bramson argues has depressed profitability.
When Barclays reports its 2018 results on Thursday, investors will examine whether the trading and advisory business that Bramson believes should be shrunk has improved its performance, and whether those gains are sustainable.
""The onus is now on the Barclays management team to convince the market that their plan is the best way forward,"" one investor said. ""This probably requires more disclosure on the varying returns within the corporate and investment bank."" 
The high-profile dispute between Bramson and Barclays CEO Jes Staley over strategy has helped spark wider debate about the viability of European investment banks, which have in recent years increasingly lagged U.S. rivals.
Barclays rival HSBC on Tuesday for instance reported a slump in fourth-quarter trading revenue, joining other European lenders in seeing a sharp annual decline from stock trading while U.S. rivals prospered.
(Graphic: Investment banks hit by Q4 market rout - https://tmsnrt.rs/2TVGoOq)
Bramson's Sherborne vehicle holds 5.5 percent of Barclays stock. 
In a letter to his shareholders last December, he criticized the bank's tactic of using considerable capital and resources to chase modest or volatile investment banking revenues by undercutting rivals, which might beef up market share temporarily but offer poor long-term returns.
Barclays declined to comment.
Barclays' corporate and investment bank averaged an annual return on equity of 4 percent between 2015 and 2017, compared with 6 percent for Barclays UK and 23 percent for the Consumer, Cards and Payments business, a Reuters analysis showed.
Bramson also said ""fortunately timed"" tax income benefits and some 900 million pounds ($1.2 billion) worth of non-recurring items put a gloss on the bank's recent earnings. The bank by contrast said the report showed its strategy working.
NOBLE EXIT 
Investors said that while Bramson's board seat bid is unlikely to succeed, it could offer him a ""noble exit"" from a campaign that threatens his track record in driving lucrative change at target firms.
""I think having been rebuffed by asking the board for a seat he was always likely to take it to shareholders, but that doesn't mean that he isn't playing a game,"" one investor, who declined to be named, said.  
""I've always thought he wouldn't get anywhere and will just have to hope that the business does actually perform better than he thinks it can, and he can exit at a higher share price having nobly failed but without losing investors' money.""
Barclays shares have fallen 27 percent since Bramson's stake became public in March last year, suggesting his investors are currently set to take a heavy loss.
Some of Barclays' recent actions to shore up the investment bank have irked investors sharing Bramson's perspective, notably the appointment of more than 80 managing directors late last year and the transfer of up to 47 billion pounds of capital to the investment bank, to the perceived detriment of the broader group.
But while some share Bramson's worries over Barclays' poor risk-return profile and sagging credit rating - of just one notch above ""junk"" by Moody's - it may prove hard to dismantle the bank's strategy, even if he does win a board seat.
""If he gets on the board then he will definitely add value, but will he be a lone voice and still be seen as an outsider even though he has been voted on?"" asked another investor.
TRACK RECORD 
Bramson, together with Stephen Welker, co-managing director of Sherborne, has pursued 10 activist campaigns since 2003, six of which saw principals of Sherborne join the target company's board.
Four of the investments were liquidated without a turnaround effort, including holdings in Scapa Group, Cutera, 4imprint Group and  3i  (LON:III) Group.
According to filings, average sterling-based returns on the six completed investments before fees or incentive allocations were more than 110 percent. 
All investors contacted by Reuters said they were not surprised by Bramson's board seat resolution, tabled on Feb. 5, but said his chances of winning a place were slim. 
""I can't see any good reason why we would support his resolution,"" a third shareholder said. 

""At the moment, we have very little detail on what his alternative plan might be, and some of his reported conclusions look flawed, not least his focus on returns in Markets, whereas actually it is the Corporate bank that really needs to improve its returns.""

939,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>","HSBC Bankers, Prepare for Lower Bonuses","(Bloomberg Opinion) --  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) Plc is making a promise: Cost control is coming without layoffs.
The pledge – laid out Tuesday by Chief Executive Officer John Flint – may seem like wishful thinking, given the lengthening list of challenges to the bank’s revenue growth.
For investors, it means HSBC will have to gin up growth faster than last year’s 5 percent gain, slow investing or cut costs. One place to start would be employee bonuses. A hiring freeze now seems unavoidable, with 235,000 full and part-time employees at the end of December, up from 229,000 the previous year.
On Tuesday, HSBC posted a 1 percent drop in adjusted pretax profit of $3.39 billion for the three months ended Dec. 31, missing the $4.4 billion consensus. Against the backdrop of Brexit and escalating tariff threats, the bank also struggled with a slowdown in securities trading like its peers, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jonathan Tyce. Even insurance sales slumped, an embarrassing result for a lender chaired by AIA Group Ltd. and  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Plc veteran Mark Tucker.
The results were the first annual numbers delivered by Flint and CFO Ewen Stevenson, who was poached from Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) to replace Iain Mackay in December.
Over the past year, HSBC’s stock has underperformed the broader market: Cost control is one of the few areas that can turn things around. The bank has its work cut out. Jaws, which measures growth of revenue versus costs, unexpectedly fell to negative 1.2 percent, compared with negative 1 percent a year earlier. Stevenson has promised this year will be positive. 
In an interview with Bloomberg TV on Tuesday, the executive said the company has already slowed headcount growth. Meanwhile, the other plans to rein in spending are underway. In June, Flint said the bank planned to lay out as much as $17 billion to expand its key Asian markets and improve technology, with plans to spend roughly two-thirds of that by 2020. The bank will be hard-pressed to meet that goal and keep costs down.
And for all the talk of HSBC's commitment to return capital to shareholders, it didn't announce a new buyback program. Such largess is unlikely to be repeated anytime soon.
Challenges also persist on the revenue side. In its core market of Hong Kong, which accounted for 31 percent of revenue last year, competition is steepening. Virtual banks are expected to gain traction in the city, where HSBC dominates. Late Monday, a Beijing released a blueprint tying the former British colony closer to Macau and nine other Chinese cities – the so-called Greater Bay Area. Its proposal to establish an international commercial bank in Guangdong presents a challenge to the very acronym HSBC represents. 
To be fair, the bank still managed to post decent results in Hong Kong. Revenue from the city rose 14 percent to $18.2 billion in 2018 from $16 billion a year earlier. Even the real-estate market, which saw a mini-rout at the end of last year, hasn’t suffered too much: Mortgage loans rose by $3 billion in the city, while lending overall climbed $6 billion.
Despite hitching its star to Chinese expansion in 2015, it’s the turmoil closer to home that most worries the top brass at the London-based bank: “We’re more concerned about the U.K. than Hong Kong or China,” Stevenson said. For a company founded more than 150 years ago to finance international trade, it’s no small irony that the bank’s biggest headaches include the trade war, Brexit and China’s Greater Bay Area.

Volkswagen said it welcomed the ruling, but the plaintiff's lawyer said he would appeal the ruling at the Federal Court of Justice, Germany's highest court. 
The case could become the first against VW to be decided by the Federal Court, potentially setting a precedent for customers affected by the diesel scandal.
VW customers have filed thousands of lawsuits across Germany seeking compensation after buying cars affected by emissions cheating software. So far, VW and affiliated traders have won 22 rulings by lower appeals courts.
The plaintiff in the this case was supported by myRight, a consumer body which has organized a group action against Volkswagen.
""myRight now is in the finals against VW"", said myRight founder Jan-Eike Andresen. The consumer body, which cooperates with U.S. law firm Hausfeld, currently represents 45,000 plaintiffs who want compensation for their diesel vehicles.
Altogether, more than 400,000 German diesel customers have participated in a joint legal action against Volkswagen.
A Federal Court of Justice ruling on the case, legally assessing Volkswagen's responsibility and potential obligation to pay compensation toward car owners, would bind all other German jurisdictions. 
VW has said about 11 million diesel cars worldwide were fitted with software that could cheat emissions tests designed to limit noxious car fumes.
The German carmaker has agreed to pay billions of dollars in the United States to settle claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers. It offered to buy back 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles.

The company has not reached a similar deal in Europe, where it faces billions of euros in claims from investors and customers.

945,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 06:02AM ET</span>",Teva expects sales injection from U.S. EpiPen market,"By Tova Cohen
TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) expects its generic version of Mylan's EpiPen to claim about 25 percent of the U.S. market by the end of the year, CEO Kare Schultz said on Tuesday, as the company closes in on a return to growth in 2020.
Wall Street has viewed the EpiPen rival as a welcome profit-booster for Teva as it contends with declining U.S. margins for its older generic medicines, competition for multiple sclerosis treatment Copaxone and costly acquisitions. 
When the device’s approval was announced last year analysts suggested it could add $250 million to Teva’s annual revenue and 4-6 cents per share in earnings, providing a welcome lift for a company that has fired thousands of employees and worked to reduce its debt load to $27 billion from $35 billion.
Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) also produces a generic version of its life-saving EpiPen allergy treatment, which like Teva's product is priced at about $300.
The U.S. market for EpiPen is worth roughly $750 million a year.
When asked how much of that market Teva expects to hold by the end of this year, Schultz said: ""It's difficult to say exactly, but the simple answer would be 25 percent roughly.""
Israel-based Teva, the world's largest generic drugmaker, is already selling its product for adults and plans to start supply of a junior version for young children in 3-4 months, the Danish-born CEO told reporters.
Many of the largest U.S. pharmacies and drug distributors do not yet have Teva's version of EpiPen, five months after it was approved for sale in the United States, pharmacy chains and a group that tracks drug shortages told Reuters last month.
Mylan’s EpiPen has also been in short supply because of manufacturing problems at the lone  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) plant that makes the auto-injectors.
Teva received U.S. approval for its copy of EpiPen in August after several years of delay, but Schultz said additional ""validations"" were required by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, which it has now done. 
While any pharmacy can call and buy Teva's product, the company does not have enough supply for all the wholesellers and pharmacies, he said.
""We will be filling up the supply chain more and more over the coming months,"" Schultz said.
Schultz estimates that Teva should approach a 50 percent market share by the end of 2020.
Last week, Teva shares dropped sharply after it published a 2019 outlook that disappointed the market..
Its shares were down 0.7 percent at midday in Tel Aviv.

""The fact is, we have a tough situation where revenues are going downhill,"" Schultz said on Tuesday. ""People forgot that a little bit so we had to remind them.""

The retailer will close about 2,500 stores in North America starting from the end of March and wind down its e-commerce operations.
Reuters had reported last week that the company was planning to close its stores when it files for bankruptcy for the second time in as many years. 
""The prior proceedings left the company with too much remaining debt, too large a store footprint and a yet-to-be realized systems and corporate overhead structure consolidation,"" Chief Restructuring Officer Stephen Marotta said. 
Stores outside North America were not included in the Chapter 11 filing and will continue operations, the retailer added. 
Payless said it intends to seek protection for its Canadian subsidiaries under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.
The company exited bankruptcy in 2017 with about $400 million in loans, after slashing its debt pile from over $800 million, according to court papers.
The move makes Payless one of the most high-profile victims of the string of bankruptcies that have hit the brick-and-mortar retail sector as more shopping is done online. Toys ""R"" Us and The Bon-Ton Stores are among the retailers that shut their stores in liquidations in the last 12 months.
Payless listed both assets and liabilities in a range of $500 million to $1 billion in a filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.

948,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 05:10AM ET</span>",China's Fosun makes bid for German fashion chain Tom Tailor,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate Fosun International announced a takeover bid for troubled German clothing retailer Tom Tailor on Tuesday, further expanding its reach into Europe's fashion sector.
Shares in Tom Tailor surged 14 percent to 2.46 euros after the company said Fosun was increasing its shareholding to 35.35 percent by buying new shares worth 2.26 euros each. That will lift Fosun's stake above the 30 percent threshold that triggers a mandatory takeover offer under German law.
The capital increase will raise 8.6 million euros ($9.7 million), the companies said, and an offer price of 2.26 euros per share would give Tom Tailor a total value of 96 million euros.
Fosun, which owns French leisure company Club Med, has been expanding in Europe's retail sector at a time when consumers in China are driving growth in luxury goods spending. Last year it took control of Lanvin, France's oldest surviving couture label, and Austria-based luxury lingerie and legwear brand Wolford. It also has a stake in Italian high-end menswear label Caruso.
Hamburg-based Tom Tailor, founded in 1962, operates in the mid-range segment of the clothing market but has been struggling with tough conditions as consumers increasingly shop for shoes and clothes online.
Its shares have lost over 80 percent of their value since hitting a high of 12.9 euros in January last year.
Last month, fellow German women's fashion retailer Gerry Weber filed for bankruptcy following failed talks with financing partners.
Tom Tailor's Chief Executive Heiko Schaefer said the capital increase, due to take place on Feb. 22, was a vote of confidence in the firm's restructuring plans at its struggling subsidiary Bonita, which sells women's fashion.
In December, Tom Tailor said it would step up efforts to restructure and modernize Bonita and wrote down the value of the brand by 120 million-130 million euros. 
""We consider the fact that Fosun is taking over all of the new shares as a sign of faith towards the path we have taken,"" Schaefer said. 
Fosun has gradually increased its stake in Tom Tailor since first buying into the company in 2014. In 2015, Fosun also took over German private bank Hauck & Aufhaeuser Privatbankiers for 210 million euros.
Chinese investors have faced a backlash in Germany in recent years due to fears state-backed companies are gaining too much access to key technologies in Europe's biggest economy following acquisitions including the 2016 purchase of robotics maker Kuka by China's Midea and Geely's surprise purchase of almost 10 percent in Daimler last year.

In December, Germany agreed new rules to lower the threshold for screening and even blocking purchases of stakes in German firms by non-Europeans, in a move to fend off unwanted takeovers by Chinese investors in strategic areas.

949,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 05:09AM ET</span>","HSBC warns on China, UK slowdowns as 2018 profit disappoints","By Sumeet Chatterjee and Lawrence White
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC warned it may have to delay some investments this year as Europe's biggest bank missed 2018 profit forecasts due to slowing growth in its two home markets of China and Britain.
Its shares fell 3 percent and analysts cut their forecasts as HSBC reported a drop in fourth-quarter revenue amid tumbling stock markets that sapped customer's confidence in investing.
The results spoke to a wider problem for European banks, which are struggling to return to growth after a decade of post-crisis restructuring due to a worsening global economic outlook. 
At the end of his first year in charge, Chief Executive John Flint said HSBC may have to delay investment plans in order to avoid missing a key target known as 'positive jaws' - which tracks whether the bank is growing revenues faster than costs - for a second straight year.
""We will be proactive in managing costs and investment to meet the risks to revenue growth where necessary, but we will not take short-term decisions that harm the long-term interests of the business,"" Flint said on Tuesday, after HSBC reported a lower-than-expected 16 percent rise in 2018 profit before tax.
In June, Flint had said HSBC would invest $15-$17 billion over three years in areas including technology and China, while keeping profitability and dividend targets little changed. 
""The key thing is just to moderate the pace of investments ... not to cancel it or change the shape of the investments,"" Flint told Reuters.
The bank said it failed to achieve positive jaws in 2018 due to the weakness of markets in the fourth quarter.
A combination of U.S.-China trade tensions, central banks turning off the money taps and cooling growth in former hot spots wiped 10 percent off MSCI's 47-country world stocks index last year, its first double-digit loss in any year since the 2008 global financial crisis.
GROWING BUT SLOWLY
Flint's comments come as an economic slowdown in China challenges HSBC's strategy of pouring more resources into Asia where it already makes nearly 90 percent of its profits.
China's economic growth slowed to 6.6 percent in 2018, the weakest in 28 years, weighed down by rising borrowing costs and a clampdown on riskier lending that starved smaller, private companies of capital and stifled investment.
Pressure on the world's second-largest economy could increase if Beijing and Washington do not reach a deal soon to end their year-long trade dispute, which is taking a growing toll on export-reliant economies from Asia to Europe.
HSBC's profits in Asia grew by 16 percent to $17.8 billion last year, accounting for 89 percent of group profit.
""Clearly our customers are really more cautious and are more thoughtful around this trade war with the U.S.,"" Flint said.
""It's possible that we'll see a slightly lower growth rate this year but we are still going to see a growth rate.""
Since taking over from Stuart Gulliver last February, Flint has largely stuck to the same China-focused strategy as his predecessor while attempting to revive HSBC's ailing U.S. franchise and putting less emphasis on its investment bank.
BREXIT HIT 
HSBC set aside $165 million against possible future bad loans in Britain, which it said reflected the increased risks of a potential economic hit from Britain's departure from the European Union, scheduled for next month.
HSBC joined UK peer Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) in warning that uncertainties related to Brexit could also drive businesses under.
""The longer we have the uncertainty the worse it's going to be for the customers. Customers are absolutely postponing investment decisions ... and that's been the part of this slowdown that we have seen in the UK,"" Flint said.
HSBC reported a profit before tax of $19.9 billion for 2018, versus $17.2 billion the year before, but below an average estimate of $22 billion, according to Refinitiv data based on forecasts from 17 analysts.
The bank said it would pay a full-year dividend of $0.51 per share, roughly in line with analysts' expectations. HSBC was confident of maintaining the dividend at this level, it said.

The bank's core capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, fell to 14 percent at the end of December from 14.5 percent at the end of 2017, mainly due to adverse foreign exchange movements.

950,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 19, 2019 04:51AM ET</span>",MarketPulse Europe - The Double-Edged Sword of Asian Exposure,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Having strong exposure to fast-growing Asia is generally something that has been good for company stocks in recent years. But the results – and the accompanying commentary – out of HSBC (LON:HSBA) today show that that can no longer be taken for granted.
HSBC – historically, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation – is notionally a British bank, but it gets nearly 90% of its profits from Asia, and most of that comes from its operations in Greater China. It’s been the bank’s strategy for some years to ‘pivot’ more heavily to Asia, after a series of governance scandals at freewheeling local subsidiaries forced it to row back its previous pretensions to be ‘the world’s local bank’.
But what happens when the basket you’ve put all your eggs in gets shaken up by an assertive U.S. President?
The bank’s shares are down 4% in London this morning – and back in negative territory for 2019 to date - after it reported a fourth-quarter result so bad that it missed its full-year by a considerable margin. Revenue and pretax profit both rose last year, by 5.5% and 16% respectively, but both were well short of analysts’ expectations.
HSBC's loan growth in Asia slowed to only 5.5%, less than half of what the bank reported in 2017. New CEO John Flint told the Financial Times (metered access) that market revenues had ‘collapsed’ in December and told Reuters that slower growth this year was a possibility. No wonder it's the worst-performing stock in the FTSE 100 this morning, followed closely by  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) - another Asia-focused bank.
The worst, of course, could still be ahead. President Donald Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25% from 10% at the start of next month if China doesn’t agree to a list of demands on reforming its own economy. “Obviously, 25 per cent tariffs — if we got there — that would be a different order of magnitude, and that could really start to disrupt supply chains,” Mr Flint told the FT.
Elsewhere Tuesday at 04:50 AM ET (09:50 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down -1.54 points, or 0.4% at 368.24. The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.5%, while Germany’s Dax index was down 0.1%, waiting for this month’s influential ZEW index of economic sentiment."

At 0829 GMT, the STOXX 600 was down 0.2 percent with most European bourses close to flat.
A new round of talks between the U.S. and China to resolve their trade war will take place in Washington on Tuesday.
Among the stocks in the red and pulling indexes down was HSBC, which reported a disappointing annual profit as higher costs and a stocks rout chipped away at its trading businesses.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) downgraded its rating for the stock to 'neutral' following the release of its results, saying there is ""limited upside"" for the share price.
The banking sector fell 0.8 percent.
The session's top gainer was Germany's Wirecard, up 7.7 percent. On Monday, Germany's financial watchdog banned ""short"" selling of the stock due to volatility following reports in the Financial Times which are now the subject of an investigation by German authorities.
Still in Germany, HeidelbergCement (DE:HEIG) jumped 4.4 percent as it shrugged off concerns about trade wars and a disorderly Brexit to forecast higher demand for cement this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Japanese car maker Honda is set to announce it's closing its only British car plant in 2022 with the loss of 3,500 jobs, a lawmaker told Reuters, in the latest blow to the UK car industry as Brexit approaches.
A closure of Honda's Swindon factory in southern England would be its second plant shuttering in 2022. The automaker said more than a year ago it will close one of its Japan plants in 2022, in an effort to consolidate production as it focuses on new vehicle technologies.
Honda built over 160,000 vehicles at Swindon, where it makes the hatchback version of its popular Civic model, accounting for a little more than 10 percent of Britain's total output of 1.52 million cars.
But it has struggled in Europe in recent years, and the industry faces a number of challenges including declining diesel vehicle demand and tougher regulations alongside the uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union, due next month. 
Justin Tomlinson, a Conservative lawmaker for Swindon who voted for Brexit in 2016, said he had met with the business minister and representatives from Honda who had confirmed the plans.
""They were due to make a statement tomorrow morning, it's obviously broken early,"" Tomlinson, lawmaker for North Swindon, told Reuters.
""This is not Brexit-related. It is a reflection of the global market. They are seeking to consolidate production in Japan.""
Honda said it would not be providing any comment on the ""speculation"". 
""We take our responsibilities to our associates very seriously and will always communicate any significant news with them first,"" the firm said.
Honda announced in October 2017 it would stop making vehicles at its Sayama plant in Japan by 2022 as it grapples with a shrinking domestic market.
Like many of its global rivals, Honda is trying to streamline its operations as it invests heavily to develop electric vehicles and self-driving cars, transforming itself from simply a manufacturer of cars into a mobility company. 
Japan has repeatedly warned it could pull investments in Britain, which it had seen as a gateway into Europe, if London does not secure a Brexit deal favorable for trade. 
The recently agreed EU-Japan trade agreement means tariffs on cars from Japan to the continent will be eliminated, while Britain is struggling to make progress on talks over post-Brexit trade relations with Tokyo.
NISSAN'S MOVE
Honda's announcement would come just over two weeks after bigger Japanese car maker Nissan canceled plans to build its X-Trail sport utility vehicle in Britain. 
In January, Britain's biggest automaker Jaguar Land Rover said it would cut 10 percent of its workforce, mainly at home, due to sluggish sales to China and a slump in European diesel demand.
""The car industry in the UK over the last two decades has been the jewel in the crown for the manufacturing sector – and now it has been brought low by the chaotic Brexit uncertainty,"" said Des Quinn, national officer for the automotive sector at Unite, Britain's biggest trade union. 
Honda said last month it would shut its British operations for six days in April to help counter any border disruption from Brexit. It was also preparing to front-load some production at its plant to ship overseas or build up inventories.
Nissan, Honda and a third Japanese car maker, Toyota Motor Corp, together account for roughly half of the cars built in Britain. 
Honda, which has been building more cars for sale outside of Europe in recent years, said earlier this month its production volumes at Swindon would be reduced to 570 cars per day and that it would make job cuts. 

""This reduction in volume will not have any impact on our permanent resource levels, and is in line with our current production plans,"" the company said.

958,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 18, 2019 11:20PM ET</span>",UBS's $6 Billion Gamble in France Tax Case: Deal or No Deal?,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s UBS Group AG’s $6 billion gamble, but the risk extends far.
The Swiss lender eschewed a settlement in a French tax investigation after failing to agree on an amount, exposing it to in-court demands from the state and prosecutors that Paris judges impose as much as 5.3 billion euros ($6 billion) in fines and damages for lost revenue.
The verdict comes Wednesday. While it’s no secret that thousands of French citizens moved funds to undeclared Swiss accounts to avoid taxes, the court will have to decide whether there is evidence UBS provided services to conceal such fraudulent funds -- and to what extent.
The danger for UBS and financial prosecutors, but also other companies under investigation in France, comes down to the bet on going to court or pushing for a deal.
Paris attorney Benjamin Grundler said multinationals will be monitoring the case, and tweaking their legal strategies depending on “where the court sets the bar.”
“If UBS is convicted and gets an eye-watering fine, that’s going to make firms currently under investigation increasingly more eager to seek settlements,” Grundler said. “But if there’s no conviction or if the fine is small, they’ll wonder: Isn’t it better to put up a fight despite the potential bad press and protracted process rather than paying 100-million or billion-euro fines?”
France two years ago introduced a U.S.-style settlement procedure, helping financial prosecutors take on a more global role.  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA negotiated with the Parquet National Financier last year to pay 250 million euros to end a bribery case, and  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) similarly settled a tax probe in 2017 for 300 million euros -- the largest criminal fine in France.
International Presence
The two recent French settlements are still far less than the multi-billion-dollar fines issued by authorities in the U.S. or Brazil in cases involving  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and construction firm Odebrecht SA., and still only half of what  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) or Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (LON:RR) paid in Germany or the U.K.
In the UBS case, prosecutors have requested that Paris judges impose a 3.7 billion-euro fine, while the French government is seeking another 1.6 billion euros in damages.
Ahead of the court’s decision, UBS referred to a Nov. statement where the bank said “the lack of a case for the prosecution is very evident,” and described the requested fine amount as “irrational.” Regardless of the outcome, an appeal is expected.
An acquittal would undercut some of the PNF’s credibility because of the large fines it requested.
‘Strong Signal’
But a fine close to or breaking the French record would undoubtedly send “a strong signal,” said Paris attorney Astrid Mignon Colombet, even if it’s less than the 1.1 billion-euro bail UBS was forced to post before the start of the trial.
“France entered the settlement game only relatively recently and doesn’t have a history of white-collar crime convictions with exceptionally high amounts,” said Mignon Colombet, who isn’t involved in the UBS case. “If there’s a big fine on Wednesday, settlements are going to seem even more attractive to companies. And the already strong deterrent effect of court convictions will increase.”
The Parquet National Financier was set up in 2014 after former French President Francois Hollande’s budget minister Jerome Cahuzac, responsible for cracking down on fiscal fraud, had to resign because he used a secret Swiss account to avoid taxes. The PNF focuses on major white-collar crimes and is pursing investigations into Airbus SE, TechnipFMC Plc, billionaire Vincent Bollore and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
The financial prosecutor’s office won its largest in-court conviction for a company in 2017 with a 80 million-euro fine for Rietumu Banka over accusations the Latvian bank participated in a tax-dodging scheme. Barely noticed elsewhere, it was a sea change in France where significant previous convictions rarely exceeded six-figure amounts.
SocGen Settlement
But it was the HSBC deal and last year’s Societe Generale settlement gave the PNF a role in the global fight against economic crimes. France took half of the total SocGen fine in a 50-50 split with the U.S., becoming one of the few jurisdictions that American authorities have worked with on bribery resolutions, including Brazil, the U.K. and Switzerland.
UBS has been dealing with the tax case for about eight years, and twice entered talks to settle. The first attempt broke down in 2014 after the Swiss lender balked at entering a guilty plea. Two years ago, UBS was angling to become the first company to use the settlement tool, paying fines but not admitting guilt, but discussions collapsed over how much the bank should pay and the case ended up in court instead. The PNF was seeking no less than the 1.1 billion-euro bail while UBS aimed to pay about six times less.
Grundler expects French financial prosecutors might become more greedy in settlement talks if they manage to clinch a convincing court win against UBS.
“When you emerge as the victor in a battle like this that clearly strengthens your negotiating hand for other cases,” said Grundler, who specializes in white-collar crimes but isn’t involved in the UBS case.

959,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2019 11:03PM ET</span>",Huawei founder says Huawei CFO arrest was politically motivated: BBC,"(Reuters) - Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei said on Monday that the arrest of his daughter, Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, was politically motivated. 
""Firstly, I object to what the U.S. has done. This kind of politically motivated act is not acceptable,"" Ren told the BBC in an interview. 
Canada arrested Meng on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States. Meng was charged with bank and wire fraud to violate American sanctions against Iran.
The U.S. Justice Department denied the charges were politically motivated. “The Justice Department’s criminal case against Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou is based solely on the evidence and the law. The Department pursues cases free of any political interference and follows the evidence and rule of law in pursuing criminal charges,” spokeswoman Nicole Navas said in an email to Reuters. 
Huawei, along with another Chinese network equipment company, ZTE Corp (HK:0763), has been accused by the United States of working at the behest of the Chinese government. The United States has said their equipment could be used to spy on Americans. Huawei has repeatedly denied the claims.
Commenting on the spying concerns, the Huawei founder reiterated that the company will ""never undertake"" any spying activities.
Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment, faces intense scrutiny in the West over its relationship with the Chinese government and allegations of enabling state espionage, with the United States calling for its allies not to use its technology.
Ren said the company could downsize to weather such attempts by the United States. 
""The world cannot leave us because we are more advanced. Even if they (U.S.) persuade more countries not to use us temporarily, we can always scale things down a bit"", he added.
In comments on a potential ban in the UK, Ren said it would not make the company withdraw its UK investments, adding that it will shift its investments to the UK from the United States if U.S. actions against Huawei continue. 
""We will invest even more in the UK. Because if the U.S. doesn't trust us, then we will shift our investment from the U.S. to the UK on an even bigger scale,"" Ken told the BBC. 

Reuters reported earlier on Monday that British security officials do not support a full ban of Huawei from national telecoms networks despite U.S. allegations against the Chinese firm.

Trade-related news continued to be the main focus as Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He is set to visit Washington this week for a new round of negotiations with the U.S.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.2% by 9:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT), while the Shenzhen Component was trading near flat. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.2%.
Liu will meet U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, the Commerce Ministry said in a short statement on Tuesday.
The new round of talks followed a round of negotiations that ended last week in Beijing without a deal, although U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping both reported progress in trade talks last week, raising hopes of an agreement before a March 1 deadline for tariff hikes.
The talks this week are aimed at ""achieving needed structural changes in China that affect trade between the United States and China."" The two sides will also discuss China's pledge to purchase a substantial amount of goods and services from the U.S., the White House said in a statement.
While global stock markets advanced on the recent trade headlines, traders remained cautious on reports that China's government accused the U.S of ""fabricating an excuse for suppressing the legitimate development"" of Chinese enterprises.
The spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, Geng Shuang, said the U.S. is using ""political means"" to interfere in economic activity, which he deemed ""hypocritical, immoral and unfair bullying.""
Since last year, the Trump administration has been putting pressure on allies to shun networks supplied by Huawei Technologies, threatening the company's access to markets for next-generation wireless gear.
Elsewhere, Australia’s ASX 200 rose 0.4%. Shares of health supplements company Blackmores dived more than 22% after the company issued a weaker-than-expected outlook for the second half of its fiscal year.

The U.S. aviation safety agency's year-long civil probe found systemic and significant mistakes with employee calculations and luggage-loading practices, resulting in potential discrepancies when pilots compute takeoff weights, the Journal reported, citing government officials and internal agency documents 
The FAA has not decided whether to impose fines or any other punishment, the report cited people familiar with the investigation as saying.
The inaccuracies ranged from a few dozen pounds to more than 1,000 pounds (450 kg) in excess of what the paperwork indicated, sparking disputes between the company and some agency inspectors about potential safety consequences, the report said.
A company spokeswoman said there was an open Letter of Investigation (LOI), which is a common mechanism for the FAA to document and share safety interests or concerns with an airline.
The airline has not been issued fines and faces no enforcement action regarding its weight and balance program, Southwest spokeswoman Brandy King said.
""In this case, the LOI addresses an issue that Southwest voluntarily reported to the FAA last year and since that time, Southwest has implemented controls to address weight and balance program concerns, and shared those measures with the FAA,"" King said. 
The FAA said in a statement it initiated a probe against Southwest in 2018 regarding weight and balance performance data.

""Since that time, the FAA has directed the development of a comprehensive solution to the methods and processes used by Southwest Airlines to determine this performance data,"" it said in the statement. ""The FAA will not close its investigation until it is satisfied that Southwest’s corrective actions are consistent and sustained.""

962,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2019 05:53PM ET</span>","Brazil's Bolsonaro fires senior minister, investor sentiment sours","By Ricardo Brito and Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Monday fired one of his most senior aides and cabinet members, Gustavo Bebianno, amid a scandal involving campaign financing for some of his party's congressional candidates.
Bebianno was secretary general of the president's office. His departure punctuated Bolsonaro's first cabinet crisis since he took office on Jan. 1 and has cast a shadow over the young government's plans.
Brazilian markets fell on Monday as investors feared that the brewing scandal could hurt Bolsonaro's ability to pass a pension overhaul seen as key to fiscal and economic recovery.
In a short video clip released late on Monday, Bolsonaro said he took the decision to dismiss Bebianno due to ""differences of opinion on important issues,"" although he did not elaborate.
Bebianno, who helped coordinate government affairs and was acting president of Bolsonaro's right-wing Social Liberal Party for the election campaign last year, denies any wrongdoing.
Analysts at Eurasia Group said in a note on Monday, before Bebianno was dismissed, that the scandal is unlikely to dent Bolsonaro's approval ratings. Despite the dubious optics, the president can claim to be taking a tough stand against an aide accused of illicit activity. 
But the timing could not be worse. Days before unveiling its landmark pension reform proposal, the government is mired in scandal, even if it is one that probably will not have much lasting impact on the administration or pension reform. 
""It is indicative, however, of a political team in disarray,"" they wrote, adding that everything points to ""an end result that will probably lead to the approval of a less ambitious version of the government’s proposal for pension reform.""
The scandal is denting investor sentiment, which had brightened last week after early details of Bolsonaro's social security reform proposals were released. The full package will be presented to senior lawmakers on Wednesday.
Brazil's Bovespa stock market fell 1 percent on Monday, the dollar rose almost 1 percent to 3.7350 reais and January 2020 interest rates rose two basis points to 6.39 percent.
Last week, the Bovespa rose 2.3 percent, within touching distance of its record-high 98,588. Interest rates fell 15 basis points, the biggest weekly drop in two months, and the real also rose..

The Bebianno scandal got personal after one of Bolsonaro's sons branded him a liar on Twitter, putting pressure on the president to dismiss him just weeks into his term.

(Reuters) - Student-loan servicer Navient Corp has rejected a $3.2 billion takeover bid from two investors as it believes the offer undervalues the company.
Navient’s board voted on Monday to reject the $12.50 per share offer from hedge fund Canyon Capital Advisors LLC and private-equity firm Platinum Equity Advisors LLC.
The offer represents a 6.6 percent premium over Navient’s Friday closing price of $11.73 a share.
The $12.50 per share offer was surprisingly lower than the $14 to $15 informal price range Canyon's advisers had given Navient during talks, Navient's chairman, William Diefenderfer, said in a statement.
The Wilmington, Delaware-based company recently ran into trouble with regulators over its business practices.
The company was accused by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of cheating hundreds of thousands of borrowers out of loan relief, telling a federal court the bureau did not identify even one such borrower. (https://reut.rs/2NbHR0m)
Navient said it would consider any proposal in the future if it reflected the fair value of the company.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. auto industry urged President Donald Trump's administration on Monday not to saddle imported cars and auto parts with steep tariffs, after the U.S. Commerce Department sent a confidential report to the White House late on Sunday with its recommendations for how to proceed.
Some trade organizations also blasted the Commerce Department for keeping the details of its ""Section 232"" national security report shrouded in secrecy, which will make it much harder for the industry to react during the next 90 days Trump will have to review it.
""Secrecy around the report only increases the uncertainty and concern across the industry created by the threat of tariffs,"" the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association said in a statement, adding that it was ""alarmed and dismayed.""
""It is critical that our industry have the opportunity to review the recommendations and advise the White House on how proposed tariffs, if they are recommended, will put jobs at risk, impact consumers, and trigger a reduction in U.S. investments that could set us back decades.""
Representatives from the White House and the Commerce Department could not immediately be reached.
The industry has warned that possible tariffs of up to 25 percent on millions of imported cars and parts would add thousands of dollars to vehicle costs and potentially devastate the U.S economy by slashing jobs.
Administration officials have said tariff threats on autos are a way to win concessions from Japan and the EU. Last year, Trump agreed not to impose tariffs as long as talks with the two trading partners were proceeding in a productive manner.
""We believe the imposition of higher import tariffs on automotive products under Section 232 and the likely retaliatory tariffs against U.S. auto exports would undermine - and not help - the economic and employment contributions that FCA, US, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) make to the U.S. economy,"" said former Missouri Governor Matt Blunt, the president of the American Automotive Policy Council.
Some Republican lawmakers have also said they share the industry's concerns.
In a statement issued on Monday, Republican Congresswoman Jackie Walorski said she fears the Commerce Department's report could ""set the stage for costly tariffs on cars and auto parts.""

""President Trump is right to seek a level playing field for American businesses and workers, but the best way to do that is with a scalpel, not an axe,"" she added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Papa John's International Inc founder John Schnatter welcomes hedge fund Starboard Value LP's investment in the pizza restaurant chain, his lawyer said, even as he filed an updated lawsuit on Monday against the company.
Papa John's this month unveiled Starboard's investment of up to $250 million and named the fund's chief executive, Jeff Smith, as its chairman. 
Schnatter, who according to Refinitiv data owns about 30 percent of the company he founded in his father's bar, served as chairman until last summer. He stepped down after reports he had used a racial slur on a media training conference call, a decision he said he regrets. He had stepped down as chief executive in December 2017. 
Schnatter, who is still a member of Papa John's board of directors, has been trying to gain more control of the chain. With the Starboard investment, the number of directors jumped to nine from six, diluting his influence.
""Mr. Schnatter welcomes the comments that have come from Mr. Smith and the company in the past few days,"" Schnatter's attorney Garland Kelley said in a statement. ""Today's amended lawsuit reflects support for Mr. Smith and his plans to invigorate the company for the benefit of all shareholders.""  
In his amended lawsuit filed under seal in the Delaware Court of Chancery, Schnatter aims to undo a new provision of a voting agreement between Papa John's and Starboard that requires the hedge fund vote its company shares in favor of Papa John's preferred directors.
""Such a provision serves only one purpose, to further entrench the prior board, one that has repeatedly proven itself willing to place its own self-interest above that of shareholders,"" Schnatter said in a statement.
Schnatter also continues to challenge the poison pill Papa John's adopted last year that he says prevents him from having discussions about the restaurant chain with other shareholders. The lawsuit was first filed in August.
When Papa John's accepted Starboard's offer, it snubbed a rival one from Schnatter.
Schnatter had said in a regulatory filing that he was evaluating his legal options after his offer was rejected. 

Last month he claimed a victory when Chancellor Andre Bouchard of Delaware Court of Chancery ordered the Papa John's board to give Schnatter some internal documents and communications, including text messages on personal devices, related to his firing.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's financial watchdog has banned ""short"" selling of Wirecard shares due to volatility in the payments firm's stock following reports in the Financial Times which are now the subject of an investigation by German authorities.
Munich prosecutors said on Monday they were investigating a Financial Times journalist, confirming that they had widened a probe into a possible violation of securities trading rules.
The Financial Times (FT) rejected as ""baseless and false"" any allegations against the newspaper or its journalists of market manipulation or unethical reporting relating to Wirecard.
A spokeswoman for the Munich prosecutors said their inquiry, which was in response to a criminal complaint, was at an early stage and declined to give any further details.
Bafin, Germany's financial markets regulator, said the ban on ""shorting"" Wirecard was a first for an individual stock, although it outlawed shorting of bank shares in 2008. Short selling is when an investor borrows shares to sell in the hope of being able to buy them back later at a lower price.
The London-based FT has published a series of reports alleging fraud and creative accounting at Wirecard, which the Munich-based firm has rejected as defamatory.
""The last few days have seen massive uncertainty in financial markets. This was triggered in particular by the price development of the Wirecard AG share in recent weeks"", Bafin said in a statement.
Shares in Wirecard, which provides payment processing services, gained 15.1 percent in Frankfurt, partly reversing a recent drop of 40 percent. Bafin said it had banned the taking or increasing of short positions until April 18.
Bafin said Wirecard had been the subject of negative reports between 2008 and 2016 and again since late January.
""The press reports have coincided with increased net short positions"", Bafin said, adding that the short positions were held by various investors, especially from abroad, often below the publication threshold.
A Wirecard spokesman said: ""We welcome all measures of the supervisory authorities that contribute to a quick clarification.""
CONTAGION RISK
Wirecard, founded in 1999, has been a perennial target for speculative short sellers who have questioned its accounting methods and rapid international expansion.
This has caused huge volatility in Wirecard's stock, though its share price has rebounded repeatedly, with the company last year entering the blue-chip DAX index.
""In recent days, there has been a further substantial increase in the net short positions"", Bafin said, adding that the events had created market uncertainty, particularly over the appropriate price determination for Wirecard shares.
Data from IHS Markit show that at the end of last week, 12.8 percent of Wirecard shares were out on loan, which IHS Markit said was a proxy for short positions. That is up from just 3.5 percent at the beginning of February. 
Regulatory filings show that one of the firms shorting Wirecard is Odey Asset Management, which had a short position against 0.77 percent of Wirecard stock as of Feb. 8. 
""I find it very surprising that Bafin are willing to step in at this point in time,"" fund manager Crispin Odey said. 
Investors must notify Bafin once their short position exceeds 0.2 percent and those holding more than 0.5 percent are obliged to publish this information. 
In 2012 the European Union banned so-called naked short selling, shorting securities without first borrowing a stock, alleging shortsellers were aggravating the financial crisis. 
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said that the Wirecard price moves constituted a serious threat to market confidence in Germany and posed the risk of contagion.
It added that historical volatility levels spiked to 99.1 percent on Feb. 8, compared to 49.1 percent on January 29.
Traders were not convinced the ban would work.

""Thinking back to other short sell bans elsewhere, it rarely has the desired effect,"" Mark Taylor, a sales trader at Mirabaud Securities, said.

974,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2019 01:00PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Glencore to take 200,000 T of aluminum from ISTIM Port Klang warehouses","By Pratima Desai
LONDON (Reuters) - Mining giant  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) has bought 200,000 tons of aluminum on the London Metal Exchange and will take delivery of the metal from warehouses owned by ISTIM UK in Port Klang, Malaysia, five sources familiar with the matter said.
Glencore wants the aluminum for delivery to clients but sources said the move was also a direct challenge to ISTIM, which is preventing companies from taking LME warranted metal when needed from its warehouses in Port Klang.
Canceled aluminum - material earmarked for delivery - in ISTIM's Port Klang warehouses stood at 309,800 tons at the end of January, up from 30,000 tons at the end of December.
Commodity trader Glencore is a major player in the aluminum market outside China, though it doesn't produce any itself. 
Sources said Glencore bought more than 1 million tons from Russia's Rusal last year and takes the bulk of production from Century Aluminium, in which Glencore has a more than 40 percent stake. Century's output in 2017 was more than 740,000 tons.
Glencore's agreements to buy aluminum from smelters around the world would take its total to about 3 million tons, sources say. That is about 10 percent of supply outside China, which accounts for 56 percent of the total at 65 million tons. 
Glencore, Rusal and ISTIM declined to comment. Century Aluminium did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
""They've (Glencore) canceled 200,000 tons in Port Klang. It's moving out slowly and unlikely to go back into the LME system,"" one aluminum industry source said, adding that the impact of Glencore's purchase could be seen in higher physical premiums.
Premiums are a reference to the extra paid for metal in the physical market over and above the benchmark LME aluminum price at around $1,860 a ton. 
European premiums on COMEX have risen to $78 a ton, the highest since October and compared with $60 at the start of January. Traders said some physical sellers were achieving $100 a ton or more.
Premiums came under pressure at the start of the year on expectations that large amounts of aluminum would come flooding into Europe after the United States lifted sanctions on Rusal. But that hasn't happened yet.
Glencore was buying aluminum from Rusal under a seven-year contract to purchase 14.5 million tons from 2012.
""That contract ended last year. Glencore will for now buy aluminum from Rusal on a quarterly basis,"" an aluminum trader said. 
""There is a lot of aluminum in LME warehouses in Malaysia, and Port Klang is one of the cheapest places to store metal.""
Metal entering the LME's global warehouse storage network is issued with a title document called a warrant. The latest data shows more than 613,000 tons of aluminum on LME warrant out of a total above 1.26 million tons is in Port Klang. 
Glencore-owned Access World, with warehouses in Port Klang, is a likely destination for the canceled metal, but it could also move to different locations or other warehouse firms, sources said.
""Some of that metal will move across the road,"" an aluminum industry source said, adding that price differentials for contracts along the maturity curve were an incentive for Glencore to buy now and sell forward.
For example, a healthy profit can be made by buying the three-month contract and selling the December contract for a premium of $60 a ton so long as financing and off-warrant rental costs are lower.

Storing metal off warrant costs about 10 cents a ton a day, sometimes less, a fraction of the more than 50 cents for aluminum on LME warrant in many LME locations.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's overwhelmingly foreign-owned car industry built 1.52 million cars last year, a decline of 9 percent on the year before, with output forecast to drop further in 2019. 
The sector faces challenges including declining diesel vehicle sales, stricter regulations, speeding up the development of electric vehicles and Brexit, which could end free trade terms with the European Union that the industry says is vital.
A British lawmaker told Reuters on Monday that Japanese carmaker Honda was set to announce the closure of its British plant in 2022 with the loss of 3,500 jobs.
Following are details on the major carmakers in Britain. 
JAGUAR LAND ROVER 
Britain's biggest carmaker made 449,304 cars last year at its three production sites: Castle Bromwich and Solihull in central England, and Halewood in northwest England.
The firm, owned by India's Tata Motors, posted a 15.6 percent drop in British output in 2018. 
The company's 2018 British output comprised a series of models: The F-type, F-Pace, XE, XF, XJ, Discovery, Discovery Sport, Range Rover Evoque, Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Range Rover Velar. 
Its cars are exported around the world.
NISSAN
The Japanese carmaker produced 442,254 cars in 2018 at its Sunderland plant in northeast England, a decline of 10.7 percent on 2017. 
Earlier this month, the company canceled plans to build its new X-Trail sport utility vehicle in Britain, citing the need to invest in new technologies but also raising the issue of Brexit uncertainty.
The company makes the Juke, Leaf, Qashqai and Infiniti models in Britain, which are mainly exported to EU countries. 
MINI
Mini, owned by Germany's BMW, was the only one of the six major carmakers in Britain to announce an increase in output in 2018, with volumes rising 7 percent to 234,183 cars. 
The company's Oxford factory in southern England makes the Mini. 
TOYOTA 
The Japanese carmaker made 129,070 cars at its Burnaston facility in central England in 2018 and is currently ramping up production of its new Corolla model.
Output at the site fell 10.4 percent last year, according to industry data. 
Toyota also produces engines at a separate facility and its British-made cars are sold across Europe. 
HONDA 
The Japanese carmaker's Swindon site in southern England made 160,676 cars in 2018, down 2.1 percent on 2017. 
Honda makes the Civic and CR-V models there but had already announced plans to cut production prior to the decision to shut the site, which is set to be confirmed on Tuesday. 
VAUXHALL
Vauxhall, owned by Peugeot maker PSA Group, built 77,481 cars in Britain last year, a 15.9 percent decline on the previous year.
The firm, which trades as Opel in continental Europe, produces its Astra model in Ellesmere Port, northwest England, but the firm has announced a series of job cuts in recent years as demand has dropped. 
The company also produces the Vivaro van at its southern English factory in Luton. 
OTHERS
Smaller luxury carmakers Aston Martin, BMW-owned Rolls-Royce (LON:RR), McLaren and Bentley are among the other carmakers operating in Britain, which produce smaller volumes. 

U.S. automaker Ford makes no vans or cars in the country, but builds nearly 1.3 million engines at two sites, in Dagenham, southeast England, and Bridgend, Wales, accounting for nearly half of Britain's total automotive engine output.

LONDON (Reuters) - The ""Big Four"" accounting firms in Britain have been asked by lawmakers to say how much they have spent on wining and dining clients and to demonstrate a link between the pay of their partners and the quality of their audits.
Rachel Reeves, chair of parliament's business committee, has written to EY, KPMG, Deloitte and PwC with nine questions and a Feb. 27 deadline for replies. The letters dated Feb. 13 were published on Monday.
Begun in January, the committee's inquiry aims to investigate whether reforms proposed by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will succeed in making the accountancy sector more competitive.
The CMA has recommended measures to inject more choice for companies when choosing an outside accountant to check their books.
A separate review has proposed a new regulator for auditors with tougher powers to improve quality after collapses at construction company Carillion and retailer BHS raised questions about how much time accountants spend on an audit.
In her letter, Reeves asks the Big Four to say how much they each spent on hospitality on audit and non-audit clients at Britain's top 350 listed companies in the past five years.
This would include expenditure on non-audit customers who later became audit clients.
Elsewhere in the financial sector, brokers are under pressure from regulators to scale back on hospitality such as tickets for rugby or tennis matches.
Accountants are also being asked to show how pay and promotion of auditors are linked to audit quality.

The committee is due to publish its report in March. KPMG said it would supply the information as requested. Deloitte, EY and PwC had no immediate comment.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) expects to boost annual revenue in Brazil over the next years by advising potential public asset sales and through a revival in capital markets, its chief executive officer in Brazil told journalists on Monday.
Marcelo Marangon said Citi expects its annual revenue in Brazil to grow to $1.5 billion from $1.1 billion over the next years. He did not specify a timeframe for the goal.
Bankers of Citi's Brazilian investment banking division are already targeting the largest asset sales and planning to vie for mandates in the transactions. 
The fastest government asset sales should be of stakes held by state-owned banks, such as development bank BNDES and Caixa Economica Federal, in publicly listed companies. 
BNDESPar, the holding company owned by BNDES, owns stakes in power companies such as Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, AES Tiete Energia SA and Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais- CEMIG, as well as in meatpacker JBS SA.
A government-controlled fund hired banks last week to sell its stake in reinsurer IRB Brasil Resseguros SA . 
Citi is also planning an expansion in its commercial banking division, which supplies services to mid-sized companies. Department head Antonio Rubens said Citi plans to double its Brazilian commercial banking unit's assets by 2020. 
The bank's commercial unit has roughly 5 billion reais ($1.34 billion) in assets, out of 75 billion reais for Citi's Brazilian operation as a whole, most of it dedicated to larger corporations. 
Rubens said those assets jumped by 27 percent in 2018 as an economic recovery increased demand. Deposits grew 10 percent to 3 billion reais.
Citi is targeting firms with between 200 million and 1.8 billion reais in revenues, he said. 
This move underscores a shift in Citi’s strategy in Brazil toward wholesale activities, after the sale of its retail activities there to Itaú Unibanco Holding SA for 710 million reais.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Rusal, the world's second-largest aluminum producer, is in talks to resume reinsuring its risks with Western companies after Washington lifted sanctions on it, officials with Russian National Reinsurance Co (RNRC) said. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Jan. 28 lifted sanctions on Rusal and other core assets of tycoon Oleg Deripaska. The reinsurance talks show the company is now trying to return to normal operations.
Natalia Karpova, deputy chief executive of RNRC, told reporters on Monday that Rusal is in talks with Western reinsurers to get them to once again share the aluminum company's risks.
She did not name any of the companies involved. 
Rusal's primary insurer is Ingosstrakh, one of Russia's largest insurance companies, according to two sources familiar with the process. Ingosstrakh had been reinsuring those risks with Western reinsurance firms prior to the imposition of sanctions by the U.S. Treasury on April 6 last year in response to what it called Russia's ""malign activities"". 
RNRC Chief Executive Nikolai Galushin told Reuters last year that after April 6 his firm was forced to take on almost all the risks of a number of Russian industrial plants previously shared among Western reinsurers. 
If Rusal persuades Western reinsurers to once again share Ingosstrakh's risks, RNRC is ready to share 20 percent of that reinsurance with Western firms, Galushin said on Monday. 
RNRC was set up by the Russian central bank chiefly to offer reinsurance to firms barred from using Western providers after sanctions were first imposed on Moscow in 2014.
The lifting of sanctions on Deripaska's interests remains contentious and U.S. congressional Democrats said on Jan. 29 they were not satisfied with the decision. 

Ingosstrakh did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Rusal declined to comment.

Russia hopes the MS-21, a twin-engine, medium-range passenger plane, will give Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus a run for their money. Three prototypes have been built and Rostec said on Monday the plane had been set to enter serial production at the end of this year. 
But Sergei Chemezov, Rostec's chief executive, said production would not now start until the end of 2020 due to U.S. sanctions. 
The sanctions have cut off imports of components from the United States and Japan needed to make the plane's wings and part of its tail fin, Russian officials have said previously. 
Chemezov said Russia would now have to make the necessary components itself and that would take time. 
""Due to the Americans stopping deliveries of composite materials (for the wings) we are moving to make our own composites,"" the Interfax news agency cited Chemezov as telling reporters at the IDEX military exhibition in Abu Dhabi. 
""The timeline of when we can start serial production is shifting a bit. We were meant to start producing several planes as part of serial production towards the end of this year, but now it will be towards the end of 2020.""

London (Reuters) - Hopes for progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks and expectations of policy stimulus from central banks lifted world stocks to 2 1/2- month highs on Monday, though European gains were held back by concern over the outlook for auto makers. 
MSCI's All-Country World Index rose 0.4 percent after Japan's Nikkei closed up 1.8 percent at its high for the year and MSCI's index of Asian equities rose almost 1 percent. Shanghai blue chips surged 2.7 percent to their highest finish in more than six months.

The Dow and the Nasdaq had boasted eight consecutive weeks of gains on wagers the United States and China can resolve their protracted trade dispute. (N) 
Negotiations will resume this week, with U.S. President Donald Trump saying he may extend a March 1 deadline for a deal. Both sides reported progress at last week's talks in Beijing.
The mood was more subdued in Europe, where a pan-European equity index inched to a four-month high. Gains were capped by auto makers, who were hit by data showing Chinese car sales fell 16 percent in January, their seventh straight month of decline.
The autos index, a bellwether for Europe's economy, fell 0.4 percent. The industry was also weighed down by fears that a U.S. Commerce Department report would lead to tariffs on imported cars and auto parts. German shares slipped 0.1 percent lower.
""The optimism on trade has been strong, but the underlying economic data has been a lot of weaker - so you have some push and pull factors,"" said David Vickers, senior portfolio manager at Russell Investments. Much focus was now on flash PMI data due out this week, he said.

984,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2019 08:41AM ET</span>","Counting cost of stockpiling, UK bike maker gears up for Brexit","By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Isla Rowntree, the founder of British children's bike maker Islabikes, has resorted to stacking spare parts in meeting spaces and office rooms as she gets ready for a potentially chaotic no-deal Brexit next month.
But the inconvenience of finding the space for six months' worth of stock is small compared with the financial consequences, she says.
Islabikes decided in September that it needed to prepare for the risk of delays at Britain's ports after Brexit by stockpiling the parts it buys from a supplier in Vietnam at its premises in Ludlow, a pretty market town in western England. 
Its preparations are typical of many companies -- including world famous firms such as Rolls-Royce (LON:RR), Airbus, luxury group Burberry -- who have depended on the ability to move goods easily between Britain and the rest of the world. 
They are facing the possibility of border delays from new EU customs checks on goods after March 29, unless Prime Minister Theresa May can win new concessions from the EU that heal the split within her Conservative Party.
British factories last month stockpiled goods at the fastest rate seen in any Group of Seven nation since records started in the early 1990s, according to the closely watched IHS Markit/CIPS surveys. 
Far from a simple act of preparation that can be reversed easily, stockpiling will have big consequences for manufacturers' finances, no matter how Brexit turns out.
""It has a massive, massive cashflow implication,"" said Rowntree, a former professional cyclist who started Islabikes after realizing that most children's bikes were heavy and poorly designed.
She founded the company in 2006 and it now employs 40 people. It designs and assembles its bikes in Ludlow, mostly for the domestic market but 25 percent of its sales go to continental Europe.
""Even if (Brexit) goes smoothly, we will end up with a drastically reduced operating profit at the end of the year because we had to spend all this extra money on warehouse space. And that's money that we can't invest in the future of the business,"" Rowntree said.
Repeated across the economy, that scenario might limit any rebound in business investment, even if London and Brussels strike a deal in the coming months.
Investment by companies in Britain has fallen for four consecutive quarters, the longest such run since 2009 when the economy was in the grip of the global financial crisis.
Rowntree said Islabikes was able to finance its stockpiling operation itself. ""But for a lot of businesses that obviously wouldn't be an option,"" she said.
GRAPHIC - Stockpiling for Brexit: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ebmj12
GEARING TROUBLE?
There are growing signs of financial stress for Britain's factory sector.
Bank of England figures show manufacturers' overdrafts as a percentage of business overdrafts, outside the financial sector, rose in December to the highest level since April 2016, at just under 20 percent. 
It was the biggest jump by this measure in three-and-a-half years.
And on the ground, those who keep a close eye on the health of British companies are now worried that manufacturers are over-stretching themselves financially by stockpiling goods.
Stocks of goods are not easy to use as collateral for loans because security can be complicated, with responsibility often split between lenders and suppliers.
""If they can't raise the finance to do that by going to a funder -- borrowing by way of debt -- typically it comes out of the cashflow,"" said Colin Haig, insolvency partner at accountants BDO.
Haig estimates there is a three- to six-month lag between early reports of companies becoming financially over-stretched and insolvency problems, such as breaches of financial covenants, that draw the attention of insolvency practitioners.
""I do think we're in that sort of space now,"" Haig, deputy vice president of insolvency trade body R3, said.
Euler Hermes, an insurer that provides protection against non-payment between companies, is also seeing ""substantial evidence"" of stockpiling, mainly among large manufacturers.
This is adding pressure to manufacturers' cashflow, with the average time between making a sale and receiving payment increased across the sector, Euler Hermes said.
""We're seeing contract terms lengthen by up to 120 days in some instances,"" said Shannon Murphy, assistant head of risk underwriting and manufacturing expert at Euler Hermes.
Murphy said stockpiling could work well for firms with fast-moving just-in-time supply chains, but those with slower-moving supply chains faced a risk of being lumbered with stock if orders dry up. 
PAINFUL CYCLE
Islabikes has a relatively quick production timetable, with a steady flow of parts arriving at its assembly line more or less weekly, and more often at peak times like Christmas.
The decision to stockpile means the company has had to forecast sales patterns much further into the future than normal -- another financial risk.
""That's an internal headache and it means that potentially we can't get the right product for the customers when they want it,"" Rowntree says. 
Rowntree hopes that a deal between London and Brussels can be signed soon, even if the outlook for Brexit is no clearer now than it was a year ago.

""It's really disappointing having to waste so much effort and sinking time and money on stuff that doesn't add value for the customer,"" she said. ""I don't like that, I like to put our energies into doing a better job.""

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates on Monday awarded Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co. a 5.7 billion dirhams ($1.55 billion) contract to supply its air force with platform systems to launch missiles, a UAE military spokesman said.
The agreement was signed at the week-long IDEX military exhibition in Abu Dhabi and followed the award on Sunday of a 1.3 billion dirhams contract to Raytheon to supply the UAE with patriot missiles.
The UAE armed forces signed a total of 7.2 billion dirhams in contracts on Monday, including 5.8 billion dirhams with international companies, Brigadier General Mohammed al-Hassani said, speaking through a translator.
The UAE has signed a total of 12 billion dirhams in contracts since the IDEX exhibition started on Sunday, he said.
 Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), Germany's Diehl Defence, and Sweden's Saab on Monday launched at IDEX the Falcon air defense weapon system, billed as a replacement to the Hawk system used by countries in the Middle East.
Falcon was developed in response to a UAE request for a replacement for the Hawk system and talks are underway to sell it to the Gulf state, Scott Arnold, Lockheed Martin's vice-president and deputy head of Integrated Air and Missile Defense said.
Weapons sales to the UAE have come under scrutiny over the past year due to the country's involvement in the Yemen war that has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed the country to the brink of starvation. 
The UAE and Saudi Arabia are leading a military coalition, which includes local forces drawn from Yemeni factions, that is trying to restore the internationally recognized government ousted from power in 2014 by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement.

987,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 18, 2019 07:50AM ET</span>",Buybacks and Bumper Profits on the Cards as Mining Giants Report,"(Bloomberg) -- A surge in iron ore prices is fueling hopes for bigger returns and a share-buyback spree as the world’s top miners prepare to report results.
BHP Group,  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group,  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc are expected to announce bumper profits over the next two weeks. So far, the biggest producers have remained stubbornly focused on shareholder returns, rather than spending on the types of acquisitions and big-ticket projects that burned investors during the last commodity boom.
“This should be a stellar reporting season,” Jefferies LLC analysts said in an emailed note. “We expect very strong results, a continued emphasis on capital returns, some discussion of potential growth, and a wave of consensus earnings upgrades.”
Igniting Iron Ore
Iron ore prices surged about 20 percent this year after last month’s deadly dam breach at a Vale SA iron ore mine in Brazil sent the market into turmoil. BHP, which reports results on Tuesday, and Rio Tinto Group, publishing next week, “are clear beneficiaries,” according to Jefferies.
There’s likely to be a focus on the extent to which other producers can ramp up output to fill the gap left by Vale. Still, top producers are operating close to capacity, according to Macquarie Wealth Management.
Investors will also be looking for reassurances from miners regarding their safety controls in the wake of Vale’s disaster. Anglo American is likely to face questions regarding the operating license at its Minas Rio dam in Brazil and the risk to production if that approval is not received, according to Jefferies.
Bigger Buybacks
Analysts are expecting record earnings from Glencore, but the bigger question is what it plans to do with all the cash being churned out of its mining and trading businesses. The stock has been weighed down by a U.S. probe into the company’s activities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Venezuela and Nigeria, as well as environmental concerns over its exposure to coal, Jefferies said.
To lure investors back, Glencore is expected to return billions of dollars in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Jefferies analysts estimate it could buy back at least $4 billion of shares this year -- equal to about 7 percent of its market capitalization.
Drill or Buy
The copper market got a jolt earlier this month when Robert Friedland, the founder of Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. and arguably the mining industry’s greatest showman, gave fresh details about the “mind-boggling” copper mine he’s building in Congo.
With financial support from Chinese backers Citic and Zijin Mining, Kamoa-Kakula will become the world’s second-largest source of copper within the next decade, Friedland said at the Mining Indaba conference in Cape Town.
The pronouncement should sharpen minds in the boardrooms of mining companies that have grown gun-shy on exploration and acquisitions since the downturn in the commodities supercycle. There’s near-unanimous agreement among executives that the copper market will move into a deep deficit in the next decade, and the question is when will miners commit capital to filling the gap.

988,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 18, 2019 06:50AM ET</span>",Anglo Platinum Hikes Dividend as Palladium Surge Boosts Cash,"(Bloomberg) -- Platinum prices are languishing near decade lows, yet investors in the No. 1 supplier of the metal haven’t had it this good for years.
 Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Platinum Ltd. (JO:AMSJ) declared its biggest dividend since 2008 as the company reported full-year earnings that nearly doubled, thanks to a weaker rand and surging prices for sister metal palladium. The Johannesburg-based miner’s shares have risen 104% in the past 12 months.
While rivals such as Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. and Lonmin Plc are also benefiting from higher prices for palladium and rhodium, which they dig up alongside platinum, Amplats is in a particularly strong position. The company resumed dividends last February after a six-year hiatus, during which it sold and wound down older, less profitable operations.
Palladium has surged 47 percent to successive records since the end of August. Demand for the metal, used primarily in the auto industry for catalytic converters in gasoline engines, is projected to exceed supply for an eighth straight year in 2019. The South African currency has also weakened 18 percent against the dollar in the past 12 months, which lowers costs at local mines.
Amplats said it expects the three major platinum-group metals -- platinum, palladium and rhodium -- will again be in a combined deficit in 2019, although platinum itself will see a “modest” surplus. Palladium will be in a “strong and widening” deficit this year, the company said.
“Automotive demand seems set to increase, even with little or no growth in vehicle sales, as average vehicle size increases and emissions rules tighten,” it said.
Amplats rose as much as 2.6 percent on Monday to 708.89 rand a share, the highest since February 2011.
The company’s strong balance sheet will enable it to increase investment in projects with low capital requirements and fast payback, while it advances studies to boost output at its key Mogalakwena mine that’s highly geared toward palladium, Ian Botha, the outgoing finance director, said on a conference call.
Amplats plans to complete studies by about 2020 to add annual output of 270,000 ounces of palladium and 250,000 ounces of platinum at Mogalakwena, Chief Executive Officer Chris Griffith said. The expansion may take about four to five years, he said.
Meanwhile, Amplats expects the palladium deficit to persist until there’s a meaningful move by auto makers to substitute platinum in their designs, the CEO said.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - State-owned Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI) aims to generate $10 billion in revenue over the next five years, its chief executive said on Monday, as the wealth fund-backed group spearheads a drive to localize military spending.
SAMI, owned by the Public Investment Fund, wants exports to account for 30 percent of its revenue by 2030, Chief Executive Andreas Schwer told Reuters at a defense event in Abu Dhabi.
The company, established in May 2017, seeks to localize 50 percent of military spending by 2030 as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plan to diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil revenue.
""By 2030 SAMI will be more than just a regional player. We will be a truly global player, to be among the top 10 companies,"" Schwer said. ""We won't serve only the domestic market. We will generate 30 percent of revenues from export markets by 2030.""
He said Saudi Arabia has a $70 billion annual defense budget plus a $30 billion security-related budget from other ministries.
Schwer said SAMI had signed 19 joint venture deals with companies from Western Europe, the United States, Asia and South Africa since 2018 and planned to sign 25 to 30 more in the next five years.
Schwer said SAMI would not do business with Russia due to U.S. sanctions. ""SAMI as an entity will not do any business with any country or company which is falling under embargo or sanctions,"" he said.
SAMI also planned to build a company in the kingdom as part of a joint venture with Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala to build aircraft components for commercial and military uses. A foreign partner could join the venture.

The tower at 25 Canada Square (NYSE:SQ), which already houses many of the bank's 6,000 London-based staff, was put up for sale in October by AGC Equity Partners. The source said a deal had yet to be agreed, with Citi unlikely to offer the full asking price.
Should Citi agree the purchase, with a decision likely in the next couple of months, the bank would look to move staff currently based in a second building in the area, 33 Canada Square, to the larger tower, the source said.
News of the talks was earlier reported by the Financial Times.
Such a move would be in line with Citi's strategy of buying buildings in locations where it has and intends to retain a presence, and follows a deal in 2016 to buy the group's New York office, the source said.

The deal would be a boost for London's commercial property market ahead of Brexit. Around 60 percent of Citi's Europe-based staff already work outside of Britain, which has meant very few - around 60 - were expected to be moved as part of preparations for Britain's exit from the European Union, the source said.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand will independently assess the risk of using China's Huawei Technologies in 5G networks, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday after a report suggested that British precautions could be used by other nations.
Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment, faces intense scrutiny in the West over its relationship with the Chinese government and U.S.-led allegations that its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying.
No evidence has been produced publicly and the firm has repeatedly denied the allegations, which have led several Western countries to restrict Huawei's access to their markets.
The Financial Times reported on Sunday that the British government had decided it can mitigate the risks arising from the use of Huawei equipment in 5G networks. It said Britain's conclusion would ""carry great weight"" with European leaders and other nations could use similar precautions.
New Zealand's intelligence agency in November rejected an initial request from telecommunications services provider Spark to use 5G equipment provided by Huawei. 
At the time, the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) gave Spark options to mitigate national security concerns over the use of Huawei equipment, Ardern said on Monday.
""The ball is now in their court,"" she told a weekly news conference.
Ardern said New Zealand, which is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing network that includes the United Kingdom and the United States, would conduct its own assessment.
""I would expect the GCSB to apply with our legislation and our own security assessments. It is fair to say Five Eyes, of course, share information but we make our own independent decisions,"" she said. 
Huawei New Zealand did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Spark said it was in discussions with GCSB officials. 
""We are working through what possible mitigations we might be able to provide to address the concerns raised by the GCSB and have not yet made any decision on whether or when we should submit a revised proposal to GCSB,"" Spark spokesman Andrew Pirie said in an emailed statement.
The Huawei decision, along with the government's tougher stance on China's growing influence in the Pacific, has some politicians and foreign policy analysts worried about potential strained ties with a key trading partner.
Ardern's planned first visit to Beijing has faced scheduling issues, and China last week postponed a major tourism campaign in New Zealand days before its launch.
Ardern said her government's relationship with China was strong despite some complex issues.

""Visits are not a measure of the health of a relationship they are only one small part of it,"" she said, adding that trade and tourism ties remained strong.

997,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 18, 2019 02:20AM ET</span>",German Carmakers at Most Risk From Trump Tariffs,"(Bloomberg) -- European carmakers’ share rally this year might hit a roadblock as a U.S. probe of auto imports raises the potential of new tariffs, with underperforming German manufacturers particularly at risk.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross submitted a report to President Donald Trump on whether vehicles made abroad pose a national-security risk, according to a statement Sunday. Trump will have 90 days for any response and, if he says he’ll move forward with measures under Department of Commerce recommendations, another 15 days to act.
U.S. government officials haven’t given any insights into the findings. At the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel rejected the idea that her country’s autos pose a threat to the U.S.
Car producers’ and suppliers’ stocks in Europe have gained in 2019 -- with the Stoxx 600 automotive index jumping 9.6 percent -- amid optimism that the U.S.-Chinese talks will resolve a dispute hampering the industry worldwide. BMW AG and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG have lagged behind as the German companies grapple with weakening demand in their home region and China.
Even with this year’s bounce, the industry still trades at a depressed valuation, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 6.6 that’s by far the lowest among all the sectors in Europe. And the automotive gauge is down 24 percent from a year ago. That’s a little before Trump began tweeting threats to tax German makers’ vehicles, though he’d complained since mid-2017 about the cars’ presence on U.S. streets.
While Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed in July to hold off on new tariffs during discussions to resolve an American-European dispute, the U.S. leader’s repeated tweets may indicate he’s primed to add import fees especially targeted at cars from the bloc, according to analysts.
“The risk that tariffs between Europe and the U.S. will come is rather high -- I would say slightly more than 50 percent,” Juergen Pieper, an analyst at Frankfurt-based Bankhaus Metzler, said in an email. “Trump seems to have a real problem with German cars.”
The European Union estimated in June that a 25 percent tariff would add about 10,000 euros ($11,300) to the sticker price of a car made in the bloc and sold in the U.S., and would cut American purchases of vehicles and parts in half. The Munich-based IFO Institute’s Center for International Economics calculates that an import fee of that size would cut German car sales to the U.S. by almost 50 percent, or about 17 billion euros, eroding total auto exports by 7.7 percent.
Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz brand and BMW, the world’s two biggest makers of luxury cars, and Volkswagen, the largest auto producer globally, have the most at stake from any U.S. trade penalties, even as they’ve reduced the need to bring in vehicles by building American plants. The U.S. is the second-largest market for both Mercedes-Benz Cars and BMW.
France’s  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and PSA Group, the owner of the Peugeot and Citroen marques, don’t sell vehicles in the U.S. PSA shares outperformed the European automotive benchmark in the past 12 months, while among carmakers with a U.S. presence, Daimler has posted the gauge’s worst decline.
Car and component exports from the EU to the U.S. totaled $62.5 billion in 2017 while imports amounted to $17.7 billion, according to a Feb. 15 note by Bernd Weidensteiner, an economist at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG). Germany accounted for $30.5 billion of the outbound figure, though only $8.5 billion of purchases from the U.S.
Even as American imports have declined in recent years as manufacturers established significant U.S. production, the German surplus of $22 billion is “a particular thorn in the side of President Trump,” he said.

The aggregate estimates for S&P 500 Index earnings growth mask a wide dispersion that obscures the potential for some good results, strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note Friday. The median member is expected to see earnings-per-share growth of 7 percent in 2019, compared with just 4 percent for the aggregate index, they said.
“The gap between the median and aggregate EPS growth underscores the opportunity for fundamental investors,” the strategists said. “The wide distribution of earnings growth highlights the importance of fundamental stock-picking as a way of differentiating returns and reinforces our expectation for a shift from ‘beta’ to ‘alpha.”’
Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). alone represent a drag of 20 percent on the S&P 500’s annual profit growth forecast, Kostin said. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., two of the biggest contributors, are expected to add 12 percent.
Analysts currently expect a small gain for second-quarter S&P 500 earnings after a decline in the first, but one within easy striking distance of a negative number that could be erased quickly as revisions arrive. Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist, Mike Wilson, recently declared that the “earnings recession is here” already. Two consecutive quarters of declines is how many economists define a technical recession.
Goldman is “less concerned” than many investors about the risk of an earnings recession, Kostin said. He cited the dispersion issue as well as an expectation that weak year-over-year profit growth should improve in the second half of the year. He also said the market has already priced in an earnings slowdown, and that revisions have troughed.
“S&P 500 returns will be more modest and micro-driven in the near-term,” Kostin wrote. “We recommend investors focus on relative value and idiosyncratic alpha opportunities.”

999,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2019 01:15AM ET</span>","A year after India's biggest bank fraud, PNB on road for annual profit","By Chris Thomas and Krishna V Kurup
(Reuters) - One year after being hit by a $2 billion scam, India's Punjab National Bank (PNB) is set to return to annual profits and strong loan growth in fiscal 2020 even as investigations continue into the country's biggest banking fraud.
State-run PNB has already surprised markets with an earlier-than-expected profit for the quarter ended Dec. 31 as it completed setting aside funds to cover for the scam and its bad loan levels eased.
(GRAPHIC: Punjab National Bank on track for recovery - https://tmsnrt.rs/2TR2ZLW) 
While the lender is still likely to post a loss of 59.84 billion rupees ($837.16 million) for this fiscal year ending March 31, analysts expect PNB to return to a full-year profit in the next fiscal, according to Refinitiv data.
The bank is expected to clock a net profit of 22.66 billion rupees for the year ending March 2020, which would be its highest annual profit in five years.
""The way the bank is shaping up, it is quite clear FY20 promises to be a much cleaner and better year for them,"" said Abhinesh Vijayaraj, vice president equity research for Spark Capital Advisors (India).
PNB's loan growth is estimated to be 8.33 percent for fiscal 2020, its highest in 4 years, as per the mean of analysts' estimates from Refinitiv. Its total assets are projected to grow at the highest rate in three years.
(GRAPHIC: Loan growth at PNB and SBI - https://tmsnrt.rs/2UYopa5) 
The lender said in February 2018 two jewelry groups used fake bank guarantees issued by rogue staff to raise credit overseas, triggering a plunge in its stock and driving it to three straight quarterly losses due to fraud-related provisions.
PNB's loss for the quarter following the scam's discovery was also a massive $1.90 billion - the biggest ever for an Indian lender.
INDUSTRY TREND
Market participants believe fiscal 2020 will likely be good for other lenders as well.
""It's going to be a good period for corporate lenders on the whole in FY20 as credit growth has picked up and asset quality-related problems are largely behind us,"" said Alpesh Mehta, an analyst with Mumbai-based brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities. 
In FY20, State Bank of India, the country's largest lender by assets, and smaller peer Bank of Baroda are expected to report their best annual profits since at least 1998.
(GRAPHIC: Punjab National Bank PE - https://tmsnrt.rs/2TPXptk)
PNB's shares have fallen about 56 percent since mid-Feb last year. That plunge makes its shares undervalued compared to their valuation in previous years. It currently trades at a 12-month forward price to earnings ratio (PE) of 9.29 in comparison with the last five years' average of 15.7 and last two years' average of 31.9.
Analysts too feel the stock is currently undervalued after multiple infusions of capital by the Indian government. Since Jan. 2018, the government has infused close to $2 billion into PNB to help shore up capital and revive loan growth.
(GRAPHIC: PNB share price - https://tmsnrt.rs/2TP5rCz) 
Some analysts, though, are cautious about PNB's prospects.
""The major concern is how has PNB changed their systems and processes following the scam, as it was unimaginable that such a big fraud could take place at one bank,"" said Asutosh Mishra, head of research of institutional equity at Ashika Stock Broking Ltd.
""Where will the bank be in three years is really the question,"" Spark Capital's Vijayaraj said.

1002,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 18, 2019 12:20AM ET</span>",Here Comes DBS’s Muddle-Through Year,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Singapore’s largest bank had only the briefest of honeymoons with an improving global economy.
Rising global interest rates, amplified by U.S. president Donald Trump’s late-cycle fiscal expansion, boosted DBS Group Holdings Ltd.’s loan profitability. But only up to a point.
In the past three months, the two to four rate increases CEO Piyush Gupta expected from the Federal Reserve in 2019 have begun to look all but impossible. Net interest margin did manage to expand by 1 basis point in the December quarter to 1.87 percent. Still, it’s hard to see how the 16-basis-point jump over the past two years can extend any further. 
One reason is Trump’s tariff war with China. Trade financing, which accounts for a tenth of the lender’s assets, shrank 5 percent by value over the previous quarter. A sudden deterioration in the global economic outlook and heightened volatility in asset prices are also taking a toll. With income from wealth-management fees falling to a two-year low and trading income dropping by 35 percent during the quarter, DBS’s net income missed the consensus estimate. 
Deposit competition in Hong Kong is another reason to be pessimistic about margins. Hong Kong dollar deposits, which provide more than 9 percent of DBS’s total customer funding, fell 3 percent. Within that, current and savings accounts – sources of practically free money – slid 13 percent in the December quarter. Virtual-only banks could further spice up competition for cheap funding in the city. 
Last year, DBS shored up profits by more than halving the elevated loan-loss provisions taken in 2016 and 2017, when a meltdown in global energy prices dinged Singapore's offshore-and-marine industry. There's little scope to cut credit losses any further. Neither will last year’s 7.9 percent gain in Singapore’s residential-property market be repeated anytime soon; home prices fell last quarter after the government clamped down on speculation in July.
A cost-to-income ratio of 46 percent-plus saw DBS’s return on assets slip below 1 percent in the December quarter – the first time that happened in 2018. To the extent higher costs are related to the bank’s technology push, the 1-percentage-point drop in return on equity to 11.3 percent should be temporary. 
Even if loan profitability doesn’t improve much this year, it’s unlikely to fall off a cliff: Surveys predict Singapore’s benchmark three-month interbank rate will still rise to 2.25 percent from 1.95 percent by the end of 2019. However, with the Fed putting interest rates on hold and hinting a pause to its balance balance sheet contraction, the best for DBS may already be in the rearview mirror.

According to a prospectus and industry data that were cited by Bloomberg, Ping An Fund Management Co., the fund arm, will offer an ETF tracking ChiNext startup stocks with a management fee of 0.15%, far lower than the industry average of 0.5%. Its 0.05% custodian fee is also just half of the 0.1% average.
“Technological upgrades and institutional demand prompted us” to introduce the product, the Ping An unit said in an e-mailed statement that was cited by Bloomberg. ETFs with “appropriate, reasonable fees” are more attractive in the long term and support market stability, it said.
The move echoed the approach of Vanguard Group, which tripled its ETF-market share to 26% in the U.S. over the course of a decade by cutting costs.
Vanguard has now amassed more than $5 trillion of client assets after offering low-cost funds to millions of Americans, Bloomberg noted.

Sanquan Food Co., based in Henan province, slumped the most since October after a media report said African swine fever was found in some of the company’s pork dumplings. Volume in the first hour of trading Monday was quadruple the three-month full-day average, according to Bloomberg data.
China is trying to contain the spread of African swine fever, which is threatening its massive pig population. The virus, which isn’t known to harm humans, was first reported in August. At least 24 provinces in the world’s top pork producer have disclosed outbreaks as of January.
Sanquan acknowledged the media report and said it was cooperating with the government, according to a statement to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The development follows an announcement last month from Fu Jian Anjoy Foods Co., which said some meat products tested positive for the virus.
Sanquan shares dropped as much as 7.2 percent, before paring declines to 1.6 percent as of 10:50 a.m. in Shenzhen. The Shenzhen Composite Index climbed as much as 2.6 percent.
Pig farmers that haven’t reported the virus continued a rally that began last week. The companies led the best week in more than three years for China’s agriculture stocks on speculation pork prices will be rising due to limited healthy pig supply, as China culled more suspected pigs.
Chuying Agro-Pastoral Group Co. and Muyuan Foodstuff Co. surged more than 5.6 percent in early Monday trading. Fu Jian rose as much as 1.7 percent.

TOKYO/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Japanese share buybacks have hit a record this fiscal year and are set to maintain the booming growth as cash-rich companies bow to pressure from investors and the government to boost returns and improve governance.
In recent weeks, SoftBank Group Corp, Sony, Itochu Corp and other companies have announced plans to buy back shares worth more than 1.3 trillion yen, bringing the total value of buybacks flagged since April 1 to over 6.5 trillion yen ($58.92 billion). 
That is already the most for any fiscal year since 2003 when new and stricter buyback rules were unveiled, according to financial data service firm I-N Information Systems.
Japan Buyback - https://tmsnrt.rs/2E9ABPV
Investors have long criticized Japanese companies for hoarding cash rather than investing it or returning it to shareholders, pushing down their returns on equity (ROE), a measure of the amount of profit a company generates from the money invested in it.
Buying back shares reduces a company's equity base, boosting its ROE. 
""This past month has seen a lot of very positive shareholder-friendly activity from a wide array of Japanese companies,"" said Seth Fischer, founder and chief investment officer of Oasis Management, citing actions by SoftBank, Sony, Haseko, Tokyo Tatemono and Toppan Printing. 
""To attract foreign investors, companies should continue this path of increasing shareholder returns, while continuing to improve their corporate governance."" 
Activist investor Oasis, among others, has been vocal in urging Japanese companies to boost returns. In December, Oasis failed to block the sale of Alpine Electronics to its larger affiliate Alps Electric, but Alps did announce a 45 billion yen buyback in January, the third largest buyback that month. 
Japan Inc is under pressure to appease foreign investors after they sold 13 trillion yen of Japanese stocks in 2018, more than four times the net sales in 2015 and 2016, and a sharp reversal of the net 1.9 trillion yen bought in 2017. 
""Recently, the global economy is weak and the Japanese market has fallen as foreign fast money has been selling aggressively,” said Archibald Ciganer, co-head of Japanese equity at money manager T.Rowe Price.
“But those Japanese companies that have good governance are taking advantage of cheaper stock prices and putting a floor under their stock price through buybacks.”
Share buybacks have had political pushback elsewhere. In the United States, Senator Marco Rubio last week announced plans to tax buybacks in an effort to encourage companies to reinvest spare cash instead of returning it to shareholders. 
In Japan, though, policy makers have been urging companies to pay more attention to the wishes of investors, most notably through the country's corporate governance and stakeholders codes. Guidelines released last year urged firms to focus on their financial management policies, including the amount of cash they had on hand. 
According to Ministry of Finance data, Japanese companies had internal reserves worth a record 446.5 trillion yen at the end of their latest fiscal year.
Japanese companies' ROEs are expected to fall below 10 percent this fiscal year for their first decline in three years, according to Nomura Securities. 
""Many Japanese companies simply have too much cash on their balance sheets weighing down their ROEs. Better capital structure management is definitely needed,"" said Kin Chan, chief investment officer of Argyle Street Management. 
Foreign investors outflow - https://tmsnrt.rs/2BMtYl1
A revision to Japan's corporate governance code last year, designed to push companies to sell stakes in other companies, is also driving buybacks. 
""Dissolving cross shareholdings, and increasing dividends and buybacks are two ways to make Japanese companies more attractive to foreign investors,"" said Patrick Moonen, principal multi asset strategist at Netherlands-based NN Investment Partners.
Further buybacks are expected. Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) predict that buybacks will reach 7.8 trillion yen for the 12 months to the end of March 2020. 
Currently, 56 percent of Japanese non-financial companies in the benchmark Topix index sit on net cash - meaning they have funds left over even if they paid all debts tomorrow. That compares with less than 20 percent in the United States or Europe, according to figures from brokerage CLSA. 

“I tell investors that the presents are still under the Christmas tree,"" said Nicholas Smith, CLSA's Japan strategist.

Smith was riding in the SUV when its driver swerved to avoid an animal and the vehicle rolled over twice, attorneys at law firms Beasley Allen and Gamble, Gamble, Calame and Jones said in a statement.
Ford said it plans to appeal. ""Our sympathy goes out to Travaris Smith and his family. At the same time, we disagree with the jury's conclusion in this case as well as with a series of rulings by the Alabama court that kept the jury from hearing critical evidence – and will appeal,"" Ford spokeswoman Monique Brentley said in a statement to Reuters.  

Ford said it has redesigned the Explorer since 1998.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian lender Gazprombank has decided to freeze the accounts of Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA and halted transactions with the firm to reduce the risk of the bank falling under U.S. sanctions, a Gazprombank source told Reuters on Sunday. 
While many foreign firms have been cutting their exposure to PDVSA since the sanctions were imposed, the fact that a lender closely aligned with the Russian state is following suit is significant because the Kremlin has been among Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s staunchest supporters.
""PDVSA’s accounts are currently frozen. As you’ll understand, operations cannot be carried out,"" the source said. Gazprombank did not reply to a Reuters request for a comment.
PDVSA brandished the story as ""fake news"" on its Twitter account in capital red letters, but did not reply to a request for comment.
Reuters reported this month that PDVSA was telling customers of its joint ventures to deposit oil sales proceeds in its Gazprombank accounts, according to sources and an internal document, in a move to try to sideline fresh U.S. sanctions on PDVSA. 
Washington says the sanctions, imposed on Jan. 28, are aimed at blocking Maduro's access to the country's oil revenue after opposition leader Juan Guaido proclaimed himself interim president and received widespread Western support.
Gazprombank is Russia’s third biggest lender by assets and includes among its shareholders Russian state gas company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP). 
The bank has held PDVSA accounts for several years. In 2013, PDVSA said it signed a deal with Gazprombank for $1 billion in financing for the Petrozamora company. The source said that Petrozamora accounts were frozen, too.
Russian officials have said they stand by Maduro and have condemned opposition actions as a U.S.-inspired ploy to usurp power in Caracas.

But Russian firms find themselves in a quandary, caught between a desire to endorse the Kremlin line and back Maduro, and the fear that by doing so they could expose themselves to secondary U.S. sanctions which would harm their businesses.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - South African defense company Paramount Group expects to sign agreements with four African governments this year to set up production facilities in their countries, its chairman said on Sunday.
Paramount, Africa's largest privately owned defense firm, has established manufacturing capabilities to meet demand from specific domestic markets before, including in India, Jordan, and Kazakhstan.
It is in talks with four countries in west and east Africa over deals that it expects to sign this year. A further three agreements could be signed in southern Africa in two years' time.
""Africa really is innovative,"" Ivor Ichikowitz told Reuters at the IDEX military exhibition in Abu Dhabi. 
""There is a huge amount of skill. There is a huge amount of human capital on the African continent that makes what we are planning to do very achievable.""
Paramount, which has maintenance and overhaul operations in Africa, has started to implement some agreements, he said, declining to disclose further details.
The company manufactures military vehicles, aircraft, ships, and weapons systems. It is also interested in working with governments on software, cyber security, and artificial intelligence, Ichikowitz said.
Commenting on the potential shape of any deals, the company prefers to be a majority shareholder in a government joint venture with concessions to build domestic capabilities, he said.
""We would implement long-term training, long-term capacity creation programs which would ultimately put us in a position where we are building a domestic defense industry in that country.""
Paramount has previously held talks with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two Middle East countries heavily investing in domestic defense industries.
Ichikowitz declined to comment specifically on those talks but said that in the Middle East ""there are substantial agreements close to finality"".
Paramount on Saturday launched a 4x4 version of its Mbombe armored personnel vehicle, which Ichikowitz said had been designed for the operational requirements of Middle East countries.

He said he expected there would be regional demand for 4,000-5,000 of the vehicles over the next ten years.

Under Nissan's current corporate charter, the position of board chair is automatically appointed to head the company board, the Nikkei said citing a source. Former Chairman Carlos Ghosn had filled both roles prior to his arrest in November for under-reporting his salary for eight years.
The issue of Nissan's chairmanship is now particularly important after the Japanese firm identified the concentration of power in one executive as one of the reasons Ghosn was able to carry out his alleged fiscal misconduct.
Speculation has swirled about whether the newly appointed chairman of France's  Renault  (PA:RENA), Jean-Dominique Senard, would assume the chairmanship of the Japanese automaker.
The Nikkei report comes after the governance committee said in a statement that the separation between operation and oversight was among topics discussed on Friday at the committee's third meeting since it was formed in December after Ghosn's arrest.
The panel, comprising three Nissan external board directors and four third-party members, is scheduled to make recommendations to Nissan's board in March on how to tighten lax governance and approval processes for matters including director compensation and chairman selection.
A spokeswoman for the committee said it could not comment on potential recommendations before they are submitted to the Nissan board. Nissan did not immediately reply to emailed request for comment.

1018,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2019 07:35AM ET</span>","Exclusive: China ride-hailing giant Didi plans Chile, Peru launches to take on Uber","By Aislinn Laing and Adam Jourdan
SANTIAGO/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing is planning to take on U.S. rival Uber in some of Latin America's fastest-growing markets, recruiting managers in Chile, Peru and Colombia, according to job postings and a company official.
Didi has moved senior executives from China to lead its expansion in markets like Chile and Peru, and began in recent weeks advertising for driver operations, crisis management, marketing and business development personnel in those countries, an analysis of LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) postings show.
Didi's widening expansion, if successful, could make for a bumpier ride for San Francisco-based Uber Technologies Inc in Latin America, one of its fastest growth regions, as it gets ready to go public as soon as later this year.
The two firms are already battling in Brazil, where Didi bought local start-up 99 in January last year, and Mexico, where the Chinese firm lured drivers with higher pay and bonuses for signing up other drivers and passengers.
Didi is China's dominant ride-hailing firm and is backed by investors including Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. In 2016, Didi bought Uber's local Chinese operations following a bruising two-year battle for domination in China. 
The push comes as Didi is laying off staff in China as it grapples with regulatory scrutiny, reportedly significant financial losses and public backlash over the murder of two of its customers, sources told Reuters.
The firm's new Chile public affairs manager, Felipe Contreras, who was previously Uber's corporate communications chief in Chile, confirmed reports Didi was looking to hire a senior executive from Chilean cellular phone company WOM to lead its engagement with government and public policy operations.
""We haven't announced a date; this is internal to the company,"" he said when asked about the timing of the hiring.
Contreras confirmed the launch plans and told Reuters that the company's aim was to be a ""market leader"" in Chile based on ""quality"", in a market where Uber, Spain's Cabify and Greece's Beat already transport thousands of passengers a day.
Didi is still mulling the ""best time"" to launch its local service, he said, saying: ""We are still in the planning and recruitment phase."" 
Chile's government has yet to pass a law regulating ride-sharing applications, resulting in a legal gray area which sees Uber, Cabify and Beat drivers routinely fined by the police for operating without public transport licenses. 
The law is still at committee stage and would need approval by both Chile's lower and upper chambers, a process which could take up to a year.

Contreras said the timeline for Didi's launch would ""not necessarily"" hinge on the law's eventual passing. ""We are studying all the variables,"" he said.

That marks a reduction from 7.64 percent of voting rights reported in the most recent filing in Germany. 
HNA, even with the reduced holding, would remain one of the largest shareholders in Germany's largest lender. 
Spokesmen for HNA in Germany and Deutche Bank declined to comment.
The SEC filing was published on Feb. 15 but the date of the reduction was Feb. 12.
HNA initially bought into Deutsche Bank in early 2017, amassing a stake of close to 10 percent. But it has since trimmed its stake in installments.
High debts at the conglomerate have fueled speculation about the future of its Deutsche stake as it reduces or exits some of its other holdings.
The fund C-Quadrat manages the stake on behalf of HNA, which has voting rights in Deutsche through a mix of ordinary shares and financial instruments. 
HNA's interests in the bank are represented through a member sitting on Deutsche Bank's supervisory board.

Other major shareholders include the royal family of Qatar, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), and Cerberus.

1020,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 16, 2019 04:10AM ET</span>","OPEC Has a President Under Sanctions, But It's Been There Before","(Bloomberg) -- Being hit by U.S. sanctions isn’t ideal when you’re representing a global oil institution, but history shows it’s manageable.
Venezuelan Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo, who this year holds the rotating presidency of OPEC, has just been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department for his ties to President Nicolas Maduro. That means any American assets he owns will be blocked and dealings with U.S. persons forbidden.
While it might be personally problematic for Quevedo, who also heads state-owned oil giant PDVSA, his role as OPEC president probably won’t be affected.
The organization is more directly represented by its secretary-general, currently the Nigerian Mohammad Barkindo. The president’s duties are more ceremonial, including such items as shaping the agenda of OPEC meetings in concert with the secretary-general. Quevedo will chair his first ministerial meeting in April.
And there’s historical proof that the office can still be discharged while being subject to American sanctions.
Iran’s Rostam Qasemi, a former commander of the Revolutionary Guards, was on the sanctions list when he became oil minister -- and OPEC president -- in summer 2011. Qasemi held the role of president until the end of the year, when it alphabetically rotated to the next country, and remained as Iran’s oil minister for another two years.
However, his presidency of the organization wasn’t without incident. OPEC failed to reach any agreement on production at its meeting in December 2011, prompting Saudi Arabia’s oil minister to angrily condemn it as the worst ever."

The lira reserve-requirement ratios have been reduced by 100 basis points for deposits and participation funds with maturities of up to a year and for other liabilities with maturities up to and including three years, and by 50 basis points for all other liabilities, the central bank said in a statement on Saturday. Banks will also now be able to hold 10 percent of their reserve requirements in gold, rather than 5 percent.
The changes came two days after Governor Murat Cetinkaya told state media he was considering adjustments to the lira’s liquidity. He lowered the reserve-requirement ratios for lira and foreign-exchange deposits last year when the currency was in free fall. This reduction is targeting credit growth rather than currency stability.
The Turkish economy is on track to cap 2018 with two consecutive quarters of contraction, a technical recession, in a sign the lira’s crash and the ensuing jump in borrowing costs were very damaging. The economy may shrink for three quarters in a row through June this year, according to forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.

1022,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 16, 2019 02:40AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. Will Valentine’s Magic Continue for Oil?
Are oil bulls off to the races? Those long Brent or playing its spread versus U.S.  WTI would have rubbed their hands with glee as the U.K. benchmark hit the key $65 per barrel level this week.
But if analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are right, that’s probably as much love as oil will get near term.
“We continue to see modest upside for Brent to $65/bbl in 2H,” the Wall Street bank said in an energy note this week, referring to second-half prospects.
Morgan Stanley agrees supply has tightened from relentless Saudi production cuts, reflected by the market’s recovery from Christmas Eve lows of around $50 for Brent and under $43 for WTI.
But it contends that a major imbalance has emerged and that’s the presence of too much light oil.
Together with modest gasoline demand, this is weighing on refinery margins and crude runs.
“Low refining margins and weaker economic data means oil prices can rally only so much,” it concludes.
The theory of an oil rally running on less-than-firm legs was reinforced by Thursday’s run-up, which came on the back of Saudi jawboning about upcoming production cuts and optimism over U.S.-China trade talks, despite mitigating weak U.S. crude supply-demand and economic data.
Scott Shelton, energy futures broker at ICAP (LON:NXGN) in Durham, N.C., notes that there was no real event driving the market the past few days but ""prices are just strong.""
The Energy Information Administration says a new swell of U.S. light oil is headed to the market, boosted by technology to unlock production from shale formations.
Those efforts could add 1.45 million barrels per day to U.S. production this year, bringing output to a record 12.41 million bpd. Next year’s output could go up by a further 790,000 bpd to a new all-time high of 13.2 million bpd.
2. Wage Hikes Here Today, Gone Tomorrow
Small businesses have a knack of figuring out when the economic wind is about to change. And they signaled in a survey this week that trouble may be on the horizon.
In a day and age when companies are grappling with a shortage of skilled labor, a hefty wage package has proven effective bait to reel in top talent.
But small businesses indicated this week they don't plan on feeding the wage machine much longer as they expect the economy to falter, leading to cheaper labor.
With near-term wages growing faster than expected future wages, the compensation spread, which measures the difference between what small businesses will pay for labor now against what they are willing to pay in the future, is at the biggest margin in history, according to an NFIB survey.
The survey is sourced by economists for a read on domestic demand and to extrapolate hiring and wage trends in the broader economy. Wage growth is what keeps consumption ticking over and inflation on pace, staving off the risk of the economy flatlining, barring a Federal Reserve or government policy misstep.
Most importantly, the compensation curve has moved fairly in tandem with a Treasury yield curve.
Inverted yield curves have preceded every U.S. recession in recent history by anywhere from 15 months to around two years.
3. U.S. Government Debt Expectations Jump
The expectations for government debt rose sharply in January, according to a latest survey by the New York Federal Reserve published this week.
The median year-ahead expected growth in debt rose to 9.1% last month from 6.1% in December, the New York Fed said. That is the highest reading since September 2014, when it was 9.2%.
That could have market implications this year if the government pushes for policies like real negative interest rates to reduce the debt level. The 10-Year Treasury real interest rate, which is adjusted for inflation, is currently around 0.85%.
But so far the Trump administration has shown no interest in reducing the debt level.
When asked about whether President Donald Trump would mention the deficit or debt in the State of the Union, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney reportedly replied “Nobody cares.”"

1024,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 09:56PM ET</span>",Big U.S. exchanges to sue SEC over 'overreaching' fee experiment,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The three largest U.S. stock exchange operators said they will sue the Securities and Exchange Commission for overstepping its authority by ordering a pilot program to test banning lucrative payments exchanges make to brokers for resting stock orders.
""We disagree with the government overreach, and this really represents an unprecedented attempt by the SEC to distort the free market mechanisms that govern the competition among trading venues,"" Michael Blaugrund, head of transactions at NYSE, told reporters in New York on Friday.
Intercontinental Exchange Inc's NYSE, Nasdaq Inc, and Cboe Global Markets, which together operate 13 of the 14 U.S. stock exchanges, each filed separate notices that they intend to sue the SEC. At issue is a pilot program the regulator approved in December that will restrict the amount exchanges can charge for stock trade executions, as well as the rebates exchanges pay brokers for orders that others can trade against, for one to two years.
The program aims to shed light on whether rebate payments, collectively around $2.5 billion last year, create conflicts of interest by incentivizing brokers to send customer orders to the exchanges that pay the biggest rebates rather than to those that would obtain the best results for the end clients.
The exchanges argue rebates are needed to compensate brokers for providing liquidity and that the SEC has not shown that they harm the market.
""The SEC is required by statute to determine there is a problem, not go on a fact-finding mission,"" Ed Tilly, chief executive officer of Cboe, said in an interview on Feb. 8.
Cboe, Nasdaq, and NYSE vigorously opposed the pilot when it was proposed early last year. 
They argued it would create winners and losers, as private stock trading venues, which execute around 40 percent of U.S. stock transactions, would not be subject to the restrictions, giving them a competitive advantage. They also said bid-ask spreads would widen without rebates, creating hundreds of millions of dollars in new costs for investors.
The pilot was expected to begin later this year, but NYSE said it will request a delay while it pursues its lawsuit.
The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""It's a very difficult decision to decide to take your primary regulator to court,"" said NYSE's Blaugrund. ""That being said, we feel this is overreaching, and we need to draw a clear line in the sand.""

1025,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 09:15PM ET</span>",Starboard gauges Bristol-Myers shareholder support for Celgene deal,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP has asked a proxy solicitor to probe the level of support among Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co shareholders for the U.S. drug maker's $74 billion deal to buy  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG), people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The acquisition would be the biggest pharmaceuticals deal ever and would unite two major sellers of cancer drugs.
Starboard has not decided whether it would oppose the Celgene deal, the sources said. The fund, run by Jeff Smith, may take no action, the sources added.
Bristol-Myers shareholders will vote on the Celgene deal in April. While Celgene shares are pricing in some uncertainty over whether it will be completed, no major Bristol-Myers shareholder has voiced opposition publicly to the deal so far. 
As of the end of trading on Friday, Bristol-Myers' cash-and-stock offer valued Celgene at $101.67 per share. Celgene shares ended trading at $90.69.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Bristol-Myers and Starboard did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Last week, Smith told CNBC in an interview that Starboard was ""certainly interested in the story at Bristol-Myers."" He declined to say whether the firm had a position it the stock.
""We evaluate those situations to determine whether we can have a positive impact. Bristol-Myers might fit that profile. It might not fit that profile. We haven't made that decision,"" Smith said.
Starboard has a track record of opposing deals. It tried to block Virginia-based meat giant Smithfield Foods' sale to Chinese company Shuanghui International in 2013, as well as aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) Inc's acquisition of B/E Aerospace two years ago. Both deals were done.
The presence of an activist investor can encourage potential deal interlopers to step in. However, no rival suitor has so far emerged publicly, either for Bristol-Myers or for Celgene.
""Our impression from (Bristol-Myers) management's long-term focus and biopharma executive commentary is that the probability of a third party buyer for Bristol-Myers before the Celgene vote in April is very low,"" BMO analysts wrote in a research note on Thursday.
""We do not believe an activist can change that.""

Starboard is known for being an influential investor that often pushes for operational improvements. It scored a boardroom coup at Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) where it ousted all board members five years ago.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 08:29PM ET</span>","U.S. raises pressure on Maduro via sanctions, aid airlift","By Andy Sullivan and Idrees Ali
WASHINGTON/MUNICH (Reuters) - The United States ratcheted up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Friday by sanctioning some of his top security officials and the head of the state oil company, and unveiling plans to airlift over 200 tons of aid to the Colombian border.
The U.S. Treasury said it sanctioned PDVSA chief Manuel Quevedo, three top intelligence officials and Rafael Bastardo, who U.S. officials say is the head of a national police unit responsible for dozens of extrajudicial killings carried out in nighttime raids on Maduro's behalf.
Separately, the U.S. State Department said on Friday it was working with the Pentagon and U.S. aid agency to fly humanitarian assistance on Saturday to Cucuta, Colombia, on the Venezuelan border.
The steps are part of a wider effort by the United States to undermine Maduro, whose 2018 election it views as illegitimate and whose government it has disavowed, and to strengthen opposition leader and self-declared president Juan Guaido.
Quevedo said on Twitter the Venezuelan officials were being sanctioned for guaranteeing peace, building homes and condemning the ""coup and military plan of the United States, its allies"" and Guaido.
U.S. military aircraft were expected to deliver more than 200 tons of humanitarian aid to the border town, a U.S. official said. The United States already has pre-positioned some relief supplies in Colombia and is coordinating with Guaido to mobilize aid for Venezuelans, a State Department spokeswoman said. 
It was unclear whether any of the U.S. aid being ferried to Colombia would reach Venezuelans.
Maduro, who has overseen an economic collapse in the oil-rich country that has left millions struggling to buy food and medicine and fueled an unprecedented migration crisis in the region, has refused to allow supplies in.
""This man Maduro has created a humanitarian crisis,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters in Reykjavik. ""As soon as this weekend we will continue to deliver massive humanitarian assistance. Hopefully Mr. Maduro will allow that in to his country.""
The aid convoy dispatched by the United States and Colombia arrived in Cucuta last week, where it is being held in warehouses.
U.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton worked to undermine Maduro on Friday, saying economic and political pressure was squeezing his top government officials and claiming without offering any evidence that ""a clear majority, maybe almost all of them"" were talking to the opposition about supporting Guaido or leaving the country.
Bolton appeared to confirm reports that Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza met in New York with U.S. special envoy for Venezuela Elliott Abrams, and suggested Maduro should ask himself what they talked about.
Bolton also said he thought ""Russia and China are hedging"" their support for Maduro because of concern about the Maduro government's indebtedness to Moscow and Beijing.
Guaido invoked constitutional provisions to declare himself interim president last month, arguing that Maduro's 2018 re-election was a sham. Most Western countries, including the United States and many of Venezuela's neighbors, have recognized Guaido as the legitimate head of state. 
Maduro retains the backing of Russia and China and control of Venezuelan state institutions including the military.
The U.S. Treasury took aim at some of Maduro's allies with its sanctions on Friday.
""We are sanctioning officials in charge of Maduro's security and intelligence apparatus, which has systematically violated human rights and suppressed democracy, including through torture,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
Also targeted was Ivan Hernandez, commander of Maduro's Presidential Guard, which Treasury says has tortured Maduro's opponents and carried out other human rights abuses.
Manuel Cristopher, director general of Venezuela's Sebin intelligence agency, and Hildemaro Rodriguez, first commissioner of the service, also were sanctioned.
The Treasury's action freezes all property in the United States belonging to the five sanctioned officials as well as that of any entities in which they own 50 percent or more.
In a sign that the Trump administration may be trying to split the men from Maduro, the Treasury Department noted in its statement that ""U.S. sanctions need not be permanent; sanctions are intended to bring about a positive change of behavior.""

""The United States has made clear that we will consider lifting sanctions for persons ... who take concrete and meaningful actions to restore democratic order, refuse to take part in human rights abuses, speak out against abuses committed by the government, and combat corruption in Venezuela,"" it said.

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 07:33PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Profit estimates may be adding in too much cost risk,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Wall Street braces for the first quarterly decline in earnings in nearly three years, some investors are wondering if the market is factoring in a bigger erosion in profit margins than will actually come to pass. 
Forecasts for U.S. earnings, after a big boost from corporate tax cuts in 2018, are falling sharply in 2019. But revenue forecasts remain relatively robust, leaving an expected spike in costs as the main reason for profitability to weaken.
But some strategists say there is little evidence yet of such cost pressures and that margins may hold up better than expected.
""Companies since the 2008 trauma have made it a top priority to maintain and increase, if possible, their profit margins,"" said Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist of Yardeni Research.
""We don't expect that labor compensation and other costs will squeeze margins. Nor do we expect that an increase in those costs will boost prices,"" he added. ""Rather, we are betting on improving productivity.""
Besides the tightening labor market, the trade war between the United States and China and the stronger U.S. dollar are among the biggest potential risks to corporate margins this year.
For the first quarter, analysts are forecasting a year-over-year S&P 500 earnings decline of 0.5 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Second-quarter earnings are still expected to grow 3.5 percent, though that estimate also is down sharply from the start of the year. 
The drop in forecasts has led to talk of a profit recession, defined as at least two consecutive quarters of year-over-year earnings declines. The last U.S. profit recession ran from July 2015 through June of 2016.
Projected revenue for S&P 500 companies has been more resilient, with first-quarter revenue growth estimated at 5.3 percent, based on Refinitiv's data.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) strategists said profit margins are holding up better than the estimates suggest, at least for the majority of S&P 500 companies. 
They said profit margins are eroding sharply for several heavily weighted companies, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and chipmakers like Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), which are skewing data for the entire S&P benchmark index.
A recent drop in oil prices has hurt margins for energy companies, a slowdown in the semiconductor business cycle has hit companies in that space and other firms have boosted investment expenses, said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at Credit Suisse Securities in New York. 
""It's not a broad-based macro issue,"" he said. ""When you look at the median company, we see margins quite stable.""
Moreover, worries that a tight labor market will drive up wages have been limited in earnings calls for the fourth-quarter reporting period, which is nearing an end. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists wrote in a note on Wednesday that while some companies are feeling the pressures of rising wages, more consumer-facing companies, including Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), viewed the trend as a positive for consumer spending. 
Also, they wrote, most management teams ""expected growth in the U.S. economy to moderate, but remain positive.""
While the labor market has been tightening, other measures of inflation have not moved much. In the 12 months through January, the U.S. consumer price index rose 1.6 percent, the smallest gain since June 2017, according to U.S. data released on Wednesday.
Though slower than 2018, U.S. economic growth was forecast to average 2.4 percent this year, according to a Reuters poll of economists.

""When the overall economy is relatively strong, that typically means there's still sufficient demand for products and it helps stabilize margins in general,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist atSunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta, Georgia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) executive on Friday disputed claims raised by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that Amazon workers face ""dehumanizing conditions"" as being untrue and invited her to take a tour of company facilities.
Ocasio-Cortez, a newly elected progressive Democrat who was an outspoken critic of the plans to locate Amazon's second headquarters in a New York City neighborhood near her congressional district, asked on Twitter if Amazon's culture of ""strict performance"" is ""why Amazon workers have to urinate in bottles & work while on food stamps to meet 'targets?' Performance shouldn’t come at the cost of dehumanizing conditions."" 
She cited a September Newsweek story that raised those claims. 
Dave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations, responded on Twitter that the claims ""simply aren’t true. We are proud of our jobs with excellent pay ($15 min), benefits from day 1, & lots of other benefits like our Career Choice pre-paid educational programs."" He invited her to take a tour of Amazon's operations.
A spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez did not respond to a request for comment.
Ocasio-Cortez was among progressive New York Democrats who had objected to the $2.8 billion in incentives from the city and New York state to woo Amazon to build a new headquarters in the city's borough of Queens. Amazon abruptly canceled the plan on Thursday.
""When the community wanted to negotiate, Amazon said 'all or nothing.' They bailed when they didn’t get 100% of what they wanted,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. ""Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) came into NYC just fine. Amazon wanted to be Foxconn.""
Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Co won $4 billion in state and local incentives from Wisconsin in exchange for a promise to build a $10 billion development.

Earlier this month, Foxconn said it would still build a factory in Wisconsin even as it shifts more of the focus of the investment away from manufacturing. Reuters reported Foxconn was reconsidering making liquid crystal display panels and intended to hire mostly engineers and researchers there.

(Reuters) -  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT) on Friday issued a disappointing 2019 forecast and said demand for its iconic Barbie doll was slowing, triggering an 18 percent drop in its shares, their worst day in nearly two decades.
The forecast comes barely a week after the company said strong holiday sales of Barbie drove a surprise fourth-quarter profit, which sent its shares up 23 percent the following morning. 
On Friday, the El Segundo, California-based toymaker said gross sales for 2019 would be flat on a constant-currency basis, with weakness in Thomas & Friends and American Girl offsetting comparatively stronger sales of Barbie and Hot Wheels.
Even then, Barbie and Hot Wheels won't sell as much as they did in 2018, Chief Financial Offer Joe Euteneuer said in an investor presentation https://mattel.gcs-web.com/static-files/228b066f-34c4-4952-8ff1-a32df7f98721.
Both Mattel and rival  Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS) have continued to be haunted by the collapse of Toys ""R"" Us as they have failed to find newer avenues to sell their toys. They also face pressure as more children shun traditional toys to play games on tablets and mobile phones.
For the first quarter, Mattel said it expects lower gross sales, blaming the liquidation of the world's biggest toy retailer and currency fluctuations.
It also expects adjusted earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)of $350 million to $400 million for 2019, below estimates of $480.18 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Gross profit margins for 2019 are expected to come in the ""low 40s"" range, while analysts were expecting margins of 44.2 percent.
Mattel has been aiming to cut at least $650 million in net costs by the end of 2019 through job cuts and other means.
The company said it expects to keep reducing manufacturing costs, the benefit of which will be first seen in 2020. 

The company's shares closed at $13.82.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.74%, the S&P 500 added 1.09%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.61%.
The Dow finished up 3.1% for the week, with the S&P 500 up 2.5% and the Nasdaq 2.4% higher. The Dow's close was its best since early November. The S&P and Nasdaq finished at their highest levels since Dec. 3.
With just weeks to go until the March 1 deadline, President Donald Trump offered an optimistic update on the second round of U.S.-China trade talks, prompting traders to turn bullish on stocks.
Trump said that trade talks ""are going extremely well,"" stressing that the United States is closer than ever to ""having a real trade deal"" with China.
Without a trade deal secured by March 1, the U.S. could implement further tariffs on China. Trump said, however, that he would be ""honored"" to remove tariffs if an agreement can be reached.
The newfound optimism on trade pushed energy stocks sharply higher, as traders had long feared a prolonged trade war would hurt economic growth in China, the world's largest oil consumer, denting oil demand.
Trade has been not only weighed on market sentiment but also on corporate earnings.
Tractor supplier Deere (NYSE:DE) posted a rare earnings miss, blaming higher raw material costs and concerns over tariffs and trade policies. Its shares fell 2%.
Financials, mostly bank stocks, also led the market higher thanks to solid gains from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C).
Newell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) plunged 18% after reporting fourth-quarter revenue that fell below estimates from Investing.com. The company also singled out trade tensions as factor that hurt results.
In tech, a surge in semis was led by Nvidia following the chipmakers' quarterly results and guidance from a day earlier.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) closed 2% higher at $157.34, but well below session highs of $163.87 as Wall Street doubted the company's guidance for a large jump in fourth-quarter revenue amid an uncertain backdrop for many of its businesses. It makes graphics chips that are often used in computers aimed at gamers.
Morgan Stanley said Nvidia is facing several challenges across different parts of the business at the same time, which ""create quite a bit of idiosyncratic risk, and many variables that are 'unknowable'.""

Corbat's total compensation included a base salary of $1.5 million plus cash bonuses of about $6.75 million, equity awards of nearly $7.88 million, and a long-term performance based pay worth $7.88 million.
Members of the board said they considered the bank's earning operating performance, and market levels of pay when deciding his compensation. 
A year earlier, Corbat enjoyed a 48 percent raise for a total annual compensation of $23 million as the bank grew adjusted profit by 4 percent. 
In 2018, the bank exceeded its goal for returns on investment but fell short of its efficiency target due to revenue pressure at the end of the year. 
The bank reported a 2018 efficiency ratio of 57.4 percent, shy of Corbat’s 57.3 percent goal. Its ROTCE of 10.9 percent last year was above the 10.5 percent target. 
A lower efficiency ratio means a bank is better at managing its costs relative to revenue, while ROTCE is a widely watched measure of how well a bank uses shareholder money to generate profits.
Citi has been under pressure from investors to prove it can grow its underlying businesses rather than simply returning capital through share buybacks. 
During 2018 its shares declined more than 30 percent despite returning more than 100 percent of its profits through dividends and buybacks. Earnings per share jumped 26 percent due to fewer shares outstanding while revenue edged up 1 percent. 
Earlier this month, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) disclosed CEO Brian Moynihan's annual compensation rose 15 percent to $27 million. 

In January,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said CEO James Gorman's overall pay rose 7 percent to $29 million, and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) CEO's compensation rose 5 percent to $31 million, according to filings.

1032,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 04:43PM ET</span>",Amazon places big bet on aspiring Tesla rival Rivian,"By Paul Lienert and Jeffrey Dastin
DETROIT/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) said on Friday it would lead a $700 million investment in U.S. electric pickup truck startup Rivian Automotive LLC, in the e-commerce giant's biggest bet on technologies with potential to reshape the automotive sector.
The deal represents a major endorsement of Rivian's electric vehicle technology by the world's largest online retailer. Amazon is hoping Rivian will assist it in its development of delivery vehicles that will bolster its logistics network, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing the confidential strategy. 
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Amazon and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) were in talks to invest in Rivian. GM's talks with Rivian about an investment are continuing and any deal would be announced at a later date, people familiar with the talks said on Friday.
Rivian could ultimately be valued at between $3 billion and $4 billion, one of the sources said.
The Rivian deal comes as its much larger electric car manufacturing rival, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, struggles to stabilize production and deliver consistent profits as it ramps up its Model 3 sedan, with pricing ultimately aimed at giving it mass market appeal.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk told investors in August that an electric pickup is ""probably my personal favorite for the next product"" from the company. But he has spoken only in general about a potential launch, saying that it would happen ""right after"" Tesla’s Model Y, which the company has targeted to start production in 2020. 
Rivian unveiled its electric R1T pickup and R1S SUV for the first time at the Los Angeles Auto Show last November. But the company had piqued Amazon's interest earlier, according to one of the sources.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos personally reached out to Rivian founder and CEO R.J. Scaringe last summer to express interest in an investment, the source said. Since then Amazon has stepped up its investment in the car sector, participating in a $530 million funding round announced last week in self-driving car startup Aurora Innovation Inc.
Amazon is looking for deals that can speed packages to shoppers’ doorsteps regardless of spikes in consumer demand or shortages of delivery personnel. Last year, Mercedes said Amazon had become the biggest customer of its Sprinter vans, securing 20,000 vehicles for delivery contractors.
Amazon has sought to win customers inside the car as well. Working with BMW AG, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Toyota Motor Corp, Amazon has enabled its Alexa virtual assistant to be installed in new models so drivers can dictate what music they want to hear and what tasks they want it to perform, hands-free.
Rivian aspires to be the first to produce a mass market electric pickup. It intends to begin selling its R1T by the end of 2020.
Scaringe has described the Rivian vehicle’s platform as a skateboard that packages the drive units, battery pack, suspension system, brakes and cooling system all below wheel height to allow for more storage space and greater stability due to a lower center of gravity.
He has also said the company plans to partner with outside firms to develop advanced self-driving technology, rather than try to do so on its own.
Rivian's existing financial backers include Saudi auto distributor Abdul Latif Jameel Co, Sumitomo Corp of Americas and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank.

Some existing shareholders participated in the funding round, Rivian said, stressing that it will remain an independent company.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Advisers to Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido are asking Citibank not to claim gold put up as collateral for a loan to the government of President Nicolas Maduro if his administration does not make payments on time, a lawmaker said on Friday.
Citi would be entitled to keep the gold if cash-strapped Venezuela does not pay the loan when it expires in March, lawmaker Angel Alvarado said, without specifying the value of the gold in question. 
Allies of Guaido, who has been recognized by the United States and more than 40 countries across the world as Venezuela's legitimate leader, is asking the bank not to invoke the guarantee.
""Citibank has been asked to stand by and not invoke the guarantee until the end of the usurpation,"" Alvarado said in an interview. ""We don't want to lose the gold.""
The gold is worth $1.1 billion, according to a finance industry source with knowledge of the situation.
Opposition leaders say Maduro usurped power last month when he was sworn in to a second term after a disputed election widely described as a sham. 
Investment bank and financial services company  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), which owns Citibank, declined to comment.
Abu Dhabi investment firm Noor Capital said in February that it bought 3 tons of gold from Venezuela's central bank, but would halt further transactions until the country's situation stabilizes.
Guaido has also asked British authorities to prevent Maduro from gaining access to gold reserves held in the Bank of England, which holds around $1.2 billion in bullion for Maduro's government.

The Bank of England has said it does not comment on client operations.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rallied on Friday, with the Dow and the Nasdaq posting their eighth consecutive weekly gains as investors grew hopeful that the United States and China would hammer out an agreement resolving their protracted trade war.
All three major U.S. indexes ended the session higher, and for the fourth straight session, the S&P 500 held above its 200-day moving average, a key technical level.
Talks between the United States and China will resume in Washington next week, with both sides saying progress has been made toward resolving the two countries' contentious trade dispute.
Tariff-vulnerable industrials provided the biggest lift to the blue-chip Dow, led by bellwethers Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, 3M (NYSE:MMM) Co, United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) Inc and  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT).
""This may be just false hope with the tariff situation as thorny details still need to be agreed upon,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. ""It's good news but its not over yet.""
Indeed, the trade row's effects were reflected in Deere & Co's earnings report, which came in below analyst estimates in part because of slowing international trade. The agricultural equipment manufacturer's shares fell 2.1 percent.
""Solving the trade issue could give global growth the boost it needs,"" Carter added. ""Absent a tariff solution, growth will continue to slow.""
With nearly 80 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported, fourth-quarter earnings season is largely in the rearview mirror. Analysts now see a profit increase of 16.2 percent for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data.

All 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 ended the session in the black.
The rate-sensitive financial sector led the S&P 500's advance, bouncing back from Thursday's sell-off as U.S. Treasury yields crept back up.
Shares of PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) were up 3.1 percent even after the snack and beverage company forecast a surprise drop in full-year profit.
Nvidia Corp rose 1.8 percent following the company's forecasts for its current fiscal year topped Wall Street expectations.
The chipmaker gave the second-largest boost to the closely-watched Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index, which was up 0.5 percent. The index has jumped nearly 18 percent so far this year.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares were down 0.9 percent after scrapping its plans for a New York headquarters.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.66-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 47 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 86 new highs and 16 new lows.

1038,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 02:53PM ET</span>","After strong 2019 start for U.S. stocks, trade verdict looms","By Lewis Krauskopf and Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Optimism about a U.S.-China trade agreement has helped drive U.S. stocks to more than two-month highs, creating a make-or-break moment for Wall Street as a year-long clash between the world's two largest economies comes to a head.
Investors are increasingly hopeful about a positive resolution as a March 1 deadline for trade talks nears. And if the United States and China reach a deal, market professionals say clarity after the lengthy dispute should continue to push shares higher. 
“If we do get a China-U.S. solution and trade agreement, which signs are more positive on that front, that could really propel stocks higher because that would give businesses more confidence in the global economy,” said Chris Gaffney, President of World Markets at TIAA Bank in St. Louis.
A few market watchers even say the benchmark S&P 500 could exceed its all-time closing high set on Sept. 20, which is about 6 percent above Friday's level. 
That would build on the more than 17 percent surge in the S&P 500 since it hit a 20-month low on Dec. 24, when investors were spooked by Federal Reserve policy as their outlook for earnings and economic growth soured. 
But stocks would be vulnerable should talks collapse and the United States hike tariffs to 25 percent on $200 billion of Chinese imports. 
Although investors increasingly believe a more accommodative Fed now provides protection from a drop, some say a significant trade disappointment could send stocks plunging.
""If talks fail and additional tariffs are applied, I do believe stocks could fall through their December 24th lows,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York.
The drumbeat of global trade developments has convulsed markets since U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports a year ago, sparking concerns that a full-blown trade dispute would undermine the global economy.
Investors had zeroed in on March 1 as a potential culmination of the U.S.-China dispute since Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year shelved any new tariffs and reset discussions for 90 days.
Trump said on Friday he may extend the deadline for a deal while keeping current tariffs in place. 
“If it’s a six-month delay, that’s a problem,"" said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""Because then you just leave this issue lingering out there for quite some time.""
Trade talks resume next week in Washington, with both sides saying this week's negotiations in Beijing made progress.

GROWING OPTIMISM 
Should the countries reach a deal, the size of the market reaction will likely rest on the details of the agreement. 
In talks this week, the countries focused on technology, intellectual property rights, agriculture, services, non-tariff barriers and currency, and potential Chinese purchases of U.S. goods and services, according to the White House.
Stocks' response could also depend on how much prices already reflect the decision and if any other major market-sensitive issues such as weakening economic data have arisen. 
""There is growing optimism that a deal gets done and I think that is increasingly reflected at these prices,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina.
Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) in Troy, Michigan, doubted the talks would collapse, noting ""the markets have pressured the U.S. and China enough to bring both countries to the bargaining table, and for various reasons, a temporary deal or ceasefire extension is the most likely path.""
""Risk assets across the spectrum would see severe selling pressure if trade talks completely collapsed and tariff rates rose,"" Saglimbene said.
BOON FOR BIG COMPANIES
Some investors believe stocks have almost fully priced in a deal, leaving little room for further gains. 
An up to 2 percent spike might occur if a deal is reached, O'Rourke said, adding: ""I would be surprised if you get much further than that on the initial news.” 
Large multinational companies stand to see the biggest share gains from any trade deal, with big tech companies potentially heading back toward historic highs, said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.

The market's recent climb has come even as analysts lowered estimates for 2019 U.S. corporate earnings growth, undercutting a fundamental support for stocks. 
But a trade deal that avoids more severe tariffs could help, since many companies prepared investors for the worst. 
A Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) review of earnings calls this week found many companies citing an impact from the trade dispute baked a 25 percent tariff hike in March into their outlook.

“There could be an upside surprise to earnings if we get some sort clarity on trade,” said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Wealth Management in Chicago.

Sidewalk Labs, which provides urban technology infrastructure, is planning a 4.9-acre smart city along Toronto’s harbor front, a project that has already faced opposition from locals over concerns of data privacy. 
Sidewalk Labs said the proposal was yet to the evaluated by Toronto city and the public and has the potential to generate around C$6 billion ($4.5 billion) to pay for the infrastructure over 30 years.
The proposal suggests that a light rail transit and infrastructure be financed by a mix of development charges, incremental property taxes and increased land value.
Sidewalk Labs outlined its project for a light railway transit, 2,500 homes where 40 percent would be below market price, and a tall-timber factory they project will create 4,000 jobs.
These would be initially financed by Sidewalk, and the company plans to recoup its investment through the various taxes, the proposals showed.
Alphabet is the parent company of Google.
""We're prepared to take the risk up front of developing a model to help make that happen, and we’re prepared to essentially get paid back when we’ve demonstrated that it can be successful,"" Sidewalk Labs CEO Dan Doctoroff told Toronto Star newspaper, which first reported the proposal.
On Thursday, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) scrapped its plans to set up its second headquarters in New York after facing public outcry.
When asked if Sidewalk's proposal could face similar backlash, Micah Lasher, head of policy and communications at Sidewalk Labs, said he expected people would not pre-judge what the company is proposing, and that public discussion would be an important part of the process. 
""The City and Waterfront Toronto have not received any formal proposal at this time and no permissions or dispensations have been granted,"" Toronto Mayor John Tory said in a statement. ""Any final proposal ... will be given full public scrutiny ... and, ultimately, consideration by Waterfront Toronto and City Council."" 
Toronto City Councillor Paula Fletcher expressed concerns about the proposal.
""I was terribly shocked because this was not within the scope of the project. I think it’s a big credibility problem for everybody.""

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 01:05PM ET</span>",Uber posts $50 billion in annual bookings as profit remains elusive ahead of IPO,"By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc had $50 billion in total bookings for its ride-service and food-delivery businesses last year, a testament to the size and global reach of the company as it prepares to woo investors in one of the biggest public stock listings to date.
But figures released by the company on Friday showed revenue grew just 2 percent in the fourth quarter, a sign that Uber continues to heavily subsidize rides in competitive markets, raising questions about its future growth prospects. 
Uber's full-year revenue for 2018 was $11.3 billion, up 43 percent from the prior year. Its losses before taxes, depreciation and other expenses were $1.8 billion, an improvement over the $2.2 billion loss posted in 2017.
Uber highlighted the annual bookings figure, which was up 45 percent over 2017, in its release on Friday of a smattering of selected figures for its fourth-quarter and full-year results, a practice it has had for the last several quarters as it anticipated going public. The full-year figures are particularly important to show potential investors the trajectory of the business, as opposed to Uber's more erratic quarterly results.
Uber in December filed confidentially for an initial public offering, which may come as early as the second quarter this year. It is racing neck-and-neck with rival Lyft to become the first ride-hailing IPO.
""Last year was our strongest yet, and Q4 set another record,"" Uber Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai said in a statement.
Uber said gross bookings for the fourth quarter were a record $14.2 billion, up 11 percent from the prior quarter. That marks an improvement after bookings growth slowed to just single-digit percentages throughout much of last year.
Uber's revenue in the fourth quarter reached $3 billion, up 2 percent from the third quarter and a 24 percent increase over the previous year.
INTENSE COMPETITION
The food-delivery service, Uber Eats, accounts for more than $2.5 billion in bookings quarterly, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Uber has trumpeted Uber Eats as the largest online food delivery business outside of China.
Uber must convince public market investors that its market share, growth trajectory, global scale and diversity of businesses make it a compelling investment, despite its enormous losses.
""Uber needs to show it can control costs and can make money, basically provide a strong argument that its business model is not broken and that it can achieve and sustain profitability despite issues with drivers, customers and politicians,"" said David Brophy, professor of finance at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.
Ongoing intense competition with ride-hailing foes across the globe has kept Uber in the red. Rivalries in India with ride service Ola, in Latin America with Didi Chuxing and in the Middle East with Careem have pressured Uber to lower prices, raise driver commissions and invest heavily in marketing and recruiting. Uber has held talks with Careem since the middle of last year about a potential merger, but the companies have not reached an agreement.
Uber Eats is also battling a crowded food-delivery industry, forcing it to adopt discounting tactics to compete with companies like food-delivery startup DoorDash, which is in the process of raising $500 million from investors at a $6 billion valuation, and restaurant and grocery delivery company Postmates, which filed for an IPO this month.
Uber has no plans to slow investment in Uber Eats or other costly areas such as autonomous car development to show profit any time soon. The company's losses before interest, taxes and depreciation spiked in the fourth quarter to $940 million, a 43 percent jump over the previous quarter and 21 percent increase from 2017.
""I believe investors will forgive even higher fourth-quarter losses if there's evidence of significant topline growth,"" said Arun Sundararajan, a professor of business at New York University Stern School of Business.

But, he said, Uber's business still represents a fraction of global consumer spending on transportation, and ""evidence that Uber is making significant inroads into changing behaviors"" is critical to its long-term success.

1041,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 12:50PM ET</span>",Trust in tailings? Vale dam disaster spurs investors into action,"By Barbara Lewis, Simon Jessop and Clara Denina 
LONDON (Reuters) - Seeking assurances from Brazilian miner Vale by phone after a second deadly dam disaster in three years is not enough for Sasja Beslik. He plans to fly there himself to get answers.
Beslik, head of sustainable finance at Swedish bank Nordea, blocked the bank's investment managers from buying any more Vale shares on Jan. 26, the day after a dam filled with mining waste burst its banks, killing hundreds.
He is the latest investor to step back from an industry that is trying to clean up its act.
Vale needs to address the risks associated with tailings dams and deal with its waste material safely if it is to prevent an exodus of global funds and stem the recent share price slide.
""We have a quite comprehensive plan of what we want to get done,"" Beslik said. ""Right now, I have two analysts doing a collection of everything from satellite images to legal requirements, best practices, all of it.""
""They have tailings dams all over the world so what are the potential implications for them?""
Fellow investor Robeco, which had been taking part in ""enhanced engagement"" with Vale since an earlier tailings dam collapse in 2015, has also now put it on a banned list.
Beslik's and Robeco's response shows the growing concern among investors that many of the thousands of tailings dams around the world are not fit for purpose.
""If you have unstable weather patterns that are not following traditional ones... (these dams) did not include that risk when they were built, so they are exposed,"" Beslik said.
The disaster has called into question the willingness of investors and lenders to continue funding the broader industry.
Vale has lost nearly a fifth of its market capitalization — just over $15 billion — since the collapse, Brazil's most deadly mining accident, but the closure of some of Vale's operations has driven iron ore prices higher. 
Executives, analysts and shareholders, say that reaction masks deep-seated problems for an industry struggling to attract money for new projects because of sustainability concerns.
Susana Penarrubia, head of ESG integration at DWS asset managers, said the incident ""confirms once again our very cautious ESG (environmental, social, governance) view on the mining sector"".
DWS ESG funds already exclude many mining companies, including Vale, and the asset manager will review positions it holds in Vale on behalf of institutional investors. 
It will use any remaining exposure to demand reform.
""We will continue with our engagement activity of putting pressure on Vale as an operator of upstream tailings dams and dams in general to be much more rigorous in their risk assessment and prevention,"" she said.
POOR DATA 
Investors said they were working to understand tailings dams that store increasingly large amounts of waste from mining operations. 
Some banks and investors have called for a new classification system to allow them to assess risks. For now investors may decide it is safer to stay away.
""Investors simply don't have enough information available to make informed decisions, they have to have a degree of trust in the companies and if the risk is too high, then they are out of mining,"" Ian Woodley, investment analyst at Old Mutual, said.
Industry-wide, regulatory and technical costs will rise as everyone tries to make tailings dams safer.
One banking source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Vale disaster damaged banks' view of whether mining was ""investable from a public equity perspective"".
Even mining companies might want to question their business models as Brazil responds to the disaster by seizing assets and carrying out arrests.
Warren Beech, a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells, said mining was trapped in ""a perfect storm"", struggling against issues of image, sustainability and community opposition.
""Assets are not beyond forfeiture and seizure. No assets in any country are sacrosanct. Governments that feel mining companies are not doing what they should be doing will attack assets,"" he said.
Vale itself has a safety net as its biggest shareholders - state pension funds that own around a fifth of the company - are unlikely to divest.
Given a strong national belief in mining, analysts say Vale's sell-off could be seen as a buying opportunity for local investors.
In a note this month, UBS analysts said some 80 percent of Brazilian investors polled were weighing buying Vale shares based on its depressed stock price, while only 30 percent of global investors it spoke to shared that enthusiasm.

(This story has been corrected to remove reference to Vale being propped up by a government stake in 10th graph)

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 12:15PM ET</span>",London bankers will need 'chaperones' for EU clients under no-deal Brexit: sources,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Investment banks have warned M&A teams in Britain they cannot pitch business to clients in the European Union if there is a no-deal Brexit without an EU ""chaperone"" sitting in on their meeting, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Banks including Nomura and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) have told dealmakers in London that in a no-deal Brexit scenario they would have to loop in EU colleagues when talking to customers in continental Europe about specific advisory work and regulated products like loans or bonds.
Even cold-calling of company executives to pitch for new business out of London could raise eyebrows among EU regulators if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal, the sources said.
""There is a whole bunch of things people have to do in the course of an M&A transaction which require regulation,"" Simon Gleeson, a financial services partner at Clifford Chance, said.
""The problem is that at the start of the discussion you have no idea how you're going to finance the deal and technically you should tell clients every five minutes 'oh, I can't do this, I can't do that,' which is a bit worrying,"" Gleeson said, referring to what could happen if there is no Brexit deal.
A Credit Suisse spokeswoman said the Swiss bank was working to maintain access to EU clients and markets by using its existing infrastructure in the event of a hard Brexit.
""Discussions with relevant regulators, employees and key stakeholders continue but as we have previously stated, our solution will involve multiple locations, including Madrid, Frankfurt and Luxembourg,"" she said. 
""London will remain a key part of the bank's footprint even after the UK's exit from the European Union,"" she said.
Nomura declined to comment.
Prime Minister Theresa May suffered another parliamentary defeat on Thursday in her attempt to win backing for a Brexit deal that would mean business as usual for bankers until the end of 2020.
But with Brexit due in just over 40 days and no deal in sight, bankers are having to face up to what a no-deal Brexit will actually mean and make contingency plans.
""If Britain crashes out of the EU, even pitching ideas to EU clients is unchartered territory,"" a London-based M&A banker at a European investment bank said.
""We will need a chaperone who is cleared by EU regulators to witness our conversations.""
REVERSE SOLICITATION
M&A bankers have until now seen their jobs as Brexit-proof because unlike other banking roles, including selling and trading equities or bonds, dealmaking is effectively unregulated.
Major investment banks have offices across Europe and London-based M&A staff typically liaise with their local counterparts when working on live deals. 
If Britain agrees a Brexit deal, banks will mainly relocate staff working with regulated products and will also benefit from a transition period to adjust to life after Brexit.
But without a withdrawal agreement in place there will be no transition period.
A no-deal Brexit would harm an M&A banker's ability to interact freely with EU companies and develop relationships with local executives to win lucrative advisory mandates down the line.
Bankers in London would need to hand all financing and deal execution activity to colleagues inside the EU, the sources said. They would also need a ""letter of engagement"" from a client, giving them the right to represent EU companies in M&A discussions, the sources also said.
This refers to the legal principle of ""reverse solicitation.""
Barney Reynolds, a financial lawyer at Shearman & Sterling, said EU financial rules recognize the principle of reverse solicitation, which is where a customer in the EU can ask for a service like M&A advice from a firm that does not have a branch or subsidiary in the bloc.
    ""It's not a panacea but it's a known legal principle. You would need to have processes and procedures in place to show that you were approached by the client in the first place,"" Reynolds said.
But a lack of clear guidelines from EU regulators on reverse solicitation creates uncertainty, according to law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, and could lead to sanctions and the risk of investors trying to rescind contracts if wrongly used.
Some banks including Credit Suisse are monitoring how much time their M&A bankers spend in the EU versus London to establish which is the best location for their top deal makers.

""It's not entirely clear what we can do and cannot do after March 29. What's certain is that under a no-deal scenario the entire pipeline would be disrupted,"" another M&A banker at a major U.S. investment bank said.

MADRID (Reuters) - Hundreds of Chinese citizens waving Spanish and Chinese flags took to the streets of Madrid on Friday to protest against BBVA (MC:BBVA), saying the bank had blocked their accounts.
The protesters said they had been told their bank accounts had been blocked because of money laundering regulations but insisted they had done nothing wrong.
""We gathered here to demand equality because we are ordinary citizens. I work in a consultancy office and I don't have suspicious transactions"", said Yunajie Chen, a Chinese accountant who arrived in Spain as a child and has been a BBVA client for over six years.
BBVA, Spain's second largest bank, declined to comment on any of these cases and said it does not discriminate against any clients based on nationality and treats all customers with the same criteria.
Spain beefed up its money laundering regulations last year. The law requires clients to give the bank a series of personal details and background information, regardless of their nationality, said spokesman for the Spanish banking association AEB, Jose Luis Martinez Campuzano. 
However Dawein Ding, vice-president of a Chinese radio station in Madrid who also works for the Chinese Association in Spain (ACHE), said banks such as BBVA were demanding far more details and making the process more complicated for Chinese citizens than for Spanish nationals.
""For a Spaniard to open a bank account they just have to show their identification card, whereas Chinese citizens have to deliver much more paperwork such as evidence of their work life like payslips and contracts,"" Ding said.
BBVA declined to comment on this.
The protesters, gathered by a major BBVA branch, said increased scrutiny effectively cut them off from paying their utility bills or tuition costs for their children.
""What BBVA and some other banks have done has damaged the legal interests of thousands of ordinary Chinese, the lives of many people...have been affected,"" said Feng Mao, the head of the ACHE association.
ACHE says between 4,000 and 5,000 people have seen their accounts blocked by BBVA.
Both the Economy Ministry and the Bank of Spain declined to comment on Friday when asked about the complaints of Chinese citizens.

A Reuters investigation last year detailed the alleged money laundering scheme involving ICBC following the arrest of seven ICBC executives in Madrid in February 2016.

1057,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 11:15AM ET</span>","Mexico to pump $3.6 billion to relieve ailing Pemex, more if needed","By Ana Isabel Martinez and David Alire Garcia
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico will inject $3.6 billion into ailing state-owned oil company Pemex, including by reducing taxes and refinancing debt, officials said Friday, promising to do ""whatever is takes"" to strengthen its finances and prevent a further credit downgrade.
Falling oil output, corruption and high labor costs have contributed to the decline of the company that was once a symbol of national pride. It now holds roughly $106 billion in financial debt, the highest of any national oil company in Latin America. Fitch and Moody's rate its credit one notch above junk.
Investors said they had expected stronger measures to avoid further downgrades, but were reassured by the commitment to more action in the future if required.
""The announcement is positive and could be enough to remedy the company additional financial needs for 2019,"" said Edgar Cruz, global markets credit research at BBVA (MC:BBVA) in Mexico, while warning that it would not stave off another crunch next year.
Over the next three years, Pemex must make more than $27 billion in debt payments. 
Pemex will receive $1.8 billion in pension liability monetization as part of the new fiscal assistance plan for the company and finances will be helped by a corruption clamp-down, officials said in a presentation that was short on details. They vowed the Mexican government will not take on new debt.
The Mexican peso weakened by more half a percent against the dollar in morning trading after the announcement. Mexico's 10-year bond was down around half a percent, before recovering slightly. 
Over time, Pemex taxes will go down, and the capital injection will allow debt refinancing over the year, Finance Minister Carlos Urzua said, adding that if Pemex requires more help, the government will provide it.
'DO WHAT IT TAKES'
""This will allow Pemex ... to not need to take on new debt, just refinancing,"" Urzua said. ""The federal government ... will do what it takes to keep finances healthy in the case of Pemex, starting this year.""
Rating agency Fitch downgraded debt issued by Pemex by two steps last month, making it the second agency after Moody's to put the company just barely within its investment grade category. 
The move stoked fears further downgrades by Fitch or other credit ratings agencies could significantly raise the oil company's financing costs and result in dire fiscal consequences for the government.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, did not fully detail how the government will finance Pemex's lower tax bill and additional capital injection. He said efforts since late December to battle rampant fuel theft in Mexico will result in savings of about $1.6 billion, while a plan to increase production will generate more resources. 
""It's injecting resources, it's lowering the tax obligation,"" he said at the press conference. ""But above all, it's cleaning Pemex of corruption, and that will let us take the company forward."" 
Investors had expected a stronger response, said Luis Gonzalez, a portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Investments in Mexico City, noting that the capital boost plus lowered taxes would still barely save Pemex from needing refinancing this year. However, he praised the commitment to double down on relief measures if necessary. 
""The unconditional support they expressed for the oil company is positive,"" he said. 
The company is in talks with lenders to potentially raise up to $7 billion this year, Refinitiv IFR reported on Friday. The company has previously said it would refinance around $6.6 billion in 2019. 
The immediate priority, according to the IFR report, is renewing a $1.5-billion revolving credit facility that matures later this year, said three banking sources that have lent to Pemex in the past. 
Pemex previously said that a total capital injection of about $1.8 billion from the government was planned for this year, according to a February 2019 presentation to investors. 

The first injection was received on Jan. 25, the presentation said, with four additional payments scheduled between later this month and May. The company ""does not expect"" to place new debt through March, the presentation said.

(Reuters) - PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc said on Friday increased investments in advertising and products aimed at boosting sales growth would lead to a fall in profit this year.
In his first major strategic move after taking over as chief executive officer, Ramon Laguarta unveiled plans to cut jobs and restructure plants to save $1 billion annually through 2023 and fund its investments in a bid to claw back market share from larger rival Coca Cola.
Shares of PepsiCo were up 2 percent in late morning trading as the company also reported better than expected core revenue growth, driven by higher demand for its Frito-Lay snacks and its beverages in North America.
Pepsi and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) are spending heavily to market low-sugar colas and flavored waters to keep up with changing consumer preferences toward healthier beverages.
Although increased advertising is helping sales, it is pressuring margins that are already squeezed by rising commodity and freight costs.
""While organic sales growth guidance suggests topline strength should continue, earnings per share suggests the cost of achieving that growth is increasing,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog said.
The company said it expects 2019 adjusted profit per share to drop 3 percent to $5.50, while analysts on average had expected a 3.5 percent rise to $5.86 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The forecast also takes into account a higher tax bill and a 2 percentage point hit from a stronger dollar.
Coca-Cola also warned on Thursday that its earnings per share could fall in 2019, citing a stronger dollar. The forecast pushed its shares down nearly 9 percent.
Sales in PepsiCo's North America beverage unit, the company's largest revenue contributor, rose 1 percent in the fourth quarter, benefiting from demand for Pepsi sodas, LIFEWTR and bubbly sparkling water and Gatorade Zero.
The investments in advertising and innovation is driving strong growth for core products, Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston told Reuters.
""(This) has caused us to want to invest more money back into the businesses in 2019 and that is why our guidance has landed where it has.""
Stripping off the forex impact and acquisition costs, PepsiCo forecast a 4 percent growth in operating revenue this year, higher than the six-year average growth rate of 3.8 percent.

Revenue and profit were in line with expectations for the quarter ended Dec. 29. The company also announced a 3 percent hike in annual dividend to $3.82 per share.

1060,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 10:40AM ET</span>",Standard Life Aberdeen preps for job cuts: sources,"By Carolyn Cohn, Elisabeth O'Leary and Simon Jessop
LONDON/EDINBURGH (Reuters) -  Standard Life  Aberdeen (L:SLA) (SLA) plans a fresh round of job cuts in the coming weeks as part of a broader cost overhaul aimed at shoring up investor confidence after a year of heavy outflows of client cash, four sources told Reuters.
Britain's biggest standalone asset manager saw more than 20 billion euros yanked from its funds in 2018, industry tracker Morningstar estimates, amid broad market turmoil at the end of the year that is set to weigh on revenue when the company posts full-year results on March 13.
The job cuts come weeks after the January arrival of former HSBC chairman and industry heavyweight Douglas Flint to lead the board, under investor pressure to boost returns and resolve long-standing concerns around the company's co-CEO structure.
A spokesman for SLA said any layoffs would be part of those flagged after the 2017 merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management, when the company said it planned to trim the then 9,000 strong workforce by around 800 over three years. 
That target has not changed despite the subsequent exit of 3,000 staff through the sale of SLA's insurance business to Phoenix Group in September, the spokesman said.
Consultations with staff are now underway again, with losses of up to 10 percent expected in some departments including sales and, potentially, investment teams including those in equities, one source said.
""There's a whole new round of cuts just started. A number of departments that went through restructuring and a consultation process, with job cuts, are having to do it all over again,"" the source said.
Consultants PwC have also been running the slide rule over SLA's operational footprint, two sources said.
""The integration (post-merger) is done but they are not going to get to a point where they say, 'that's fine, it's over'. The pressure on costs is permanent. There are outflows and they have to be thinking whether that is sustainable,"" one said.
The SLA spokesman confirmed Stephanie Bruce, Head of Financial Services for Assurance at PwC in the UK, had been seconded to the company from April last year to advise during and after the Phoenix deal, but was not advising on job cuts.
As part of shrinking its cost base, one of Scotland's biggest financial companies and a major employer in Edinburgh has also ditched plans to take over a prime office building in the city at 10 George Street, two sources said.
SLA had originally pre-let the office on a 15-year lease, but instead had appointed agents JLL and EYCO to assign the lease to others, ahead of a planned refurbishment in June, a source said.
The SLA spokesman confirmed the company no longer planned to take up the offices and would instead rent them out.
OUTFLOWS
While front-line investment teams at SLA largely escaped the initial post-merger cuts, pressure to trim high-earning fund managers has increased after heavy outflows from its flagship absolute return fund, GARS, and equities.
Morningstar estimates total outflows in 2018 of 21 billion euros, with GARS accounting for more than 14 billion euros of that total and around two-thirds of SLA's more than 200 funds losing assets. 
""Outflows accelerated in the second half of the year, continuing a downtrend that began around three years ago,"" Morningstar manager research analyst Francesco Paganelli said.
""Like many other large active asset managers, SLA is under pressure particularly in traditional long-only asset classes, where low-cost index funds and ETFs continue to gain market share.""

1061,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 10:25AM ET</span>","Nvidia forecasts demand rebound, Wall Street not so sure","By Sonam Rai
(Reuters) - Nvidia Corp's forecast of a demand rebound by the end of the year calmed investor nerves and pushed its shares up 5 percent on Friday, but several Wall Street analysts said the outlook was ""aggressive"" given weak demand and the ongoing U.S.-China trade war.
The chip designer on Thursday forecast full-year revenue to be ""flat or down slightly"" from 2018, but Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said he expects China, gaming and self-driving vehicles to drive demand for its chips.
Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc had also forecast full-year revenue ahead of analysts' expectations. AMD, like Nvidia, is banking on its newest graphics and data center chips to bolster growth for the year.
Top chipmakers took a hit in the fourth quarter from a slowdown in China, triggered by the trade dispute. In January, Nvidia cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars because of weak demand in China.
The dispute remains an overhang even as negotiators from the two countries are in talks ahead of a March 1 tariffs deadline.
While Nvidia could see a double-digit drop in revenue in the first two quarters, it is projecting a big 35 percent jump in the fourth quarter to make up for the lost sales, Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster wrote in a note.
""The key question: is a 35 percent y/y growth exiting FY20 realistic? Our belief is that it is not realistic because it is similar to the growth rates during the crypto-boom,"" Munster said.
Demand for graphic chips from Bitcoin miners brought in hundreds of millions of dollars for Nvidia in 2018. But at the fag end of the year the boom evaporated, and, coupled with lower demand from China, led to a pile-up of unsold chips at distributors and retailers.
Nvidia will not be able to make up on all the crypto loss and could likely miss the full-year guidance, according to analyst Kinngai Chan from Summit Insights Group.
However, the company still has an opportunity in the form of selling technology for self-driving cars.
Nvidia's platform is being used by hundreds of companies involved in autonomous cars, including software developers, auto suppliers, sensor and mapping companies.

""Although this (self-driving) segment currently contributes relatively little to the top line, we acknowledge the opportunity Nvidia has to grow its presence in cars beyond infotainment as drivers seek autonomous features in newer vehicles,"" Morningstar analyst Abhinav Davuluri wrote.

1062,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 10:15AM ET</span>",Britain to look at whether auditors should check for fraud,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - An independent review is to look at whether accountants in Britain should check for fraud when auditing company finances so they could potentially spot problems that cause corporate crashes, the business ministry said on Friday.
The collapse of construction firm Carillion and retailer BHS and more recently troubles at Patisserie Valerie prompted politicians to try to shake up accounting and the dominance of the ""Big Four"" firms - EY, KPMG, Deloitte and PwC - that check the books of most major companies in the country.
The review, headed by Donald Brydon, chair of the London Stock Exchange, will look at how to bridge a gap between expectations that an audit can flag future problems and the reality of what is essentially a backward looking snapshot.
It will look at the extent to which auditors can and should assess the impact of ""uncertain future events"" and whether underlying information is reliable, the ministry said.
""Is it their job to be policemen hunting for fraud? Probably not. We have to be careful we don't raise expectations beyond what's possible,"" Brydon told lawmakers earlier this month.
He will consider whether more items in company statements should be audited, such as the risk calculations made by banks that determine how much capital they hold to stay solvent.
The review marks the third part of a push to inject more competition into the auditing business in Britain and improve quality in the external checks of a company's books.
Britain's Competition and Markets Authority has already proposed changes to increase choice in the market. Another review has proposed replacing the regulator for audits, the Financial Reporting Council, with a new, more powerful authority.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, an industry body, will provide 500,000 pounds ($640,750.00) of funding for the latest review.
""All supporting organizations recognize and accept that their contribution to the review is unconditional. The review will be conducted on an independent basis,"" the ministry said in a statement.
A report on the review's finding will go the ministry by the end of 2019, with a final version published and its recommendations put out to public consultation.

1066,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>",How Amazon scrapped its plans for a New York headquarters,"(Reuters) - More than a year of work to bring Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's headquarters and tens of thousands of jobs to New York City ended on Thursday with a couple of phone calls.
Jay Carney, the company's top policy executive, told New York Governor Andrew Cuomo that the world's biggest online retailer would not go ahead with plans to invest $2.5 billion to build a second head office in the New York City borough of Queens.
Carney, a former press secretary for President Barack Obama, told New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio the same shortly after.
Abruptly scuttling its Big Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans blindsided Amazon's allies and opponents alike. The company said the decision came together only in the last 48 hours, made by its senior leadership team and Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, chief executive and the richest person in the world. 
Yet by some measures the decision was months in the making, as community opposition signaled to the company that it was not entirely welcome.
The abrupt reversal has made the company a target of ire from progressives like U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who are swiftly gaining ground and influence in the U.S. Democratic party. It may also play into an intensifying battle between Republicans and Democrats as President Donald Trump and his allies accuse left-leaning rivals of embracing socialism. 
The decision has also generated fresh debate about the rich tax-breaks and public funding that municipalities routinely throw at companies to lure their business and the jobs they bring with them. 
Seattle-based Amazon captivated elected officials across North America in September 2017 when it announced it would create more than 50,000 jobs in a second headquarters dubbed HQ2. Cities and states vied desperately for the economic stimulus, with New Jersey offering $7 billion in potential credits and the mayor of an Atlanta suburb promising to make Bezos mayor for life of a new city called ""Amazon.""
A backlash began in earnest when Amazon announced two winners to split the offices last November: Arlington, Virginia, and New York's Long Island City neighborhood, with New York offering incentives worth $1.53 billion to Amazon. The company could apply for $900 million more, too.
New York State Senator Michael Gianaris and City Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer said that day that it was ""unfathomable that we would sign a $3 billion check"" to one of the world's most valuable companies considering the city's crumbling subways and overcrowded schools. 
City Council meetings in December and January showed Amazon executives who showed up the stern opposition they could expect from some elected officials and labor organizers.
Protesters interrupted the meetings. A television report showed people unfurling signs saying, ""Amazon delivers lies,"" and ""Amazon fuels ICE (NYSE:ICE) deportations"" - a reference to the company's cooperation with the U.S. Department in charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Amazon felt that a small number of local and state officials had no desire to collaborate on a path forward, the company later said, despite what it said was strong popular support for its project.
RELATIVELY PAINLESS EXIT 
Tension ratcheted up earlier this month, when Gianaris was nominated to a state panel set to vote in 2020 on whether to approve the financial terms for Amazon.
Days later, Amazon executives weighed the pros and cons of whether to follow through with its New York headquarters, two people briefed on talks inside the company said. Concerned that Amazon could be in limbo for more than a year ahead of the state panel's vote, the growing consensus within the company was that it did not make sense to move ahead in the face of persistent opposition with a headquarters in New York City, where it already has 5,000 employees. 
Amazon had no binding legal contracts to acquire or lease the land for the project. It could exit with relatively little pain, the people said.
Company officials also concluded Amazon could shift the jobs that would have been created in New York to other corporate centers it has across the United States, from the San Francisco Bay Area to Boston. Reopening talks with former HQ2 contestants did not make sense, the people said. 
Gianaris blamed Amazon for the reversal.
""Amazon never showed willingness to look seriously at the concerns that were raised,"" he said.
Still, up to the moment of the announcement, there were signs that the parties could work together.
One union leader said he and other labor organizers met on Wednesday with Cuomo and four Amazon officials, including Brian Huseman, its vice president of public policy.
""We had such a productive meeting yesterday. Everyone left happy,"" said Stuart Appelbaum, head of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.
The group is trying to organize workers at an Amazon facility in Staten Island, another New York City borough, despite the company's past opposition to unionization.

""It was a complete surprise that they would say they look forward to working with us, and we talked about next steps, and then they call it all off the next morning,"" said Appelbaum.

LONDON (Reuters) - The outlook for Wall Street earnings has deteriorated significantly in recent months, data shows, raising the risk that companies in the United States may slip into recession before its economy does - with Europe close behind.
Analysts on average expect the S&P 500's first-quarter earnings per share to drop 0.3 percent year-on-year, according to I/B/E/S Refinitiv data. 
That's a big drop from the 8.2 percent rise expected as recently as October and would mark the first contraction in U.S. company earnings in three years.
Analysts have also made deep cuts to forecasts for the rest of the year.
They still expect growth in the remaining three quarters, meaning Wall Street would avoid a technical recession typically defined as a fall in two consecutive quarters. But only just, as the lowered growth forecasts are meager.
For a graphic on U.S. earnings estimates over time: https://tmsnrt.rs/2TRqqof
The swift pace and size of the cuts have kindled concerns that the downward trend will continue, particularly as companies struggle with squeezed margins and large amounts of debt. 
The full-year estimate stands at just 4.2 percent now, down more than half from 10.2 percent in October.
It's pretty gloomy on the other side of the Atlantic too. Analysts anticipate barely any growth among European companies listed on the STOXX 600 at the slowest in 18 months, data shows.

Some of the changes relate to so-called interchange fees, the report said. Interchange fees are what merchants pay to banks when consumers use a credit or a debit card to make a purchase from their store.
Fees that Mastercard and Visa charge financial institutions, such as banks, for processing card payments on behalf of merchants are also set to increase, the report said.
Visa and Mastercard did not immediately to a request for comment.
Merchants often pass on any increases in processing fees to consumers, in an attempt to protect their own profits. Up to 2.5 percent of prices for goods and services go to cover card fees, the WSJ said.
Card companies have said in the past that their credit and debit cards usually result in more sales for merchants, especially in countries like the U.S. They also say that expenses for ramping up anti-fraud/theft security measures, to make payment processing safer, need to be covered.

Recently, the two companies along with several U.S. banks, had to pay over $6 billion to settle a lawsuit brought by merchants who accused the credit card companies of violating federal antitrust laws by forcing merchants to pay swipe fees and prohibiting them from directing consumers toward other methods of payment.

1070,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 06:50AM ET</span>","Xi Hails Important Progress, Says Trade Talks to Resume in U.S.","(Bloomberg) -- President Xi Jinping said U.S.-China trade talks would continue next week in Washington, as the two sides race to reach a deal that would avert a tariff increase on Chinese goods by March 1.
“Negotiations between both sides have achieved important progress in another step,” Xi said after a round of trade talks wrapped up in Beijing, according China’s Xinhua News Agency. “Next week, both sides are going to meet in Washington. I hope you keep up the good work, and push for a mutually-benefiting and win-win agreement.”
Xi said he values the “good working relationship” with President Donald Trump very much, and is willing to keep in touch with him in various ways. He added that China was “willing to solve the bilateral economic disputes and frictions through cooperation, and push for an agreement that both sides can accept. But cooperation has principles.”
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sounded a positive note on Friday, saying he and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer held “productive meetings” with China’s Vice Premier Liu He. They both also met Xi later in the day.
“We feel we have made headway on very, very important and difficult issues,” Lighthizer said, according to the Associated Press. “We have additional work we have to do but we are hopeful.""
The two sides remained far apart this week on structural reforms to China’s economy that the U.S. has requested, according to three U.S. and Chinese officials who asked not to be identified because the talks were private. They said it would likely take a meeting between Xi and Trump to seal a deal.
The U.S. and China were scrambling on Friday to produce a memorandum of understanding that would pave the way for a meeting between the two presidents, the Financial Times reported earlier, citing people briefed on the negotiations.
The U.S. has also not relented on demands for China to dial back government subsidies for state-owned enterprises and improve corporate governance, one of the people said, an extremely sensitive issue that is seen as a non-starter for Chinese leaders.
The uncertainty has weighed on investors, with Asian stocks retreating from the highest levels since October following a dip in U.S. equities. Both sides have an incentive to strike a deal: Trump has repeatedly linked market gains to his administration’s policies, while Bloomberg Economics estimates China would avoid a 0.3 percent drag on 2019 gross domestic product if the trade truce holds.
Trump earlier this week said he was open to delaying the deadline to more than double tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods if the two countries were close to a deal that addresses deep structural changes to China’s economic and trade policies. Bloomberg News reported late Wednesday that he’s considering pushing back the deadline by 60 days.
Asked Thursday if the Trump administration was considering extending the deadline for tariff increases, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said no decision has been made.
Negotiators in Beijing “are soldiering on” and the “vibe” is good, Kudlow said on Fox News, adding that he was briefed by U.S. officials earlier Thursday. “They are going to be meeting with President Xi tomorrow, which is a very good sign. They are moving through all of the issues. They are getting the job done.”
Kudlow later told reporters at the White House that he’s “cautiously optimistic” on the outcome of the talks with China.
A meeting date between Trump and Xi has not been set and it is unlikely the pair can meet before the March 1 deadline.
White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said on Tuesday that Trump wants to meet Xi “very soon.”

WASHINGTON/HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnamese airlines will be able to fly to the United States and codeshare with American carriers after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration declared the Southeast Asian country complies with international safety standards.
The U.S. aviation safety agency said in a statement late on Thursday that it was awarding Vietnam a ""Category 1"" rating, two weeks after Reuters reported the decision was expected.
""It's recognition by a very developed aviation authority which requires a very high standard of safety and security,"" Vietnamese Deputy Transportation Minister Nguyen Ngoc Dong told Reuters on Friday.
There are currently no non-stop flights between Vietnam and the United States, despite a large market catering to tourism and visits by friends and relatives. Vietnam Airlines JSC, Bamboo Airways and VietJet Aviation JSC desire to fly to the United States.
Bamboo Airways Chairman Trinh Van Quyet said Bamboo was considering destinations such as Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco, with the first route to open in late 2020 or early 2021. His airline has ordered 20 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 787s for long-haul flights.
CAPA Centre for Aviation Chief Analyst Brendan Sobie said the FAA rating was important for Vietnam symbolically and politically.
But he said Vietnamese airlines could struggle to make U.S. flights profitable because of the lack of demand from high-paying business travelers. 
""For Vietnam Airlines, launching routes to the U.S. is our political responsibility as a national airline. Whether or not the route is commercially feasible depends quite a lot on technical issues and aircraft,"" the airline said in a statement.
Vietnam Airlines said it was in talks with Airbus and Boeing about potential jet purchases for the U.S. route, but the earliest they were expected to arrive was in 2022. In the meantime its existing codeshares with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) could be expanded after the rating.
Budget carrier VietJet said it plans to purchase wide-body jets capable of non-stop U.S. flights and believes its experience in keeping costs down will give it an effective business model.
""We plan to open routes to cities with Vietnamese communities living in the United States such as in California, serving the large traveling and commercial demand from customers,"" VietJet's vice president To Viet Thang said in a statement.
The FAA last year sent a team to Vietnam to conduct a safety assessment.
Vietnam's rapidly growing aviation market saw traffic increase 16 percent on average each year from 2010 to 2017, government data shows. 

Its airlines are major customers of Boeing and Airbus SE.

LONDON (Reuters) - The trading of dual-listed shares in Britain by European investors is expected to continue after Brexit, a senior official at pan-European exchange Euronext has said.
Investors in the bloc can only trade shares on foreign platforms that EU regulators have deemed to be ""equivalent"", meaning they comply with customer protection and other rules that are similar to those in the EU.
Britain is due to leave the bloc next month and Brussels has not pre-emptively made an ""equivalence"" decision regarding UK trading venues in case of a no-deal Brexit.
Without a deal to ensure a smooth departure, European investors who want to trade in London in the shares of a company that is also listed on an EU exchange would be cut off from a big pool of trading, which could mean less competitive prices.
Anthony Attia, chief executive of Euronext's Paris operation and head of global listings, said the bourse was ""actively working"" with regulators to make sure its double listings in Dublin, Amsterdam and Paris would continue to benefit from a European pool of liquidity.
CLARIFICATION
The European Commission is responsible for granting equivalence to foreign financial operators, taking advice from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
""We are confident this is going to continue after Brexit, but obviously we need to wait for some clarification and positioning from the European Commission on this,"" Attia told reporters on Thursday evening in a conference call.
Euronext saw ""significant"" commercial opportunities from double listings, Attia said.
ESMA Chair Steven Maijoor said earlier this week that the watchdog was looking at this issue with a view to avoiding disruption in financial markets.
""We intend to provide more clarity on this matter sufficiently ahead of Brexit date,"" Maijoor said.
Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 and has yet to agree the terms of its divorce due to deep divisions within the British parliament.
Brussels agreed in December that if Britain crashes out of the bloc with no deal, it would deem UK clearing to be equivalent so that EU customers could continue using them.
The European Commission said on Friday it was aware of the issues around dual listed shares and is in contact with ESMA on the matter.
""As we said in our 19 December 2018 communication, after a thorough examination of the risks linked to a no deal scenario in the financial sector, the Commission has found that only a limited number of contingency measures is necessary to safeguard financial stability in the EU27,"" a Commission spokesman said
UK-based share trading platforms like Cboe Europe, the London Stock Exchange's Turquoise, and Aquis Exchange plan to open hubs in the EU by March 29 to avoid the risk of customers in the bloc being cut off.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares recovered on Friday after weak U.S. and Chinese economic data earlier sent global equity markets into a dive.
After opening lower, Europe's STOXX 600 nudged up 0.2 percent despite weakness in German equities. Demand for safe-haven currencies remained strong.
Stocks fell after a U.S. report that retail sales had dropped in December to their lowest since 2009 and by data on Chinese producer prices, which were little changed for a seventh straight month in January. 
Germany's main stock index, which is exposed to the Chinese economy because of its large number of exporters, was down 0.2 percent by 0932 GMT. It had fallen as much as 0.5 percent. 
European car stocks, a bellwether for the continent's economy, fell 1 percent as sales dropped and the deadline approached for a U.S. Commerce Department that could lead to the imposition of tariffs.
""After hot markets of late, a little bit of cold water has been poured on bourses over the last 24 hours,"" said Deutsche Bank's strategist Jim Reid.
The slow start in European shares reflected nerves across global equity markets. MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat. 
Emerging markets were set for their first back-to-back weekly loss since late last year. The MSCIEF index of emerging market stocks dropped 0.8 percent. 
Investors in Asia took fright early after the U.S. retail sales report. Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.1 percent as market in Seoul, Tokyo and Shanghai all lost ground.
Worries about the United States, which many considered a bright spot in the world economy, offset some optimism over trade talks in Beijing between the United States and China. 
The two top U.S. negotiators were due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday, but no decision has been taken to extend a March 1 deadline for a deal.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a tweet on Friday that he and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer had ""productive meetings"" with China's Vice Premier Liu He.
SAFE HAVEN 
The Japanese yen and other safe-haven currencies made gains as the market awaited developments in the trade talks. The dollar remained fairly robust in spite of the U.S. retail figures, trading up 0.2 percent at 97.1 against a basket of major currencies. 
The euro was 0.2 percent lower at $1.1278 and headed for a second week of losses. It is down by 1.7 percent so far this year after discouraging economic data from the euro zone.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to 2.6483 percent, wiping out most of its rise this week.
Commodities diverged from wider market trends. Crude oil briefly reached 2019 highs above $65 per barrel after OPEC-led supply cuts and a bigger-than-expected cut by Saudi Arabia this week encouraged investors.
The global Brent benchmark last traded at $64.75, up 18 cents, or 0.28 percent, from the last close. It has risen 4.5 percent this week.

For the U.K.’s Theresa May, there’s a real risk that Spain’s rival parties will seek to use Brexit as a political weapon -- focusing their fire on the tiny rocky outcrop of Gibraltar.
Sanchez himself forced May to give ground in a diplomatic tussle over the contested territory last November, threatening to veto the Brexit deal. To placate him, Britain was forced to write a letter conceding that Gibraltar won’t necessarily be covered by a future U.K.-EU trade deal.
The Spanish leader claimed victory, declaring Britain will be forced to open talks on joint sovereignty over the British Overseas Territory, a long-held goal in Spain.
The history matters because May still needs Spanish support. As time runs out, she’s trying to reopen Brexit negotiations to get a better deal on the Irish border backstop. New talks would give Spain -- and others -- a chance to make their own demands in return.
Many officials in May’s team also believe she’ll need to ask the EU to extend the deadline beyond Britain’s scheduled exit date of March 29. To do that, May will need support from every one of the EU’s 27 other member countries, including Spain."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German financial watchdog Bafin has extended the mandate of its monitor at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) over the bank's role in a money laundering scandal involving Danske Bank.
Deutsche Bank acted as a correspondent bank for Danske Bank in Estonia, meaning it helped transfer funds on behalf of the Danish lender from Estonia to places like New York.
Bafin said on Friday it had ordered Deutsche Bank to review its group-wide risk management processes in the area of correspondent banking and to adjust them where necessary.
In order to monitor the implementation of this measure, Bafin said in a statement it had widened the mandate of the special representative appointed in September 2018.
Germany's biggest bank said that there were no indications of misconduct on its part. It has received requests for information from regulators and law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, investigating Danske Bank.
Denmark's largest bank is under investigation over suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros ($225 billion) from 2007 until 2015 from its Estonia branch. 
Deutsche Bank has scaled back its correspondent banking business by around 40 percent since 2016. In Russia it cut such activity by around 75 percent since 2016, while it has exited such business in Moldova, Estonia and Latvia.
Board member Karl von Rohr said last week that it had so far not made any provisions for possible Danske-related legal costs.
In 2017, the Fed was among regulators that fined Deutsche Bank nearly $700 million for weak controls that allowed money laundering from Russia. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the case is still ongoing.

1079,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 05:52AM ET</span>",Qatar's real estate market faces reality check ahead of World Cup,"By Eric Knecht and Tuqa Khalid
DOHA/DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar's Doha Tower, a spike-tipped cylinder that glows orange at night, won an award when finished in 2012 amid a Gulf-wide real estate boom, but today about half of its 46 floors are empty.
The office tower, now a familiar part of the capital's high-rise skyline, has run foul of what real estate brokers, bankers and analysts say is an oversupplied Qatar property market ahead of the 2022 World Cup that mirrors a real estate downturn in the wider Gulf region after a drop in oil prices.
Qatar has the added challenge of a diplomatic, trade and transport boycott imposed on the Gulf Arab state by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt over allegations that Doha supports Islamist militants, a charge Qatar denies.
The protracted row has made it tough to lure would-be foreign buyers of residential or commercial space.
Residential prices are down about 10 percent from June 2017, when the boycott began, and office prices have fallen by a similar rate, according to analysts and economists. Rents are down 20 percent from three years ago, they say.
""Qatar's property sector has been one of the main casualties from the blockade that was imposed in mid-2017,"" Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
The property downturn has so far not translated into bad loans, as bankers say borrowers holding sluggish real estate assets tend to be among the country's wealthiest.
""They have capacity to withstand the market ... I don't see a major threat,"" Doha Bank CEO Raghavan Setharaman said, when asked about his view of the real estate market. 
A banker at Al-Khalij Commercial Bank said banks like his have been restructuring many property loans in recent months, extending them to 20-year payment periods from 10 in some cases, to keep business moving for developers hit by slow demand.
But with the World Cup edging closer, real estate experts say long-planned projects are now set to flood the market, even as buildings in prime locations, like Doha Tower, sit idle.
""It'll be interesting to see what happens when they (real estate prices) are really put under pressure in a year's time, when a lot of new supply hits the market,"" Johnny Archer, Associate Director of DTZ, a Doha-based real estate firm, said.
WORLD CUP FRENZY 
Tiny but wealthy Qatar, the world's top liquefied natural gas exporter, plans to increase residential space by about 50 percent and office space by 40 percent in the next three years, partly on expected demand from the World Cup, according to a report published last week by real estate company DTZ.
The lion's share of construction underway is for high-end residential towers, white-collar office space, and luxury hotels and shopping malls.
FIFA requires Qatar have at least 60,000 hotel rooms in place for the month-long World Cup tournament, which Qatar estimates will draw about 1.5 million fans - more than half of its roughly 2.6 million population.
Qatar has about 26,500 rooms and will add another 15,000 by 2022, DTZ's report estimated. The rest will be met by rooms aboard cruise ships and in desert camps, according to the local World Cup organizing committee. These camps are expected to be bedouin-style accommodation to give visitors a taste of desert life. 
Much of the building is in an entirely new city, Lusail, a 38-square kilometer stretch just north of Doha dotted by commercial towers, hotels, and shopping centers at various stages of construction.
Lusail is being developed by state-controlled Qatari Diar Real Estate Company, which envisions it hosting 200,000 residents and 170,000 employees. It is anchored by Qatar's largest World Cup stadium, an 80,000 seat venue that will host the opening and closing matches.
Colliers International, whose office was an early entrant to Lusail, says getting companies to fill a rush of towers coming online ahead of 2022 will be a daunting task.
""There's going to be massive structural oversupply for office infrastructure for the foreseeable future,"" said Colliers' Qatar country director Adrian Camps. 
In a bid to spur activity, Qatar last month ratified an investment law allowing foreigners full ownership of companies, and for years Qatar has designated certain high-end areas like Lusail open to foreigners, but brokers say demand remains low. 
Shopping malls, lacking the Saudi or Emirati shoppers who once flocked to them before the boycott, are among the most visibly affected, with some having to shutter shops in recent months.
New malls are being built anyway.
Total retail space has doubled in three years and will grow 50 percent more by 2021 with nine new malls, according to DTZ.
Beyond 2022, Qatar real estate faces an uncertain outlook. Aside from soccer stadiums, Qatar has not specified legacy plans for what happens to infrastructure developed for the World Cup after the tournament. 

""There's too much uncertainty as to where that demand specifically is going to come from,"" Richard Rayner, who surveys property for DTZ said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hong Kong telecoms company HKT apologized after a Valentine's day deal it sent to HSBC staff offering discounted laptops ""for him"" but vacuum cleaners and kitchen appliances ""for her"" angered employees over its sexist implications.
The multi-page advertisement, described as an ""HSBC Staff Offer"" was produced and sent to employees of the bank this week by HKT, a telecommunications company owned by Hong Kong conglomerate PCCW.
HSBC staff in Hong Kong and London sharply criticized the offer, according to a source who shared images of it with Reuters, at a time when the bank is battling to reduce a gender pay disparity that is the worst among big British firms. 
""We have heard the feedback and offer our heartfelt apologies for any offense caused,"" a spokesman for HKT said on Friday.
""We firmly believe in gender equality in both the workplace and in life, and we are committed to ensuring that we, and our business partners, exercise prudence, respect and inclusion for all.""
On pages festooned with pink heart drawings, the ""FOR HIM"" section offers discount laptop computers as well as a GoPro camera and wireless headphones, while the ""FOR HER"" gifts include five different vacuum cleaners, a blender and a kitchen water tap.
""The offer is from a third party source who manage their own marketing materials. HSBC is committed to gender diversity in the workplace,"" a spokeswoman for HSBC told Reuters on Thursday. 
The controversy over the sexist implications of the advertising offer comes amid a widening debate about sexism and gender pay disparity in banking and industry generally.
HSBC disclosed in December that its gender pay gap, which measures the difference between the average hourly salary of men and women, grew to 61 percent in the year to April 2018, up from 59 percent a year earlier.
The lender - which employs more than 40,000 people in Britain - had the widest gender pay gap of any large British company in 2017.
HSBC said the large gap was due to the fact there were fewer women in senior roles and more in junior ones, reflecting an industry-wide problem.

The bank said it was taking steps to bridge the gap, including targeting an increase in the ratio of women in senior management roles to 30 percent by 2020, from 23 percent today.

1081,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>",West ups defense spending to keep ahead of Chinese tech: conference report,"MUNICH (Reuters) - The United States led a rise in Western defense spending in 2018 as it moved to keep ahead of Chinese and Russian pushes into advanced military technology, a report said on Friday.
And U.S. President Donald Trump will likely press European states to spend even more at a NATO conference in April, the International Institute for Security Studies (IISS) said. European powers would together have to find an extra $102 billion to meet his latest demands, it added.
Worldwide outlays on weapons and defense rose 1.8 percent to more than $1.67 trillion in 2018 - with the United States on its own responsible for almost half that increase, according to ""The Military Balance"" report released at the Munich Security Conference.
Western powers were concerned about Russia's upgrades of air bases and air defense systems in Crimea - the peninsula it seized from Ukraine in 2014, the annual report said. Its stationing of an S-400 air defense system there increased Moscow's reach in the Black Sea, where it seized three Ukrainian ships last year.
But ""China perhaps represents even more of a challenge, as it introduces yet more advanced military systems and is engaged in a strategy to improve its forces' ability to operate at distance from the homeland,"" it added.
China's stated ambition to modernise its People's Liberation Army by 2035 was ""supported by defense spending that has been on a relentlessly upward trajectory"". 
Slower Chinese economic growth had caused a slight deceleration in spending - but the defense budget still grew nearly six percent between 2017 and 2018.
MISSILES, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
""Chinese naval capability is entering a new phase,"" as it launched cruisers and began sea trials for its first indigenous aircraft carrier, the report said.
Beijing was also improving its air force and pushing into new technologies including very high speed cruise missiles and artificial intelligence.
Western states ""still retain an edge over adversaries, but the gap is narrowing. The pace of change may mean that in the future, advantages - if they exist at all - may be held only fleetingly, before the other side catches up.""
Trump would probably keep up his pressure on NATO allies to increase their defense spending to 2 percent of their gross domestic product, the report said.
""As of late 2018, doing this would mean that NATO European states would have to find an extra $102 billion, on top of the amount they currently spend,"" it added.
Major U.S. and European arms makers that would benefit from any increase include  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), Airbus and Rheinmetall.
The institute said there was a serious lack of transparency regarding military expenditures in the Middle East and North Africa, where known military spending accounted for 4 percent to 11 percent of GDP.

No assessment was available for Syria, Libya, or ""particularly opaque"" states such as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, it said.

Smith did not answer questions after the morning meeting in The Hague, but Netherlands Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra told reporters that they had had ""intensive talks"".
""I don't think it's polite to say exactly what we discussed,"" Hoekstra said. ""It was about protecting the interests of Schiphol (airport) and KLM.""
The meeting comes a day after KLM received a petition signed by 25,000 of its 35,000 employees asking Air France to renew the contract of KLM CEO Pieter Elbers, who is due to leave the company when his term expires in April.
Air France's board is due to meet Feb. 19 ahead of full year earnings Feb. 20, a meeting where either a decision should be made to reappoint Elbers or a new leader should be nominated.
Elbers is seen as a staunch defender of Dutch interests, as KLM has carefully guarded its independence within the Air France group since its takeover in 2003.
The relative outperformance of the Dutch subsidiary has caused tensions within the group. KLM staff regarded repeated costly strikes at Air France with dismay, as the Dutch arm of the union weathered endured painful cost-cutting and layoffs during Elbers' tenure.
For the first nine months of 2018, Air France Group reported operating profit of 328 million euros ($370 million), while KLM had operating profit of 960 million euros.

1086,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 05:03AM ET</span>",Australian miner Fortescue says two driverless trucks involved in low-speed incident,"By Melanie Burton
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian iron ore miner Fortescue said on Friday that one of its driverless trucks, traveling at low speed, ran into another that was parked at its remote Western Australian operations in an incident earlier this week. 
The miner said in a statement that no one was hurt or at risk of being injured in the Feb. 11 incident. Fortescue is retrofitting 100 huge mining trucks with autonomous haulage systems (AHS) at its remote Chichester hub, aiming to more than double its self-driving fleet. 
""This was not the result of any failure of the autonomous system,"" Fortescue Chief Executive Elizabeth Gaines said in the statement. The miner is conducting a full investigation into the incident and expects that to conclude in the near future.
""On Monday, 11 February an AHS truck made contact with a parked AHS truck at slow speed,"" the statement said, without disclosing the speed at which the moving vehicle was traveling or details of any damage to the trucks. ""No manned vehicles or people were involved.""
Analysts said that minor accidents with autonomous vehicles had been reported in the mining industry before. All of Australia's iron ore miners have transitioned into using some autonomous vehicles to cut costs as they can operate without breaks and drive more efficiently. 
""These things happen (across the industry) from time to time,"" said UBS analyst Glyn Lawcock in Sydney.
Earlier on Friday the West Australian paper, without citing sources, reported the moving truck backed into the stationary vehicle.
Fortescue, which said its AHS trucks have safely traveled more than 24.7 million km (14.8 million miles) since 2012, declined to comment directly on the West Australian's report.
A spokesman for the firm, which reports earnings on Feb. 20, said, ""We already have a good understanding of the incident and expect the investigation to conclude in the near term.""
The Western Australian Department of Mines was notified by Fortescue and has begun an investigation, Director of Mines Safety Andrew Chaplyn said in a statement.

""The department will review the company’s internal investigation report to determine what further actions may be required,"" he said.

At 05:00 AM ET (1000 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 was up 0.4% at 3,195.45. National markets were led higher by France’s CAC 40, which gained 0.7%, while Germany’s Dax lagged with a 0.1% decline.
Investors pulled $6 billion from European stocks in the week to Wednesday, various media reported Friday citing data from EPFR. That’s the highest weekly outflow since the summer of 2016 – and once again it’s Brexit that is the main cause of the selling.
For the last two years, markets have been able to ignore the possibility of a disorderly Brexit disrupting the European economy, but it’s increasingly hard to ignore, with Prime Minister Theresa May still unable to get her withdrawal plan through parliament with less than 50 days to go till March 29.
The auto sector is particularly exposed to Brexit issues, given the deep cross-border integration in supply chains and the value of the U.K. market. But Brexit isn’t the only problem it faces – tighter emissions standards in Europe and slower demand in China aren’t helping either.
New data out Friday showed new car registrations in Europe were down 4.6% on the year in January, suggesting that the industry is only slowly getting over the problems it had with new testing standards last year. Data from China overnight also showed declines for most major brands. Germany’s Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), as well as  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), are all toward the bottom of their respective indices this morning.

Elsewhere, engineering giant Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) continues to fall as investors lose faith with its restructuring strategy. It’s down 1.3% and has lost 9% this week.
But there’s brighter news from France, where  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) surged after a strong quarterly update driven by its Universal Music Group unit. Vivendi faces frustration in its struggle for control of  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT), however.

Europe's STOXX 600 managed, barely, to hover flat as gains in telecoms and industrials helped offset the China strain. 
 Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) was another top gainer, up 7.5 percent after a source said Italian state lender CDP has authorisation to increase its stake in the firm to 10 percent within the next 12 months.
Eutelsat on the other hand sank 9.2 percent, the biggest faller on the STOXX, after its first half results. A trader said the company's CEO A talked down the possibility of consolidation in the industry.
Swedish defence firm Saab climbed 6 percent after its fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations and it forecast better margins and sales in 2019.
The European market was already dragged down on Thursday by very weak U.S. retail sales data. It was nonetheless on track for its first weekly gain in four, having hit a three-month high on Wednesday.
M&A also moved some shares.
German internet portal Scout24 surged up 12 percent to the top of the STOXX after it welcomed a higher offer from a private equity consortium of Hellman & Friedman and Blackstone (NYSE:BX).

1090,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 03:22AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Cautions Investors to Prepare for Auto Tariffs,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors should prepare for at least a temporary imposition of auto tariffs before this summer, according to Morgan Stanley.
“Although we expect any auto tariffs would be fleeting, the event would certainly create at least some near-term pressure on economic fundamentals and investor sentiment,” Morgan Stanley's Michael Zezas and Meredith Pickett wrote in a Feb. 13 note, calling it a “low-conviction” view.
While Morgan Stanley expects any tariffs to be rolled back quickly, implementation could happen by the summer, the strategists said.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is expected by Feb. 17 to submit to Trump a report on his investigation assessing how imports of autos and car parts impact U.S. national security. Trump has threatened a tariff of as much as 25 percent and has focused on vehicles from the European Union. The president has pledged to refrain from imposing new levies on cars imported from the EU while the two sides try to reach a broader trade agreement.
In assessing the negative impact of any tariffs, the strategists cited a Center for Automotive Research report from July that said the price of both new and used vehicles would rise, and dealerships would see employment declines and a decrease in revenue.
Goldman Sachs are also warning investors to brace for the possibility of tariffs.
A report recommending them could come as a “slight surprise” to financial markets, economist Alec Phillips wrote in a note Friday. He sees a 40 percent chance of broader auto tariffs “at least temporarily,” in an attempt to obtain greater concessions from the European Union and/or Japan.
On the broader trade issue, Morgan Stanley said it doesn’t expect U.S.-China tariffs to rise on March 2.
“We think the feedback loop between weak markets and a more constructive stance for both sides kicked in during the fourth quarter,” the strategists wrote. “Hence, we see both sides as highly motivated to come to terms.”
While Zezas and Pickett think the debt ceiling is unlikely to have much of a market impact, other policy issues on the horizon which may do so include the attempted approval of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, and rhetoric starting to heat up in the 2020 presidential campaign.
“Our policy outlook continues to support our colleagues’ views on U.S. equities (range-bound and likely to test the lows again this year), credit (remains in a bear market), and rates (lower bias on yields into year-end),” the strategists said."

It also said the introduction of the new IFRS 16 standard would have no bearing on the plans or financial ambitions Tesco detailed in October 2016.
The new standard seeks to align the presentation of leased assets more closely to owned assets.
Tesco said it has no effect on how the business is run, nor on cash flows for the group.
But it does have a significant impact on the way the assets, liabilities and the income statement of the group are presented, as well as the classification of cash flows relating to lease contracts.
The new standard is effective for all accounting periods beginning on or after Jan. 1 2019.
That means Tesco's first reported accounting period under IFRS 16 will be its 2019-20 financial year, which runs from Feb. 24 2019 to Feb. 29 2020.
It said its first half 2018-19 results reported last October, restated for IFRS 16, will be the comparative numbers for Tesco's first published IFRS 16 accounts in October 2019.

Tesco is due to report its full year 2018-18 results on April 10. These results prepared on an IFRS 16 basis will be published shortly after.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's cash-starved residential real estate market is set to get a boost from foreign and domestic private equity firms, which are lining up big bets worth hundreds of millions of dollars for the sector. 
The domestic residential real estate space has been in a rut for years with failed and delayed projects putting buyers off. Developers more recently have been hit by a credit squeeze as banks struggle with bad debts and a crunch in the shadow banking sector. 
Private equity firms are now swooping in to buy assets at attractive valuations, say industry insiders, as regulatory changes and a more dovish monetary policy outlook bode well for the sector. 
""With major impetus being given to affordable housing ... PE investors are sensing a big opportunity in this segment,"" said Anuj Puri, chairman at Anarock, a real estate consultancy firm.
""The expected 8-10 percent annual return in the affordable segment of residential real estate is attracting not just Indian investors but also foreign entities from the U.S., Singapore and Canada.""
Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group, one of the largest owners of commercial real estate in India, this month agreed to buy a majority stake in Aadhar Housing Finance - an affordable housing project, and committed 8 billion rupees ($112 million) of additional equity to the asset.
Piramal Enterprises and Ivanhoe Cambridge, the real estate arm of Canadian fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), last week announced a $70.15 million investment in Palava - a project of Lodha Group on the outskirts of India's financial hub, Mumbai.
Several domestic real estate funds, including HDFC Property Fund and Kotak Realty Fund, are also scouting opportunities in the real estate space, say industry sources aware of the talks. 
And one industry source said that Canadian asset management firm Brookfield Asset Management is exploring roughly half a dozen residential real estate investments and it aims to nearly double its bets in the space to over $1 billion, from $450 million in the coming year.
The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), along with Hines Investments is also poised to announce an investment in the space, a source involved in the deal said.
Brookfield declined to comment, HDFC Property, Kotak Realty, ADIA and Hines were not immediately available for comment.
India PE Deals in Residential Real Estate: https://tmsnrt.rs/2UVxsZm
TIMING IT RIGHT
Rising bad debts and real estate project failures have made banks cautious on lending to developers, leading to a slowdown in the property market that relies heavily on borrowing for both home building and buying.
Developers in the country were typically averse to private equity as it is more expensive funding compared to debt they could raise from banks, or non-bank finance companies (NBFCs).
However, with funding from NBFCs drying up in the aftermath of a string of defaults at lender IL&FS, developers are being forced to explore debt and equity funding from private equity. 
""For the PE players the valuations are probably a lot more attractive today than they were four to five years ago,"" said Anshul Jain, managing director at Cushman and Wakefield India.
""From a risk perspective too, risk is slightly lower as some green-shoots are visible in the segment. PE can see that pricing and sale pricing is at an all-time low, so valuations are at an all-time low, so it's a good time for them to enter.""
The government has also announced several incentives for the real estate sector in the interim budget earlier this month.
""This is a very positive budget from a real estate point of view,"" said Samir Jasuja, managing director of PropEquity, an online real estate data and analytics platform.
The government announced a total tax rebate for individuals with annual income of up to 0.5 million rupees, and offered some tax incentives that would benefit both property developers and potential homebuyers. 
These measures, along with the rate cut by the central bank last week, are expected to give an added push to the segment.

Ng has been detained in Kuala Lumpur since Nov. 1, shortly after the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announced charges against him for allegedly laundering funds siphoned off from the 1MDB sovereign wealth fund. He left Goldman Sachs in 2014.
Ng had agreed to waive extradition and would be sent to the United States pending an order from the Malaysian home affairs ministry, judge Edwin Paramjothy Michael Muniandy said in a Kuala Lumpur court on Friday.
His lawyer, Tan Hock Chuan, asked for the order to be issued within 30 days. It must be issued within three months under Malaysian law.
Ng had reached an agreement with the DoJ on bail and other terms, Tan said.
""The respondent intends to defend the case on its merits in the court of the Eastern District of New York, the United States,"" Tan told the court. 
Marc Agnifilo, Ng's New York-based lawyer, told Reuters ahead of the hearing that his client intended to plead not guilty when he appeared in a U.S. federal court.
Ng is facing separate criminal charges in Malaysia but it is unclear how they will affect his transfer. The attorney-general's office did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Tim Leissner, another Goldman Sachs official, and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho have also been charged in the United States over the alleged theft of billions of dollars from 1MDB. Leissner has pleaded guilty. 
A Goldman Sachs spokesman, asked about Ng, said: ""As we have said all along, we are outraged that any employee of the firm would undertake the actions detailed in the government's charges.""

Goldman Sachs is being investigated by Malaysian authorities and the DoJ for its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1Malaysia Development Berhad.

1095,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2019 12:07AM ET</span>","As Amazon drops New York City project, progressives claim a major coup","By Joseph Ax
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wasted no time on Thursday in calling Amazon's decision to scrap plans to build a major New York outpost with nearly $3 billion in city and state incentives a big victory for progressive politicians.
The democratic socialist congresswoman has become the face of the Democratic Party's ascendant left wing, thanks in part to her upset victory last year in a district near the proposed Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) development.
""Anything is possible: today was the day a group of dedicated, everyday New Yorkers & their neighbors defeated Amazon's corporate greed, its worker exploitation, and the power of the richest man in the world,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter. 
Amazon blamed local opposition for its abrupt reversal, which some saw as the latest evidence of the progressive movement's surging influence ahead of the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination next year.
""They have shown sufficient power to back off the largest corporation in the world,"" Douglas Muzzio, a professor at Baruch College in New York and an expert on city politics and public opinion. ""They killed Amazon, the biggest beast around.""
Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has made anti-corporate criticism a key tenet of her 2020 presidential campaign, called the subsidies ""billions in taxpayer bribes"" and asked on Twitter, ""How long will we allow giant corporations to hold our democracy hostage?""
Amazon had already been a favored target for some left-wing politicians due to its dominance of online shopping and reputation for imposing difficult work conditions on warehouse workers. The company has defended its practices and last year raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour, more than twice the federally mandated level.
But since Amazon announced plans for its so-called HQ2 in 2017 and began soliciting bids from hundreds of U.S. cities, the political environment in both New York and the country has shifted significantly.
Last fall, Democrats swept to victory in the U.S. House of Representatives, buoyed by left-wing energy and animus toward Republican U.S. President Donald Trump. In New York, Democrats took control of the state Senate from Republicans for the first time in a decade.
Democratic leaders in the state Senate then nominated Michael Gianaris, whose district includes the proposed Long Island City Amazon site, to a little-known state board that could have vetoed the project. 
Gianaris, a Democrat, was a vocal critic of the billions in subsidies offered to Amazon despite initially calling on the company to consider New York.
""This was a shakedown, pure and simple,"" Gianaris told reporters on Thursday.
Critics of the deal questioned why the third-most valuable company in the United States – with a chief executive, Jeff Bezos, who ranks as the world's wealthiest man – required that level of public funding, including tax breaks and grant money.
Amazon also faced anti-gentrification sentiment in a city where income inequality and a lack of affordable housing have become major concerns. Some labor leaders opposed the deal unless Amazon agreed not to oppose unionization efforts, a position that the company representatives rejected.
Still, public polling suggested the deal, which Amazon said would eventually create at least 25,000 jobs, was fairly popular among New Yorkers.
Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio, an enthusiastic backer of the project, faced outrage from left-wing activists who questioned how he could defend the subsidies while staying true to his liberal principles.
But he and Governor Andrew Cuomo, a fellow Democrat who spent the last year burnishing his own progressive bona fides while running for another term, had argued that the deal's job creation benefits far outweighed any cost.
In a statement, Cuomo cast blame on a ""small group of politicians"" he accused of putting political interests ahead of their constituents' needs.
De Blasio, by contrast, put the blame on Amazon for refusing to address local concerns.

""We gave Amazon the opportunity to be a good neighbor and do business in the greatest city in the world,"" he said in a statement. ""Instead of working with the community, Amazon threw away that opportunity.""

The opening of the cafe in the city of Shanghai comes as Starbucks has been facing slowing sales growth in its second-largest market amid pressure from a growing number of independent coffee shops and Chinese startups such as Luckin Coffee which offer cheap delivery and big discounts. 
""Today marks yet another significant milestone as we take everything we have learned around coffee and our relentless pursuit for food innovation, to create a new exciting all-day cafe dining and Italian aperitivo experience,"" Starbucks China CEO Belinda Wong said in a statement.
The Starbucks Reserve Bakery Cafe, which opens this weekend, is the firm's first such store in China and will offer its premium coffees, freshly prepared food from its Princi Italian bakery and alcoholic drinks from a ""mixology"" bar"".
The company also has similar cafes in the United States, where it has been pursuing an upscale strategy.
Starbucks has benefited from a growing cafe culture in China but the trend has also given rise to a host of ambitious local competitors, including Luckin Coffee, which has said that it wants to open 2,500 new stores this year and overtake Starbucks as China's largest coffee chain.

Analysts say, however, that there are signs that Starbucks' efforts to improve sales are gaining steam, with quarterly sales in China beating estimates last month, driven by new store openings and a delivery program that it launched with internet giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) last year.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were down 0.6% and 0.3% respectively by 10:00 PM ET (3:00 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.6%.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.5%. Index heavyweights Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and  SK Hynix Inc  (KS:000660) both fell more than 2%.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.3%. Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 edged up 0.2%.
China's Consumer Price Index came in at 1.7% higher than a year ago, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday. That compared to the expected 1.9%.
Meanwhile, producer inflation rose just 0.1% from a year ago, lower than the forecasted 0.2% rise.
Overnight, U.S. stocks closed lower after official data showed the country’s retail sales in December came in far below expectations.
Retail sales fell 1.2% in December, according to The Commerce Department. It was their biggest monthly drop since September 2009.
Renewed uncertainty surrounding the trade tensions between the U.S. and China also weighed on sentiment. Citing three unnamed U.S. and Chinese officials, Bloomberg reported that the two countries have made little progress so far during their discussions in Beijing this week. They have failed to narrow the gap on issues related to structural reforms to China’s economy, according to the report.
The news came one day after U.S. President Donald Trump said the talks were going “very well.” He also said he is open to extend the March 1 deadline to more than double tariffs on $200 billions of Chinese goods if the two sides get closer to a deal.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Thursday. They are expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping later today, according to the South China Morning Post."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - EBay Inc.'s stock price slumped for most of last year but a number of prominent hedge funds were so convinced that change is on the horizon for the e-commerce company that they established new or added to existing positions in the last months of 2018.
Baupost Group, run by Seth Klarman, and BlueMountain Capital both made new investments while Hudson Bay Capital Management and Adage Capital Partners expanded their bets with sizable purchases during the fourth quarter, regulatory filings and data compiled by Symmetric.io show.
Banking giants UBS AG,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which invest for retail and institutional clients, also purchased millions of new shares, the data show.
For these investors, the nearly 30 percent gain in eBay's share price in the first seven weeks of trading this year represents a sizable windfall that was likely fueled by behind-the-scenes moves of two activist hedge funds that also built stakes recently.
Elliott Management, one of Wall Street's busiest and successful activists, said in its regulatory filing that it made a new bet on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in the fourth quarter, listing call options on 8.5 million shares. In January, Jesse Cohn, a partner at Elliott and head of its U.S. Equity Activism, wrote to eBay's board to urge a sale of StubHub ticketing and its classified-ads business, forecasting that doing so could help push the stock price to as high as $63 a share in 2020. It closed at $36.32 on Thursday.
Starboard Value, another prominent hedge fund which has won more board seats through settlements than others, also built a stake and contacted management, people familiar with the move said, even though eBay was not listed on Starboard's filing.
Starboard did not respond to questions about the position.
The 13-F regulatory filings that require fund managers to detail the amount of stock they held in U.S. companies at the end of the previous quarter often do not require filers to disclose derivatives, which means an investor can build a position without its showing up on this filing.
Ebay on Thursday announced a restructuring plan that will unite geographic regions under a global segment and said that a senior executive, Scott Cutler, will leave.
Baupost's 13-F filing shows that it bought 21 million shares of eBay in the fourth quarter, making the company one of eBay's top five U.S. holdings.
To be sure, there were also hedge funds that backed away. Larry Robbins' Glenview Capital Management, which boasted a 17 percent gain in January after losing 16 percent last year, sold 4.4 million eBay shares, cutting its position by 37 percent.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prominent U.S. investor Jeffrey Vinik is promising potential clients a cut in fees and said that it had been tougher to raise money than he initially thought, as he prepares to relaunch Vinik Asset Management after six years on the sidelines.
Vinik, who once ran Fidelity's Magellan mutual fund and then oversaw $10 billion at his own hedge fund, had hoped to raise as much as $3 billion in the hedge fund relaunch. 
But with only a few days to go before his planned March 1 launch, Vinik is both tempering expectations and trying to drum up support quickly so that he has as much cash as possible to put to work.
""We will offer investors a 50-basis point discount on management fees in our 1/30 and 2/20 tranches,"" the fund manager wrote in a letter seen by Reuters.
Raising $3 billion by March 1 was no longer feasible, he wrote, explaining that his ""expectation for the timing of inflows has been too optimistic.""
A spokesman for Vinik declined to comment.
Vinik, 59, said last month that he was returning to investing for clients at a time many rivals are throwing in the towel. He said he missed competing with the world's biggest institutional investors and criticized some of his fellow hedge fund managers for poor performance.
But the sluggish returns have weakened investor appetite for hedge funds. Those who are still tempted to invest are taking more time to carefully research their choices, industry analysts said.
That is a clear change from the heady days of 1996 when Vinik's reputation created such a buzz that he raised $800 million on the first day of the original Vinik Asset Management and closed to new investors immediately.
Vinik said in the letter he understood that he had asked institutional investors to hurry their standard due diligence process and wanted to thank them by offering a ""founder's share class"" for the first $1 billion of outside capital raised. These types of arrangements often offer lower fees in return for early commitments.
Even as he offers his fund at a discount, Vinik said that he was still sure it would grow and be successful.
""We have full confidence in our ability to become a multi-billion dollar long-short equity fund ... and provide our investors with great results,"" he wrote.

1100,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 07:48PM ET</span>",Nvidia full-year sales outlook tops analyst views; shares rise,"By Sonam Rai and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Chip maker Nvidia Corp on Thursday forecast sales for its current fiscal year that topped Wall Street expectations, sending its shares up 8 percent in late trading.
The Santa Clara, California-based company said it expected revenues for its fiscal 2020 year to be ""flat or down slightly"" from the $11.7 billion it recorded in the just-ended fiscal year. The forecast exceeds the $10.8 billion in revenue that analysts expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Fourth-quarter revenues fell for Nvidia, which supplies chips for gaming computers and artificial intelligence work and is coming off record highs early last when demand for its chips for mining crypto currencies sent sales soaring.
The just-ended fiscal year was Nvidia's best ever, with sales up more than 21 percent from a year earlier, but sputtered to what Chief Executive Jensen Huang called a ""disappointing finish.""
Over the course of the fiscal year, demand for chips for mining vanished and a slowdown in China dampened Nvidia sales. 
""But the China economy is in the final analysis a growth economy, so we're looking forward to it recovering,"" Huang said on a conference call with investors. ""And gaming is one of the most important pastimes of their culture.""
Nvidia reported profit for the fiscal fourth-quarter ended Jan. 27 above Wall Street estimates. Its outlook for the 2020 fiscal first quarter missed analyst expectations only slightly and its data center business, where it competes against  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), did not fall as far as analysts had feared. 
""Not-as-bad-as-feared has replaced the better-than-expected for a lot of companies this earnings season,"" analyst Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners said.
Nvidia has entered into newer growth areas such as data centers and self-driving cars as it looks beyond its bread-and-butter business of selling chips that enhance video game graphics. Analysts had been concerned about Nvidia's fast-growing data business because Intel, the biggest supplier of chips used in data centers, last month gave a lower-than-expected sales forecast on slower buying from cloud computing customers, especially in China.
But Nvidia's data center business appeared to be spared from that slowdown, bringing in $679 million in the fourth quarter. That was lower than the year before, but slightly ahead of analyst expectations, according to data from FactSet.
""There was just a level of cautiousness across all of the enterprise customers and the cloud service providers that we've not experienced in a while,"" Huang said on the call. ""It has to be temporary. The computing needs of Earth have certainly not been satisfied with what we shipped last quarter.""
Nvidia has grown at a rapid pace in the past few years, but a slowdown in China and a fading cyrptocurrency craze have started to weigh on its sales. Fourth-quarter total revenue fell to $2.21 billion from $2.91 billion, but came above its already lowered estimate of $2.20 billion. 
The chip designer forecast first-quarter revenue of $2.20 billion, plus or minus 2 percent, for the quarter. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $2.28 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
But while the first-quarter forecast lagged expectations, Nvidia's stronger-than-expected full-year forecast suggests the company is expecting a significant increase in sales in the second half of its fiscal year, said Kinngai Chan of Summit Insights Group. 
The company's net income fell to $567 million, or 92 cents per share, in the fourth-quarter ended Jan. 27, from $1.12 billion, or $1.78 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Nvidia earned 80 cents per share, above analysts' estimates of 75 cents.

Its shares were up 8 percent to $167.40 in late trading, after closing up 1.09 percent at $154.53 in regular trade on Nasdaq.

U.S. District Court Judge Lee Rosenthal issued the default judgment on Wednesday after Rafael Ramirez did not contest Harvest Natural Resources' claims, according to an opinion accompanying the ruling.
James Edmiston, Harvest Natural's former chief executive and director, said on Thursday he was pleased with the order. Whether the shareholders of Harvest will ever receive a payment from Ramirez ""is the $1.4 billion question,"" he said.
Ramirez, in a message to Reuters, said he was not surprised by the order, but declined further comment.
Harvest's suit claimed Venezuela refused to allow the company to sell its assets in the country from 2012, leading it to lose $472 million. It accused Ramirez and others of seeking a $10 million bribe to approve the transaction. 
Rosenthal initially awarded Harvest $472 million in damages in December, an amount he tripled this week.

Ramirez was appointed energy minister by late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, serving in that job until 2014. He later was the country's ambassador to the United Nations, but left after being accused of corruption by Venezuelan officials amid a purge of executives at state oil firm PDVSA.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prominent hedge fund managers sold out of Chinese technology stocks and dumped Silicon Valley majors such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) while global stock markets cratered during the fourth quarter, according to securities filings released on Thursday.
Activist hedge fund Jana Partners sold out of its position in major Chinese e-commerce company  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and reduced its stake in Apple by approximately 175,000 shares, slicing its position in the company by 63 percent.
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc shrank its Apple stake to 249.6 million shares from 252.5 million shares in the fourth quarter. Buffett's assistant Debbie Bosanek said in an email to Reuters: ""One of the managers other than Warren had a position in Apple and sold part of it in order to make an unrelated purchase. None of the shares under Warren's direction have ever been sold.""
Soros Fund Management and David Tepper's Appaloosa Management sold out of their stakes in Apple.
Third Point LLC sold all of its shares of Alibaba and in streaming company Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), while reducing its stake in payments company  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) by approximately 200,000 shares, or about 11 percent of its prior position. 
Omega Advisors, run by billionaire Leon Cooperman, sold all of its approximately 88,000 shares of Facebook and reduced its stake in Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc by approximately a third by selling approximately 47,600 shares.
The moves came during a volatile fourth quarter in which fears of slowing economic growth pushed the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index to the brink of a bear market while stock indexes in China and Germany finished the year down 20 percent or more. 
Since then, shares have rebounded sharply on a broad global rally powered by hopes of a new trade deal between the United States and China and the Federal Reserve's decision to slow its pace of U.S. interest rate hikes. 
Alibaba is up nearly 23 percent since the start of January, while Netflix is up nearly 34 percent over the same time. Those gains helped power the average hedge fund in January to the largest monthly gain since September 2010, according to Hedge Fund Research.
""While investor optimism dominated in January, significant macroeconomic uncertainty still exists, increasing the likelihood that recent trends toward elevated realized volatility will remain and continue to drive industry performance,"" said Kenneth J. Heinz, president of HFR.
Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers' stock holdings in 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are one of the few public ways of tracking what hedge fund managers are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures are made 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions.
Along with the sell-off among technology stocks, hedge fund managers added new positions in companies ranging from Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) to Salesforce.Com Inc.
Jana Partners added a new position in Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) by buying approximately 115,000 shares, while Third Point increased its stake in the company by 135 percent by adding another 675,000 shares. Shares of the company are up 16.6 percent since the start of the year. 

Tiger Global added a new position in information technology infrastructure management company Solarwinds Corp. Shares of the $5.7 billion market cap company are up 35 percent for the year. Omega Advisors, meanwhile, doubled its stake in CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) by buying approximately 401,000 shares. Shares of the company are up 3.7 percent for the year to date.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Drilling curbs by oil producers in the largest U.S. shale field will continue until transport bottlenecks ease and investors stop punishing companies for increasing capital spending, executives at an energy conference said on Thursday.
The price of crude in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico fell sharply last year, selling as much as $18 below U.S. benchmark prices, as a lack of pipeline capacity landlocked some oil output and as investors pushed producers to reduce spending and boost shareholder returns.
On Thursday, the regional price of crude was at a $1.10 a barrel premium to U.S. crude futures, the strongest in more than a year as companies including Parsley Energy,  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD), Goodrich Petroleum Corp have pared their exploration budgets, easing the constraints. 
Pioneer Natural Resources Co, one of the Permian's largest producers, said this week it plans to reduce 2019 capital expenditures by 11 percent, or about $350 million, slowing its production growth from prior years.
""There aren't nearly as many drilling dollars available,"" said Bobby Whiteside, president of Midland, Texas-based oil producer Regions Permian LLC. ""If Wall Street wants you to drill within cash flow, you're going to have slower growth.""
The Permian is the nation's largest and fastest growing oil field. Its output has driven U.S. crude production to near 12 million barrels per day (bpd), forcing OPEC and allies to cut their output.
Oil and gas officials interviewed at the Houston conference say the recent shale cutbacks will remain until three proposed pipelines from West Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast come online over the next 18 months. 
Executives said the recent strengthening of regional crude prices suggest that producers can expect oil sold at Midland, Texas, to slip from the current premium to a $1 to $3 per barrel discount to U.S. benchmark crude in the second quarter. 
""I don't think you'll see a big differential again unless they grow production over capacity,"" said Jacob Daniels, an employee of Texas oil producer Chisholm Energy, which drills in the Permian.
""We're about at breakeven now, and that has really helped us,"" added Brett Bracken, an exploration manager at Permian oil producer Ares Energy Ltd.
The U.S. oil industry could easily meet the U.S. Energy Information Administration's oil-production forecasts over the next two years if Wall Street still rewarded production growth over returns, said Allen Gilmer, founder of market intelligence provider DrillingInfo.

""But with investors insisting on free cash flow and dividends, maybe we won't,"" Gilmer said. ""These guys have amazing assets but their stock prices haven't benefited at all from growing reserves or production.""

""As a result, we have set a new target of 25 million domestic subs combined from both of these direct-to-consumer services by 2022.""
The New York-based company's results come nearly a month after former Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves, who led opposition of a merger, challenged the company's decision to deprive him of $120 million in severance pay after he resigned amid a wave of allegations of sexual assault and harassment.
While media majors Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) are tapping into their extensive film and TV libraries to launch streaming rivals to Netflix Inc and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's Prime video, smaller players CBS and sister company Viacom Inc are focused on providing original content to other distributors.
In late January, CBS board members were briefed by bankers who presented various scenarios for the company that included mergers and options to remain independent, sources have said, who added that no decisions were made. The exact scenarios are not yet known.
The company is also moving ahead with looking for a permanent chief executive, these sources said. 
On Feb. 11 CBS shareholders filed an amended complaint to their class-action lawsuit, alleging that Moonves and three other CBS executives inappropriately sold stock ahead of negative reports about Moonves. 
In a statement CBS said: “The vast majority of sales mentioned in this complaint were made as part of pre-planned selling arrangements designed to comply with applicable securities laws. The remaining sales were subject to CBS’ customary pre-clearance policies and procedures and were properly disclosed.” 
Both CBS and Viacom, controlled by National Amusements, are expected to rekindle merger talks in the coming months after attempts to combine the two fell apart last year.
CBS said advertising revenue during the reported quarter rose 7.3 percent to $1.87 billion. 
CBS Chief Financial Officer Christina Spade said that in the first half of the year, the company will allocate 100 percent of its cash to invest in the business and improve financial flexibility. In the second half of the year, Spade said, it will be opportunistic in buying back stock. 
The company said affiliate and subscription fee revenue, which includes income from cable, satellite and streaming TV providers as well as its own All Access offering, rose to $1.03 billion from $923 million a year before.
Net income from continuing operations rose to $561 million, or $1.49 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $40 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier. 
The company recorded a $129 million charge related to the changes in the U.S. tax law last year.

CBS said total revenue rose 2.6 percent to $4.02 billion, below estimates of $4.13 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc said it has trimmed its stake in iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), though none of the selling was Buffett's, and added positions in Canada's Suncor Energy Inc and software company Red Hat Inc (NYSE:RHT).
Berkshire also appeared to have shed a $2.13 billion stake in database software company  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) after having first disclosed it in November. It is rare for Berkshire, which owns some stocks for decades, to unwind an investment so fast. 
The changes were disclosed in a Thursday regulatory filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed stock portfolio as of Dec. 31, which shrank $38 billion in the quarter to $183.1 billion amid a broad selloff in stocks.
A recent change in accounting rules means that decline will likely punish Berkshire's reported net income, though not operating profit, when the Omaha, Nebraska-based company reports fourth-quarter and year-end results, expected on Feb. 23.
Thursday's filing includes investments by Buffett and his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, but does not say who bought and sold what.
Berkshire said in the filing that its Apple stake shrank to 249.6 million shares in the quarter from 252.5 million, reducing its reported stake to below $40 billion as Apple's share price slid 30 percent.
Buffett, though, had nothing to do with the selling.
""One of the managers other than Warren had a position in Apple and sold part of it in order to make an unrelated purchase,"" Buffett's assistant Debbie Bosanek said in an email. ""None of the shares under Warren's direction have ever been sold.""
Investors monitor Berkshire's quarterly filings for signs about where Buffett, Combs and Weschler see value.
Stock prices often move higher or lower when Berkshire discloses new stakes, or sheds old ones.
Suncor shares rose 4 percent after Berkshire reentered the stock, which it last owned in the third quarter of 2016, owning 10.76 million shares worth $300.9 million.
Shares of Red Hat rose 0.3 percent after Berkshire said it owned 4.18 million shares worth $733.4 million.
Oracle shares fell 1.3 percent.
Suncor, Red Hat, Oracle and Berkshire did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial, railroad and other sectors, and often buys stocks when buying whole companies appears too expensive. Its last major acquisition was in January 2016. 
Most other changes in Berkshire's stock portfolio were relatively smaller, though it boosted its stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) 41 percent to 50.1 million shares, worth $4.9 billion.
Combs is a director at JPMorgan, which is working with Berkshire and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) to create a new company aiming to cut employee healthcare costs. 

Berkshire also confirmed its new, $261 million stake in StoneCo Ltd, a Brazilian credit card processor that went public in October.

(Reuters) - Motorists swam for their lives and residents were rescued from homes sliding downhill as the wettest winter storm of the year triggered floods and mudslides across California on Thursday.
In Sausalito, just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, a mudslide carried away two homes and engulfed five cars, sending one woman to the hospital, Southern (NYSE:SO) Marin Fire Department tweeted. Dozens of homes were evacuated in the area. 
In Cabazon, about 84 miles (135 km) east of Los Angeles, two motorists swam from their vehicle and were rescued by helicopter after their car was engulfed by churning brown floodwaters, a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman said.
""We've had multiple water rescues throughout the day, I think today our helicopter is up to about a dozen,"" said CalFire spokesman Richard Cordova. ""We haven't seen rain like this in 10 years.""
Three Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) passengers suffered minor injuries when severe turbulence shook a flight headed from southern California to Seattle on Wednesday, according to authorities.
The moisture-rich tropical storm, known as an atmospheric river, has lashed Northern California with rain and snow since late Tuesday. The moisture flow, nicknamed the ""Pineapple Express"" for its origin near Hawaii, unleashed its full force overnight.
Power lines, trees and car-sized boulders littered roads in San Diego County and flash flood warnings were in place after regions like Palomar Mountain got nearly 10 inches (25 cm) of rain, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).
WILDFIRE AREAS AT RISK
To the north, Venado, a town near San Francisco famed for its rainfall, got more than one foot of precipitation over 48 hours.
Areas particularly at risk were those that suffered deadly wildfires in the last two years, leaving scorched hillsides devoid of vegetation and prone to collapse. 
Residents in Northern California’s Butte County - where the Camp fire killed 86 people and destroyed nearly 19,000 structures last year - were told to leave their homes over concerns a creek could overflow and flood communities.
Hundreds of people in Lake Elsinore, 56 miles east of Los Angeles, got mandatory evacuation orders on fears hillsides scorched by the 2018 Holy Fire could turn into debris flows.
To the north Redding, the town devastated by the Carr Fire in 2018, was hit with around 14 inches of snow that shut down Interstate 5 south of the Oregon border and knocked out power to thousands of customers.

A couple more feet of snow were expected to fall in the Sierra Nevada Moutains of northern California through Friday, said NWS meteorologist Hannah Chandler-Cooley in Sacramento.

The newspaper said that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Facebook had not agreed on an amount, citing two people it said were familiar with the matter. Facebook reported fourth-quarter revenue of $16.9 billion and profit of $6.9 billion.
The FTC has been investigating revelations that Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million of its users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. 
The probe has focused on whether the sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica and other privacy disputes violated a 2011 agreement with the FTC to safeguard users' privacy. 
An eventual settlement may also mandate changes in how Facebook does business.
Facebook declined to comment directly on the Washington Post report. ""We have been working with the FTC and will continue to work with the FTC,"" a spokeswoman said.
The FTC declined comment.
The biggest FTC fine for a privacy lapse was $22.5 million levied on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google in 2012. The agency has had bigger settlements on other issues.

The FTC settled with pharmaceutical company Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) in 2015 for $1.2 billion to resolve antitrust violations committed by Cephalon, which it had acquired.

1110,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 06:16PM ET</span>",Trump to get U.S. Commerce Department recommendation on auto tariffs,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department is set to meet a Sunday deadline to deliver its recommendations to President Donald Trump on whether imported vehicles and parts pose a national security risk and to outline options on how to address the issue, officials said Thursday.
Trump is expected to initially keep the department's recommendation secret as he focuses on China and other pressing trade issues. He may not disclose details until he decides on whether to impose tariffs, a decision automakers believe could take weeks or months.
Last May, Trump said he was considering tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported vehicles. Automakers and foreign governments opposed the idea.
In June, Trump said the Commerce investigation about whether vehicle imports pose a national security risk would be done by the end of July. In November, Trump again threatened to impose tariffs after General Motors announced thousands of job cuts.
But in the face of strong opposition from Congress and automakers, Trump has moved slowly on the issue.
Major automakers said last year that tariffs of 25 percent on imported cars and parts would raise the price of U.S. vehicles by $83 billion annually and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.
They argued there is no evidence auto imports pose a national security risk. Canada and Mexico each won duty-free access to 2.6 million vehicles as part of a new North American free trade deal even if the administration moves ahead with the tariffs.
Administration officials have said tariff threats were a way to win concessions from Japan and the European Union at the bargaining table. Last year, Trump agreed not to impose tariffs as long as talks were proceeding in a productive manner.
Several Republican senators oppose tariffs. Some back legislation to restrict presidential authority to impose tariffs on national security grounds.
Senator Charles Grassley, a Republican who chairs the Finance Committee, said Thursday new auto tariffs would damage the U.S. economy. ""Raising tariffs on cars and parts would be a huge tax on consumers who buy or service their cars, whether they are imported or domestically produced,"" he said.
Trump has urged the EU to drop its 10 percent tariff on imported vehicles. The U.S. passenger car tariff is 2.5 percent, while it imposes 25 percent tariffs on pickup trucks.

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, whose members include General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG, Toyota Motor Corp, has warned tariffs would boost imported car prices nearly $6,000 on average.

1111,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 06:14PM ET</span>","Feeling unwelcome, Amazon ditches plans for New York hub","By Jonathan Allen and David Shepardson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) abruptly scrapped plans to build a major outpost in New York that could have created 25,000 jobs, blaming opposition from local leaders upset by the nearly $3 billion in incentives promised by state and city politicians.
The company said on Thursday it did not see consistently ""positive, collaborative"" relationships with state and local officials. Opponents of the project feared congestion and higher rents in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, and objected to handing billions in incentives to a company run by Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man.
State Senator Michael Gianaris, who represents Queens and was a vocal critic of the deal, told a news conference on Thursday that the Amazon subsidies were unnecessary.
""This was a shakedown, pure and simple,"" he said. 
Amazon's sudden pullout from New York City prompted finger pointing by Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo, the politicians who crafted the deal. Cuomo angrily blamed the loss on local politicians while de Blasio blamed Amazon.
Cuomo said in a statement that a small group of politicians had ""put their own narrow political interests"" above those of New Yorkers.
The year-long search for its so-called HQ2 culminated in Amazon picking Northern Virginia and New York after hundreds of municipalities, from Newark, N.J. to Indianapolis competed for the coveted tax-dollars and high-wage jobs the project promised.
Amazon said it would not conduct a new headquarters search and would focus on growing at other existing and planned offices. The company already has more than 5,000 employees in New York City and plans to continue to hire there, Amazon said on Thursday.
A Siena College Poll conducted earlier this month found 56 percent of registered voters in New York supported the Amazon deal, while 36 percent opposed it.
CITY SHAKEDOWN?
Some New Yorkers mounted protests after the deal was announced, angered by the $2.8 billion in incentives promised to Amazon and fearing further gentrification in a neighborhood once favored by artists looking for cheap studio space. 
U.S. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a critic of the project and a self-described democratic socialist whose district spans parts of Queens and the Bronx, cheered the reversal by the world's third most valuable public company. 
""Anything is possible: today was the day a group of dedicated, everyday New Yorkers & their neighbors defeated Amazon’s corporate greed, its worker exploitation, and the power of the richest man in the world,"" she wrote on Twitter.
People briefed on the decision said Amazon had made the decision early on Thursday amid rising concerns about the small vocal minority. The people said Amazon will not shift any of the planned jobs to Tennessee where an operations hub is planned or Virginia, but plans to grow its existing network of locations. 
Amazon had not acquired land for the project, making it easy to scrap its plans, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters on Friday.
LOST OPPORTUNITY? 
In a statement, de Blasio blamed Amazon for failing to address local criticism.
""We gave Amazon the opportunity to be a good neighbor and do business in the greatest city in the world,"" he said. ""Instead of working with the community, Amazon threw away that opportunity."" 
Some long-time residents in Long Island City, which sits across the East River from midtown Manhattan's skyscrapers, feared being forced out by rising rents and untenable pressure on already overburdened subway and sewage systems. High-rise towers have sprouted across the neighborhood in recent years.
""This is a stunning development, with Amazon essentially giving in to vocal critics,"" said Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. The about-turn could spook other companies thinking about expanding in New York, he added. 
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google has avoided competitions between cities for offices, and its growing presence in lower Manhattan has met with little serious blowback. 
Google said in December it plans to invest more than $1 billion on a new campus in New York to double its current headcount of more than 7,000 people.
""I think the (Amazon) PR event turned out to be a mistake,"" said Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at the Roosevelt Investment Group, who owns Amazon shares.
Shares of Amazon fell 1 percent. 
'REALLY GOOD POKER PLAYERS'
Hours before the announcement, Amazon officials in New York betrayed no knowledge of the deal's cancellation when they met with local community members on Thursday morning, said Kenny Greenberg, a neon artist and member of Long Island City's community board.
""Either they are really good poker players or they were not aware,"" Greenberg said of the Amazon representatives. ""There was no hint of this at all."" 
The meeting with Amazon officials had been held to answer concerns from the community about labor conditions for Amazon's warehouse and delivery workers and the company's opposition to labor unions.
U.S. Representative Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat whose district includes the proposed site, lamented the loss of jobs and new revenues.

""This is not the Valentine that NY needed,"" she wrote, adding that she had been ready to push for changes to the deal to address local concerns.

Analyst are looking for Pepsi to report a profit of $1.49 per share on sales of about $19.5 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
As usual, focus will be more on its global snack business rather than its namesake cola. Investors will also be interested to see the performance and direction of new CEO Ramon Laguarta.
Pepsi was initiated with a neutral rating and a $123 price target by UBS in December.
Farm equipment maker Deere (NYSE:DE) will also weigh in ahead of trading.

Money market funds based in the United States have taken in nearly $29 billion so far in 2019 after pulling in nearly $209 billion during the last half of 2018, Lipper said. The research service's latest data covered the seven days through Feb. 13.
Investors have favored these low-risk alternatives to bank accounts due to recent stock market volatility and relatively attractive yields, analysts said.
The Federal Reserve has raised rates from historic low levels in recent years, helping returns on low-risk financial assets.
The growth in money market fund assets has enticed companies to issue more commercial paper purchased by some of those funds as a source of cash, resulting in lower borrowing costs for banks and Wall Street.
Precious metals commodities funds, which invest in gold and are sometimes seen as an alternative to cash in periods of turmoil or high inflation, recorded $414 million in withdrawals during the week. That was the most cash pulled from those funds since September.
Funds based in the United States but invested primarily in Chinese stocks recorded $31 million in withdrawals during their first week of withdrawals of the year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller bet against electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc during the fourth quarter, wagering that its share price will fall, according to quarterly filings released on Thursday.
Druckenmiller's family fund, named after the hedge fund Duquesne Capital that he founded in 1981, bought put options on Tesla shares worth $99.8 million, a Security and Exchange Commission filing revealed. 
The option contract allows the fund to sell the shares at a set price before a set time, implying Druckenmiller believes Tesla's share price will fall before the contract expires. Neither the strike price nor the maturity of the contract is public. 
Tesla's shares have fallen 6.61 percent since the start of the year after a volatile 2018 in which its price vacillated around $134. 
Tesla has $920 million in convertible debt coming due on March 1, which is expected to put pressure on the company, which has previously struggled to maintain a positive cash flow. 
Convertible issues give bondholders the right to trade their debt for equity after shares rise over a certain price. Tesla shares are currently more than $50 below the $359.87 conversion price after closing on Thursday at $303.77.

Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers' stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are one of the few public ways of tracking what the managers are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures come 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co scrapped plans for a 12-story headquarters office tower on Boston's waterfront on Thursday, choosing instead to lease smaller buildings nearby and return $87 million in incentives to the state of Massachusetts.
The move is another side-effect of the 127-year-old company's decision last year to break up and sell major businesses since it will no longer need the 800-person campus it envisioned. 
GE's headquarters now will have about 250 employees in two brick buildings that once housed the Necco Wafer candy company. GE will lease the buildings, about 95,000 sq feet, after selling them and adjacent land for the tower jointly with the state to recoup the incentive money.
GE will ""fully reimburse the Commonwealth"" for the cost of its project, Lizzie Guyton, communications for Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, said in a statement after the state development board approved the plan on Thursday. 
GE said last year it will pare down making power plants, jet engines and renewable energy systems. In August 2017 GE said it was delaying the office tower. It announced plans to move to Boston from Fairfield, Connecticut, in 2016, and its current headquarters are nearby.
""We are looking forward to moving into our permanent headquarters space in the refurbished Necco brick buildings later this year,"" GE said in a statement.
""While changes in the company's portfolio and operating model will lead to a smaller corporate headquarters, we are fully committed to Boston and proud to call it home.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow slipped while the Nasdaq posted a slim gain on Thursday as investors struggled to square grim retail sales data with hopes that high-level talks in Beijing could resolve the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute.
Paring earlier losses, the S&P 500 held above its 200-day moving average, a key technical level, for the third straight session.
All three major U.S. stock indexes were held back by rate-sensitive financial stocks as U.S. Treasury yields fell on the weaker-than-expected economic data. 
Talks to defuse the ongoing tariff dispute between the world's two largest economies moved to a higher level as U.S.-China negotiations progressed in Beijing ahead of the March 1 deadline. 
But trade optimism was undercut by a report from the U.S. Commerce Department showing retail sales in December suffered their biggest drop in more than nine years, stoking fears of an economic slowdown. 
""The market has been climbing this wall of worry since Christmas,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""Some of that worry might turn into reality, and that's what's holding investors back.""
""I wouldn't say there's a lot of conviction out there,"" Ghriskey added. 
With the fourth-quarter reporting season now more than three-fourths complete, analysts now see earnings growth of 16.2 percent for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data. 
But first-quarter estimates are less favorable. They show a 0.3 percent year-on-year decline, which would mark the first quarter of negative growth since the earnings recession that ended in 2016. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 103.88 points, or 0.41 percent, to 25,439.39, the S&P 500 lost 7.3 points, or 0.27 percent, to 2,745.73 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.58 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,426.96.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, 6 closed in negative territory, with consumer staples and financials showing the biggest percentage declines.
Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) rose 1.9 percent on the heels of a better-than-expected earnings report as the network gear maker benefited from strength in newer businesses and shrugged off the impact of the U.S.-China trade war.
Shares of American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) slid 9.0 percent, marking its worst day in four years after the global insurer posted a quarterly loss.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co shares fizzled, dropping 8.4 percent and providing the biggest drag on the Dow after its full-year profit forecast fell well below Wall Street expectations.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) dipped 1.1 percent after pulling the plug on its planned headquarters in New York due to local opposition. 
Canada Goose's quarterly results and profit forecasts beat analyst expectations, but said higher labor costs and expansion investments hit profit margins. The luxury coat maker's U.S.-listed shares sank 12.9 percent.
 Avon Products  Inc (NYSE:AVP) plunged 11.0 percent after the multi-level marketing cosmetics brand missed quarterly revenue estimates.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 26 new lows.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's new government is trying to slash the cost of sending cash home for Mexican families living abroad and is hoping competition from fintechs will encourage banks and services like Western Union to reduce commissions and improve exchange rates.
Deputy Finance Minister Arturo Herrera said the government did not plan to place new regulations on the flow of remittances, one of the country's largest sources of foreign currency and a lifeline for millions of poor families.
However, the former World Bank executive envisaged that the increasing use of money transfer apps would help bring down the cost of sending remittances. Currently, the commission charged and the foreign exchange rates imposed together take a bite out of each remittance of 8 percent on average. Herrera said that should be brought down to 5 percent. 
""That is to say, the cost of transactions must come down by about 40 percent. That is something the fintechs are probably in a better position to do than traditional actors such as banks,"" Herrera told Reuters in an interview earlier this week. ""Their great advantage is that they can operate in a more efficient and direct way and at lower costs, which should lead to lower commissions.""
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, has made fighting poverty and inequality a centerpiece of his administration. Herrera said bringing down the cost for financial services like remittances would help many of the nation's neediest.
Banking costs are a sensitive issue in Mexico. When Lopez Obrador's ruling MORENA party introduced a bill last year to limit banking fees it triggered a selloff in the stock market. Lopez Obrador distanced himself from the bill.
Other changes were better received, with credit ratings agency Fitch saying a bill introduced by Lopez Obrador to loosen restrictions on pension fund managers could lead to better returns and payouts for beneficiaries.
Lopez Obrador has also tried to calm investors' nerves by saying there would be no modifications to the legal framework relating to economic, financial and fiscal matters in the first three years of his tenure. 
The government says 24 million Mexicans live in the United States, by far the largest source of money sent home. Mexicans sent a record $33.5 billion in remittances in 2018, a 10.5 percent jump from a year earlier, Mexican central bank data shows. 
Mexico is already home to 75 startups that specialize in payments and remittances, data from fintech platform Finnovista, shows, while remittance apps like Remitly and Xoom have been gaining popularity.
Herrera said banks and Western Union would have to make their services cheaper to compete with money transfer apps. He did not say how quickly that would happen.
""I wish we could make it happen immediately,"" he said. 
Western Union and its closest rival Moneygram did not respond to requests for comment. The Mexican Banking Association declined to comment on the topic.
Turning to fintechs for change is part of a broader strategy aimed at decreasing the use of the cash in Mexico, Herrera said. He said the Finance Ministry planned to reveal additional measures at the annual Banking Convention in March. 

Ninety percent of transactions in Mexico are made in cash, in a system that he said is inefficient and expensive and creates ample opportunities for corruption and money laundering.

1119,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Ends Mixed as Techs Show Strength,"Investing.com - Stocks finished mixed on Thursday as tech stocks gained and the broader market was pushed and pulled by weak economic data and the prospect of the U.S. government avoiding another shutdown.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.41%, the S&P 500 lost 0.27%, but closed well above session lows of 2,731.23, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.09%.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said President Donald Trump will sign the government funding bill that would avoid a shutdown, but will use other executive measures, including declaring a national emergency, to build a border wall.
""The (p)resident is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country,"" Sanders said in a statement released during late trading.
The border security deal is expected to win approval in the Senate, after which it will make way to Trump's desk for his signature, averting a second partial government shutdown.
The reaction in the broader market was fairly muted, however.
A rise in tech stocks led by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) helped the Nasdaq recover from broader weakness following data showing U.S. retail sales suffered their biggest drop since 2009.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ended the day higher, but Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) closed just below the flatline.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was also in the spotlight after it scrapped plans to build a second HQ in New York amid recent backlash from local residents and politicians. Its shares fell 1%.
Investor optimism on the U.S. and China agreeing a trade deal before the March 1 deadline continued, even as chief White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow downplayed reports of an extension.
""I can't speak to that. No such decision has been made so far,"" Kudlow told Fox News Channel when asked if there would be a 60-day extension.
In a sign of confidence on talks, Kudlow said ""the vibe in Beijing is good"" and confirmed the U.S. trade team would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, served up modest gains, rising just 0.15%, thanks to a 1% rise in U.S. oil prices.
On the earnings front, Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) fell sharply after Wells Fargo warned the retailer's valuation was frothy even as it delivered blowout fiscal-third quarter earnings that topped estimates from Investing.com. Its shares fell 12.7% after rising more than 10% in premarket trading.
""While we remain confident on the trajectory of the GOOS brand and the fundamental story that has developed since their IPO in 2017, we feel the risk/reward today is not as compelling as it once was (when shares were cheaper and upside to numbers seemed easier to come by),"" analysts wrote in a note.

Nvidia has grown at a rapid pace in the past few years, but a slowdown in China and a fading cyrptocurrency craze have started to weigh on its operations.

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 04:21PM ET</span>","Charlie Munger targets active managers, Elon Musk; praises China","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Charlie Munger, the longtime business partner of Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, on Thursday criticized active fund managers, bankers and even Elon Musk as he urged investors to court simplicity and temper expectations for future returns.
Munger, 95, often provoked laughter as he fielded questions at the annual meeting of Daily Journal Corp, the Los Angeles newspaper publishing company he chairs, though he is better known for his four decades as a Berkshire vice chairman.
Berkshire now owns more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, railroad and other sectors, along with dozens of stocks. Many critics have said its girth has made it tougher for the Omaha, Nebraska-based company and its stock to outperform.
Munger said that is also true in the stock market, where the average professional stock picker does not outperform lower-cost funds that track indexes such as the Standard & Poor's 500.
""For another considerable period, index investing is going to do better than active stock picking,"" Munger said at the meeting, which was webcast by CNBC.
Berkshire has performed better than average because ""we've tried to do less,"" Munger said, though he expects even its stocks holdings will not return a blowout performance.
""Warren thinks that Berkshire can do a little better than the S&P from this point. I don't think many people can, but he may be right about himself and the team he has,"" Munger said, alluding to portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. ""It won't be by huge margins, that I confidently predict.""
Munger offered repeated endorsements of investing in China, saying the country offers more opportunities than the United States, including BYD Co, a Berkshire investment he said will become ""much more huge"" in electric cars.
He also endorsed hedge fund manager Li Lu, the founder of Himalaya Capital Investors. Munger said he is the only outside manager he has given money to, calling him ""the Chinese Warren Buffett"" and that ""he's hit it out of the park.""
In criticizing banks, Munger said they still ""present temptations to their managers to do dumb things,"" and that stupidity can still creep into the industry.
Munger did not single out individual banks for criticism. One of Berkshire's largest investments is  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, which has faced many scandals over its treatment of customers.
Musk, the chief executive of electric car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, became a target when Munger was asked about his own oft-stated preference to hire someone with a 130 IQ who thinks it is 120, instead of someone with a 150 IQ who thinks it is 170.
""You must be thinking about Elon Musk,"" Munger said, prompting raucous laughter.
Tesla declined to comment.
Munger also made many direct and oblique references to age, including when answering a question about investment performance in current markets.

Investors ""have to accept less,"" he said, ""just as an old man has to expect less of his sex life than when he was 20.""

(Reuters) - U.S. discount retailer Payless ShoeSource Inc plans to close all of its approximately 2,300 stores when it files for bankruptcy later this month for the second time in as many years, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The move would make Payless one of the most high-profile victims of the string of bankruptcies that have hit the brick-and-mortar retail sector as more shopping is done online. Toys ""R"" Us and The Bon-Ton Stores are among the retailers that shut their stores in liquidations in the last 12 months.
Payless had been trying unsuccessfully to find a buyer. After no such deal could be clinched, the Topeka, Kansas-based company has decided to initiate preparations to liquidate, the sources said. 
There is still a small chance a buyer could emerge after Payless files for bankruptcy, the sources said. In the meantime, the company is preparing to run going-out-of-business sales at its shops in the next week, one of the sources said.
The sources asked not to be identified because the liquidation preparations are confidential. Payless declined to comment.

Payless filed bankruptcy once before in April 2017, and exited 18 months ago, with about $400 million in loans, after slashing its debt pile from over $800 million, according to court papers. A group of creditors, including hedge fund Alden Global Capital LLC, took over ownership, according to bankruptcy court records.

1128,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 04:05PM ET</span>","Fannie, Freddie to pay U.S. Treasury $4.7 billion in dividends by March","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac said on Thursday they will pay a combined $4.7 billion in dividends to the U.S. Treasury Department by March as the housing finance agencies posted stronger annual 2018 net incomes than a year earlier. 
In September 2008, the government took control of the two government-sponsored enterprises in a $187 billion bailout during the global credit crisis after they were exposed to soured subprime mortgages. The two agencies have handed over their profits to the U.S. Treasury under the terms of the conservatorship.
Fannie and Freddie make money by charging fees to guarantee home loans made by banks and other lenders. They also earn income from investing in mortgages and related securities.
Fannie and Freddie's net results rebounded in 2018 after hefty writedowns on their tax-deferred assets as a result of the dramatic rewrite of the federal tax code enacted in December 2017. Lower corporate tax rates from the tax overhaul also helped their bottom line, they said.
On the other hand, the two agencies faced two major headwinds last year: a housing sector slowed by higher mortgage rates and tight inventories, and financial market turbulence in late 2018 due to investor worries about faltering global growth and the trade conflict between China and the United States.
Fannie, the larger of the two GSEs, reported net annual income of $16 billion in 2018, five times the $3.2 billion posted in 2017.
The company, headquartered in Washington, said it will send $3.2 billion in dividends to the Treasury by March 31.
Freddie said its net income was $9.24 billion, up from $5.63 billon in 2017.
The McLean, Virginia-based company said it will pay $1.5 billion in dividends to the Treasury by the end of next month.
Fannie and Freddie's futures look somewhat uncertain as their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, awaits a permanent chief.
Mark Caldaria, who is currently the chief economist of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, testified before the Senate Banking Committee earlier on Thursday in a confirmation hearing to succeed acting FHFB director Joseph Otting.
Caldaria had criticized the role of GSEs when he was at the Cato Institute. 
White House officials have hinted about overhauling Fannie and Freddie including a possible end to their conservatorship.

1129,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 04:00PM ET</span>",Airbus A380 production halt to fuel transatlantic trade spat,"TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus's decision to shut production of the A380 looks set to reignite a translatlantic trade row over mutual claims of illegal aircraft subsidies, even as Airbus implements a two-year plan to stop making the world's largest airliner.
The planemaker announced the shutdown on Thursday due to weak sales, eliminating a model at the heart of a record trade dispute between the European Union and United States over government support for Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA).
After 15 years and thousands of pages of arguments, the two sides are locked in arbitration proceedings at the Geneva-based World Trade Organization to determine the amount of harm each has caused through support, a possible precursor to sanctions.
The WTO’s appeals body last year said the EU had failed to remove subsidized government development loans for the world’s largest airliner, the A380, and Europe’s newest long-haul jet, the A350, causing losses for Boeing and U.S. workers.
Now, the EU is preparing to argue to the WTO that A380 subsidies no longer exist because the aircraft is being taken off the market, said a European source familiar with the case.
It will argue that the A380 part of the case should be halted because it will not be built after 2021, citing an earlier decision to drop charges on the now defunct A340, two European sources said.
The United States argues that subsidies paid to the A380 in the form of government loans have irreparably caused lost sales to Boeing and that this should be remedied through sanctions.
Airbus and Boeing declined to comment. 
Last year's appeals ruling was part of a two-way battle between the EU and the United States over aircraft subsidies that could spark tit-for-tat reprisals between the two trade superpowers.
The Trump administration last year said the United States would slap countermeasures on European goods unless the EU stopped ""harming U.S. interests"". WTO rules allow it to target any industry since all goods fall into one category. 
Boeing has predicted such tariffs could reach billions of dollars a year starting as early as 2019.
The EU has highlighted wins in a parallel case against U.S. subsidies for Boeing, and Airbus says this could in turn spark EU sanctions against the United States.
Airbus said on Thursday it would no longer need to repay state loans on the A380 because governments had agreed to share some risk in the roughly 15-billion-euro project. 
It is estimated to have 1 billion euros in remaining unpaid government loans tied to the A380.

The United States has consistently called on Airbus to forego the European loans or pay them back at market rates.

Shares of Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) fell nearly 12%.
The apparel maker reported fiscal third-quarter earnings of C$0.96 a share on revenue of C$399.3 million, beating estimates compiled by Investing.com for earnings of C$0.61 on revenue of C$269.86 million.
The strong results, which sent shares up premarket, seemingly played second fiddle to signs U.S. consumers may be starting to tighten their belts after retail sales dropped by the most in nine years.
Department-store sales were of particular concern, dropping 3.3% in December, the most since January 2016.
The United States accounts for roughly a third of Canada Goose's total revenue.
Some also pointed to the company's ambitious expansion plan in China as a potential headwind as it comes at a time when China's economy is showing signs of a slowdown.
Consumer discretionary was also stifled by a drop in MGM Resorts as investors punished the company for posting a surprise loss.
MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) posted a reported earnings of $0.14 a share on revenue of $3.05 billion in the fourth quarter, exceeding estimates from Investing.com for earnings of $0.13 on revenue of $2.99 billion.
The company's outlook for 2019 was ""prudent"" but ""reasonable,"" according to Union Gaming.
""We believe management delivered an upbeat but prudent picture for 2019 that pinned $1,773m of Consensus EBITDA for the Las Vegas Strip as a reasonable forecast today,"" Union Gaming analyst John DeCree said in a note.
But the mixed report did draw cheers from some analysts on Wall Street.
""We see a potential rejuvenation at MGM's Las Vegas resorts and at the regional operations,"" said CFRA, an independent research provider. ""Also, MGM seems poised to consolidate its market share gains in China.""
Other casino stocks followed MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) lower as  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) fell more than 1%."

Executive Chairman Carlos Torres confirmed in a letter to staff last month that Cenyt provided various services to the bank, but said it had found no evidence of spying.

BBVA recently hired auditing company PwC to help in the investigation, which is also looking into alleged spying on government officials.

1145,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 11:15AM ET</span>","Eskom split to minimize risks to South Africa, Ramaphosa says","By Mfuneko Toyana and Wendell Roelf
JOHANNESBURG/CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said his plan to divide struggling state power firm Eskom into three units would minimize risks to the economy, as a fifth day of power cuts hurt businesses and drove the rand to a six-week low on Thursday.
Eskom, which supplies more than 90 percent of the power in Africa's most industrialized economy, is technically insolvent, the government said on Wednesday, warning that an urgent bailout was needed to help it manage its $30 billion debt.
""Restructuring will reduce the risk of a massive Eskom that at times has been termed 'too big to fail', placing government in a position where all our eggs are in one basket,"" Ramaphosa said in a speech to parliament.
""It is not a path to privatization,"" he added, promising that a financial support package for Eskom would be accompanied by a turnaround plan and that officials would consult with trade unions, which have expressed anger at the proposed split.
Last week Ramaphosa - who faces a parliamentary election in May - pledged to separate Eskom into units for generation, transmission and distribution to increase efficiency and prop up the country's most important state company. 
The former union leader is under pressure to revive an economy that stagnated under his predecessor, scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma, and the Eskom crisis will test his negotiating skills with his ex-colleagues.
Eskom cut 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity from the grid from 0600 GMT on Thursday, likely until 2000 GMT. On Monday the firm slashed 4,000 megawatts from the grid in its largest cut since the 2014/15 financial year.
Locally referred to as ""load-shedding"", the power cuts are an emergency measure to prevent the power system from a total collapse, Eskom says. Around a third of Eskom's 45,000 MW capacity is offline.
GRIDLOCK
The outages, the worst in several years, have spooked investors days before a budget speech by the finance minister and have prompted a sharp slide in the rand and government bonds.
The rand fell more than 1 percent versus the dollar to its weakest in six weeks on Thursday and is now down more than 4 percent this week.
For ordinary South Africans the cuts mean some mothers are struggling to cook for their children and traffic gridlock in major cities as traffic lights stop working.
""If the power goes off for more than six hours and we have to run the generators for that long it's going to be very expensive. We're not going to be able to afford the diesel,"" said Arno Steenkamp, a manager at a Johannesburg restaurant.
""If we can't make coffee and food it's going to hit our sales and we might have to close,"" he added.
Firms in the mining sector, the backbone of the country's economy, are looking at alternatives to reduce their dependence on Eskom and monitoring the situation closely.
Eskom hopes to end the power cuts by the end of the week.
Its woes, which reflect the failure of successive governments to take on labor unions, pose a potential threat to South Africa's credit rating, with Moody's the last of the top three ratings agencies to rate it investment grade.
There is also the risk that unions could go on strike.
The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), the biggest union at Eskom, on Thursday warned Ramaphosa's African National Congress (ANC) not to take its members' votes for granted at the upcoming election.
Senior NUM officials are set to hold talks with Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan on Monday to express their disagreement with the plan to split Eskom, which the union fears will lead to massive job losses further down the line.
Ramaphosa said in parliament that cost-cutting at Eskom would not necessarily entail job cuts.
Eskom started cutting power on Sunday and intensified outages on Monday after seven generating units unexpectedly went offline.

1147,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 11:00AM ET</span>",KLM workers petition Air France to keep Dutch executive,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Hundreds of workers of Air France's Dutch subsidiary KLM gathered at its office in Amstelveen, Netherlands, on Thursday to deliver a petition voicing support for the subsidiary's CEO Pieter Elbers.
Elbers' 4-year term expires in April, and Air France's board is due to meet in Paris on Feb. 19 to discuss strategy ahead of earnings on Feb. 20.
New CEO Ben Smith has pushed for deeper integration among the airline's operating divisions since his appointment last autumn. KLM has fiercely guarded its structure and brand since its acquisition in 2003, leading to tensions between Elbers and Smith.
The petition was signed 25,000 times by KLM employees, out of 35,000 total, in a strong display of support for Elbers. Signatories credited him with the airline's success and said they were afraid of the consequences if he is dismissed.
""There would be a very real risk of unrest among the employees and unclear and potentially unstable management if Pieter Elbers were to be forced to step down,"" a letter accompanying the petition and addressed to Air France chairwoman Anne-Marie Couderc said.
The relative outperformance of the Dutch subsidiary under Elbers has also caused tensions within the group. Air France was hit by repeated costly strikes, even as KLM staff weathered successive rounds of cost-cutting and layoffs.
For the first 9 months of 2018, Air France Group reported operating profit of 328 million euros ($370 million), while KLM had operating profit of 960 million euros.
Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra has also voiced support for Elbers, and met his French counterpart Bruno le Maire on Monday to discuss the situation at Air France-KLM.
The French government holds a 14.29 percent stake in the group.

LONDON (Reuters) - A Valentine's day special deal for HSBC staff in Hong Kong offering discounted laptops 'for him' but vacuum cleaners and kitchen appliances 'for her' has angered staff over the sexist implications of the campaign. 
The offer has drawn criticism from HSBC staff both in Hong Kong and in London, where it was posted in an internal chatroom, according to a source who shared images of it with Reuters.
The multi-page advertisement, described as an 'HSBC Staff Offer' and apparently produced by an external company, offers discounts on a range of goods to Hong Kong workers at Europe's biggest bank.
On pages festooned with pink heart drawings, the 'FOR HIM' section offers discount laptop computers as well as a GoPro camera and wireless headphones, while the 'FOR HER' gifts include five different vacuum cleaners, a blender and a kitchen water tap.
""The offer is from a third party source who manage their own marketing materials. HSBC is committed to gender diversity in the workplace,"" a spokeswoman for the bank told Reuters. 
The controversy over the sexist implications of the advertising offer comes amid a widening debate about sexism and gender pay disparity in banking and wider industry.
HSBC disclosed in December that its gender pay gap, which measures the difference between the average hourly salary of men and women, grew to 61 percent in the year to April 2018, up from 59 percent a year earlier.
The lender - which employs more than 40,000 people in Britain - had the widest gender pay gap of any large British company in 2017.
HSBC said the large gap reflected the fact there were fewer women in senior roles and more in junior ones, reflecting an industry-wide problem.

The bank said it was taking steps to bridge the gap, including targeting an increase in the ratio of women in senior management roles to 30 percent by 2020, from 23 percent today.

1158,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 08:55AM ET</span>",German govt adviser proposes broader view of EU antitrust rules,"BERLIN (Reuters) - European Union antitrust rules could be reformed to introduce a two-stage review of mergers that would examine competition issues and then broader public interests, said the head of a German commission tasked with coming up with reforms proposals.
Germany and France want to overhaul EU mergers rules following the European Commission's veto of efforts by Siemens and  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) to create a European rail champion to compete with larger foreign rivals.
Achim Wambach, who heads the German commission charged with presenting reform proposals, said a two-stage review of mergers could first look at competition issues and then at broader public interests - such as security issues and the impact on consumers.
""One could imagine that an authority examines the competition issues, and then one could, for example, apply to the EU Commission for a 'commission permit', which also takes into account the wider public interest,"" Wambach, also head of Germany's Monopolies Commission, told Reuters.
France and Germany are pushing for a reform of EU competition rules to take a more global rather than solely European view of mergers and potentially to allow EU ministers to have a say.
""In my opinion, there would have to be a European Monopolies Commission which would work with the European Commission,"" Wambach said.
""The process must be as transparent and objective as possible. The basis for this should always be an appraisal that provides information about the effects on public welfare. And then decisions would be made on that basis,"" he added.

1159,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>",‘Land of Confusion’ as Junk Defies Wall Street Recession Signal,"(Bloomberg) -- Ride the great credit rally or get out before it falls apart?
Edward Park is unequivocal. The deputy CIO at Brooks Macdonald Asset Management has offloaded about a third of the firm’s credit exposure in favor of short-dated sovereign obligations since December on signs sputtering global growth mean the business cycle has entered its winter.
And he’s just getting started. The London-based manager of about $15.5 billion of assets overall now plans to sell a “large portion” of its corporate positions over the first half of the year.
“Debt costs are likely to rise as credit spreads expand to price in the higher default risk as we move to the end of the economic cycle,” Park said. “If flows were to reverse liquidity could become squeezed quite rapidly.”
Even if many of his peers are yet to vote with their feet just yet, the angst is widespread. The number of investors demanding companies reduce leverage climbed to a decade-high this month, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) survey, while two-thirds expect slower growth in the next 12 months.
This week, fresh warnings from  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) resonated as a growing pack of investors fretted the staying power of the party in balance-sheet risk.
According to Marty Fridson, one of Wall Street’s first high-yield bond analysts, the market hasn’t been so out of whack with economists’ forecasts of a U.S. recession since the financial crisis. Junk spreads indicate a 10 percent chance of recession versus 25 percent for a recession probability model. Premiums would have to widen about 250 basis points to bring them in line with the forecast, according to the chief investment officer at Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors LLC.
Yet credit bulls are rampaging like there’s no tomorrow, powering the best start to the year for U.S. junk since 2009. Traders have channeled a net $11.5 billion into exchange-traded products tracking corporate bonds this year, dwarfing inflows into the sovereign market. Premiums on U.S. speculative-grade debt have narrowed by over 130 basis points since early January, effectively erasing the December sell-off.
Great Divergence
Unlike in typical risk-on scenarios, where traders would skirt safe havens in government bonds as they pursue higher credit yields, demand for Treasuries remains intense.
It’s “the land of confusion,” Joseph Kalish, chief global macro strategist at Ned Davis Research Group, wrote in a note. While corporate bond prices suggest Goldilocks, Treasuries flash growth fears. One explanation for the “unusual behavior” could be that both corporate and government bonds are drawing support from muted inflation expectations, according to Kalish.
That sovereign-credit disconnect may be a signal for a correction in credit, particularly once the market awakens to the full force of quantitative tightening, Steven Major, global head of fixed income research at HSBC, argued in a report published this week.
On the QT
Even after signalling greater flexibility at the January meeting about its plan to remove stimulus, the Fed is still bidding to scale down its $4 trillion balance sheet.
Whether that will materially reduce liquidity, spur risk aversion and ramp up corporate borrowing costs are famously open questions for investors of all stripes. But they’re ones bullish money managers are choosing to ignore, warns Colin Purdie, CIO of credit at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors.
“There’s still the big question of central-bank buying and the absence of the central banks in the bond market, and that does cause us some concern,” he said in an interview on Bloomberg TV.
Another way of thinking about it: Junk investors are betting there’s more liquidity coming, according to HSBC. “At best, there might be an end to the U.S. QT ahead of what may previously have been expected,” Major wrote. “At worst, the credit markets may have got it completely wrong.”
Over at Citigroup, renowned bear Matt King is growling -- the era of monetary distortion in risk markets is now receding, he said.
“As central banks back away, we come back to fundamentals,” according to the credit-products strategist. “What we are finding though is that fundamentals are not some nice fixed anchor. Everyone is actually downgrading their GDP forecasts, downgrading their earnings forecasts.”

(Reuters) - Shares of soft drink bottler Coca Cola HBC AG (LON:CCH) fell 4 percent on Thursday after it warned of higher finance costs and weak consumer spending in several of its markets this year.
The company - which bottles and sells Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co drinks in 28 countries, mostly in Europe - said costs related to refinancing an 800-million Euro bond, which matures in June 2020, may double this year and cross currency fluctuations would hurt its core profit by 50 million euros.
It also said economic growth this year is forecast to slow in a number of its markets. It said this is likely to crimp consumer spending in its ""established"" and ""developing"" markets segments, which together comprised 48 percent of its volumes last year.
""We are seeing that only in a few of the markets, there would be somewhat of a slowdown,"" Chief Executive Zoran Bogdanovic said.
These warnings overshadowed a rise in most of the key metrics for the company and made its stock the top loser on London's bluechip index. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts, for example, lowered their earnings estimates for 2019 to 2021 by 3 percent, due to the higher financing costs. 
""The capital structure is becoming inefficient as the company builds up cash,"" they said.
BUSINESS MODEL
Analysts also flagged the lack of any merger news as weighing on the stock on Thursday, after reports from Coke HBC, rival bottler Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola itself raised some hopes of an announcement. 
Coca-Cola was looking to refranchise its Africa bottling unit, and both bottlers are seen as potential buyers. Coca-Cola's general business model is to sell syrup to a network of franchise bottlers in different markets who do the heavy lifting of bottling and delivering the drinks.
The U.S. company is the second-biggest shareholder in both bottlers, with an 18.5 percent stake in CCEP and a 23 percent stake in HBC, according to Refinitiv data.
Coke European Partners forecast revenue and profit growth for 2019, and announced plans to seek a new stock market listing on London's main stock exchange.
In 2018, Coke HBC's comparable earnings before interest and tax rose to 680.7 million euros ($768.17 million) from 621 million euros a year earlier. 
On a per share basis, earnings were 1.306 euros, which analysts at Jefferies said fell 3 percent short of their estimates. They added that earnings could be 8 percent lower this year, due to the higher financing charges. 
Coke HBC said volumes were expected to grow this year in all three segments, with the established and emerging market segments accelerating marginally, as Nigeria returns to volume growth. However, growth in developing markets are likely to moderate to more ""normalized levels"", it said.
The company also said it was stocking up inventory of raw materials to last between two weeks and a month in the face of an impending Brexit. 

Shares of Coca Cola HBC were down 3.5 percent by lunchtime in London. U.S.-listed shares in European Partners were indicated 1.3 percent higher.

1167,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 06:55AM ET</span>",HSBC forex trading costs cut sharply by blockchain -executive,"By Tom Wilson
LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC has reduced the cost of settling foreign exchange trades by a quarter through its blockchain-based system, an executive overseeing the project told Reuters, offering a glimpse of the savings the technology could offer banks.
The bank processes between 3,500 and 5,000 trades a day on its ""FX Everywhere"" system, settling trades worth $350 billion, Mark Williamson, chief operating officer of FX cash trading and risk management, told Reuters. 
The HSBC platform is a rare example of blockchain technology being put to practical use by a major bank. Last month the London-based lender said it had processed FX trades worth $250 billion on the platform since February last year.
The fresh details of the scale of the HSBC project suggest that the potential of blockchain to make significant cost savings in the financial services industry - long touted by its proponents of the technology - is being realized.

Supporters say blockchain - a shared database that can securely process and settle transactions without the need for third-party checks - could transform industries from finance to real estate by obviating cumbersome and inefficient processes.

Financial institutions have so far taken a cautious approach with the technology originally conceived to underpin of the bitcoin cryptocurrency. Many are concerned by uncertainty over security, regulation and the impact on existing systems. 
HSBC coordinates payments across its Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific trading hubs on the platform, a type of blockchain known as a ""shared permissioned ledger"", which allows approved multiple parties to amend and update in real time. 
Williamson said that HSBC settles ""billions of dollars"" worth of payments every day, helping the bank to manage risk by allowing it to see real-time exposure across multiple balance sheets. 
He did not give precise figure for daily transactions but said that a significant amount of overall internal flows are likely to be settled on the system.

1168,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 06:42AM ET</span>",Airbus to scrap A380 superjumbo production as sales slump,"By Tim Hepher
TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus is scrapping production of the A380 superjumbo, with lackluster sales forcing it to abandon a dream of dominating the skies with a 21st century cruiseliner.
The world's largest airliner, with two decks of spacious cabins and room for 544 people in standard layout, was designed to challenge Boeing's legendary 747 but failed to take hold as airlines backed a new generation of smaller, more nimble jets.
Confirming a shake-up first reported by Reuters, Airbus said on Thursday the last A380 would be delivered in 2021. 
The move comes after Emirates - the largest A380 customer - was forced to reduce its orders for the iconic superjumbo after an engine dispute and a broader fleet review, opting to order a total of 70 of the smaller A350 and A330neo instead. 
Without the anticipated level of demand from the Gulf heavyweight, Airbus said its assembly lines would dry up.
""This was a joint decision. We cannot run after illusions and we have to take the only sensible decision and stop this program,"" Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said.
Airbus said it would enter talks with unions in coming weeks over the 3,000-3,500 jobs potentially affected. Enders later said the company could not guarantee all would keep their jobs.
The jobs at risk are mainly in France and Germany but there could also be an impact in Spain and Britain too.
Airbus took a charge of 463 million euros for shutdown costs, but is expected to be forgiven some 1 billion euros of outstanding European government loans under a funding system that stands at the center of a trade dispute with Boeing (NYSE:BA).
Airbus shares rose 5 percent on investor relief that Airbus would close a long-running chapter of losses on the A380, also buoyed by stronger than expected 2018 results.
Airbus will produce 17 more of the planes including 14 for Emirates and 3 for Japanese airline ANA.
As part of the restructuring, Emirates placed a new order for 40 A330-900neo jets and 30 A350-900 aircraft, partially restoring a purchase of A350s which it canceled in 2014.
Responding to behind-the-scenes concerns from airline customers from Asia to Europe, Enders stressed Airbus would continue to support the A380 as long as it remains in service.
LEADING BUYER 'DISAPPOINTED'
Emirates, which had built its global brand around the A380 and Boeing 777 and which has 100 of the Airbus superjumbos in its fleet, said it was disappointed by the closure.
""Emirates has been a staunch supporter of the A380 since its very inception,"" said Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum.
""While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the program could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation,"" he added.
The decision came after Emirates failed to reach an engine agreement with Britain's Rolls-Royce (LON:RR), which said on Thursday it noted the decision to shut down the program.
The A380 will remain a pillar of the Emirates fleet well into the 2030s, the airline said.
Emirates' local rival Etihad of Abu Dhabi also disclosed it was cutting some Airbus and Boeing jet orders, highlighting growing questions over the growth of Gulf airlines. 
Making its maiden flight in 2005, the A380 was a major step in Airbus's efforts to compete on equal terms with Boeing and challenge what had been a cash cow for its arch-rival.
But sales of the industry's largest four-engined jets have fallen due to improvements in lighter twin-engined alternatives, such as the Boeing 787 and 777 or Airbus's own A350.
""What we are seeing here is the end of the large four-engined aircraft,"" Enders said after halting the program in his last major decision before stepping down in April.
""There has been speculation that we were 10 years too early; I think it is clear that we were 10 years too late,"" he added.
The prospect of a premature halt to A380 production emerged last month as part of a restructuring of Emirates orders first reported by Reuters. 

On Wednesday, Reuters reported that Airbus was poised to ax the superjumbo.

The European Commission said in January it was investigating the unidentified banks for a scheme that distorted sovereign bond trading markets from 2007 to 2012. 
The Commission's powerful antitrust arm said some traders at the eight banks exchanged commercially sensitive information and coordinated trading strategies on euro-denominated bonds, mainly through online chatrooms.
However, it said the charges did not imply anti-competitive conduct was a general practice in the market.
The European Commission and RBS declined to comment.
The charge came as a further blow to Europe's banks, which have already paid billions of euros in misconduct fines since the financial crisis.
RBS settled a major fine last year after agreeing a $4.9 billion penalty with U.S. regulators for past mis-selling of toxic mortgage-backed securities.

1171,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 06:23AM ET</span>","With eyes on China, EU lawmakers back investment screening","STRASBOURG (Reuters) - EU lawmakers overwhelmingly backed a far-reaching system on Thursday to coordinate scrutiny of foreign investments, notably from China, to protect strategic technologies and infrastructure in Europe.
The vote was 500 in favor, 49 against and 56 abstaining.
Under the plan, developed as Chinese investments surged, the European Commission will investigate foreign investments in critical sectors and give its view on whether they undermine European interests.
China is not named in the proposed legislation, but its backers' complaints over investments by state-owned enterprises and technology transfers are clear references to Beijing.
""All the powers in the world - the United States, Canada, Japan to China - have had their systems of screening, the United States with CFIUS since 1975. Only Europe had no screening system,"" Franck Proust, the leading EU lawmaker on the plan, said on the eve of the vote.
""We're not looking to bar foreign investment. It is essential for EU countries, we need it. It's to pay attention to the investments that are strange, that do not make economic sense but are political.""
The proposal, demanded by France, Germany and the previous government of Italy, initially faced opposition from some EU countries, including Greece, Cyprus, Malta and Portugal.
Some of the opponents have welcomed Chinese investment, such as Greece. Its largest port, Piraeus, is majority-owned by China's COSCO Shipping.
However, the mood has partly shifted. The EU is now looking into Chinese telecoms company Huawei, concerned over its ties to the Chinese government and suspicion that Beijing could use its technology for spying. Huawei denies the allegations.
European Parliament lawmakers wanted tougher screening than initially proposed by the EU executive, such as obliging the Commission to start screening deals if a third of EU members expressed concerns and requiring EU countries to cooperate.
They also extended the list of ""critical sectors"" to include aerospace, health, nanotechnology, the media, electric batteries and the supply of food.
The system would not require individual countries to carry out screening. Currently, half of EU countries have a system in place. Those that do will need to inform other EU members and the Commission if they screen an investment. All will have to provide an annual report to the Commission.
The Commission's opinions could address concerns that the security of vital infrastructure might be compromised or that innovations that took years of expensive research could be lost to foreign hands.

However, EU countries and not the Commission would still make final decisions on whether to block foreign investments under the new law, which will take effect in October 2020.

1174,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 05:20AM ET</span>",The Tariffs No One Seems to Want Edge Closer to Trump’s Arsenal,"(Bloomberg) -- No American industry is lobbying hard for them. Most economists think they’re a bad idea. Even some trade hawks in President Donald Trump’s administration see them as a roadblock in his overhaul of the global trading system.
That’s helps explain why tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts -- the next possible salvo in Trump’s trade war -- are causing auto-parts supplier Michael Haughey to hold back on any major expansion right now.
“We’re not doing anything dramatic to really grow our business,” Haughey, president of Tennessee-based North American Stamping Group, said by phone. “We’re not hiring those extra people, we’re not growing and spending the extra capital money in anticipation that we might have to hunker down for a while.”
By Sunday, the Commerce Department will deliver to Trump the results of an investigation into whether the U.S. car imports stemming from the decades-long push toward a global automotive industry represent a threat to national security. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross can recommend options for the president, potentially leading to levies of as much 25 percent on imported vehicles and parts.
They’re tariffs hardly anyone seems to want.
“You cannot find a corner of this industry that thinks this is a good idea,” said John Bozzella, president of the Association of Global Automakers, the main group for overseas-based carmakers lobbying against new tariffs.
The automakers’ opposition stands in stark contrast with American steel producers and steelworker unions, whose calls for trade protections led to new levies on imports of the metals last year under the same trade powers Trump is using to examine autos.
Automakers, parts suppliers and economists predict dire consequences for the U.S. economy, in part because of the industry’s massive reach.
The auto industry makes up about 8 percent of global trade, compared with the slightly more than 3 percent represented by the bilateral trade between the U.S. and China, according to the World Trade Organization. The U.S. imported more than $191 billion in passenger cars and light trucks in 2017, the last full year of data available, and exported $56.9 billion worth. It imported almost $149 billion in parts and had exports valued at $86.6 billion.
The Trump administration argues that cars are a valid target for national-security tariffs because it sees “economic security” as a key element to safeguard the nation. It also points to the discrepancy in U.S. tariffs with the rest of the world. “Why is it that Europe gets to charge us 10 percent to try to sell them a Ford or a GM automobile and they get 2.5 percent? I mean, that’s insane,” White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said in November.
Proponents within the administration see auto tariffs as a way to force repatriation of supply chains and re-shoring of the parts manufacturing they argue has left the U.S. too dependent on countries such as China for key components.
That, they contend, is particularly important when it comes to nurturing emerging technologies such as electric vehicles that it’s already been protecting aggressively. Among the first wave of tariffs imposed on China last year were 25 percent duties on electric cars and buses, plus motors and other parts.
But the tariffs have also faced internal opposition within the Trump administration. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has been trying to delay a decision, arguing that rolling out the tariffs would scupper his attempt to close trade deals with the European Union and Japan, according to people familiar with internal discussions.
Production Costs
Economists argue that rather than strengthen the U.S. industry, tariffs would simply raise the cost of production and, in the long term, may push domestic carmakers to shift even more production offshore.
A 2018 study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that global retaliatory tariffs in response to a new 25 percent U.S. levy on autos and parts from all countries including Canada and Mexico would cause a bigger fall in U.S. exports than imports, reduce domestic production by almost 4 percent and lead to 624,000 U.S. job losses.
That’s in part because the auto parts business is increasingly global, with most vehicles produced in the U.S. assembled from components sourced from around the world.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)., Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co., Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. and Honda Motor Co. each imported less than 10 percent of the vehicles they sold in the U.S. last year from outside North America. They would suffer the least from vehicle tariffs and could be in a position to benefit from their rivals’ pain.
Still, the companies argue against steep levies, warning they would ravage U.S. payrolls, stifle domestic investment and raise new-car prices. “There would be no winners,” said Matt Blunt, president of the Washington-based American Automotive Policy Council, which lobbies on behalf of GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler.
Trade used to be one of the few areas where the Detroit Three saw eye-to-eye with big labor. Today, the issue separates them.
The United Auto Workers, which represents nearly a half-million members in the U.S., stands out as one of the few groups that has signaled any degree of support for the Commerce Department’s investigation, calling it “long overdue.”
Aside from the economics, it’s a tough call for Trump politically. David Britt, chairman of the economic development committee for Spartanburg County Council in South Carolina, says he voted for Trump. But he’s pleaded with the president in a letter and through Senate testimony not to proceed with the tariffs.
Spartanburg is home to a BMW plant that employs 10,000 workers and has suppliers with about 70,000 workers across the state, Britt said. “I’m hoping and praying he will listen,” he said of Trump.

The Swiss company’s shares rose as much as 3.7 percent to a record as it forecast improved sales and said that it expects to cede control of its dermatology unit by the middle of this year. After 14 billion francs ($14 billion) of deals in 2018, there’s no sign Schneider will stop nipping and tucking in an attempt to build a stronger Nestle.
The food company is “ticking all the boxes” with “improvement on all fronts,” wrote Jean-Philippe Bertschy, an analyst at Bank Vontobel.
Revenue accelerated for the first time in seven years in 2018. The food company has been gobbling up smaller, faster-growing brands such as Blue Bottle Coffee and Sweet Earth as health-conscious consumers switch to niche brands and forgo mainstream labels. Nestle, under pressure from activist shareholder Dan Loeb to boost returns, also forecast 700 million francs of restructuring costs this year amid the shake-up.
The company plans to push further into plant-based alternatives for meat as it considers selling Herta, a business with sales of 680 million francs.
“With these portfolio changes, the strategic picture of the group becomes much clearer than one to two years ago, with our focus on food and beverage and nutritional health,” Schneider told reporters at Nestle’s headquarters in Vevey.
One obstacle is deflation in Europe, Japan and Australia, which contributed to the weakest annual gain in pricing in more than a decade. Nestle will need to raise prices without turning off customers as Schneider seeks to return to mid-single-digit sales growth by next year. Growth was 3 percent in 2018.
Share Buyback
Nestle also said it’s accelerating its buyback to complete the 20 billion-franc program six months early. Still, Schneider told reporters the company isn’t excluding further M&A.
“Acquisitions could easily be financed,” he said. “We have strong cash generation, and one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry.”
The CEO said portfolio adjustments aren’t over. Investors have called for the sale of Nestle’s U.S. frozen-food business, which had flat sales in 2018.
“Consumer behaviors change in food and beverage, and we want to bet on areas that are growing fast,” he said.
Following criticism by Loeb that the board lacks consumer-goods expertise, Nestle proposed Dick Boer, former CEO of Dutch grocer Ahold, and Dinesh Paliwal, CEO of Harman, the car-stereo maker that was sold to Samsung (KS:005930), as new directors.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - The Kenya Electricity Generating Company plans to raise funds from the market later this year and it may opt to issue the country's first green bond, its chief executive said.
KenGen has a 1,631 megawatt annual capacity and it supplies 70 percent of the East African nation's electricity. Private investors hold 30 percent of the company while the rest is held by the state.
Rebecca Miano, KenGen's CEO, said the company would go to the market once it redeems its 10-year, 25 billion shillings ($250 million) bond in October.
The bond was heavily oversubscribed when it was issued in 2009.
""Our finance people are burning the midnight oil to look at the possibilities,"" she told Reuters in an interview late on Wednesday, without giving a figure for the target amount.
""The team is looking at asset backed securities, they are also looking at green bonds.""
The so-called green bonds help to finance projects in the renewable energy, energy-efficiency, green transport and wastewater treatment sectors.
Kenya's capital markets regulator is set to unveil regulations for private issuance of green bonds next week, paving the way for the first issue.
Although Kenya has high consumer electricity tariffs compared with countries like Egypt and South Africa, the government's policies had boosted investment in the sector, Miano said, helping it to avoid blackouts or schedule cuts.
""Kenya was among the first countries in Africa to liberalize generation and it has its own advantages. You have many players and it brings competition... you have adequate power,"" she said.
KenGen has shifted its strategy in recent years to focus on renewable energy in order to reduce the risk posed by its hydro generation dams, which are normally susceptible to a drop in production when the rains fail.
Geothermal steam, hot underground steam found in the Rift Valley which is used to drive turbines for electricity production, accounts for nearly a third of the firm's annual production, Miano said.
""Our geothermal-led strategy is bearing fruit,"" she said, adding the company was developing capacity for an extra 720 MW in the next four years to 2022.
The new plants being developed are mainly in geothermal with one plant, with a capacity for 80 MW, being in wind.
KenGen paid a dividend to shareholders for its year ended last June, breaking a two-year dividend drought associated with the costs of building the new geothermal plants and installing additional capacity in existing plants. 
Miano said shareholders might secure additional dividends in the future.

""The outlook is positive because we have projects that we are implementing that will increase our business and we do hope that the board will continue (recommending a dividend),"" she said.

Frankfurt's trade-sensitive DAX (GDAXI) was up 0.4 percent, showing resilience after GDP data revealed the euro zone's largest economy only just escaped falling into recession in the fourth quarter. GDP data for the whole bloc will be released at 1000 GMT.
""Given that on this occasion there were no obvious temporary factors dragging on the economy, this bodes ill for economic growth (in Germany) this year too,"" said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics.
Chinese export and import data for January came in well ahead of expectations earlier, providing some relief for investors who will see that a sign of some recovery in the global economy more generally this year.
But markets continue to await signs of concrete progress in trade talks in Beijing, with latest reports saying U.S. President Donald Trump is considering pushing back a March 1 deadline for higher tariffs by 60 days.
Closer to home, European industrial and consumer staple heavyweights stole the show on Thursday: Airbus (PA:AIR) delivered better-than-expected results, taking some of the sting out of news that Europe's largest aerospace group has abandoned its flagship A380 programme. Its shares jumped more than 5 percent to levels just shy of its record set last July.
AstraZeneca's (L:AZN) fourth quarter sales topped forecasts and the British drugmaker forecast another year of growth, sending its shares up more than 4 percent. They were on track for their best day since July.
Nestle (S:NESN), the world's top food and drinks maker, soared to all-time highs after giving an upbeat outlook for the year ahead on an improving outlook in China and North America.
The news lifted the food and beverage index (SX3P) 1.4 percent to its highest since November 2017.
Banks were a mixed bag, with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) rallying after its quarterly results beat expectations, while results from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) failed to ignite much love from investors. Their shares were down 2.3 percent and 1.1 percent respectively.
In healthcare, UK medical devices maker ConvaTec (L:CTEC) plunged almost 20 percent to record lows and the bottom of the STOXX 600 after full-year results.

1178,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 04:27AM ET</span>",MarketPulse Europe - Nestle Shows Where the Growth Is,"Investing.com -- It’s all about growth.
On a day when Europe’s largest economy confirmed it didn’t grow at all in the last quarter of 2018, shares in Nestle (SIX:NESN) rose over 2.9% to an all-time high, as it posted its first rise in organic sales growth in six years.
The company’s turnaround under CEO Marc Schneider appears to be gathering pace as it adapts to changing consumer tastes and sheds underperforming assets. That means there’s more money for shareholders, earlier than they expected: Nestle is raising its dividend by 4% and accelerating its 20 billion-franc stock buyback program.
While Nestle’s figures owe a lot to company-specific actions such as disposals and more leverage, they reflect a trend that is fast becoming one of the themes of 2019: the more sales you have outside of a stagnating Europe, the better are your chances of growing.
Nestle is following where Europe’s luxury goods makers – who make most of their money in North America and China - have led so far this year. Nestle too said that growth was strongest in the U.S. and Asia.
Contrast that with the news on the home front: Germany’s fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth was revised to zero Thursday. Elsewhere in Europe, domestic-focused sectors like banks are trailing local markets in both Spain and Italy this morning (although Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), a domestic-focused German bank, has bounced 2.7% after beating some very low expectations).
But hopes on an agreement in the U.S.-China trade dispute continue to support the general mood: the broad-based Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.5% at 366.74, while Germany’s DAX was up 0.5% at 11,216 and the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.4% at 7220.03
Elsewhere, Airbus (PA:AIR)soared 5.3% after it said it would end production of A380 superjumbo, while Juventus (MI:JUVE) was up 1.1% after it successfully sold 175 million euros of bonds at a rate of around 3.5%, allowing it to repay more expensive bank loans. That’s despite the bonds not carrying a rating."

LUXEMBOURG/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU judges dealt a possible blow to an EU crackdown against tax avoidance by global multinationals on Thursday by annulling an order by the EU executive against a Belgian tax-break scheme for about 35 large companies.
The anti-avoidance drive led by Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has included orders to Ireland to recover some 13 billion euros from iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and to Luxembourg to claw back up to 30 million euros from Fiat Chrysler, 250 million euros from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and about 120 million euros from France's Engie.
The Netherlands has been told to recover between 20-30 million euros from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).
It is not yet clear how much of an impact the decision by the General Court, the lower branch of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, may have on other cases. Legal experts will be scrutinising the detail of the Belgian ruling.
""The General Court annuls the Commission's decision concerning tax exemptions granted by Belgium by means of rulings,"" the EU tribunal said in Luxembourg.
""The Commission wrongly considered that the Belgian system relating to the excess profit of multinational companies constituted an aid scheme,"" it said.

The case involved Dutch industrial company Magnetrol and Belgium which took their cases to the General Court after the Commission in 2016 ordered Belgium to recover some 700 million euros from the companies which benefited from the scheme.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - U.S. and Indian government officials pressed on with talks on Thursday to resolve their differences over trade and investment, Indian government sources said, even though U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross called off his visit because of bad weather at home.
Ross addressed a U.S.-India CEO Forum by video after his flight was canceled and was due to similarly join the commercial dialogue later in the day with Indian Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu, the sources said.
U.S. ambassador to India Kenneth Juster is leading the delegation on the ground. 
India and the United States are sparring over a range of issues, from India's new rules on e-ecommerce that affect firms such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to data localization and its tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump says are exceptionally high.
Washington has also had a longstanding grievance with India over its large trade deficit with the United States and what it sees as the Indian government's lax intellectual property enforcement.
A U.S. trade delegation led by United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin began high-level talks with Chinese counterparts on Thursday to de-escalate a tariff war ahead of a March 1 deadline for a deal.
New Delhi defends the measures on e-commerce as a way to protect the interests of small businesses and says it has been cutting tariffs gradually to give local industry a level playing field and create jobs for a very large youth population.
Details of the discussions held on Thursday were not immediately available and officials said the two sides were likely to issue a joint statement later on Thursday. 
The sources also said that trade negotiations would be conducted by the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and not by the Commerce Department, which is focused on boosting investment, improving the business climate and some specific areas such as travel and tourism.
Still, the two sides are expected to touch on the thorny issues that have cropped up in recent months and pledge efforts to address them. ""It will be a friendly discussion, they would avoid the risk of disappointment,"" said a source with knowledge of the matter. 
The meeting comes at a time when the USTR is reviewing India's eligibility as a beneficiary of its Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) under which the country has enjoyed zero tariffs for about 2,000 goods exported to the United States that are worth $5.6 billion. 

Reuters reported last week that the USTR is considering withdrawal or scaling back of these tariffs because of the lack of reciprocity from India on its tariffs, its tightening curbs on online sales and its insistence that foreign payment card companies, such as Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V), store data in India.

1181,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 03:53AM ET</span>",Renault embarks on post-Ghosn era with lower profit goal,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles Guillaume
PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) set a weaker full-year profit goal on Thursday, citing currency challenges and market uncertainties, as the French carmaker presented annual results without its recently ousted CEO Carlos Ghosn for the first time in 13 years.
Under new leadership since Ghosn's forced resignation last month over financial misconduct allegations, Renault targeted profitability of ""around 6 percent"" in 2019, compared with a 6.3 percent operating margin recorded last year.
Revenue and profit both declined as expected on the combined effect of currency setbacks, a withdrawal from Iran and a diesel sales collapse that hit engine production for Renault's alliance partner Nissan and affiliate Daimler.
The results nonetheless met Renault's own targets, including revenue growth before currency effects and an operating margin above 6 percent, on the way to its mid-term objective to exceed 7 percent in 2022.
""2018 was clearly a challenging year in which we faced expected as well as unexpected difficulties,"" new Chief Executive Thierry Bollore said, adding that the results ""demonstrate the group's resilience"".
Renault shares, which have lost about one-third of their value over the past 12 months, were up 3.8 percent at 58.84 euros as of 0840 GMT.
UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT
Bollore, formerly Ghosn's deputy, was promoted to CEO on Jan. 24, with outgoing  Michelin  (PA:MICP) boss Jean-Dominique Senard taking over the departed leader's role as chairman.
Ghosn faces trial in Japan after a Nissan internal probe uncovered evidence of misconduct including failure to declare more than $80 million in deferred income - straining relations with 43.4 percent-owner Renault. Ghosn denies wrongdoing.
Renault said on Wednesday it had blocked 30 million euros in deferred and severance pay to Ghosn, who had served as its CEO since 2005, and as chairman for almost a decade.
Underscoring challenges to alliance cooperation, Renault's sales to Nissan and other partners fell by 946 million euros ($1.1 billion) in 2018, reflecting collapsing diesel demand. A further negative impact is expected this year, the company said.
Nissan's contribution to Renault earnings came in at 1.51 billion euros, a 46 percent decline from 2017, when the Japanese carmaker's profit was inflated by one-off gains.
Renault's own cost-saving efforts in purchasing and manufacturing contributed 421 million euros to profit, a 37 percent decline.
Overall revenue fell 2.3 percent to 57.42 billion euros, while recurring operating profit dropped 6.3 percent to 3.61 billion. Net income amounted to 3.3 billion euros, down sharply from the 5.31 billion recorded in 2017, partly reflecting the exceptional year-earlier gain from Nissan.
Excluding currency effects, revenue would have risen 2.5 percent, Renault said. Analysts had expected recurring operating profit of 3.52 billion euros on revenue of 58.1 billion, based on the median of 12 estimates from an Infront Data poll.

The carmaker said it saw no need for any financial provisions in relation to the scandal and ongoing investigation into Ghosn's conduct and executive payments by Renault and the jointly owned Renault-Nissan BV alliance management company.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said Thursday that it will resume selling older iPhone models in its stores in Germany after they were banned last year, but only with chips from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, which is in a global legal battle against the Cupertino company.
Apple said it had ""no choice"" but to stop using some chips from  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) in iPhones headed to Germany in order to comply with a patent infringement lawsuit Qualcomm won against Apple there in December.
Qualcomm, the world's biggest supplier of mobile chips, sued Apple in Germany alleging that some older iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models violated Qualcomm patents around so-called envelope tracking, a feature that helps mobile phones save battery power while sending and receiving wireless signals. The alleged patent violation stemmed not from Intel chips but yet another Apple supplier - Qorvo Inc - whose chip was only present in older phones with Intel modems.
The court sided with Qualcomm and banned sales of some iPhone models that used Intel modem chips, leading Apple to pull the devices from its 15 retail stories in Germany and its online store in the country.
The ban was a victory in Qualcomm's legal conflict with Apple.
The iPhone maker has alleged that Qualcomm engaged in illegal patent licensing practices to protect a monopoly on so-called modem chips, which connect mobile phones to wireless data networks. Qualcomm has in turn alleged that Apple has infringed its patents. A major case between the two goes to trial in the United States in April.
Apple began phasing in Intel's modem chips in 2016 after years of using chips exclusively from Qualcomm. In last year's iPhone models, Apple dropped Qualcomm's chips completely in favor of Intel's.
But Qualcomm has continued to supply Apple with chips for older models, and Apple on Thursday said it would use only those for German iPhone 7 and 8 models.
""Qualcomm is attempting to use injunctions against our products to try to get Apple to succumb to their extortionist demands,"" Apple said in a statement to Reuters.
Newer iPhones with Intel chips remain on sale in Germany.

""Intel's modem products are not involved in this lawsuit and are not subject to this or any other injunction,"" Steven Rodgers, Intel's general counsel, said in a statement.

1184,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 02:48AM ET</span>",Famed Cullinan mine banks on big diamonds to drive down debt,"By Emma Rumney and Barbara Lewis
CULLINAN, South Africa (Reuters) - The owner of one of the world's most famous diamond mines could be about a decade away from clearing its multi-million-dollar debts, in a sign of the struggles facing an industry assailed by synthetic rivals and uncertain demand. 
Petra Diamonds bought Cullinan in 2008, aiming to breathe new life into the South African mine renowned for yielding the largest rough gem diamond ever found - 3,106 carats - and being the world's main source of rare blue diamonds.
The London-listed miner, which acquired Cullinan from industry leader De Beers, borrowed heavily to revamp the facility and began mining a new section of ore last July.
Petra told Reuters its debts from the mine stood at around 65 percent of its overall $650 million in borrowing, which would represent about $420 million.
Cullinan's general manager Juan Kemp added that it could take ""between five and 10 years"" from the opening of the new section to clear the debts related to the mine. That goes beyond the 2022 maturity of Petra's bond notes. 
The company says it expects to generate free cash flow this year - a target it had hoped to reach in 2017 before being derailed by strikes and construction delays - and start reducing its debts. 
Kemp said one thought kept him awake at night: ""When will we get that next big stone?""
Ben Davis, mining analyst at Liberum, said the diamond prices Petra had achieved were below market expectations.
""Everyone is very much hoping, for the sake of the equity holders and debt holders, it will deliver more higher-quality stones,"" he added.
The miner's difficulties reflect in part the problems facing the industry - which often takes years to recover huge investments - including new competition from synthetic diamonds and sluggish demand, especially for small stones.
In a sign of the times, De Beers, owned by  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), last year abandoned its decades-old policy of refusing to sell man-made diamonds as jewelry. 
GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ic5k2O
DIAMOND PRICES
Man-made diamonds require less investment than mining natural stones and can offer more attractive margins.
Synthetic producers spend around $300-500 per carat produced, according to a 2018 report by Bain & Company. De Beers' lab-grown diamonds sell for $800 per carat. 
Petra, by contrast, has to shift 20,000 tonnes of earth at Cullinan to yield one cup of diamonds, at an average cost in the first half of their financial year of $55 per carat, leaving it with a margin of $41 per carat. 
Industry experts say synthetic production accounts for a small percentage of the market, but is growing fast. De Beers is investing $94 million over four years to build a U.S. factory that will churn out 500,000 carats a year, for example, while Chinese producers are stepping up output.
Prices are also under pressure. Diamond miners say sales are seasonal and fall off after the Christmas rush, but the industry's giants have nonetheless reported weaker prices. 
Alrosa, the world's biggest diamond seller by volume, said in January sales were down 44 percent year on year, while De Beers, the biggest seller by value, said the first 2019 sales cycle was 25 percent lower than in 2018. 
""Diamond prices have come under pressure from a toxic combination of deteriorating consumer confidence in China, growth in synthetic jewelry capacity, working capital finance withdrawal ... and jewelry recycling,"" Davis said.
The tougher landscape is widening the disparities within the diamond mining industry itself. 
Big players, led by De Beers and Alrosa, have the money and technology to expand in places such as Namibia and Russia, while mid-tier miners like Petra, and smaller players look to eke out the resources from older mines. 
Petra gained control of Cullinan, east of Pretoria, for $80 million. Previous owner De Beers had dismissed the 116-year-old mine as not profitable enough. For Petra, it is its flagship project and its most capital-heavy, and thus central to shareholder confidence. 
DIRTY COLOR
A single large, valuable stone could bring in millions of dollars and lighten Petra's debt load. So far, however, the only large stones recovered from the new mining section have been a dirty color, and low quality. 
Kemp said the new section, which analysis suggests should be rich, had yet to show what it can produce. 
""We expect a large stone at some point,"" he said. 
In the absence of rarer gems and weak prices for small diamonds, averages for Cullinan stones have slipped from $140 per carat in the first half of its 2018 financial year to an expected $96 for the first half of this year - the lowest since 2010. 
That helped prompt a 30-percent fall in Petra's share price since it published prices in January, extending a steep decline over the previous two years. The miner has bought and developed four other African mines. 
Jacques Breytenbach, Petra's finance director, said pricing at Cullinan was variable from one period to the next, and that the market tended to be weaker at the end of the calendar year due to destocking. An increase in diamond tenders in the second half of Petra's financial year would make a big difference to cash generation, he added.
Small miners are more vulnerable to adverse industry trends than the bigger players, whose volumes improve the probability of success, according to Bernstein analyst Paul Gait.

""Their size allows the laws of large numbers to work on their side,"" he said. ""You're not just reliant on the belief that in a few years' time you will find a stone of 1,000 carats.""

1186,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 02:11AM ET</span>","Not time yet to discuss Nissan chairmanship, Renault's Senard says","By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - The new chairman of French automaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) on Thursday said it was not the time to discuss whether he would also take the helm of Nissan, as he arrived in Japan to reaffirm an alliance rocked by the arrest and ouster of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn.
The comment from Jean-Dominique Senard, reported by Japanese media, appeared aimed at avoiding putting further strain on an alliance that some in Japan see as unequal. Senard's visit is the first by Renault's top brass since Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo in November over allegations of financial misconduct.
The downfall of one of the world's best-known executives has stunned the global auto industry and heightened tension between Renault and Nissan Motor Co. Senard is expected to meet Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa during his two-day visit.
Senard said it was not the time to discuss whether he would also assume the chairmanship of Nissan, and that he expected discussions to be amicable, Jiji news agency reported, without giving direct quotes.
Senard was appointed chairman of the French automaker three weeks ago, and is also expected to be named to Nissan's board, given Renault's 43 percent stake in the Japanese firm. He is expected to visit Nissan's headquarters in Yokohama on Thursday and Friday to meet with board members and management teams.
The visit is aimed as a friendly, introductory call, according to sources familiar with the matter. But tension has been building between the two sides, with Renault initially backing Ghosn until he was forced to resign as chairman and CEO last month.
Some Nissan executives have long been unhappy with what they see as Renault's outsized influence over Nissan - the Japanese automaker, in turn, holds a 15 percent, non-voting stake in Renault. 
A focus now will be on who becomes the next chairman of Nissan, a role previously held by Renault's chairman. Nissan has said one of the reasons Ghosn was able to carry out his alleged fiscal misconduct was a concentration of power in one executive.
Ghosn denies wrongdoing. 
DRIVING FORCE
""There are various topics to discuss, but my responsibility is to Nissan stakeholders, to employees and customers and shareholders other than Renault, and Mr. Senard is in the same position,"" Nissan's Saikawa told reporters on Thursday.
""The main thing is to talk about the future responsibly."" 
Ghosn himself was the driving force in the alliance, which was sealed in 1999 when Nissan was rescued from near-bankruptcy and enlarged in 2016 to include Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Ghosn had been pushing for a deeper tie-up between Nissan and Renault, including possibly a full merger, despite reservations at Nissan.
Senard's appointment in late January helped quell a leadership debate which erupted after Nissan dismissed Ghosn immediately after his arrest while Renault had initially stuck by the executive, and has opened a path for Renault and Nissan re-examine the operations and structure of their alliance.
Joining Renault from tyre maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP), Senard is generally seen by Nissan as a welcome outsider who could provide more balance to the alliance, over which Nissan has said Ghosn held excessive control given his roles as chairman of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, along with being Renault CEO.
Senard's meeting with Saikawa would be the second since they first met face-to-face late last month.
Another person with direct knowledge of the matter said Senard would also meet executives at Mitsubishi Motors, in which Nissan holds a controlling stake. 
Meanwhile, Ghosn, in custody at a detention centre in Tokyo for nearly three months, on Wednesday replaced his chief attorney with a legal team headed by one of Japan's most fiery lawyers in a move seen as taking on a more aggressive strategy in fighting his charges, which he denies.
Regardless of the tensions, however, analysts say the automakers need the alliance to compete better with rivals such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and Toyota Motor Corp. 
Renault announced on Thursday that revenue and profit fell in 2018, hit by collapsing diesel sales, exchange-rate setbacks and a withdrawal from the Iranian market. 

Nissan earlier in the week said its annual profit will plumb six-year lows due to waning global sales and an ongoing slump in its U.S. operations.

The Abu Dhabi-owned airline said in a statement that it has committed to take delivery of five Airbus A350-1000s and 26 A321neos plus six Boeing 777-9s ""over the coming years"".
However, it has ordered more aircraft, mostly in 2013 when it went on a jet-buying spree, and said in the statement that the ""balance of the remaining orders will be defined at a later time through rescheduling, restructuring or reduction.""
According to Etihad documents and the manufacturers' websites, Etihad had placed orders for 26 A321neos, 40 A350-900s and 22 A350-1000s, as well as eight 777-8s and 17 777-9s.
The airline said it will also continue to take delivery of Boeing 787 Dreamliners, but did not say how many it would take.
Etihad has so far received 28 of 71 Dreamliners it has ordered, according to Boeing's website.
Etihad said it had reached agreements with Airbus and Boeing to not disclose details of the order changes.
The airline's announcement comes after a lengthy strategy review that began in 2016 after it piled billions of dollars into a failed strategy of buying minority stakes in other airlines. 
Etihad has reported losses in excess of $3 billion and thousands of employees have left, including long-serving chief executive James Hogan, since the review started.
Etihad's new boss Tony Douglas said last year the airline was now focused on flying passengers to and from Abu Dhabi, rather than competing to be a major intercontinental airline.

Chinese equities outperformed their regional peers after official data showed better-than-expected trade figures for January.
Exports unexpectedly grew 9.1% in January from a year earlier, beating the expectation of a 3.2% drop, data from China’s General Administration of Customs showed.
Imports also only fell 1.5%, much less than the expected 10% fall and narrowing from December’s 7.6% drop.
That left the country with a trade surplus of $39.16 billion for the month, better than forecasts of $33.5 billion.
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component opened near flat but gained 0.2% and 1.0% respectively by 1:30 AM ET (06:30 GMT) following the release of the data. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.1%.
Investor sentiment was also boosted after Bloomberg reported that U.S. President Donald Trump is considering extending the March 1 deadline for a tariff increase by 60 days.
His comments contrasted with earlier comments from the White House that described March 1 as a ""hard deadline.""
Separately, Trump told reporters on Wednesday that trade talks are making good progress. “I think it’s going along very well,” said Trump. “They’re showing us tremendous respect.”
Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to meet US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Beijing on Friday, the South China Morning Post reported, citing unidentified people.
""Investors are once again cautiously optimistic that progress will be made and realistically an extension of the tariff deadline will be seen as a good result,"" said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at Rakuten Securities, in a Reuters report.
""Longer term, only evidence of a solid deal going forward will dispel the investor caution and global growth fears that have been such a feature over the last year,"" Twidale added.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded near flat after government data showed earlier in the day that the country's gross domestic product grew at an annualised rate of 1.4% in the October to December period last year.
The 1.4% expansion is in line with analysts’ expectation and followed a revised 2.6% annualised contraction in the July-September period.

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 01:15AM ET</span>",Airbus A380: from European dream to white elephant,"By Tim Hepher
TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Loved by passengers, feared by accountants, the world's largest airliner has run out of runway after Airbus decided to close A380 production after 12 years in service due to weak sales.
The decision to halt production of the A380 superjumbo is the final act in one of Europe's greatest industrial adventures and reflects a dearth of orders by airline bosses unwilling to back Airbus's vision of huge jets to combat airport congestion.
Air traffic is growing at a near-record pace but this has mainly generated demand for twin-engined jets nimble enough to fly directly to where people want to travel, rather than bulky four-engined jets forcing passengers to change at hub airports.
And while loyal supporters like top customer Emirates say the popular 544-seat jet makes money when full, each unsold seat potentially burns a hole in airline finances because of the fuel needed to keep the huge double-decker structure aloft.
""It's an aircraft that frightens airline CFOs; the risk of failing to sell so many seats is just too high,"" said a senior aerospace industry source familiar with the program.
Once hailed as the industrial counterpart to Europe's single currency, the demise of a globally recognized European symbol coincides with growing political strains between Britain, France, Germany and Spain where the plane is built.
That's in stark contrast to the display of European unity and optimism when the engineering behemoth was unveiled in front of European leaders under a spectacular light show in 2005.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair called the A380 a ""symbol of economic strength"" while Spanish premier Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero called the rollout ""the realization of a dream"".
Passengers marveled at the European giant with room for 70 cars on its wings, looking rather like the hump-backed Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747 but with the top section stretching all the way to the back.
Airlines had initially rushed to place orders, expecting it to lower operating costs and boost profits as the industry crawled out of a slowdown in tourism since September 2001.
Airbus boasted it would sell 700-750 A380s, which nowadays cost $446 million at list prices, and render the 747 obsolete.
In fact, A380 orders barely crossed the 300 threshold and the 747 has outlived its rival, after reaching the age of 50 this week.
FALL FROM GRACE
The seeds of the A380's fall from grace were already present behind the scenes of the 2005 launch party, insiders say. 
Despite public talk of unity, the huge task was about to expose fractures in Franco-German co-operation that sparked an industrial meltdown. When the delayed jet finally reached the market in 2007, the global financial crisis was starting to bite. Scale and opulence were no longer wanted. Sales slowed.
At the same time, engine makers who had promised Airbus a decade of unbeatable efficiencies with their new superjumbo engines were fine-tuning even more efficient designs for the next generation of dual-engined planes, competing with the A380.
Finally, a restless Airbus board started demanding a return and stronger prices just when the plane desperately needed an aggressive relaunch and fresh investment, insiders said.
""It was a triple whammy,"" said a person close to the debate.
As demand see-sawed, so did the plane's marketing: starting with luxuries including showers, then vaunting its green credentials with the messianic slogan 'Saving The Planet One A380 at a Time"" before joining the race to squeeze in more people and cut costs. 
Yet despite its own deep industrial problems, Boeing was winning the argument with its newest jet, the 787 Dreamliner. It was designed to bypass hubs served by the A380 and open routes between secondary cities: a strategy known as ""point to point"".
Airbus fought back, arguing that travel between megacities would nonetheless dominate air transport.
But economic growth would splinter in ways Airbus did not predict. Intermediary cities are growing almost twice as fast as megacities, according to a 2018 paper posted by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development.https:// That's a boon for twinjets like the Boeing 787 and 777 or Airbus's own A350, which has outsold the A380 three to one. Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders, who was rarely seen as an enthusiastic backer of the A380, toyed with ending the project about two years ago but was persuaded to give it a last chance. But with Emirates unable to hammer out an engine deal needed to confirm its most recent A380 order, time had finally run out. ""Airbus tends to think of it as a flagship; Enders looks at it and sees a lack of orders,"" said a person close to the German-born CEO, who steps down in April. Some insiders worry that Airbus will lose a valuable symbol of pride and commercial audacity when production ends in 2021. Now, airline bosses are seeking assurances that Airbus will support the A380 with spare parts for years to come. Many invested in the A380 as their flagship while airports also spent heavily on new facilities. Some customers like Air France and Lufthansa may not shed too many tears, analysts say.  They too invested in the A380 but may also be relieved to see a potent weapon removed from Gulf rivals like Emirates, whom they accuse of flooding the market.  Emirates insists it plays fairly and has called the A380 a ""passenger magnet,"" misunderstood and badly marketed by rivals. 
Its chairman said on Thursday he was disappointed in the A380's demise, but added ""we accept that this is the reality of the situation"".

1193,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2019 12:50AM ET</span>",China's bad debt managers risk becoming bad credits themselves,"By Samuel Shen and Shu Zhang
SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's bad debt managers, whom Beijing hopes to play a key role in resolving financial risks, are in danger of becoming bad credits themselves as the leverage crackdown that fueled a boom in their business now threatens their own access to funding.
The practice of buying banks' non-performing loans (NPLs) at a discount and recovering them for a profit has grown rapidly in China since 2016.
It has attracted a slew of new local players as well as foreigners including Oaktree Capital Group and CarVal Investors as Beijing's deleveraging campaign and economic restructuring produces a still-rising mountain of soured loans. 
But as China's economy posts its slowest annual growth in 28 years amid the Sino-U.S. trade war, Chinese vulture funds are finding themselves mired in their own liquidity squeeze.
The industry's woes not only hamper Chinese banks' ability to quickly offload bad debts to make room for fresh lending, but also increase financial risks in the system and threaten social stability as tens of thousands of retail investors lose their savings in vulture fund investments.
Prices for bad loan portfolios have weakened amid a fresh avalanche of supply, dashing fund managers' hopes for a quick turnaround of their assets. 
""In the past, domestic bad loan investors borrowed a significant sum of money to buy portfolios but they're not able to borrow any more,"" said Ted Osborn, partner at PwC.
The deterioration in distressed asset prices is hitting the books of dozens of listed companies who rushed into the business a few years back. 
Even state-owned bad debt specialists - referred to as AMCs - are suffering. 
China Huarong Asset Management, the country's largest AMC, reported a 61 percent decline in pretax profit generated by its NPL business in the first half of last year. Rival China Cinda Asset Management expects its 2018 profit to fall 30 percent, its first profit decline since its 2013 listing. 
DISILLUSIONMENT 
Bad loan manager Zhejiang Dongrong Equity Investment Co is a case in point. It began defaulting on a series of bad loan investment products last August and is now offering goods including rice, milk and ham in part payment to pacify disgruntled investors. 
The private asset manager began to ramp up its NPL business three years ago in the aftermath of China's stock market crash. In March 2016, general manager Zhang Wei told Reuters the company's short-term plan was to grow its bad loan business to ""tens of billions of yuan"" and forecast annualized returns of roughly 13 percent. 
Today, Dongrong is sitting on nearly 9 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) worth of distressed assets and more than 20,000 individual investors in Dongrong's fund products are demanding their money back.
""I feel helpless,"" said Zhou Jian, who invested 2 million yuan in a Dongrong NPL fund due to mature in January but has yet to receive any money. 
In a letter to investors, Ye Zhen, Dongrong's founder, said the whole industry is suffering from liquidity stress and promised to return investors' money in three years. 
Attempts by Reuters to reach Zhang and Ye by phone and email were unsuccessful. 
Rival Dong Fang Cheng An also cited a poor funding environment when it defaulted on a series of NPL products in December. 
""Since 2018, China's NPL market has been impacted by the macro environment, with the bad loan recovery process being greatly lengthened,"" the asset manager said in a statement on its website. 
The firm, which owes investors 7 billion yuan, said it has set up an emergency taskforce to deal with the liquidity issue. 
MORE BAD LOANS
About $1.4 trillion of soured loans - including NPLs, distressed debt and loans in the ""special mention"" category - sit within banks and the four big AMCs, according to PwC. It expects distressed debts to grow as the economy slows and regulators push lenders to clean up their books. 
""I think this is the very beginning of China's ... NPL cycle and it will have many years to run,"" said Osborn, who heads PwC's China and Hong Kong Restructuring & Insolvency team. 
Chinese banks' non-performing loans reached 2 trillion yuan in 2018, driving the industry's NPL ratio to a decade-high of 1.89 percent, regulators say, even after lenders resolved nearly 2 trillion yuan in soured assets that year.. 
Thanks to increasing supply, prices of bad loan portfolios dropped more than 10 percentage points between the first quarter and the third quarter last year, according to China Orient Asset Management, another state-controlled AMC. 
""Some asset managers acquired a large number of NPL portfolios previously. If they cannot dispose them quickly and recover the money, they could face liquidity risks when their short-term borrowings become due,"" Chen Jianxiong, vice president of Orient AMC, told a recent conference. ""In a slowing economy, it becomes more difficult to dispose of NPLs. Every asset manager is under big pressure at both the funding end and the return end."" 
One such firm is Shanghai Morn Electric Equipment Co, a maker of electric wires and cables. It ventured into the NPL business in early 2017, buying 10.9 billion yuan in NPL portfolios for that year and earning 97.2 million yuan in revenue from that business. But in October, it warned its 2018 profit would drop as much as 92 percent because of its NPL business. 
SMELLING BLOOD
The struggles of local asset managers mean some foreign vulture funds with deeper pockets have sensed an opportunity. 
Avery Colcord, Managing Director of CarVal Investors, said China's deleveraging campaign has helped wipe out some ""fierce"" local rivals and brought down bubbly prices. 
""We feel that fundamentals are quite favorable today,"" he said, after CarVal completed two deals in 2018, its first since 2015. 
The view was echoed by Greg Ritchie, director of LVF Capital, which launched a $500 million fund in 2017 dedicated to investing in China's NPL market. 
""A slowing economy is good for us,"" Ritchie said. ""One of the pros that western investors bring to the market is they have long-term money ... For a lot of domestic money, it's one-year money."" 
Shenzhen Qianhai Financial Assets Exchange data shows overseas purchases of bad loan portfolios in China nearly tripled last year to 30 billion yuan. 
""Compared with domestic investors, foreign buyers are more cautious, and would seek more adequate collateral, and deeper discounts,"" said Li Jiaqi, executive director of the exchange's cross border division. 
""They can hold assets longer, and wait throughout the cycle, for recovery.""

The feature will be compatible with U.S. Model 3 vehicles, followed by Model S and Model X vehicles that were manufactured after August 2017, the electric carmaker said.
When enabled, the ""sentry mode"" monitors the environment around an unattended car and uses the vehicle's external cameras to detect potential threats, according to Tesla's blog https://www.tesla.com/en_NZ/blog/sentry-mode-guarding-your-tesla?redirect=no.
A minimal threat will be detected if anyone leans on the car, triggering a message on the touchscreen and warning that its cameras are recording.
For a more severe threat, like someone breaking a window, the mode activates the car alarm, increases the brightness of the center display, plays loud music and alerts owners on their Tesla mobile app.
The United States had 773,139 motor vehicles stolen in 2017 - the highest since 2009, according to data from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-1

Investor sentiment improved somewhat after U.S. President Donald Trump said trade talks are making good progress. “I think it’s going along very well,” Trump told reporters. “They’re showing us tremendous respect.”
In a surprise move, Trump said on Wednesday that he is open to extending the March 1 deadline for a tariff increase, if China and the U.S. get closer to a trade agreement, though there are few signs so far that an accord is near.

Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to meet US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Beijing on Friday, the South China Morning Post reported, citing unidentified people.
""Investors are once again cautiously optimistic that progress will be made and realistically an extension of the tariff deadline will be seen as a good result,"" said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at Rakuten Securities, in a Reuters report.

(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday, as it benefited from strength in its newer applications and security businesses, while shrugging of the impact of a U.S.-China trade war on its networking gear business.
Shares of the Dow component rose about 4 percent in extended trading after the network gear maker also forecast third-quarter earnings above analysts' estimates and boosted its share buyback program and quarterly dividend.
Analysts have been worried about the impact of the trade war on Cisco's traditional business of selling switches and routers, as some of these are made in China. But those concerns were brushed aside by Chief Executive Chuck Robbins who said demand was steady through the quarter.
""It certainly is one of the more complex macro geopolitical environments that I think we've seen in quite a while with all the different moving parts,"" Robbins said. 
""But to be honest, from the first day of the quarter to the last day of the quarter, we saw zero difference.""
Robbins, who took the helm in July 2015, has made acquisitions a central part of his efforts to add muscle to the hardware giant's newer growth areas such as the cloud, internet of things and cyber security.
Under Robbins, Cisco has pivoted to software and cyber security to make up for slowing demand for its routers and switches as companies increasingly shift to cloud services offered by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc instead of building their own networks.
""Strong growth in areas like security and software-defined networking are indicative of Cisco staying a leader in nascent technologies and possibly turning into more spend per customer or opening up new opportunities,"" Morningstar analyst Mark Cash said. 
The company said it expects third-quarter revenue growth of 4 percent to 6 percent, implying a range of between $12.96 billion and $13.21 billion. Analysts were expecting $12.84 billion. 
In the latest quarter, revenue from its application software businesses rose 24 percent to $1.47 billion. 
Security business, which sells firewall protection and breach detection systems, also posted an 18 percent jump in sales to $658 million.
Sales in its infrastructure platform business, which includes the company's traditional business of switches and routers, rose 6 percent to $7.13 billion. 
Total revenue rose 4.7 percent to $12.45 billion in the second quarter, above analysts' expectations of $12.41 billion.

On an adjusted basis, the company earned 73 cents per share, beating estimates of 72 cents per share.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said its headline price index fell for a fourth month in January, reaching the lowest since 2012, while measures of new enquiries, sales and listings all declined. The survey suggests both demand and supply for homes is subdued.
The country is due to leave the European Union in less than two months and it’s still possible that it will do so without a transition in place, which is expected to hurt the pound and cause widespread economic damage. Rapid price growth in the past few years has also made homes unaffordable for many, especially in London and the southeast.
“Resolution of the Brexit negotiations is widely seen as critical to encouraging potential buyers back into the market,” said Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS.
U.K. house prices rose an annual 2.5 percent in December, the least since 2013, the Office for National Statistics reported Wednesday. London, the worst-performing region, experienced the first decline in values in a calendar year since 2008.

Chris Pilgrim, Pilgrim Bond, in the southeast:
“Market depressed due to Brexit, weather and time of year.”
Edward Rook, Knight Frank, in Sevenoaks:
“The market wants to get going but uncertainty following the political mess is stagnating activity.”

1198,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 06:38PM ET</span>",Johnson & Johnson supplier seeks bankruptcy over talc lawsuits,"By Tina Bellon and Tom Hals
(Reuters) - A key supplier of talc used in Johnson & Johnson's baby powder filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Wednesday in the wake of multibillion-dollar lawsuits alleging its products caused ovarian cancer and asbestos-related mesothelioma.
Imerys Talc America, the U.S. unit of French group Imerys SA, said it filed for bankruptcy because it lacks the financial clout to defend against nearly 15,000 lawsuits over its talc mineral product, which is also used in cosmetics.
Imerys said that while it continued to believe the lawsuits are without merit, the prospect of rising settlement and defense costs over the next few years prompted the decision to file for bankruptcy.
They also cite a multibillion-dollar verdict against Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and the ensuing media attention as factors that led to the Chapter 11 filing.
In July, a Missouri jury ordered J&J to pay a record $4.69 billion to 22 women who said asbestos in talc caused ovarian cancer. J&J has said it is appealing that verdict. 
Imerys said it had settled for an undisclosed amount prior to the trial.
Imerys also attributed its filing to a dispute over an indemnity agreement. Imerys said some of its supply agreements required J&J to indemnify Imerys, but it said the U.S. healthcare conglomerate had refused to do.
Imerys and J&J have repeatedly denied the allegations about talc, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown their talc to be safe.
J&J on Wednesday declined to comment on Imerys Talc America's Chapter 11 filing and on the allegations against it over the indemnification agreements.
Reuters on Dec. 14 published a report detailing that J&J knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results it did not disclose to regulators or consumers.
J&J has said that its talc products do not contain asbestos. 
Imerys said bankruptcy provided the best avenue for addressing its talc liability.
Bankruptcy provides Imerys a single forum to settle the widespread litigation. A similar strategy has been used by numerous companies facing litigation over faulty breast implants, products containing asbestos and recalled automotive airbags.
Two North American subsidiaries of Imerys, Imerys Talc Vermont and Imerys Talc Canada, also filed for Chapter 11 on Wednesday.
Total revenue in 2018 for Imerys Talc America was $174 million, according to records filed with the Delaware Bankruptcy Court.
COMPANY TO ESTABLISH A TRUST
Imerys said in court documents it plans to use bankruptcy to establish a trust to pay personal injury claims, a strategy typically used by companies facing asbestos claims. 
When the company leaves bankruptcy, current and future litigation claims will be channeled to the trust rather than Imerys, which would be freed from future lawsuits over talc.
Imerys could finance the trust with the disputed indemnity agreement with J&J and its right to insurance proceeds, which the company estimated could be worth around $700 million. It said it also has a right to an undetermined portion of up to $2 billion of Johnson & Johnson's insurance. 
However, the company said some of the policies exclude asbestos claims and none of them cover claims in which the first exposure occurred after 1986. In addition, punitive damages are often not covered. 
Imerys said it could exhaust some of those insurance proceeds within the first half of this year defending cases.
Court records show that the defense of a single case can cost $4 million.
As a co-defendant with J&J, Imerys has faced at least a dozen U.S. jury trials over allegations that its talc causes ovarian cancer or mesothelioma.
While some juries awarded damages as high as $2.75 million against Imerys Talc America, many verdicts were later thrown out on appeal.
Imerys and J&J have also won several trials or had cases result in mistrials due to hung juries. 
The verdicts against the company are all still on appeal and Imerys has not yet paid any of those verdicts. However, the company settled at least four cases before they went to trial for undisclosed amounts.
Mark Lanier, a Texas-based lawyer representing many of the talc plaintiffs, on Wednesday said Imerys Talc America's bankruptcy would not change the litigation. 
""We have always targeted our cases against J&J and Colgate Palmolive, the companies that put the asbestos laced talc into the products,"" Lanier said.
Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is another defendant in the U.S. talc litigation. The New York-based company sold Cashmere Bouquet, a cosmetic talcum powder, from 1871 to 1995.

Colgate did not respond to a request for comment. It has denied allegations that its talc products cause cancer.

Beyond trade, rising energy stocks powered the broader market higher. The gains reflected rising oil prices as Saudi Arabia's pledge to continue cutting output offset data showing a larger-than-expected build in domestic crude stockpiles.
Tech stocks struggled to get in on the rally, weighed down by weakness in FANG stocks.
Apple reportedly is nearing the launch of a new streaming service that will feature free original content for device owners, but may not include Netflix, CNBC reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 0.42%, and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) dropped 2.3%.
The CNBC report comes as Goldman Sachs said it expects the iPhone maker to launch a streaming service this spring or summer to plug the gap from a decline in service revenue on expectations of a material drop in traffic acquisition costs.
Traffic acquisition costs, the fee Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) pays companies for diverting traffic to its website, are expected to drop significantly this year, according to the bank.
""We forecast that traffic acquisition costs growth drops materially to about 29% in 2019 from 46% in 2018,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said.
On the economic front, mixed U.S. inflation data also supported the broader market amid expectations subdued price pressures would strengthen the Federal Reserve's case to hold off monetary policy tightening.
The Labor Department said on Thursday its consumer price index was flat January, after edging up 0.1% in the prior month. But core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 2.2% for the year through January, above forecasts for a 2.1% increase.
In Washington, Trump told reporters he would ""take a very serious look"" at the border security deal and reiterated he does not want the see a second government shutdown.

1201,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 05:37PM ET</span>","Apple aims for April launch of TV service with CBS, Viacom and Starz","By Kenneth Li and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is targeting an April event to introduce a streaming television service that will likely include subscription TV services from CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS), Viacom Inc and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp's Starz among others as well as its own original content, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
Apple has long hinted at a planned video service, spending $2 billion in Hollywood to produce its own content and signing major stars such as Oprah Winfrey. The TV service is expected to launch globally, a person familiar with the matter said, an ambitious move to rival services from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's Prime Video. Apple’s App Store, where the service is likely to be distributed, is currently available in more than 100 countries.
But it has kept its precise plans for how it will distribute those shows a secret, even as investors have started to fixate on revenue from paid subscriptions as a replacement for growth from iPhone sales, which declined over the holiday shopping quarter for the first time ever last year.
Apple aims to bring together its own shows into one central location with content from media companies, saving iPhone and other Apple device users from having to juggle multiple apps for those channels, the sources said. Apple is aiming to resell TV channels subscriptions similar to Amazon, whose Prime Video Service resells Starz and other channels and keeps a cut of the sales.
Apple is also in discussions with HBO, part of AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc-owned WarnerMedia, to become part of the service and it could yet make it in time for the launch, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The terms of Apple's deals could not be learned. Apple has typically sought a cut of between 30 percent for apps in the App Store to 15 percent for premium channel apps such as HBO.
Apple, CBS, HBO, Starz and Viacom declined to comment. CNBC earlier reported Apple was targeting an April or May launch for its service.
The television services launch comes as Apple builds out its services segment, which brought in $37.1 billion in its fiscal 2018.

The Wall Street Journal this week reported that major publishers such as the New York Times and Washington Post balked at the proposed terms of a possible paid news service from Apple in which the iPhone maker would keep as much as half of subscription revenues. An announcement for the news service is expected in March, Buzzfeed reported.

1. Retails Sales Arrive (Finally)
It’s been an awkward time for stock and bond traders who pore over every piece of economic data. The federal government is still catching up with delayed reports from the partial shutdown.
After a hiatus, the market will finally get the figures on December retail sales tomorrow when the Commerce Department releases it at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Economists expect that retail sales edged up 0.1% percent in December, according to Investing.com. Core retail sales, which exclude auto and gasoline sales, are seen remaining flat.
Household consumption accounts for about 70% of the U.S. economy.
The January gauge of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan hit its lowest level in two years as pessimism over the government shutdown and the uncertainty over the economic outlook made consumers cautious.
2. PPI, Jobless Claims on Their Way
Also at 8:30 AM ET, the government will report its latest figures on wholesale inflation.
The Labor Department will issue the producer price index (PPI) for January.
On average, economists expect that the PPI rose 0.1% last month, while the core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2%.
Retail inflation numbers out today were mixed, with the headline CPI flat, but the core CPI coming in a little hotter than expected year over year.Weekly initial jobless claims also arrive at the same time.
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are expected to fall to 225,000, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
3. Coke Before the Bell, Chips After
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) leads the earnings parade tomorrow before the bell.
On average, analysts are predicting a fourth-quarter profit of 43 cents per share on sales of about $7 billion.
The company had previously stated it expected 2018 revenue growth of 4%.
Shares are little changed over the last three months, but they're close to their 52-week highs seen in November.
After the bell, chipmaker Nvidia will report results.
Nvidia cut its outlook for Q4 revenue, citing weaker sales of ""gaming and data center platforms.""
Semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) will also weigh in postmarket."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed higher on Wednesday as investor optimism was stoked over hopes the United States and China could iron out a trade deal, and benign inflation data suggested the Federal Reserve would hold interest rates steady in the near term.
All three major U.S. stock indexes gained ground, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posting their fourth consecutive advances. For the second straight day, the S&P 500 closed above its 200-day moving average, a key technical level. 
Stocks briefly pared gains following a late-morning tweet by U.S. Senator Marco Rubio saying he would introduce a bill to ""tax corporate buybacks the same way as dividends.""
In Beijing, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said ""so far, so good,"" regarding ongoing talks aimed at resolving the U.S.-China trade dispute, adding he hoped for ""productive"" meetings in the days ahead.
""The markets are extremely vulnerable to news,"" said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton. ""(Investors are) waiting and hoping for good news to come out of the trade negotiations with China, and for continued signs that the economy is still growing at a healthy pace without heating up inflation.""
The U.S. Labor Department reported consumer prices were unchanged for the third consecutive month in January, in a sign the Fed could hold interest rates steady for the time being.
Fourth-quarter earnings season is approaching the finish line, with more than two-thirds of the S&P 500 having reported. 
While analysts now see fourth-quarter earnings growth of 16.6 percent, the outlook for the current quarter is less upbeat.
Fourth-quarter profit is projected to fall 0.3 percent from a year ago, marking the first loss since the earnings recession that ended in 2016, according to Refinitiv data. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 117.51 points, or 0.46 percent, to 25,543.27, the S&P 500 gained 8.3 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,753.03 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.76 points, or 0.08 percent, to 7,420.38.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but utilities and communications services ended the session in positive territory. 
Energy was the largest percentage gainer as oil prices saw their biggest increase since late January.
Groupon Inc sank 11.1 percent, one the biggest losers on the Nasdaq, as reduced traffic led to a fourth-quarter profit miss.
Generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Inc dropped 7.8 percent after forecasting a weaker-than-expected 2019 due to new competition for branded drugs.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co advanced 3.9 percent following news the conglomerate booked the most orders for electricity-generating gas turbines in 2018.
Levi Strauss & Co filed documents for an IPO after more than three decades as a privately-held company. Rivals Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) and  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) Inc all dipped on the news.
Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares rose in after-market trading after posting better-than-expected quarterly results as the network gear maker benefited from its shift to newer businesses. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.86-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.42-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 38 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 78 new highs and 19 new lows.

1205,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 04:30PM ET</span>","AIG swings to loss, hit by catastrophes and volatile market","By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) on Wednesday reported a quarterly loss as the insurer was hit with catastrophe losses and made a lower return on investments in a volatile market. 
Excluding realized investment gains and losses and some other items, AIG posted a loss of $559 million, or 63 cents per share, for the fourth-quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with income of $526 million, or 57 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. 
On that basis, Wall Street analysts expected income of 42 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company's general insurance unit reported an underwriting loss of $1.1 billion, compared with $846 million a year ago, largely due to Hurricane Michael and the California wildfires. 
Still, AIG said its general insurance accident year combined ratio - which excludes changes from losses incurred in past years - was 98.8 for the quarter, compared with 102 a year ago.
A ratio below 100 percent means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. The accident year ratio is a measurement that AIG Chief Executive Brian Duperreault has cited as the best gauge of the unit's long-term profitability. The number excludes catastrophe claims and reserve charges.
Duperreault, who took the helm at AIG in May 2017, has pledged to turn the company around. His most critical task is a return to profitable underwriting, something AIG has not achieved since 2007. 
The combined ratio in AIG's commercial insurance unit, which includes losses for catastrophes, was 115 compared to 113 in the year ago quarter.
In December, Duperreault said that AIG expected to enter 2019 ""with a slight underwriting profit"" in its general insurance unit. That would be just a waypoint on a path to a double-digit return on equity, a process that could take up to three years, he said. 
AIG remains on track to meet those objectives, Duperreault said in a statement on Wednesday.
""It's something that he's been very vocal about and he really needs to deliver,"" said James Breece, a portfolio manager and equity analyst for Spears Abacus Advisors LLC. The New York-based investment firm advises the Beehive Fund, which owned 150,250 shares of AIG as of Sept. 30.
The 2018 fourth quarter was challenging for insurers, given the tumultuous financial markets. AIG's shares plunged 26 percent, closing out the year at $39.41, while the S&P 500 Multi-line Insurance Index tanked by 19.5 percent, its biggest drop since 2012. 
Insurance investors fretted about everything from the impact of mass catastrophes, such as California's wildfires, on insurers' bottom lines to how the market mayhem affected life insurers' investment portfolios.
The broader S&P 500, in comparison, fell 13.7 percent. 
AIG’s life and retirement unit reported adjusted pre-tax income of $623 million, down 20 percent from $782 in the year-ago quarter.
AIG's total net investment income fell to $2.8 billion, in the quarter, from $3.5 billion, a year ago, reflecting a significant impact from market performance, the company said.
The insurer added $365 million to its reserves in the quarter, following the completion of a review by AIG’s chief actuary, Mark Lyons, who was also named chief financial officer in December.

AIG's decision to boost funds for paying future claims was driven largely by insurance policies the company issued in 2016 and earlier, the company said.

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 04:29PM ET</span>",Exclusive: FBI investigating top Vitol executives in Americas - sources,"By Brad Brooks and Gary McWilliams
RIO DE JANEIRO/HOUSTON (Reuters) - The FBI is investigating energy trading firm Vitol's top two executives in the Americas in connection with a Brazil bribery case, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said, deepening the U.S. role in a probe of foreign oil firms' dealings with state-controlled Petrobras. 
The FBI's targeting of the Vitol executives is the second recent sign that U.S. authorities are stepping up their involvement in the trading fraud case, the latest twist in Brazil's sweeping ""Car Wash"" corruption probe. 
That significantly increases dangers for Vitol, the world's largest independent oil trader, and other major trading firms like Trafigura and  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), also ensnared in the case.
(GRAPHIC: Volumes and revenues of the four oil traders - https://tmsnrt.rs/2zWgcLA)
Miguel ""Mike"" Loya, Vitol's U.S. head, and Antonio Maarraoui, the company's head for Latin American and the Caribbean, are under investigation by the U.S. law enforcement agency, the sources told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Vitol said it has a zero tolerance policy for bribery and corruption. Trafigura and Glencore have declined to comment on the U.S. investigation, with the latter reiterating past statements that it is cooperating with Brazilian authorities. Trafigura said it takes the allegations seriously.
All of the companies have been suspended from business dealings with Petroleo Brasileiro SA since Brazilian prosecutors accused the three trading firms in December of paying more than $30 million in bribes to its employees.
Petrobras declined to comment specifically on any FBI involvement, but said in an email that it remains committed to cooperating with investigators. The company previously said it was a victim of the alleged scheme.
U.S. prosecutors and their Brazilian counterparts have worked together on Car Wash cases in the past, including on forcing Brazil construction conglomerate Odebrecht to pay a record $2.6 billion fine in a 2016 leniency deal.
'KNOWINGLY' INVOLVED
Loya and Maarraoui, both Houston-based, have not been charged in Brazil. They also have not been charged in the United States and it is unclear whether the U.S. Justice Department will bring charges.
Neither Loya nor Maarraoui responded to requests for comment via email.
Brazilian prosecutors previously said Loya and Maarraoui ""knowingly and voluntarily"" arranged to bribe Petrobras employees using middlemen with whom the pair had direct. 
A Brazil federal police investigation includes several emails between Loya, Maarraoui and a group of middlemen, along with personal meetings, which often took place in Houston. 
Brazil prosecutors have said Loya and Maarraoui arranged for the middlemen to move illicit funds through U.S., European and offshore bank accounts. That money that was funneled to Petrobras employees, who in turn gave Vitol sweetheart deals on massive trades involving petroleum derivatives and fuel storage, they said.
Loya, part of a large and successful family in the energy business, joined Vitol as a trader in 1992 and became president of its Americas operation in 1999. He was considered to be in the running to lead the parent company a year ago. 
Coming from modest means in El Paso, Texas, Loya graduated from the University of Texas at El Paso and got his MBA at Harvard. He played rugby in college and now co-owns the SaberCats, a Major League Rugby team in Houston.
BIG TARGETS
The European firms - Vitol is based in London, the two others in Switzerland - are powerhouses in commodities trading and are by far the largest firms yet caught up in the Car Wash probe.
They have investments in strategic energy and commodity infrastructure around the world including Brazil. Together they control about 10 percent of the world's daily oil consumption and have revenues larger than Argentina's gross domestic product.
John Marzulli, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Richard Donoghue, declined to confirm or deny that an investigation into the men is underway by the office. The FBI's media relations office said by email that it ""neither confirms nor denies the existence of investigations.""
Last week, Reuters reported that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating a former U.S.-based oil trader for Petrobras who already is charged in Brazil with taking part in the alleged corruption scheme involving commodity companies Vitol, Glencore Plc and Trafigura AG. 
The trader, Rodrigo Garcia Berkowitz, 39, is cooperating with U.S. authorities in the investigation and may face charges in the United States, sources said.
Brazilian prosecutors have followed a pattern of first charging less important figures in schemes, then flipping them to turn state's witness and testify against more powerful figures.

The Car Wash investigations began in 2014 when a money laundering scheme was discovered at a gas station in the Brazilian capital Brasilia, leading to black market money dealers' links to top executives at Petrobras. It is the first major push against corruption and impunity for the rich and powerful in Brazil, and has profoundly shaken the political and business communities in Latin America's biggest economy.

The suspension of its shares comes a day after Helios was delisted from the Nasdaq. The shares started trading over the counter, the company said.
This may be the end of Helios and Matheson as a publicly listed company, but it marks the start of a new chapter for its subscription services business MoviePass Entertainment, which it acquired in December 2017.
Helios and Matheson said in October last year it would spin off MoviePass in a bid to separate the subscription services unit from the company's data analytics business.
MoviePass has been a problem child for Helios and Matheson as its $9.99 per month all-you-can-eat movie subscription model was fraught with issues.
The MoviePass app was clunky, much to the chagrin of customers. A move to cut back on the number of films customers could see in theaters using the subscription proved fatal as it came at a time when rivals, including AMC (NYSE:AMC), launched similar subscription plans.
But free from the shackles of Helios and Matheson, with discretion over its subscription plans, MoviePass is expected to adopt a simpler model to reel in subscribers.
MoviePass will adopt a bait-the-hook approach, or, more aptly, bait the screen with movies that MoviePass subscribers will pay to see in a bid to avoid some of the earlier pitfalls.
The road to new beginnings for MoviePass, however, is far from smooth as the experience of going to a movie theater is losing its luster to online streaming companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), according to a report.
""At $46 (billion), global subscription (over-the-top content delivered by the internet) revenues will overtake box office revenues in 2019 when theatrical takings will come in at just under $40 (billion),"" according to Ampere Analysis."

1212,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 03:04PM ET</span>",Apple ramps up self-driving program as Waymo says its tech improves,"By Stephen Nellis and Alexandria Sage
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has sharply increased its efforts to test self-driving cars on public roads but lags far behind market leader Waymo on a key safety metric, according to data released on Wednesday by the California Department of Motor Vehicles.
Apple, which has kept details of its self-driving program under wraps, put in 79,745 miles (128,337 km) of testing in California in 2018, still far short of 10 million miles of testing on roads around the world by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo. But the miles put in by Apple last year far surpassed the 838 miles of testing that the iPhone maker did the previous year.
The data was part of California regulators' annual so-called ""disengagement reports,"" which track how often a human safety driver must intervene to take control from a self-driving system during testing on public roads.
In the complex world of self-driving technology where road-test data is a closely guarded secret, the number of miles between disengagements has become a key metric for industry watchers to indicate how far any player's technology has progressed.
Waymo led the industry with 11,017 miles between disengagements in 2018, a 50 percent improvement from 5,595 miles the year before. Waymo said the improvement came despite driving 1.2 million miles in California, where roads are much busier than other areas where it is testing vehicles, such as suburban Arizona.
""A lower rate of disengagements shows that our cars are getting better at recognizing and handling a wide variety of driving situations, including 'edge cases' across the cities we’ve been testing in: those unusual situations that a human driver might see only once (or never) in a lifetime of driving,"" Waymo said in blog post.
Apple, by contrast, came in dead last, logging just over one mile per disengagement. In a letter to regulators, Apple said its approach to reporting disengagements had been ""conservative"" and that its report was ""over-inclusive.""
Apple said it changed how it categorized disengagements starting in July 2018. Since then, the company said it had driven about 2,000 miles between what it calls ""important disengagements,"" which it defined as ""situations that might have resulted in a safety-related event or a violation of the rules of the road."" At least two of those ""important disengagements"" happened when other human drivers hit its test vehicles, Apple said.
Apple declined to comment beyond its public documents, but even its re-worked disengagement numbers put it below other firms testing the technology.
General Motor's Cruise said it had driven 447,621 miles in California autonomously in 2018, with a disengagement every 5,205 miles on average, an improvement over every 1,236 miles last year. Cruise has yet to meet a target it set for early 2018 of driving 1 million miles autonomously per month.
Apple, which has only talked in general terms about its interest in self-driving, is a relative latecomer to the field, having only secured a California permit to conduct testing in 2017.
Last year Apple re-hired Doug Field to work on its self-driving car project, called Project Titan, with longtime executive Bob Mansfield. Field had previously left Apple to become senior vice president of engineering at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.

Some companies, including Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co , Tesla Inc, Lyft and German auto supplier Bosch, said they had performed no autonomous testing in California last year.

QUEBEC CITY (Reuters) - WestJet Airlines Ltd's new no-frills carrier Swoop said on Wednesday that most of its passengers are either new or infrequent flyers, helping the Canadian company's two airlines avoid competing for the same passenger.
Swoop President Steven Greenway said in an interview that more than 50 percent of its travelers had either never traveled by plane, or would not normally fly with WestJet or its domestic rival Air Canada.
""Given our model we are not cannibalizing, we are creating a new market,"" Greenway said by phone.
Swoop, launched in June 2018 as an ultra low cost carrier will grow from six to 10 aircraft in 2019 as it adds frequency. But the airline will add fewer routes compared with the 19 it launched last year, he said. 
WestJet, Canada's second largest carrier, said earlier this month it would take a prudent approach to adding capacity in 2019. WestJet is counting on Swoop to help drive higher revenues this year after a turbulent 2018.
Greenway said about 20 percent to 30 percent of Swoop's travelers to warm destinations such as Las Vegas or Mexico are ""repatriated Canadians"" who used to cross over the border to fly from U.S. airports on low cost rivals like Allegiant Airlines and Spirit Airlines. 
Greenway would not comment on an investigation by Canada's Competition Bureau into whether Swoop violated competition laws by selling flights at below-cost fares in order to force out smaller rivals. 

The investigation followed a complaint by startup budget carrier Flair Airlines and is supported by Canada Jetlines which expects to launch service this year.

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 02:16PM ET</span>",Cities shunned by Amazon revive hopes for HQ given New York opposition,"By Daniel Trotta
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cities that were shunned in Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's search for a secondary corporate headquarters are revisiting their bids in case one of the actual winners, New York City, rejects the corporate giant due to opposition from local politicians.
Chicago, Miami and Newark are among the passed-over finalists that have expressed interest in another chance to become the home of an Amazon project that could bring 25,000 jobs. Nashville, Tennessee, which was awarded a 5,000-person center, also said it was open to taking on a bigger role should New York withdraw from consideration.
Newark, New Jersey, some 15 miles (24 km) to the west of New York City, is willing to share the headquarters in the event its larger neighbor would be satisfied with a scaled-down project, said Aisha Glover, chief executive of Newark Alliance, the group leading that city's effort.
""We're definitely interested in reactivating our bid,"" Glover said, stressing the importance of keeping Amazon in the New York metropolitan area.
Amazon in November announced New York City and Arlington, Virginia, which borders Washington, D.C., would share the so-called HQ2 project, splitting some 50,000 jobs between the two places as the Seattle-based company looked to expand elsewhere.
But the New York project, to be based in the Long Island City neighborhood in the borough of Queens, just across the East River from Manhattan, has run into opposition from local politicians who oppose the $2.8-billion in incentives promised to Amazon in a deal secretly negotiated by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.
Among those leading the opposition is state Senator Michael Gianaris, a Democrat who represents the waterfront district where Amazon wants to locate. He criticized offering huge tax credits to a company that made a net profit of $3 billion last quarter and whose chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is listed by Forbes as the richest man in the world.
""The dollars are pointed in the wrong direction. Amazon is trying to take, take, take. There's no consideration of the devastation they would wreak on the surrounding community,"" said Gianaris, raising concerns about the impact on public transportation, schools and low-income housing that are already under strain.
The state senate has nominated Gianaris to the Public Authorities Control Board, which could sink the project as it has other deals in the past. In 2005, the board rejected a plan to build an Olympic and American football stadium in Manhattan.
Among Gianaris' allies is U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the rookie Democratic congresswoman from a nearby district whose progressive politics have captured a large national following.
Amazon has the support of other politicians including Cuomo, who has yet to ratify Gianaris' position on the control board.
Amazon said it is not reaching out to any finalists. 
“We appreciate hearing from locations we have worked with on HQ2 and other projects. We look forward to continuing the relationship as we make investment decisions in the future,” Amazon said Wednesday.
Cuomo's office did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
While the Amazon HQ does have its New York backers, the sustained opposition has led the company to reconsider other sites.
The Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos, cited two unnamed sources ""familiar with the company's thinking"" to report that Amazon executives held internal talks to reassess New York and consider alternatives. 
But other places may be just as unwelcoming. Nearly 50 left-leaning organizations from cities on Amazon's short shortlist published a letter saying they, too, opposed HQ2. https://ourhq2wishlist.org/dear-jeff
Still, Amazon received 238 proposals from across North America in a year-long bidding war, and Amazon named 20 finalists. Among the cities on the shortlist were Chicago, Miami, Dallas and Newark.
Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said he has yet to contact Amazon but that ""we welcome the opportunity to talk further"" with Amazon should it consider abandoning New York.
Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker's office said in a statement that he ""immediately called Amazon"" after the Washington Post report ""to make a full-throated pitch"" for the Chicago bid.
Nashville would ""evaluate the project and respond appropriately"" if Amazon presented a new opportunity, Jeff Hite, the senior vice president for economic development at the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.
The Dallas Regional Chamber of Commerce declined to comment.
New Jersey made one of the more aggressive bids, proposing up to $7 billion in potential tax credits. Glover, of the Newark Alliance, said she has reached out to the New York opponents to see if a shared headquarters would be more acceptable.
""If for some reason they want to pull out, either in whole or in part, Newark and New Jersey are ready, willing and able to accommodate them,"" Glover said. ""So we wanted to make sure that we were sending that message to Amazon in a very clear and direct way.""

1218,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 02:11PM ET</span>","T-Mobile, Sprint executives face skeptical House panel","By Diane Bartz and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Executives from T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp faced tough questions from lawmakers on Wednesday about how the companies' planned merger would affect prices and jobs, especially in rural America.
The deal to combine the No. 3 and No. 4 U.S. wireless carriers, struck in April, was approved by both companies' shareholders in October and has received national security clearance, but still needs approval from the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission.
Representative Mike Doyle, who chairs the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee panel holding the hearing, raised worries about the deal because the U.S. wireless market has just four main carriers. The industry leaders are AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ).
""It's hard to think of one (deal) where consolidation did not result in people losing their jobs, prices going up and innovation being stifled,"" Doyle said. 
Representative Billy Long, a Republican, expressed concern about lost jobs in his Missouri district. Representative Dave Loebsack, a Democrat, pointed to job losses in Iowa after T-Mobile's acquisition of Iowa Wireless last year and said T-Mobile's plan to buy Sprint made him ""very concerned"" about potential negative effects on Iowa.
Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said T-Mobile had sent call center jobs overseas in 2012 and asked for legally enforceable assurances that the new jobs touted by T-Mobile US Chief Executive John Legere would not be sent offshore once the deal wins approval.
Legere defended the $26 billion deal, arguing that it will create jobs and help with the construction of the next generation of wireless networks. He said the merged company would have more capacity which would lead to a push to lower prices. 
""This is a unique merger in that there will be a significant increase in supply,"" Legere said. To win support for the deal, T-Mobile previously said it would not increase prices for three years. 
Legere was not without supporters. Representatives Anna Eshoo, a Democrat, and Steve Scalise, a Republican, asked questions that indicated support for the deal.
In prepared remarks released on Tuesday, Legere pointed to the company's history of aggressive pricing, said it would need 11,000 new employees by 2024 and pledged to compete hard on building the next generation of wireless, called 5G.
He also pledged to create 5G without using networking equipment from Huawei Technologies Co Ltd or ZTE Corp (HK:0763), two Chinese telecommunications firms distrusted by U.S. national security experts.
T-Mobile has run into criticism from unions and consumer advocates, but rural operators have been the fiercest opponents.
Carri Bennet, general counsel at the Rural Wireless Association, said the merger ""will force rural Americans to pay more money for wireless services,"" especially if they contract with a mobile virtual network operator who buys wholesale access to Sprint's network and re-sells it.
She said that Sprint is the only one of the four national carriers that offers anything approximating commercially reasonable roaming rates to rural carriers. ""It (the merger) should be denied,"" she said. 
Communications Workers of America President Chris Shelton told the committee the deal would ""kill American jobs, lower wages, and raise prices.""
Consumer advocates have said that the poorest wireless customers were likely to be disproportionately hurt by the deal since Sprint and T-Mobile have a big market share in prepaid plans. 
A group of eight Democratic U.S. senators and independent Senator Bernie Sanders urged the Justice Department and FCC on Tuesday to reject the deal, saying monthly bills could rise as much as 10 percent.
Lawmakers who signed the letter include potential or confirmed presidential candidates Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Sherrod Brown, Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker.

Sprint shares were up 0.2 percent in midday trade while T-Mobile shares fell 0.7 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's markets regulator urged lawmakers on Wednesday to give it ""rapid"" response powers to deal with problems that may arise after Brexit.
The European Parliament has proposed that ESMA should have powers to issue ""no action letters"" that tell firms they will not face sanctions if they do not comply with a rule or deadline after Britain leaves the EU.
Such letters are used by U.S. regulators, and would avoid the EU having to make time-consuming legislative changes if temporary problems with rules crop up.
After Brexit, the EU will have a large, liquid and interconnected capital market next door which is no longer subject to the bloc's rules, Steven Maijoor, chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority, said.
""This creates the need to have tools to react rapidly to new developments,"" he told an industry event in Dublin.
Lawyers said the comments signaled an arm's length relationship with the EU for Britain's financial sector after decades of being deeply interlinked.
""The reference to the large liquid market ‘next door’ emphasizes the imminent gulf between London and the EU, with their interconnectivity a justification for enhanced regulatory vigilance, rather than an opportunity for convergence,"" Simon Morris, a financial services lawyer at CMS, said.
Banks and insurers in Britain face patchy access to EU customers in future, based on a system of market access known as equivalence and used by Japan and the United States.
Maijoor signaled that Brexit would mean a more hands-on approach to applying equivalence to the EU's neighbor.
""Equivalence assessments need to be conducted more frequently to detect changes on time,"" Maijoor said.
The bloc is toughening up conditions for granting access to foreign clearing houses and Maijoor said it was essential that these changes were completed in time for Brexit.

London-based LCH dominates clearing of euro denominated derivatives, and its chief executive said on Wednesday there was no sign of big shifts in volumes to rivals.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Wednesday it was recalling about 1.48 million F-150 pickup trucks in North America due to a potential transmission downshift issue that could increase the risk of a crash.
Ford said select 2011-2013 model year trucks with six-speed automatic transmission could experience an unintended downshift into first gear without warning, which could result in the loss of vehicle control. Ford is aware of five accidents, including one report of whiplash potentially related to the issue.
The recall covers 1.26 million trucks in the United States and 221,000 in Canada. Dealers will update the powertrain control software and the company will notify customers next month.
In March 2016, Ford recalled 153,000 U.S. 2011-2012 Ford F-150, Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator vehicles for a similar transmission downshift problem. Ford spokeswoman Monique Brentley said the root cause was different than in the new recall.
In December 2017, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into whether that recall should be expanded by nearly 1.4 million 2011-2013 vehicles after 123 complaints and two crashes but no reported injuries.
The agency said an unexpected downshift ""can cause the vehicle to slow down suddenly and without warning. This can also cause the rear tires to skid or lock up, increasing the risk of a crash.""
The investigation is pending.
Ford also said it is issuing two other recalls. One covers 28,200 2017-19 Lincoln Continental vehicles in North America for door latches that may not engage due to the buildup of silicon contamination and could result in the door opening while driving.
Ford said it was not aware of any reports of accidents or injuries. Dealers will replace the door latch assemblies in all four doors.

Ford is also recalling 4,200 2019 model Ford Mustang, Lincoln Nautilus and Lincoln Navigator vehicles for instrument panel cluster assemblies that are blank when the vehicles are started. Dealers will update the software. No crashes are reported linked to the recall.

1230,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 11:53AM ET</span>","Union Investment to buy 16,000 German apartments from Chinese firm: sources","By Arno Schuetze
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German fund manager Union Investment is nearing a deal to buy about 16,000 German flats for roughly 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) from a Chinese investor, people close to the matter told Reuters. 
BGP and Union Investment confirmed the deal but declined to give financial details. The deal would be the first in Germany's buoyant property market in which a fund manager has made such a large acquisition. 
The transaction will involve Union buying BGP, which owns the properties, with a view to offering the real estate to retail investors, the sources said.
The portfolio of apartments is being sold by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Real Estate Investing (MSREF), whose main investor is China's sovereign wealth fund CIC. 
Union Investment plans to merge BGP with its own property platform and eventually transfer the BGP properties to its investment funds, the sources added. 
Union Investment and BGP said in a statement that the acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2019.
Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while CIC had no immediate comment.
With the deal, Union Investment and its partner ZBI Zentral Boden Immobilien Gruppe - 49.9 percent owned by Union Investment - plan to strengthen their joint residential real estate fund platform and increase the volume of managed funds, the fund manager said. 
BGP's acquisition of the apartments in 2016 had been the first major Chinese investment in German homes. Chinese real estate investors then became a regular sight in many German cities, according to real estate agents.
BGP was formed in 2005 as a joint venture between Australian investment group Babcock & Brown and property group GPT and at one stage was worth 4 billion euros. 
Babcock & Brown was liquidated in 2009 and GPT shareholders received shares in BGP. These securities were held mainly by funds and 58,000 primarily Australian retail investors.
For decades, Germans enjoyed comparably cheap housing. But ultra-low interest rates, foreign investment and a failure to build enough flats to keep pace with an influx of people to big cities have pushed up house prices and rents in recent years.
German home prices have risen by 60 percent since 2010, according to Fitch Ratings. That has prompted German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government to set out a raft of measures to try to speed up the construction of housing and limit rent rises.
Banking on a prolonged boom of the German property market, Union Investment hopes its planned real estate funds will meet abundant demand. 
Half of BGP's apartments are located in Berlin with the rest mainly in cities such Cologne, Duesseldorf, Muenster and Kiel. 
In a separate deal, Germany's second-largest housing group Deutsche Wohnen is planning to buy a portfolio of 2,800 apartments in Cologne, Duesseldorf and Frankfurt for roughly 750 million euros from investor Akelius, two people familiar with that deal said. 
Deutsche Wohnen declined to comment, while Akelius was not immediately available for comment.

1231,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 11:43AM ET</span>",Nestle set to sell first Starbucks coffee under $7.15 billion deal,"VEVEY, Switzerland (Reuters) - Nestle will sell Starbucks-branded coffee at grocery stores and online in Europe, Asia and Latin America from this month as it seeks to increase its lead over rivals such as JAB.
After last year's $7.15 billion cash deal for exclusive rights to sell the U.S. chain's coffees and teas, Nestle will start selling Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) labeled coffee beans, roast and ground coffee and single-serve capsules for its Nespresso and Nescafe Dolce Gusto coffee makers.
These will be available at grocery stores and online in 14 markets, including Belgium, Brazil, Chile, China, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain and Britain, with more markets following later this year, the world's biggest food group said on Wednesday.
Asked whether the launch of Starbucks Nespresso capsules would help Nespresso return to double-digit growth, Patrice Bula, executive vice president and head of strategic business units, marketing, sales and Nespresso, told a media briefing: ""Yes, I hope so, yes. We have huge ambitions."" 
He said he was also confident of accelerating Nestle's strong U.S. coffee business that was boosted by the Starbucks deal and saw strong potential in markets like India and China.
""It is a landmark for us, a new growth platform, a moment where we can accelerate in the premium segment,"" he said.
Starbucks, the world's biggest coffee chain, has been selling its coffee for use at home -- including a variety of roasts in whole beans, instant or ground versions as well as coffee pods for its Verismo brewers and JAB's Keurig K-Cup system -- across North America and in some international markets for years. 
Nestle is building on this existing product range and taking it to new markets under the deal struck last May which allows Starbucks to focus on its cafes and Nestle, with its retail expertise, to bring Starbucks coffee to supermarket shelves around the world.
David Rennie, head of coffee, said Nestle could still consider strategic acquisitions in the coffee sector. 
""Never say never, but we believe we have three iconic brands today and will focus on developing these.""
Under last year's deal Starbucks, which is expanding in China and finally ventured into coffee-obsessed Italy in September, will have its out-of-home business managed by Nestle, while continuing to sell its ready-to-drink products directly.

Nestle is due to publish full-year results on Thursday.

Levi's, one of the world's biggest denim brands and the inventor of blue jeans, faces rapid changes in consumer tastes as people shop for cheaper store brands and look for more comfortable clothing like jogging pants.
Last year, rival VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) said it would spin off its less profitable Wrangler and Lee jeans business into a publicly traded company, allowing it to focus on Vans and its outdoor wear businesses to help improve profit margins.
The 145-year-old company, which intends to list as ""LEVI"", set a placeholder amount of $100 million to indicate the size of the IPO. The final size of the IPO could be different.
The company could be valued at around $5 billion when it debuts, a CNBC report said in November.
The privately held company is controlled by the descendents of founder Levi Strauss. It is required to post quarterly earnings with U.S. regulators as it its Japanese arm, Levi Strauss K.K, is publicly traded in Tokyo.
In its latest report, the company said sales rose nearly 9 percent to $1.59 billion. Its filings also show that it has halved its debt load over the last two years.
Levi Strauss sells in products in over 50,000 retail locations, including about 3,000 standalone stores and shops-in-shops across 110 countries. It sells apparel under the Levi's, Dockers and Denizen brands.
With the IPO filing, the company joins a list of high-profile companies seeking to go public this year including Uber Technologies, Lyft, Pinterest and Airbnb.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), BofA Merrill Lynch and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are part of a 12-member underwriting team handling the IPO.

1236,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 11:15AM ET</span>",Carlsberg rolls out the smart barrel,"By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - It is almost a barman's dream - a keg that can monitor beer levels and alert the brewery for more supplies when stocks are running low, cutting the risk of running out of beer.
Not only that, the keg can keep beer fresher for longer, banishing the scourge of the flat pint.
Pity it just can't change itself yet.
Faced with stagnating sales of mainstream beer, and drinkers switching to wines and spirits, brewers have been forced to innovate to keep bar owners happy and sell them a broader range of products, helping them boost their own margins along the way. 
Danish brewer Carlsberg (CO:CARLa) is introducing the smart beer keg, allowing bar staff to monitor keg levels real-time on a tablet. The data it collects will help both the brewer and the outlets predict which beer will be in demand at certain times of day or during the year.
""This allows us to make sure the right product is available at the right place at the right time,"" Nancy Cruickshank, who heads digital transformation at Carlsberg, said in an interview.
The smart kegs are made of plastic rather than the traditional heavy steel, commonplace for the last 60-70 years. 
Carlsberg's keg is being rolled out in Western Europe and some Chinese cities, while the digital system around the keg has been tested in Berlin and will be launched in Copenhagen, Malmo and Milan next month.
Carlsberg is not the only brewer with a PET plastic keg. AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, offers Stella Artois and other brands in its ""PureDraught"" kegs, while global number two Heineken has a variety of beers for its ""Blade"" and ""BrewLock"" systems.
The new lighter plastic keg uses compressed air to push out the beer rather than CO2, which keeps it fresh for up to 30 days compared to less than a week with the old steel kegs.
Carlsberg says it allows bars and restaurants to try out some of the lesser known and more expensive beers because they don't run the risk of the beer going flat.
This also helps brewers in their drive to boost margins, with sales of more premium brews, including craft, and gives drinkers the chance to sample them as draught rather than just in bottles.
""This very much fits with consumers' demand for different types of tastes and products. And they're really willing to pay for them,"" Cruickshank said. ""This is a chance for us to access a higher-margin market."" 

The switch to plastic goes against an increasing trend among food and beverage makers to turn away from single-use plastic packaging, as consumers become more environment conscious. Carlsberg said although the kegs are single-use, it is working on a plan to collect and recycle them.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 10:43AM ET</span>",Exclusive: BT executives knew of accounting fraud in Italy unit - prosecutors,"By Emilio Parodi
MILAN (Reuters) - A preliminary criminal investigation into an accounting scandal at the Italian unit of British telecom firm BT has alleged that three top executives of the group were aware of bookkeeping fraud at the unit, according to a document prepared by Italian prosecutors.
The document, which wraps up the preliminary investigation, alleges that a network of people in BT Italy exaggerated revenues, faked contract renewals and invoices and invented bogus supplier transactions in order to meet bonus targets and disguise the unit's true financial performance.
The closing of the preliminary probe is the final step before prosecutors press charges against the suspects. Under Italian law those under investigation now have three weeks to show why they should not be charged.
In the document, handed this week to parties involved in the investigation and seen by Reuters, prosecutors for the first time have named group executives as suspects in the case, though the prosecutors say all three have left BT since the scandal surfaced. Two of them were based in London.
The document also lists BT Italy as a subject of the investigation, no longer as a damaged party.
In an emailed statement, BT said: ""It would be inappropriate to comment on an ongoing criminal investigation.""
In the document, prosecutors name Luis Alvarez and Richard Cameron, respectively former chief executive and former chief financial officer of BT Global Services - one of the biggest divisions of BT Group (LON:BT) - and Corrado Sciolla, formerly BT's head of continental Europe, among an expanded list of 23 suspects. Alvarez and Cameron were based in London, while Sciolla was in Milan.
The three are accused of setting unrealistically high business targets and of complicity in false accounting at BT Italy, which formed part of the Global Services division, according to the document.
A lawyer acting for the three could not be immediately reached for comment.
AUDITOR PROBE
The document also reveals that an Italian partner of BT's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, is under investigation over the scandal, which erupted in 2017 and led the group to write off 530 million pounds ($685 million).
In the document prosecutors allege Andrea Alessandri, who led the PwC team in charge of auditing BT Italia's accounts, falsified the audit.
Reuters could not immediately contact Alessandri for comment. A PwC spokeswoman said the company had no immediate comment.
When the scandal broke in early 2017, BT's then chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said that the company could not have detected the problem sooner as top managers in London were unaware. BT filed its own criminal complaint against several of BT's Italian managers in 2017. It is contesting class-action lawsuits by shareholders who say the group misled investors and failed to promptly disclose the irregularities.
Prosecutors have also placed BT Italia under investigation. Under Italian law, a company can be deemed responsible for alleged crimes committed by its top executives.
BT said in January 2017 that Sciolla was leaving the company and in May 2017 announced the replacement of Alvarez. It was not immediately clear when Cameron left BT. 
Patterson, who is not under investigation, stepped down on Jan. 31 this year. BT said it would not be possible to get a comment from him on the probe.

Britain's accounting regulator said in June 2017 it would investigate audits by PwC of BT Group in the wake of the Italian scandal. PwC said at the time the British regulator's annual review of its audit work, policies and procedures showed a continued trend of improvement in PwC's work.

Greek equities fell 23.6 percent in 2018, a tough year in which banks took a beating. But mid-cap shares bucked the downtrend for a second straight year.
""It was the year of mid-caps,"" Socrates Lazaridis, CEO at Hellenic Exchanges told reporters. ""But for the first time, the market capitalization of banks fell below 10 percent of the stock market's total capitalization.""
Greece's five listed banks have struggled to shrink their mountains of bad loans and return to sustained profitability. 
Foreign investors held 22.3 billion euros ($25.2 billion) of Greek stocks or 63.3 percent of total market capitalization, which fell to 45 billion euros at the end of 2018 from 54.1 billion in 2017.
Foreign funds accounted for 56 percent of total trading activity last year, or 7.8 billion euros, executives said.
Fund raising on the Greek bourse totaled just 450 million euros via four new corporate bond issues and only one new listing.

Hellenic Exchanges, which is 60 percent owned by foreign funds, is preparing infrastructure for a new electricity exchange which authorities plan to launch later this year, executives said.

1243,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 10:15AM ET</span>",President Macron to unveil plan to give Europe's electric battery industry a jolt,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will invest 700 million euros ($790 million) over the next five years into projects to boost the European electric car battery industry and reduce its carmakers' reliance on dominant Asian rivals, said French presidency officials.
In a speech to the Paris-based International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers later on Wednesday, President Emmanuel Macron will unveil his strategy to help the French car industry fend off competition on electric vehicles (EV) and autonomous cars from Asian and U.S. tech giants.
The plan comes after Germany in November set aside 1 billion euros to support battery cell production to reduce dependence on Asian suppliers and shore up jobs at home that may be at risk from the shift away from combustion engines.
French officials said the two European countries will work on Franco-German initiatives, at a time when their countries' carmakers are waking up to the threats posed from relying on Chinese suppliers in an age of international trade wars.
""For a long time, European carmakers considered it was not up to them to develop battery production,"" a French official said. 
""Now, those advocating for an international division of labor are forced to realize that trade war exists,"" added the official.
While some carmakers assemble battery packs, Europe has no significant production of their constituent cells - currently dominated by a handful of firms including China's CATL and Korean rivals LG Chem and Samsung (KS:005930)
""China has a very aggressive strategy to eventually dominate the electric vehicle universe by starting from electric batteries all the way up the value chain,"" the official said. 
Peugeot-maker PSA threw its support behind efforts to create a European manufacturer of electric car batteries in March last year.
Domestic rival  Renault  (PA:RENA), which sources electric-car batteries from LG Chem, also said it could buy cells from a European supplier as production of electric vehicles ramps up.
""We're noticing a realization among carmakers that tomorrow's competition will require a local battery industry,"" the French official said. 

Macron's plan will also include facilitating the construction of electric vehicle (EV) charging points, giving more visibility to carmakers about electric vehicle bonuses for consumers and increasing the government's EV purchasing targets.

Trump is considering signing a bipartisan spending deal on border security that gives him less money than he originally asked for, Sarah Sanders told Fox News in an interview.
The S&P 500 rose 8 points or 0.31% as of 9:31 AM ET (14:31 GMT), while the Dow gained 95 points, or 0.38%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 21 points, or 0.29%.
Investor sentiment was also boosted after Trump said on Tuesday he could push back the March 1 deadline for imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports if the two sides were close to settling their differences. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are scheduled to hold talks on Thursday and Friday in Beijing.
""The market is taking into consideration the fact that they are talking and there's also the deal to avoid another possible government shutdown which is being viewed as a positive,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager, at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.
Data earlier in the day showed that U.S. consumer prices  were unchanged in January while annual inflation ran at the slowest rate in over one-and-a-half years, increasing chances that the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady this year.
Technology stocks were among the top gainers after the morning bell, with  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) up 1.9%, Alphabet A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) up 1% and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rising 0.6%.

1246,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 09:14AM ET</span>",Global stocks greet sign of trade truce extension with glee,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors hungry for progress on resolving a U.S.-China trade war seized on U.S. President Donald Trump’s comment that he could let a March 1 deadline for a deal with China ""slide"", taking this as a cue to buy stocks and sell bonds on Wednesday. 
As U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer prepared for talks in Beijing to hammer out a trade deal, markets cheered the signal that there could be an extension to a tariff truce.
European shares followed Asia's lead to rise 0.8 percent while S&P 500 futures rose 0.4 percent and Nasdaq futures gained 0.5 percent, pointing to a strong Wall Street open.
U.S. inflation figures which confirmed consumer prices were unchanged for a third straight month in January helped boost the STOXX 600 to the day's high and gave U.S. futures a nudge higher.
Investors welcomed this further sign U.S. inflation is cooling as adding to the Federal Reserve's argument against raising rates. 
""The Fed's new reaction function is they need to see inflationary pressures before they hike again, and clearly we've seen those inflationary pressures aren't there,"" said Mohammed Kazmi, portfolio manager at UBP in Geneva.
European chemicals, carmakers, and luxury goods saw the biggest gains as investors snatched stocks whose valuations have been hit by trade tariffs and a slowdown in China.
China's blue-chip CSI 300 rose around 2 percent to a four-month high overnight, with IT shares leading gains.
Trump said on Tuesday he could see letting the March 1 deadline for reaching a trade agreement with China ""slide for a little while"" if the two sides were close to a deal.
He added, though, he is ""not inclined"" to delay raising tariffs.
""There's still a level of uncertainty there but at least the rhetoric does not show he is digging his heels in, so the market has quite rightly taken it as a positive,"" said Justin Onuekwusi, fund manager at Legal & General Investment Management. 
""But of course the key thing is he can change his mind.""
Investors remained concerned about underlying trends of slowing economic growth and weaker earnings. Analysts have slashed their 2019 earnings growth estimates for developed world stocks from around 10 percent to 5 percent. 
Investors went back into risky assets and sold safe-haven government bonds, driving yields up. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a one-week high at 2.7060 percent.
In Europe, political uncertainty in Spain bubbled up.
Spain's IBEX lagged the market and Spanish bond yields rose after parliament rejected the Socialist government's 2019 budget proposal, raising the chances of a snap general election. 
CENTRAL BANK SUPPORT 
Risk assets have also been helped up by central banks' dovish shift.
The Federal Reserve will chart plans to stop letting its bond holdings roll off ""at coming meetings,"" Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said on Tuesday, signaling another major policy shift for the Fed after pausing interest rate hikes.
""Mester's comments follow on quite clearly from what Powell said at the recent press conference, which was already quite a dovish shift which the market wasn't expecting,"" said UBP's Kazmi.
""Everyone wants to catch this rally because they know at some point it will fade, there will have to be some sort of adjustment later this year because this is pretty much as dovish as [the Fed] can get without moving to a rate cut.""
Progress on another issue unnerving markets - the U.S. government shutdown - also provided a boost to risk appetite.
The Cboe Volatility Index, Wall Street's so-called ""fear gauge,"" dropped overnight to 14.95, its lowest level since October.
The U.S. dollar managed a 0.2 percent rise to 96.930 after the inflation figures. 
Slipping deadlines were front and center not only on the trade war front but also in Brexit.
Sterling briefly spiked half a percent on Wednesday, propelled by large purchase orders executed in a thin market, while renewed suggestions of a delay to Britain's exit from the European Union also lifted sentiment on the currency.
Emerging market stocks faltered, trading flat on the day. BAML on Tuesday said investors saw emerging markets as the ""most crowded"" trade, for the first time ever.
In commodities, oil prices surged after OPEC said it cut production sharply in January, and as U.S. sanctions hit Venezuela's oil exports.
London copper prices eyed their first session of gains in five as hopes of a trade deal soothed concerns over the economy in China, the world's biggest metals consumer.

1247,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 09:00AM ET</span>",Barclays says has spent up to 200 million pounds on Brexit,"By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) -  Barclays  (LON:BARC) has spent 100 to 200 million pounds ($129-258 million) moving operations and staff out of Britain to prepare for Brexit, its UK chairman Gerry Grimstone said on Wednesday as bank bosses detailed the costs involved.
International banks have been setting up subsidiaries across the European Union since Britain voted to leave the bloc in 2016 to ensure they can continue to serve clients if their operations in London lose the rights to do so from March 29.
Barclays has moved its European headquarters and almost 200 billion euros in assets to Dublin and last year began shifting 40 to 50 investment banking jobs to Frankfurt from London.
Grimstone detailed Barclays' costs after Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Vice Chairman Anne Finucane told a banking conference in Dublin that her bank had spent $400 million on its Brexit preparations.
""I hate to say that we're more cost effective than Bank of America. We've certainly spent 100, 150 or 200 million,"" Grimstone said at Dublin's annual European Financial Forum.
Morgan Stanley's head of EMEA, Clare Woodman, declined to say how much the bank had spent on its moves to Paris and Frankfurt.
Grimstone said Barclays had swiftly moved to take advantage of the new environment.
""We identified a couple of years ago that there were huge opportunities for us. We haven't been dragged kicking and screaming to this,"" he said of Barclays' new Dublin office. It can accommodate a staff of 400 and 1,700 staff around Europe will report to it.
""We believe this will give us a competitive advantage on the continent which we haven't had before,"" he said.

""At the same time as expanding here, we are expanding our trading presence in Frankfurt and we will use this to be a major force in the euro market and in euro clearing.""

1250,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 08:15AM ET</span>",Investors taking stock of whether AIG will hit profit target,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - As American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) reports its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, investors will be looking to see if the insurer is closing in on an elusive profit target.
AIG's chief executive officer, Brian Duperreault, who took charge of the firm in May 2017, has pledged to turn the company around. His most critical task is the return to profitability of underwriting of risks, a key measure of an insurer's performance that AIG has not achieved since 2007.
In December, Duperreault said that AIG expected to enter 2019 ""with a slight underwriting profit"" in its general insurance unit. Investors are watching for signs that AIG will make good on that prediction.
""It's something that he's been very vocal about and he really needs to deliver,"" said James Breece, a portfolio manager and equity analyst for Spears Abacus Advisors LLC. The New York-based investment firm advises the Beehive Fund, which owned 150,250 shares of AIG as of Sept. 30.
It would be surprising for Duperreault to miss the mark, given the seasoned executives he hired to spur change and other restructuring efforts he has led since arriving, Breece said.
The 2018 fourth quarter was challenging for insurers, given the tumultuous financial markets during the period. AIG's shares plunged 26 percent, closing out the year at $39.41, while the S&P 500 Multi-line Insurance Index tanked by 19.5 percent, its biggest drop since 2012. 
Insurance investors fretted about everything from the impact of mass catastrophes, such as California's wildfires, on insurers' bottom lines to how the market mayhem affected life insurers' investment portfolios.
The broader S&P 500, in comparison, fell 13.7 percent. 
AIG's businesses include both commercial property and casualty coverage and life insurance.
In early December, AIG said it had racked up an estimated $750 million to $800 million in catastrophe losses so far during the fourth quarter.
Analysts said they will be looking at whether those numbers will hold and if AIG's Bermuda reinsurance unit, Validus Holdings, Ltd., will have sustained more than the $60 million pretax loss for wildfires disclosed in December. 
So far this year, AIG's stock is up more than 11 percent to $43.83, outpacing gains of the S&P 500 Multi-line Insurance Index and S&P 500 of about 9 percent. Still, its shares are down 36 percent since Duperreault took charge in 2017. 
A slight underwriting profit for AIG's general insurance unit would help fuel an 8 percent adjusted return on equity ""going into 2019,"" Duperreault said in December. That would be just a waypoint on a path to a double-digit return on equity, a process that could take up to three years, he said. 
Some competitors, including Hartford Financial Services Group (NYSE:HIG), Inc and The Travelers Companies Inc (NYSE:TRV), produced double-digit returns in 2018.
Investors crave details about how AIG will turn itself around, analysts said.
""Someone looking at owning this stock over the next few years will want to know what the path is toward a continued underwriting profit and what the chances are that AIG is going to get there,"" said Neuberger Berman analyst Michelle Giordano-Valentine.
The quarter will also shine a light on the final stretch of a review by AIG of its reserves for paying future claims.
AIG's chief actuary, Mark Lyons, who was also named chief financial officer in December, said in November that he was about to review the remaining 25 percent of AIG's reserves, including for the financial lines insurance business and some international casualty coverage.

Lyons said at the time that he did not see any ""material red flags"" in the remaining reserves.

1254,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",Venezuela oil firm transferred millions of euros to Bulgarian bank accounts: security officials,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria has blocked transfers out of several bank accounts which have received millions of euros from Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA (Petroleos de Venezuela), security officials said on Wednesday.
Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido assumed presidency of the country three weeks ago, arguing that Nicolas Maduro's re-election last year was a sham. The United States and most Western countries, including Bulgaria, have recognized Guaido as the legitimate head of state, but Maduro retains the backing of Russia and China and control of state institutions.
Acting on a tip-off from the U.S., Bulgaria's security services were checking accounts held at a local bank, by a man who had several citizenships, including a Bulgarian one, Bulgaria's chief prosecutor, Sotir Tsatsarov said.
The money that came into the accounts was being sent to accounts abroad, Tsatsarov told reporters after a meeting with the U.S. ambassador to Sofia at the government building.
""We have established that there were money transfers from Venezuela, namely from the state oil company of Venezuela to these accounts,"" Tsatsarov told reporters.
""All measures have been taken so that the funds that are still in the accounts, which are not in small amounts, will be fully under our control and not leave the country on false grounds,"" he said. 
There are millions of euros in the accounts, according to the head of the State National Security Agency, Dimitar Georgiev, who said the Bulgarian central bank was cooperating in the process. 
Prosecutors will be looking at all the transfers into and out of these accounts before deciding whether to raise money laundering charges, Tsatsarov said, adding that the bank itself was not under suspicion. 
""Our government is working very closely with Bulgaria and other members of European Union to ensure that the wealth of the people of Venezuela is not stolen,"" the U.S. ambassador to Sofia, Eric Rubin, said after the meeting.

PDVSA is looking to increase exports to places like India as U.S. sanctions, designed to cut off the flow of foreign currency to Maduro's government, hobble its deliveries to the United States and Europe.

1255,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>","Huawei Says Security Concerns Aren’t Slowing Sales, For Now","(Bloomberg) -- Rising global concerns over security aren’t impeding sales of Huawei Technologies Co. for now, although that may change if government pressure, led by the U.S., forces mobile operators to delay investments, an official at the Chinese company said Wednesday.
U.S. lawmakers and the administration of President Donald Trump have said Huawei poses a potential security threat and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo this week urged allies to shun the Shenzhen-based company. Huawei has said that it’s privately held, doesn’t take orders from the Beijing government, and wouldn’t do so because that would ruin its global business.
“At this point in time we do not see a slowdown in sales on Huawei network gear or on devices,” Huawei’s Cyber Security Officer and Privacy Officer Jaap Meijer told reporters in Warsaw. “Let there be no mistake, if the situation that’s taking place will continue for a lot longer then at some point in time of course it will impact our business progress as well.”
Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei said in mid-January that he was confident his company’s revenue would grow to $125 billion in 2019 from more than $100 billion last year.
Huawei is in talks with governments across Europe on security standards for new technology, although it’s been unable to engage the U.S. in similar negotiations. Pompeo came close to issuing an us-or-them ultimatum to European nations buying from the company, saying in Hungary on Tuesday that contracts with the giant could limit the availability of U.S. equipment.
This poses risks to a speedy roll-out of fifth-generation mobile technology infrastructure, of which Huawei is a leading global supplier. The company’s future growth in Poland has been under scrutiny since one of its employees was arrested last month on suspicion of espionage, along with a former Polish security services agent.
Asked if Pompeo’s remarks constituted bullying, Huawei U.S. Chief Security Officer Andy Purdy, said: “We hope that the determination and forcefulness that is being expressed against us can be channeled into efforts to better” define and mitigate risks, which should lead to stricter standards for all suppliers.

The company said its pay-TV business, which includes both satellite TV and streaming service Sling TV, lost a net 334,000 subscribers during the fourth quarter, more than what analysts had expected Dish to lose at 264,000, according to research firm FactSet.
Dish’s core satellite TV business has been struggling from ""cord-cutting,"" as consumers cancel their cable and satellite television subscriptions and increasingly shift to online video streaming.
Net income attributable to Dish Network fell to $337 million, or 64 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $1.39 billion, or $2.64 per share, a year earlier when it recorded an about $1.2 billion tax gain.
Dish reported 64 cents in diluted earnings per share for the quarter.
Analysts on average had expected the company to report a profit of 67 cents per share on revenue of $3.28 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Revenue fell to $3.31 billion from $3.48 billion.

The hotel industry in the United States has thrived in the backdrop of a robust economy, allowing corporations to raise their travel budgets which helped hotel occupancy rates hit a record high last year.
However, top hotel operators, including Hilton and Marriott, have pointed to a deceleration in revenue growth per room in 2019, as global economic activity slows and trade tensions weigh on corporate capital spending plans.
Hilton cut its 2019 RevPAR growth outlook to a range of 1 percent to 3 percent, from an earlier forecast of an increase between 2 percent and 4 percent.
Revenue per available room (RevPAR), a key performance metric for the hotel industry, is calculated by multiplying a hotel's average daily room rate by its occupancy rate.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned 79 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, beating analysts' estimates of 69 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue rose to $2.29 billion from $2.07 billion.

""We won't support a merger at any price,"" Markus Grolms, vice chairman of Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board and secretary at IG Metall, Germany's biggest labor union, told Reuters.
Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) and Tata Steel are planning to combine their European steel activities to create the continent's No. 2 steelmaker after ArcelorMittal, raising concerns that far-reaching remedies are required to secure antitrust approval.
The European Commission is expected to sent a so-called statement of objections this week in which it will outline areas of particular competitive concerns, forcing the companies to come up with remedy ideas to avoid a potential veto.
""We have always defined a red line with regard to the merger control proceedings. If this line is crossed we won't give our support,"" Grolms said, without saying where the line would be drawn.
Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff a day earlier said the Commission's statement, expected at the end of the week, was not unusual given the transaction's size and gave no reason for fresh concerns.

The steel-to-submarines group is still confident it can complete the deal in early 2019. The European Commission will rule on the transaction by April 29.

""Many customers tried to get their goods through to the U.S. ahead of time in second half 2018, creating additional growth,"" Rolf Habben Jansen, chief executive of the company that is the world's fifth biggest shipping liner, told reporters in Hamburg on Tuesday.
""That points to some business having been brought forward,"" he added.
However, with European activities being relatively stable, a direct crisis was not on the horizon, and only later this year would it be clear whether there would be sustained damage to business, he said.
Shipping is only slowly recovering from an oversupply of vessels that plunged the sector into an almost decade-long slump, forcing some players out of business and others to combine forces to seek economies of scale.
Elsewhere, freight rates were stable for the time being and further direction for the remainder of the year would emerge in the period from now up to the middle of May, Habben Jansen said.
On vessel supply, he said order books were low, representing 10 percent of the global fleet, with some scrapping activity being noticeable.
Preliminary results for 2018, due on Feb. 25, were likely to reflect growth in transport volumes above the market average and results should be ""satisfactory"", Habben Jansen said.
The company in November said a later peak season in 2018 was likely to lift full year earnings.
It targets earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) in a corridor of 200-450 million euros ($226.4-509.4 million). 
Hapag Lloyd is introducing a surcharge mechanism this year to account for cleaner fuel rules starting in 2020 under the watch of the International Maritime Organisation.
It was important to have ""the right bunker clauses in all contracts"", Habben Jansen said.

1264,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 05:34AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Renault to scrap Ghosn's 30 million euro golden parachute - sources,"By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - The board of  Renault  (PA:RENA) was poised to cancel as much as 30 million euros ($34 million) in deferred pay and severance to its ousted boss Carlos Ghosn, as directors met on Wednesday to approve its full-year accounts, sources told Reuters.
Renault will scrap around 460,000 performance shares attributed to Ghosn since 2014-15 and now worth 26 million euros, under proposals backed by the French government, its biggest shareholder, two people familiar with the matter said.
The board is also likely to drop a two-year non-compete clause worth 4-5 million euros to Ghosn, who was forced out in January following his arrest in Japan for suspected financial misconduct at Nissan, Renault's alliance partner. 
A Renault spokesman did not immediately return calls and messages seeking comment.
Ghosn, 64, was arrested in Japan and ousted as Nissan chairman last November and has since been indicted along with Nissan and a fellow director for failing to disclose more than $80 million in additional 2010-18 compensation that he had arranged to be paid later. Ghosn denies the deferred pay was illegal or required disclosure.
The scandal, triggered by a Nissan internal investigation, initially strained ties with 43.4 percent-owner Renault as the French carmaker continued to back Ghosn until he was eventually forced to resign last month. 
Renault appointed new Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard on Jan. 24 and last week passed evidence to prosecutors that the company had paid part of Ghosn's 2016 Versailles wedding costs, in a first case of his suspected misconduct at the French carmaker.
Ghosn's representatives say he was unaware the 50,000 euro rental had been charged to Renault and now plans to repay it. 
The proposal to scrap most of Ghosn's severance package was drawn up by Renault's remuneration committee and is unlikely to be rejected by the full board, the sources said.
Left intact, his golden parachute could have been politically explosive in France, where President Macron is battling ""yellow vest"" street protests over low pay and inequality.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire had asked the government's lead board representative at Renault to ""ensure that Mr Ghosn's compensation is cut as much as possible"", a ministry official said on Wednesday.

""We've always been against excessive pay,"" the official said. ""It's not about the presumption of innocence but ethics and decency.""

1265,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2019 05:33AM ET</span>","Ghosn changes lawyer team, adds hotshot attorney, in change of strategy","By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn's chief defense attorney Motonari Otsuru resigned and was replaced by a team that includes hotshot lawyer Junichiro Hironaka, in a change of strategy from the ousted Nissan Motor chairman three months after his arrest.
Ghosn, Nissan's one-time savior, has been held in detention since his Nov. 19 arrest and indicted for under-reporting his salary and breach of trust. He has denied the charges.
The once-feted auto executive hired Hiroshi Kawatsu as head of a new defense team, his office said on Wednesday.
Hironaka, 73, has won several high profile cases, helping acquit senior lawmaker Ichiro Ozawa and senior bureaucrat Atsuko Muraki.
Hiring Hironaka would mean a more aggressive legal strategy, said Nobuo Gohara, a former prosecutor. Otsuru previously led the special prosecutors' office that is now handling Ghosn's case.
""Otsuru was miscast. He worked at the heart of the special prosecutors office so he was not someone who was going to go after them aggressively,"" Gohara said. ""Hironaka is an experienced defense lawyer who has won a number of cases. He will mount a more thorough and aggressive defense.""
Otsuru's office confirmed his resignation in a statement, but gave no reason for the move. A second member of Ghosn's defense team, Masato Oshikubo, had quit, it said. Go Kondo, Ghosn's third defense lawyer, was unavailable for comment.
Ghosn released a short statement thanking Otsuru for his team's ""tireless and diligent work"", and called him a ""very capable and intelligent man and lawyer"".
The sudden change in attorneys comes ahead of the expected start of informal meetings with prosecutors and judges to discuss pretrial preparations, an indication that there will be no new charges against Ghosn.
""As we begin the trial phase, I have decided to engage Hironaka-sensei as my legal counsel,"" Ghosn said, using a honorific suffix. ""I look forward to defending myself vigorously, and this represents the beginning of the process of not only establishing my innocence but also shedding light on the circumstances that led to my unjust detention.""
Ghosn, 64, told the Nikkei newspaper last month that Nissan executives opposed to his plans for closer ties with automaking partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) plotted to remove him.
Ghosn was widely credited with rescuing Nissan from near-bankruptcy after he was brought over to Japan in 1999 by Renault after the French automaker bought a chunk of Nissan.
Since his arrest, Ghosn has resigned as chairman of Renault and been sacked as chief of Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, the three-way alliance he once captained.
The scandal has roiled the global car industry and created tension between Nissan and Renault.

Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa is scheduled to meet newly appointed Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard on Thursday in Japan as they look at ways to cement their partnership.

These positive results come in as earnings forecasts for STOXX 600 companies are stabilizing after experiencing a free fall since last November, I/B/E/S Refinitiv data shows.
Earnings for the last quarter of 2014 are now expected to rise 3 percent year-on-year, a more optimistic outlook than the 2.3 percent forecast of last week.

1271,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 10:14PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Venezuela's self-declared president Guaido to nominate own Citgo board - sources,"By Marianna Parraga and Mayela Armas
(Reuters) - Advisers to Venezuela's self-declared president Juan Guaido have proposed he appoint six executives to a transitional board for U.S. refiner Citgo Petroleum Corp, Venezuela's most important foreign asset, four people close to the talks said.
The congress chief wants to secure control of the U.S. subsidiary of Venezuelan state-run energy firm PDVSA as he seeks to assemble an interim government. Controlling Citgo and other assets outside Venezuela, especially those that generate revenue, would provide him with much-needed funds.
PDVSA, Citgo and Venezuela's oil ministry did not respond to requests for comments.
Guaido invoked a constitutional provision to assume the presidency three weeks ago, arguing that the re-election last year of President Nicolas Maduro was a sham. Most Western countries, including the United States, have recognized Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate head of state, but Maduro retains control of state institutions.
The proposed board would be composed of Venezuelans Luisa Palacios, Angel Olmeta, Luis Urdaneta and Edgar Rincon, all of whom are currently living in the United States, plus two American Citgo employees. They would be assigned specific tasks by Guaido's team to secure operational and financial control while resolving internal disputes, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Guaido's advisers have been recruiting from a wide range of Venezuelan energy executives in recent weeks, the people said. Some have declined to join his proposed board.
Palacios, who holds a doctorate from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, has been head of emerging markets and Latin American research at consultancy Medley Global Advisors. She did not respond to a request for comment.
Olmeta and Urdaneta were top executives at PDVSA and Citgo, and Rincon worked as senior vice president of operations at energy firm Nabors Industries Ltd (NYSE:NBR), according to their LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profiles. They could not immediately be reached for comment.
Two top American executives currently working for Citgo, Vice President of Refining, Art Klein, and chief strategy officer, Rick Esser, also would join the board, the people said. They did not respond to requests for comment.
Maduro calls Guaido's claim to the presidency an attempted U.S.-backed coup and promised he will not allow Citgo to be ""stolen.""
""We have protected the nation's assets and that is hurting them,"" Guaido said in a speech on Tuesday, in reference to Maduro's government.
Citgo's U.S. headquarters have been torn into factions by the political battle. PDVSA last week sought to remove U.S. citizens from its board and huddled over a legal strategy to block the expected appointments. Some Venezuelan executives have been recalled to Caracas, others dismissed, and some Maduro loyalists suddenly reappeared, people familiar with the company's operations said.
Washington also has been closely involved in talks on the fate of Citgo, which owns about 4 percent of U.S. oil refining capacity. The unit runs refineries in Illinois, Texas, and Louisiana, operates fuel pipelines and terminals, and supplies a retail network of 5,500 gas station across 29 U.S. states.
Esser has been making routine decisions as Citgo's current president, Asdrubal Chavez, and his closest collaborators have run the company from the Bahamas, where a Citgo executive office was opened last year, three people at the Houston-based firm said.
The mechanics of how the new board would take over are unclear, and there are likely to be court challenges to the board's authority, people familiar with the deliberations said.
A long fight in U.S. courts could jeopardize Guaido's attempt to control operation of Citgo's refineries and gain access to the millions of dollars of dividends Citgo generates each year. The company has been barred from paying dividends to PDVSA and the cash is believed to have accrued on its books.

1272,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 09:22PM ET</span>",Overseas tariffs sour U.S. whiskey exports,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American whiskey makers are feeling the pain after their major overseas markets imposed hefty duties on their liquor in retaliation against President Donald Trump's tariffs on aluminum imports.
U.S. global whiskey exports, which include rye and bourbons, recorded a nifty 28 percent year-over-year increase in the first six months 2018, the Distilled Spirits Council said on Tuesday.
But once levies from Canada, Mexico, China and the European Union took effect, the collective whiskey exports from 37 U.S. states fell by 8 percent in the period from July to November last year, compared with the same five months in 2017, according to the Washington-based industry trade group.
The tariff-induced drop wiped out the overseas sales gain the industry had enjoyed in the first half of 2018, the group's data showed.
""Tariffs are starting to have a negative effect on exports,"" Christine LoCascio, the group's senior vice president of international trade, told a press conference. ""Many of the small distillers have felt the effect on day one."" 
(GRAPHIC: U.S. whiskey exports - https://tmsnrt.rs/2TIQTV2)
In 2017, American whiskey producers exported $1.1 billion worth of their products. Nearly 60 percent was shipped to the EU, 12 percent to Canada and the rest to other countries, including China. 
On the other hand, the distillers fared better at home.
In 2018, American whiskey rang up a 6.6 percent increase in revenues from a year earlier to $3.6 billion, the group's data showed.
In the wake of the EU's imposing 25 percent tariffs last June, U.S. whiskey exports fell 8.7 percent in the following five months, compared with the same period in 2017.
Canada's 10 percent duties that took effect on July 1 resulted in an 8.3 percent sales decline in that country for American whiskey producers in the July-November period compared with the same period a year earlier, the group said.

1273,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 08:20PM ET</span>",T-Mobile Chief Pledges He Won't Use Huawei Equipment,"(Bloomberg) -- T-Mobile US Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Legere says his company doesn’t use equipment from Huawei Technologies Co., and won’t after buying Sprint Corp. to form a bigger No. 3 in the U.S. wireless market.
“Let me be clear –- we do not use Huawei or ZTE network equipment in any area of our network. Period. And we will never use it in our 5G network,” Legere said in written testimony prepared for a hearing Wednesday before the House communications subcommittee.
The statement is in response to critics who’ve raised the issue of the Chinese equipment maker as a risk to national security to build opposition to the proposed $26.5 billion merger.
Sprint parent SoftBank Group Corp. has “significant ties” to Huawei, as does T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), according to Carri Bennet, general counsel for the Rural Wireless Association that represents smaller competitors to the merging parties. Huawei supplies Deutsche Telekom, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“Allowing a Japanese-influenced company and German-influenced company to merge when both have significant 5G ties to Huawei appears to run counter to U.S. national security concerns,” Bennet said in testimony submitted for the hearing.
Lawmakers and the administration of President Donald Trump say Huawei poses a potential security threat, if only because it can’t buck orders from China’s government, and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo this week urged Europeans to shun the Shenzhen-based company.
Huawei says it’s privately held, doesn’t take orders from the Beijing government, and wouldn’t do so because that would ruin its business that relies on income worldwide.
The Federal Communications Commission is considering whether to effectively ban Huawei from U.S. networks; already the company’s gear is effectively limited to small providers attracted by low prices.
Still, critics bring up Huawei and perils that are likewise ascribed to ZTE Corp (HK:0763)., another Chinese gear maker.
“T-Mobile, Sprint, and their parent companies refuse to commit to the American public not to use the Chinese companies in building 5G infrastructure if allowed to merge,” Protect America’s Wireless, a group that has held several news conferences critical of the merger, said in a Tuesday press release. The group has refused to disclose its backers.
Legere seemed to have the group in mind.
“Opponents of the transaction have set up a shadowy group that refuses to disclose its donors, to lob allegations that this transaction will allow Huawei and ZTE into U.S. networks,” the T-Mobile chief said in his testimony. “That’s false, and they know it is.”
A U.S. watchdog group that checks the national security implications of deals -- the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius -- has approved the proposed merger, the companies said in December.
It’s not clear how much weight the security concerns will carry in the debate. Nine U.S. senators in a Tuesday letter raised other consequences as they urged the FCC and Justice Department to kill the deal. Problems include less competition, higher bills, and lost jobs, the lawmakers said.
Legere argues that the merger will produce more jobs, lower prices and competition for market leaders AT&T Inc (NYSE:T).,  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ). and even cable providers such as Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA).
The decision on whether the deal can go ahead won’t rest with lawmakers, but with regulators at the FCC and Justice Department, who are influenced by Congress. Wall Street seems less than sanguine: the premium, a measure of how risky traders perceive a deal to be be, has risen steadily since early October.

1274,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 06:43PM ET</span>",Ford told UK PM May it is preparing alternative production sites: The Times,"(Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co told British Prime Minister Theresa May that it is stepping up preparations to move production out of Britain, The Times reported on Tuesday. 
The automaker told the prime minister during a private call with business leaders that it is preparing alternative sites abroad, The Times said. 
Ford was not immediately available for comment. 
Ford, which operates two engine plants in Britain, last month said that it faces a bill of up to $1 billion if Britain leaves the Europe Union without a deal.
Car makers and other manufacturers have warned about the toll a no-deal Brexit could impose, including higher tariffs, disruption to supply chains and threats to jobs. Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union on March 29. 
Another participant on the private call with May said that other companies delivered the same warning as Ford, The Times reported. 
""This isn't about contingencies any more - we are taking steps because of the uncertainty. It's real,"" the participant said during the call. 
Last week Nissan Motor Co said it scrapped plans to build its new X-Trail SUV in Britain and will produce it solely in Japan, saying that uncertainty over Britain's departure from the EU was making it hard for it to plan for the future.

Ford is the top-selling automotive brand in Britain, which is its third-largest market and the destination for roughly one in three cars made at its plant in Cologne, Germany. It employs about 13,000 people in Britain.

1275,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 06:36PM ET</span>","Activision full-year forecasts miss, to cut nearly 800 jobs","(Reuters) - Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) forecast full-year profit and revenue below analysts' estimates on Tuesday and said would invest more in developing its game franchises as the company faces intense competition from games such as ""Fortnite"".
However, the company's profit beat estimates by a cent and the game publisher announced a new share buyback program of up to $1.5 billion, while saying it would cut about 800 jobs to focus on developing its games franchises, sending its shares up 3 percent in after-market trading.
The company had 9,800 employees as of the end of 2017.
As part of the restructuring actions, Activision expects to incur a pre-tax charge of about $150 million, the majority of which is expected to be incurred this year.
However, Activision said the number of developers working on its games, such as ""Call of Duty"", ""Candy Crush"" and ""Overwatch"", in aggregate will increase about 20 percent over the course of 2019.
""ATVI's refocus on key game franchises over a net headcount reduction is the right path on returning to growth,"" Benchmark Co analyst Mike Hickey said.
Activision's results follow weak reports from rival publishers Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive Software Inc and  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA), adding to fears that competition from free-to-play battle royale games ""Fortnite"" and ""PUBG"" was eating into sales.
The battle royale format, which allows dozens of players to battle each other until the last survivor, became wildly popular in 2018 and the two games have been credited with introducing newer audiences to gaming.
""2019 will be a transition year for us,"" Chief Financial Officer Dennis Durkin said.
""Given limited frontline releases, the organizational work underway and the current competitive environment, we're planning for this year to be down year-over-year,"" Durkin added. 
EA and Take-Two plunged last week as their forecasts came in short of analysts' estimates.
Activision's full-year outlook for adjusted profit of $2.1 per share and revenue of $6.30 billion came in below Wall Street estimates. Analysts were expecting a profit of $2.54 per share and revenue of $7.25 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company said it will not generate material revenue from the ""Destiny"" game franchise in 2019 following the sale of publishing rights to Bungie in January.
For the fourth quarter, Activision reported total adjusted revenue of $2.84 billion, missing estimates of $3.04 billion.

Excluding items, the company earned $1.29 per share, just ahead of estimates of $1.28 per share.

1276,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 06:32PM ET</span>",Vale CFO says miner's top managers were unaware of dam risk report,"By Marta Nogueira
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Senior management at Brazilian miner Vale were never shown internal security documents indicating that its dam at Brumadinho was at risk of collapse, the company's chief financial officer said on Tuesday. 
The CFO, Luciano Siani, was asked about management's knowledge of the internal documents at a news conference a day after Reuters reported on them. The documents, dated Oct. 3, 2018, classified the dam at Brumadinho as being two times more likely to fail than the maximum level of risk tolerated under internal guidelines. The dam collapsed in late January in one of the deadliest mining disasters in decades. 
Asked whether the company's senior management had seen the internal report, Siani said, ""No.""
""There was a lot of controversy about this recommendation to pass technical details to senior management,"" Siani said at the company's headquarters in Rio de Janeiro. ""If a mechanic and a pilot detect a problem, they have to have the autonomy to take immediate decisions in the field, and if you scale that into the company hierarchy, it can mean the difference between taking a quick decision and not."" 
The disaster in the mineral-rich state of Minas Gerais was the second major collapse of a mining dam in the region in about three years, following a similar disaster in 2015 at a nearby mine co-owned by Vale. So far, at least 165 people have been confirmed dead after the dam burst, with nearly 200 more likely also killed.
Siani said that in general, it was debatable whether technical details on Vale's dams should reach the board, as that could affect flexible decision-making.
He said the safety measures recommended by the documents, generated by national and international experts, were already being acted upon by the company. He said the report recommended actions, such as reducing the water level, which were already under way.
Siani stressed that the board was told that the dam was stable.
The collapsed dam, which had more than 12 million cubic meters of iron ore tailings, released a wave of mud that buried company facilities, nearby dwellings and forests, and affected rivers in the region.
""This structure, in addition to having no imminent risk, did not show any symptom of problems,"" Siani said. 
Vale shares added to gains after the news conference, rising 5.4 percent to close at 44.30 reais. 
""The news conference helped reduce risk perception in relation to potential future litigation,"" XP Investimentos analyst Karel Luketic said in a research note, adding that the current depressed share price more than reflected future risks stemming from the collapse.
Siani said there were 46 board meetings related to the dam issue between 2016 and last year, but did not go into detail. 
On Tuesday, Brazil's Senate leader Davi Alcolumbre announced the creation of a 180-day special investigative commission to probe the collapse of the dam, identify who was responsible, and enact measures to prevent such a tragedy happening again.

1277,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 06:20PM ET</span>",GE wins most 2018 gas turbine orders; Mitsubishi wins on new technology: report,"By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co booked the most orders for electricity-generating gas turbines in 2018 but fell to second place for the largest and most advanced machines, behind Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, according to a closely watched report seen by Reuters and people familiar with the matter.
Demand for gas turbines has been tumbling since 2011, stoking fierce competition for deals and prompting manufacturers to slash jobs and close factories. GE is in the midst of a multi-year restructuring of its power business, which lost $808 million last year.
The latest rankings show Mitsubishi won 41 percent of the orders last year for turbines that can produce 100 megawatts or more, compared with 28 percent for GE and 25 percent for  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), according to McCoy Power Reports data. 
Among newest-generation turbines, known as ""post F-class,"" MHPS got 49 percent of orders, compared with 34 percent for GE and 16 percent for Siemens, the data shows. 
Orders for the most advanced turbines have dwindled along with the entire market, even though they churn out the most electricity per unit of fuel burned. GE suffered a high-profile breakdown with one of its advanced turbines in Texas last year, and warned it may spend $480 million on repairs for the global fleet.
GE last year held onto its longtime top spot when all orders were counted. 
The rankings show GE dominated orders for older-technology F-class turbines and that it had an overall tally of 33 percent of orders by capacity, compared with 31 percent for MHPS and 26 percent for Siemens.
GE is ""proud to the leader ... as it has been every year since 2010,"" spokeswoman Kirstin Carvell said. Siemens did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Mitsubishi said in a statement on Tuesday that its ranking largely reflected orders for its new J-Series turbine, which the company said has greater than 64 percent efficiency and 99.5 percent reliability.

1. CPI Expected to Edge Up
Economic attention will be on retail inflation tomorrow.
The Labor Department will issue the January consumer price index (CPI) at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Overall, economists expect retail inflation to remain tame.
The CPI is forecast to show a 0.1% rise for January and a 1.5% year-on-year gain, according to Investing.com.
The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to climb 0.2% for the month and 2.1% over the 12 months through January.
2. Cisco Cut Today, Reports Tomorrow
Among earnings reports, the main action will be after the bell.
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) will issue its results tomorrow.
On average, analysts expect that the networking giant earned 72 cents per share, with revenue of about $12.4 billion.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgraded the stock today, just ahead of earnings, cutting it to equal weight from overweight and lowering the price target to $49 from $51.
The brokerage said Cisco is still executing on security, but may find it difficult to offset deceleration in the hardware cycle.
Also tomorrow after the bell,  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP) will issue results.
3. Oil Inventories Seen Rising Again
Saudi jawboning to push prices higher helped crude rise today. But a reversal could come quickly tomorrow if inventory numbers show continued strength in U.S. production.
OPEC said today it expected demand for its oil to decline to 30.59 million barrels per day (bpd) this year -- some 240,000 bpd lower than what it anticipated in January -- due to higher U.S. production.
Analysts expect that U.S. oil inventories rose by 2.7 million barrels in the latest week.
Gasoline inventories are also expected to rise, but distillate stockpiles, which include heating oil, are forecast to fall as freezing temperatures grip the country."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.49%, the S&P 500 gained 1.26% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.46%.
Trump told reporters he was ""not happy"" with the deal on border security struck by U.S. lawmakers, but he downplayed expectations the United States was heading toward a second partial government shutdown.
""I don’t think you’re going to see a shutdown,” Trump said. But he added: ""If you did have one, it’s the Democrats' fault.""
The deal includes just $1.375 billion for a border barrier, well short of the $5.7 billion Trump has demanded for his proposed border wall.
On trade, meanwhile, Trump said he may consider extending the current 90-day trade war truce, which expires on March 1, but he would prefer not to.
Without a deal, or extension to the deadline, the U.S. has threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 25% from 10%.
Trade-sensitive stocks like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) took the trade uncertainty in stride, each rising more than 1%, supporting the gains in the industrial sector.
Materials and financials, meanwhile, drove the bulk of the gains in the broader market, with the latter propped up by a surge in  Brighthouse Financial  .
Brighthouse (NASDAQ:BHF) jumped 14% after its fourth-quarter earnings topped expectations.
Major Wall Street banks were boosted a surge in U.S. government bond yields on the back of improved risk sentiment. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) ended the day higher.
Tech stocks also flourished on the back of a continued rise in semiconductor stocks. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and NXP Semis (NASDAQ:NXPI) racked up sharp gains for the day.
The energy sector was supported by gains in U.S. oil prices on data showing OPEC slashed oil output last month, while Saudi Arabia pledged to continue reducing production also supported sentiment.
On the economic front, investors mulled over mixed economic data showing the labor market remained strong, but small business optimism fell to its lowest level in more than two years.
But analysts downplayed the significance of the drop in small business optimism, blaming it on volatile market conditions in December and the partial government shutdown.

1285,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 03:55PM ET</span>",Chipotle's Spectacular Recovery Discovers Resistance,"Investing.com - Not many stocks have had the run Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) has had since the beginning of the year and since it reported better-than-expected results on Feb. 7.
The stock is up nearly 38% and has more than doubled since bottoming last year.
The question now is if it has moved too high? The shares hit a 52-week high of $612.60 soon after Tuesday's open, but then fell back and were trading down 1.7% late afternoon.
Clearly, some profit-taking set in.
Chipotle has struggled in recent years from growing way too fast and then getting into trouble with food-safety problems. The company has scaled back new store openings and concentrated on getting the basic operations back into shape.
The exercise was painful. The shares were off as much as 65% from their top in 2015 until bottoming last year.
Chipotle's run-up is one of a few stocks that have hit new highs, and they're not tech stocks.
Along with Chipotle, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has also hit new highs, along with such, well, boring stocks like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) and AutoZone (NYSE:AZO). A glamour stock bucking the trend has been Boeing (NYSE:BA).

BOSTON (Reuters) - Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP is backing a new hedge fund being run by former Eton Park partner Aaron Wertentheil with a $150 million commitment, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Wertentheil is launching Jones Road Capital Management with roughly $300 million in assets, including the capital from Blackstone, plus money from Eric Mindich, his former boss at Eton Park, and an unidentified endowment, said one of the sources.
New York-based Jones Road will concentrate on special situations investments in the corporate credit, government credit and equities markets, among others, the sources said.
Blackstone has already committed to also putting capital into a second portfolio that Wertentheil expects to raise after finishing fund raising for the first one, signalling the firm's strong confidence in the manager. 
The sources could not speak publicly because the investment is private. 
Wertentheil could not be reached for comment.
Blackstone, which invests $78 billion in hedge funds, is making the investment with cash from its $1.5 billion Strategic Alliance Fund III, as it bets that new players can succeed in an industry that has struggled with poor returns and investor withdrawals in recent years. It has so far seeded six managers from this portfolio, including Tresidor Investment Management and Seiga Asset Management. 
Blackstone's seeders traditionally take a 15 to 25 percent cut of the fund's business, people familiar with the terms have said.
Wertentheil worked for years at Mindich's multi-strategy fund Eton Park, which made industry history for hedge funds when it raised a record $3 billion in 2004. Wertentheil oversaw more than a billion in assets at Eton Park and stayed on to help close the firm.
Wertentheil started generating buzz soon after Eton Park's end in 2017 as someone who could start his own firm or join an existing one in a senior role.
James Connolly, who also worked at Eton Park, is a partner and senior managing director at Jones Road. Robert Renda is the firm's chief financial officer, having previously worked at Folger Hill Asset Management, and Michael Adams is the chief operating officer and general counsel.
Securing seed investments from Blackstone often helps the new managers establish credentials and get up and running while it allows Blackstone to get in on the ground floor with promising newcomers.
Competition for Blackstone's seed money is always fierce. But some critics note that seeder funds' records can be uneven no matter how thorough the due diligence.

1287,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 03:31PM ET</span>",Pernod CEO pursues change and engages activist shareholder,"By Martinne Geller
LONDON (Reuters) -  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) will embrace change and continue ""constructive"" talks with activist investor Elliott Management, CEO Alexandre Ricard said on Tuesday while dismissing speculation that the company could become a takeover target.
The world's second-biggest spirits group behind  Diageo  (LON:DGE) is under pressure from New York hedge fund Elliott Management to improve profit margins and corporate governance.
Last week Pernod vowed to lift its margins and shareholder returns in a three-year strategic plan that Elliott described as a first small step.
Chief Executive Ricard, the grandson of the French drinks group's founder, said he welcomed Elliott's perspective.
""We met in January. We will continue to have an open dialogue with Elliott in the coming weeks or months, as we do with other shareholders,"" he told Reuters. 
A spokeswoman for the fund declined to comment on Tuesday. 
Ricard said talks with Elliott centered around governance and margin improvement, adding that Pernod is a consolidator rather than a takeover target.
""I hope there will be no surprise if I reiterate very clearly and specifically -- Pernod Ricard is here, Pernod Ricard is here to stay and Pernod Ricard is and will remain a consolidator.""
Elliott's arrival has raised speculation of potential dealmaking. A source close to the matter told Reuters in December that Elliott had suggested options such as merging with another spirits company. 
Ricard declined to comment on the likelihood that Elliott would seek a seat on the board of the maker of Absolut vodka and Martell cognac. 
Pernod shares closed down 1.3 percent.
NECESSARY TRANSFORMATION
Pernod's 46-year-old CEO, who once worked as an M&A consultant at U.S. bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and appeared bare-chested at his desk in an internal promotional video last year, acknowledged that change is necessary for success. 
""The mandate I think I've been given is quite clear. It's to consistently and ruthlessly pursue value creation over time,"" Ricard said. 
""If you want a company to succeed and stay over time, that company needs to transform itself permanently. Consumers change over time, the environment changes, the dynamic changes -- if you don't keep transforming yourself, it's not going to happen.""
He declined to say whether having Elliott as a shareholder helped him to push the message on the need for change within the company, or what governance initiatives might be in the pipeline.
When asked about double voting rights for longtime shareholders - which are often granted by French companies after two years - Ricard said there were no plans to change the company's practice of affording them only after 10 years. 

One source had told Reuters the company's current policy limited the influence of outsiders. However, Ricard said the rights were open to all qualifying shareholders, not just those close to the Ricard family.

1288,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 03:01PM ET</span>","Democratic senators urge administration to reject Sprint, T-Mobile merger","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of eight Democratic U.S. senators and independent Senator Bernie Sanders urged the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday to reject a proposed $26 billion merger of T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp.
The merger is ""likely to raise prices for consumers, harm workers, stifle competition, exacerbate the digital divide, and undermine innovation,"" they wrote in separate letters to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai and Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department's top antitrust official.
The signatories included potential or confirmed presidential candidates Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Sherrod Brown, Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker. Also signing the letters were Senators Richard Blumenthal and Tom Udall.
The companies did not immediately comment. A U.S. House panel is set to hold a hearing on the merger on Wednesday.
The senators noted the four largest wireless carriers including AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) control 98 percent of the market. 
""Antitrust regulators around the world have consistently blocked four-to-three mergers in the mobile and telecommunications industry, and those who have allowed such mergers have lived to regret it,"" they wrote.
Separately, T-Mobile Chief Executive Officer John Legere defended the merger in written testimony released on Tuesday, ahead of a House Energy and Commerce Committee panel hearing on Wednesday.
He said the company does not ""use Huawei or ZTE (HK:0763) network equipment in any area of our network"" and will ""never"" use equipment from the Chinese firms in the next-generation high-speed 5G network.
U.S. national security officials have said both ZTE and Huawei raise concerns. The Trump administration is preparing an executive order, that could be released as soon as this month, that would allow the Commerce Department to bar U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by Huawei, ZTE or other companies deemed to pose national security risks.
Legere said the merger would lead to lower prices and more U.S. jobs. Opponents argue the combined entity would likely raise prices, cut costs and harm rural consumers.
Legere's testimony says the combined firm's business plan projects ""aggressive share increases – taken from the industry leaders AT&T and Verizon – through its accelerated, enhanced 5G deployment."" 
He said the company planned to ""keep the customers we’ve fought hard to win and win new customers with great quality, lower prices, and more innovative offerings.""
Sprint Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure will tell the panel that the combined firm's improved network ""will be able to compete for customers who have been reluctant to use Sprint or T-Mobile because of concerns that the quality of their individual networks is not as good as those offered by Verizon or AT&T.""
The companies announced the merger in April 2018 after their a first round of merger talks ended in 2014 when President Barack Obama’s administration expressed antitrust concerns. 
In the current review, Legere said the companies had turned over 25 million pages of documents to regulators. 

""It has been a long road,"" Legere said.

(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co delivered 46 aircraft in January, two more than a year earlier, as the world's biggest planemaker gears up for another year of record sales amid booming demand from the airline industry.
The company's shares rose as much as 1.5 percent to $409.90.
Investors and analysts keep a close watch on the number of planes Boeing turns over to airlines and leasing firms for cues on the company's revenue and cash flow.
European rival Airbus SE delivered 39 aircraft in January, up from 27 planes a year earlier.
Boeing won 43 net orders last month, beating Airbus, which did not report any wins and had 13 cancellations dominated by the superjumbo A380 aircraft.
Of those orders, 18 were for 787 Dreamliner jets, as Boeing ramps up production rate for its wide-body aircraft to 14 per month from 12 in 2018.
""There continues to be some pent-up demand (for the 787),"" Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu wrote in a note.
""The order (for the longest version of the 787 jets - the 787-10) is notable given it is the first since June 2017 when Singapore ordered 19 of the variant.""
The remaining orders are for a military version of Boeing's best-selling 737 aircraft, the P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, from Britain, Norway and the United States, as well as commercial sales to unidentified customers.
Boeing delivered 806 aircraft last year, missing its target by four jets as the company was hit by fuselage and engine delays at its suppliers.
Despite that it retained the title of the world's biggest planemaker for the seventh straight year. Airbus delivered 800 planes in 2018.

The U.S. planemaker has set a target of 895 to 905 commercial aircraft deliveries for 2019.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes extended gains on Tuesday, in a broad-based rally after American lawmakers reached a tentative deal to avoid another partial government shutdown and on hopes of an agreement during the ongoing U.S.-China trade talks.
President Donald Trump comments that he did not anticipate another government shutdown added to sentiment, even though he expressed unhappiness about the agreement that includes funds for U.S.-Mexican border security but not for his promised wall.
The S&P 500 index crossed its 200-day moving average price on Tuesday, a technical level that indicates long-term momentum, for the first time since Dec. 4.
The benchmark index is now just about 7 percent away from its Sept. 20 record closing high, boosted by an upbeat fourth-quarter earnings season, a dovish Federal Reserve and trade optimism.
""The fact that lawmakers want to leave the government open sounds like one of the biggest drivers for markets today,"" said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager with Hodges Funds in Dallas.
""Investors like that fact that we are getting closer to trade issues improving. They are taking a risk-on stance, everyone is buying today."" 
Top U.S. officials arrived in the Chinese capital on Tuesday for high-level trade talks as the world's two largest economies attempt to strike a deal before a March 1 deadline and avoid another escalation of tariffs.
Trump said he would consider pushing the deadline if the two sides were close to a deal.
Trade-sensitive industrials climbed 1.52 percent, boosted by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Inc and  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT).
Chipmakers, which depend on China for a huge chunk of their revenue, also rose and pushed the Philadelphia chip index 1.92 percent higher. 
The broader technology sector rose 1.28 percent, lifted by gains in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) rose 2.24 percent and was the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.
In the latest data underscoring the economy's strength, U.S. job openings surged to a record high in December.
At 12:41 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 337.49 points, or 1.35 percent, at 25,390.60. The S&P 500 was up 32.98 points, or 1.22 percent, at 2,742.78 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 96.36 points, or 1.32 percent, at 7,404.27.
Eight of the 10 major sectors trading higher posted gains of more than 1 percent. Only the real estate sector was trading lower.
About 71 percent of the S&P companies that have posted earnings have topped expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. But analysts' estimates for first-quarter earnings have turned negative for the first time since 2016.
 Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA) jumped 4.3 percent after the videogame maker's newly launched battle royale game gained traction. Rival Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) lost 4.2 percent following a downgrade by a 5-star analyst.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3.34-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

Brighthouse Financial (NASDAQ:BHF) reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.68 a share, above estimates compiled by Investing.com of $1.57 a share. But revenue of $2.01 billion fell just short of estimates for $2.03 billion. Its shares rallied 14%.
The strong beat on the bottom line was helped by a 27% surge in annuity sales in the fourth quarter.
But some analysts said Brighthouse may be too reliant on its annuity segment to drive profits and pointed to the lack of a dividend on offer as another headwind.
""Our view is tempered by some near-term profit pressures and by BHF's nearly monoline business mix heavily dependent on annuities, a line of business prone to volatility,"" said CFRA, an independent research provider. ""Brighthouse also does not pay a cash dividend, while many peers yield 3% or more.""
T. Rowe Price Group (NASDAQ:TROW) rose 4% after it released preliminary data showing assets under management at the end of January increased by 8% to $1.04 trillion from the end of December.

The upbeat results come a day after the company said it had cut its stake in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) by half in the fourth quarter of last year.
Loews (NYSE:L) rose 3.5%, paring some of its losses from Monday, when it swung to a surprise loss owing to a 27% surge in insurance claims and policyholders' benefits costs.

The fate of the A380 superjumbo has been in doubt since a vital order from Emirates foundered over inconclusive engine talks, forcing Airbus and the airline to weigh an alternative plan that would trigger a premature halt to A380 production.
Under the proposed reshuffle, first reported by Reuters, Airbus hopes to broker a deal that would see Emirates switch part of its order to smaller models like the A350 or A330, while eking out a few last-minute A380 orders from British Airways.
The timing of any final announcement may be driven by the outcome of those talks, but Airbus will be under pressure to provide some clarity on its plans in time for Thursday's earnings following mounting speculation over the plane's future.
""The A380 is the elephant in the hangar; it will be impossible to avoid saying something on the subject,"" said Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa, who predicted last week that a decision to shut the loss-making program may be imminent.
The A380 is already on life support due to weak sales. Barring a surprise breakthrough in stalled engine talks between Emirates and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR), the A380's French and German factories are unlikely to survive beyond 2020, analysts say.
Any decision to pull the plug on the iconic European double-decker after just 12 years in service must be approved by the Airbus board, which meets on Wednesday.

PARIS (Reuters) - Sodexo's sport and leisure business, which provides catering at the U.S. Super Bowl, Royal Ascot and the Eiffel Tower, will focus on organic growth as it integrates its 2017 U.S. acquisition Centerplate.
Nathalie Bellon Szabo, the chief executive of Sodexo's Sports & Leisure Worldwide business said it plans to grow in its three key markets of the United States, France and Britain by securing more contracts and also look to expand in China.
The business, which recently secured a contract for the Cathay Pacific lounges in Hong Kong, will pursue contracts for airport lounges in China, as well as contracts for stadiums, museums and convention centers.
Sodexo (PA:EXHO) is the world's second-largest food catering services group after Britain's Compass, generating annual revenue of 20 billion euros ($22.6 billion). 
Its sport and leisure business, which provides tickets, travel, food and logistics, bought Centerplate, a U.S. company catering at events such as the NFL Super Bowl and the U.S. Presidential inaugural balls for $675 million.
This doubled its revenue to 1.7 billion euros and made the United States its top market, with 65 percent of its revenue.
""We now need to stabilize our growth and expand organically in our business segments and key countries and focus on improving our profitability,"" Bellon Szabo told reporters.
It also owns and runs the Lido cabaret in Paris and the Yachts de Paris and Bateaux Parisiens River Seine cruises.

It recently secured a contract to manage the Eiffel Tower's restaurants for another ten years, with a target of boosting by 35 percent revenues of roughly 40 million euros under the previous deal.

1306,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 11:55AM ET</span>","EU court to rule on legality of Belgian tax break, may affect Apple","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's second-highest court will rule on Thursday whether a Belgian tax break which benefited some 35 large companies is illegal state aid, a judgment which could provide clues to other tax cases involving Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Fiat Chrysler.
As part of its crackdown on tax avoidance, the European Commission three years ago ordered Belgium to recover some 700 million euros ($790 million) from the group, saying the companies' ""excess profit"" tax plan gave them an unfair advantage vis-a-vis smaller firms.
The scheme allowed the companies to claim deductions for economies of scale, reducing their corporate tax base by 50-90 percent. 
Dutch industrial company Magnetrol and Belgium subsequently challenged the Commission's decision at the Luxembourg-based General Court. The largest beneficiaries were Wabco, Cellio,  BP  (LON:BP), BASF, Atlas Copco and Belgacom.
Judges may also rule whether it qualifies as a scheme or are just individual tax rulings.
The tax avoidance drive has included orders to Ireland to recover some 13 billion euros from iPhone maker Apple and Luxembourg to claw back up to 30 million euros from Fiat Chrysler, 250 million euros from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and about 120 million euros from Engie. 
The Netherlands has to recover between 20-30 million euros from Starbucks.
All the major companies have challenged the EU rulings. At stake is whether the Commission is over-stretching its powers by using its state aid tool to address tax fairness concerns.
The United States has criticized the cases against U.S. companies and notably in the Apple ruling it has accused the EU of grabbing revenue intended for U.S. coffers.

The cases are T-131/16 Belgium v Commission and T-263/16 Magnetrol International v Commission.

1310,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 11:13AM ET</span>",Under Armour beats holiday-quarter profit on fewer discounts,"By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) -  Under Armour  Inc (NYSE:UAA) beat analysts' estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday, as the sportswear maker kept a tight lid on costs and sold more sneakers at full price during the holiday shopping season.
The company's Class A common shares rose 3.8 percent to $21.58, as investors shrugged off a disappointing current-quarter revenue forecast for North America, its biggest region.
Under Armour struggled with excess inventories for most of last year and was forced to offload more products to discount chains. This added to costs and dented margins.
To cut expenses, the company has shut underperforming stores, slashed jobs and reduced product sourcing costs.
In the fourth quarter, a 12 percent reduction in inventory levels and rising demand for sportswear, which includes Under Armour's popular Project Rock, Curry 6 and HOVR sneakers, allowed the company to cut back on discounts and beef up its margins.
The company's online markdowns during the peak holiday period were about 10 to 20 percent lower, compared with a year earlier, according to brokerage William Blair.
Excluding one-time items, Under Armour earned 9 cents per share in the fourth quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of 4 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Adjusted gross margins rose 160 basis points to 45.1 percent, beating analysts' expectations of 44.8 percent. 
North America sales, however, fell 6 percent, as larger rival  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) continued to dominate with a slew of hot product launches. 
Under Armour forecast mid-single-digit percentage fall in first-quarter North America sales.
A lack of any major product launches on the horizon has also left analysts skeptical that the company can see a sales recovery in North America any time soon.
""It would appear that Under Armour has hit a ceiling domestically,"" Nomura Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel said.

Total revenue rose 1.5 percent to $1.39 billion, edging past estimates of $1.38 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Signs that the U.S. and China might reach an agreement in trade talks and news of a tentative deal to avoid another government shutdown in Washington helped push world stock markets and bond yields broadly higher Tuesday. 
Tokyo's Nikkei set the tone with a 2.6 percent rally, its best day of the year so far (T), while the Stoxx 600 index of European shares gained 0.5 percent. 
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 238.95 points, or 0.95 percent, to 25,292.06, the S&P 500 gained 24.75 points, or 0.91 percent, to 2,734.55 and the Nasdaq Composite added 81.40 points, or 1.11 percent, to 7,389.30 in early trading.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.89 percent.
U.S. and Chinese officials expressed hopes that the new round of talks, which began in Beijing on Monday, would bring them closer to easing their nearly year-long trade war.
Beijing and Washington are trying to hammer out a deal before a March 1 deadline, without which U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent.
""There will be no winner in a trade war. So at some point they will likely strike a deal,"" said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities in Tokyo.
In Washington, U.S. lawmakers reached a tentative deal on border security funding, though aides cautioned that it did not contain the $5.7 billion President Donald Trump wants to build a wall on the Mexican border.
""What investors are taking from this is that the government stays open, whether or not Trump signs on the deal is secondary,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.
The dollar, meanwhile, hovered near a two-month high after notching its longest winning streak - eight days straight - in two years.
The dollar index fell 0.15 percent, with the euro up 0.16 percent to $1.1293.
The optimism that another government shutdown in the world's largest economy would be averted and trade tensions between the U.S. and China were easing helped push bond yields higher as investors traded out of safety plays.
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 6/32 in price to yield 2.6823 percent, from 2.661 percent late on Monday.
In commodity markets, oil prices jumped up as traders weighed support from OPEC-led supply restraint and a slowdown in the global economy. U.S. crude 2.6 percent to $53.78 per barrel and Brent gained 2.6 percent to $63.11.

1314,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 10:21AM ET</span>",German minister backs tougher rules on telecoms suppliers,"By Andreas Rinke
BERLIN (Reuters) - Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has thrown his weight behind a proposal to reform Germany's telecommunications law to toughen security requirements on foreign network vendors, the RND group of newspapers reported on Tuesday.
Seehofer's intervention increases the likelihood that Germany will tighten oversight over Huawei Technologies , sidestepping pressure from the United States to exclude the Chinese company from its market.
Government and industry leaders want clarity on the ground rules before Germany embarks on the buildout of next-generation 5G mobile networks by auctioning spectrum in late March.
Citing participants at a meeting of conservatives and Social Democrats, who rule together in a grand coalition, RND said Seehofer's aim was to better control Huawei - and not to ban it.
The best way to achieve this would be by amending an article in Germany's Telecommunications Act that addresses security. This would apply to all vendors and should not be viewed as a direct response to Huawei, coalition sources told RND.
Seehofer's view is key, because his ministry oversees the BSI cybersecurity agency that is drafting a catalog of proposed security steps together with the Federal Network Regulator that will oversee the spectrum auction.
Officials are also concerned that, should a decision ultimately be taken to block Huawei, there would need to be a sound legal basis to do so.
Consultations are continuing, a senior government source told Reuters earlier on Tuesday, and a final decision on whether to let Chinese firms participate in 5G is unlikely within the next two weeks.
Work still needs to be done to address costs, feasibility and security measures, said the source, pushing back against reports in the German business press that officials had hammered out a common approach.
NO-SPY DEAL
Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Germany needs guarantees that Huawei would not hand data to the Chinese state before it can take part in building fifth-generation networks that would link everything from vehicles to factories at far greater speeds.
Such a no-spy pledge would come in addition to a catalog of security measures toughening certification procedures to minimize the risk that network equipment comes fitted with 'back doors' that would expose it to cyber espionage.
Huawei, the global networks market leader with annual sales exceeding $100 billion, faces international scrutiny over its ties with the Chinese government and suspicion Beijing could use its technology for spying, which the company denies.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo drove home that message in Budapest on Monday, cautioning allies in central Europe that deploying equipment from Huawei would make it more difficult for Washington ""to partner alongside them"".
Germany's three telecoms operators - Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn),  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) and  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) Deutschland - use Huawei equipment in their networks and have warned that curbing their choice of vendors could be costly. 
Deutsche Telekom has, for its part, proposed a series of measures to safeguard security, including setting up an independent laboratory to scrutinize equipment used in critical infrastructure before it is deployed in the field.

1315,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 10:05AM ET</span>","India, France drive Scotch whisky sales as Brexit looms","EDINBURGH (Reuters) - The value of Scotch whisky exports rose nearly 8 percent in 2018, backed by booming sales in India, France and the United States and the impact of pricier Scotch, data from Britain's tax authority HMRC showed on Tuesday.
Britain's biggest food and drink export grew 7.8 percent to 4.7 billion pounds ($6.05 billion) last year, with the number of 70 centiliter bottles sold abroad up 3.6 percent to 1.28 billion.
With Britain's exit from the European Union trading bloc due in six weeks, there is still no decision on what the trade rules for British exports will be after that. Producers of Scotland's flagship tipple are particularly worried about sales to the EU which make up about a third of their world market.
Scotch growth in recent years has been driven by demand for single malts, which are made at one distillery and pricier than blended Scotch which is made from mixing one or more whiskies.
Exports of single malts rose 11.3 percent to 1.3 billion pounds. 
In volume terms, exports were primarily driven by growth in India, which expanded by 23.1 million to 112.6 million bottles. The United States and France - the world's heaviest Scotch drinker - each grew exports by 9.4 million bottles.
At the same time, exports to Germany and Spain fell by around 10 million and 4.5 million pounds apiece.
""(The) industry does not take continued growth for granted,"" said Karen Betts, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association which represents 90 percent of the producers.
She urged Britain not to leave the EU without a Brexit deal at the end of March.
""We also want to see the UK and EU agree to an open and positive future relationship, which delivers frictionless trade with the EU, and the UK to secure ambitious trading relationships with key markets around the world.""
The United States became the first billion-pound export market for Scotch in 2018, growing 7.8 percent to 1.04 billion pounds last year to retain its place as the largest market in the world for Scotch in terms of value.

Britain's trade minister Liam Fox said in response to the data: ""My international economic department is focused on turning the UK into an exporting superpower and, as our single largest food and drink export, the success of Scotch whisky overseas is key to this ambition.""

Starting last year, the bank began developing a technology platform to handle corporate clients' cash payments and receipts of money around the world. Goldman will launch the product in 2020, with itself as the first client.
Since taking the helm at Goldman in October, Solomon has overseen a review of the bank's businesses to identify areas where it can grow to reach a goal of generating $5 billion in new revenue. 
Goldman's scale as a global bank means that strategies like adding more small and mid-sized corporate clients or launching corporate cash management services can add ""a couple of million dollars of revenue"" at only a moderate cost to the bank, Solomon said. 

""You can move the needle over a period of time with reasonable investments.""

The Richmond, Virginia-based tobacco company will issue the U.S. bonds in six tranches in denominations of $2,000 as it looks to pre-pay a term loan arranged by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Altria said in a regulatory filing.
Altria said in December it was using a nearly $15 billion term-loan facility with JPMorgan to finance the $12.8 billion price tag for a 35 percent stake in Juul Labs Inc. The loan matures in December this year.
The money being raised will support Altria's purchase of Juul as well as Canadian cannabis producer Cronos Group, which it announced in December.

Its European bond issue is expected to raise 4.25 billion euros ($4.80 billion) in a four-part sale.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors made a U-turn on emerging markets, naming them the most crowded trade, in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's survey for the first time in its history.
This marked a big reversal from last month, when fund managers said ""short EM"" was the third most-crowded trade - showing how fast the mood can shift in an uncertain market.
It could prove to be a bad omen for emerging markets, though, as assets named ""most crowded"" usually sink soon afterwards. 
Previous ""most crowded"" trades have included Bitcoin, and the U.S. FAANG tech stocks, which led the selloff in December.
Emerging-market stocks (MSCIEF) are up 7.8 percent so far this year, and flow data on Friday showed investors pumped record amounts of money into emerging stocks and bonds.
Emerging-market assets had a torrid 2018. Crises in Turkey and Argentina ripped through developing countries already suffering from a strong dollar and rising U.S. yields pushing up borrowing costs. 
But a dovish turn by the Fed at the start of the year, indicating the world's top central bank would not raise interest rates as quickly as previously expected, sparked fresh enthusiasm among investors.
Major asset managers and investment banks such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citi and BlueBay Asset Management ramped up their exposure to emerging markets in recent weeks.. 
The Institute of International Finance (IIF) predicted a ""wall of money"" was set to flood into emerging market assets.
However, there are some indications momentum may be waning. Analyzing flows of its own clients, investment bank Citi noted they had turned cautious on emerging-market assets over the last week, with both real money and leveraged investors pulling out funds following four weeks of inflows.
BAML did not specify whether the ""long EM"" crowded trade referred to bonds, equities or both.
Outside emerging markets, investors' main concern remained the possibility of a global trade war. It topped the list of biggest tail risks for the ninth straight month, followed by a slowdown in China, the world's second-largest economy, and a corporate credit crunch.
Overall, BAML's February survey - conducted between Feb. 1 and 7, with 218 panelists managing $625 billion in total - showed investor sentiment had hardly improved. Global equity allocations fell to their lowest levels since September, 2016.
""Despite the recent rally, investor sentiment remains bearish,"" said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at BAML.
SECULAR STAGNATION
Investors remained worried about the global economy, with 55 percent of those surveyed bearish on both the growth and inflation outlook for the next year. 
""Secular stagnation is the consensus view,"" BAML strategists wrote. 
Following this theme, investors were most positive on cash and, within equities, preferred high-dividend-yielding sectors like pharmaceuticals, consumer discretionary, and real estate investment trusts. 
As investors added to their cash allocations, the number of fund managers overweight cash hit its highest level since January, 2009.
The least preferred sectors were those sensitive to the cycle, like energy and industrials - which BAML strategists see as good contrarian investments if ""green shoots"" appear in the global economy.
Worries about corporate debt were still running high, with this month's survey showing a new high in the number of investors demanding companies reduce leverage. 
Some 46 percent of fund managers find corporate balance sheets to be over-leveraged, the survey found, and 51 percent of investors want companies to use cash flow to improve their balance sheets. That's the highest percentage since July 2009.
Europe, one of investors' least-favored regions, showed a slight improvement. A net 5 percent reported being overweight euro zone stocks, from 11 percent underweight last month. 
But investors' reported intention to own European stocks in the next year dropped to six-year lows as the profit outlook for the region continued to lag.
Allocations to UK stocks increased slightly from last month but the UK remained investors' ""consensus underweight"", BAML said. It has been so since February 2016.

YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan Motor warned its annual profit will plumb six-year lows on waning global sales, underlining the challenges it faces as it also grapples with the fallout from the shocking arrest and ouster of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn.
The Japanese automaker, in its first results since Ghosn was detained in November, unveiled an $84 million charge linked to deferred compensation for the executive who has been indicted for under-reporting his salary at Nissan over 2010-2018. 
The scandal has roiled global auto markets and created tensions between Nissan and its automaking partner France's  Renault  (PA:RENA), raising concerns about the future of the companies that Ghosn wanted to integrate.
The dour outlook indicates an urgent need for Nissan and Renault to strengthen their partnership, but ties have been strained since the Japanese automaker moved first to remove Ghosn as chairman after his Nov. 19 arrest in Tokyo. 
Nissan wants to stabilize alliance operations, said CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who is scheduled to meet newly appointed Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard this week in Japan as they look at ways to cement their partnership.
Ahead of that meeting, the Nissan CEO said he wanted both companies to better leverage their scale to be more competitive and efficient in areas including manufacturing and procurement, while respecting each others' autonomy. 
""In the past few years there's been a lot of talk about 'convergence' of the two companies' operations,"" Saikawa said, referring to one of Ghosn's key aims for the alliance. ""While stabilizing our operations, we need to re-examine whether investments (towards convergence) are the most efficient.""
This could mean a reassessment of the alliance's growth targets through 2022, Saikawa said at a briefing on Tuesday.
Nissan, which is almost 60 percent bigger than Renault by sales, remains junior in their shareholding structure. Renault holds 43.4 percent of Nissan, whereas Nissan has just a 15-percent non-voting stake in Renault.
Japan's second-biggest automaker projected an operating profit of 450 billion yen ($4 billion) for the year to March, down 22 percent from the previous year and 17 percent below an earlier forecast, hurt by a slowdown in global sales. 
This would be Nissan's lowest operating profit since 2013.

SALES TO SKID
Nissan cut its annual global retail vehicle sales view by 5.5 percent and projected weaker sales in China, its biggest market, and the United States. 
Saikawa said Nissan will avoid trying to meet sales targets by using discounts, a strategy which has hurt its profitability in North America, the world's No. 2 auto market.
""We were only able to meet 60 percent to 70 percent of our (global) target for the year to the third quarter,"" Saikawa said. ""If we are not careful about how we make up for that shortfall in the fourth quarter we could find ourselves in similar situations we've seen in the past.""
""So we want to raise our performance by improving the quality of sales,"" he added.
Nissan expects to sell 5.6 million vehicles worldwide in the year to March, versus a previous target for 5.93 million. 
While it still sees sales growing in China, the world's top auto market, it trimmed its forecast for the country to 1.56 million units from 1.70 million units.
In the United States, it now sees sales tumbling 8.6 percent on the year to 1.46 million units, from 1.55 million last year. 
(For an interactive chart on Japanese automakers' vehicle sales in the U.S., China, see https://tmsnrt.rs/2RjnBuA)
Nissan and its domestic rivals, including Toyota Motor Corp, have struggled with sluggish sales and falling profit in North America. Their margins have been squeezed as they resorted to steep discounts to drive up demand in a competitive U.S. market where sales have plateaued near record highs.
While it has been able to repair some of its profits in North America as inventory reduction of older models enabled it to dial back on heavy U.S. discounting, falling demand will test Nissan's ability to be disciplined with its incentives.

GHOSN SALARY PROVISION
The bleak outlook comes as Nissan also grapples with the Ghosn scandal and the resulting scrutiny of its corporate governance. 
Nissan said it had recognized around 9 billion yen ($84 million) in additional expenses linked to payments to Ghosn. This announcement comes after it was indicted alongside Ghosn with failing to disclose the compensation. 
While it is possible that a Japanese court could order Nissan to pay Ghosn that amount, Saikawa said it was ""unlikely"" the expense would be realized.
This provision refers roughly to the amount Ghosn has been charged of under-reporting in his 2010-2018 salary at Nissan.

Ghosn has denied all charges against him.

Shopify said gross merchandising volume rose just 54 percent compared with a 65 percent jump in the same period a year earlier.
Shopify, whose software enables merchants to sell everything from infant formula to cosmetics online, has been investing heavily to boost its market share by introducing augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality based applications.
Shopify AR, for instance, helps shoppers to view 3D models to assess whether the purchase of furniture, among others, will fit in a particular physical space.
The company's operating expenses rose 53.4 percent to $195.2 million in the fourth quarter. 
Shopify said its net loss narrowed to $1.5 million, or 1 cent per share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, from about $3 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier.
Overall revenue rose to $343.9 million from $222.8 million.

Excluding items, the company earned 26 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 20 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The results underscored the success of its multi-year plan to lower costs and reduce bloated inventory. The third-largest U.S. sportswear maker has closed stores, cut jobs and rolled back promotions to bolster profit margins as it tries to recover from a bruising fight for market share with bigger rivals  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (DE:ADSGN).
The sports apparel firm reported earnings per share of $0.09, beating expectations for earnings of $0.04.
Revenue totaled $1.39 billion, just above forecasts of $1.38 billion, with 24% growth in international sales offsetting a 6% drop in North America.
Apparel revenue increased 2% to $970 million, thanks to growth in sales in training wear, but footwear revenue fell 4% to $235 million and accessories revenue fell 6% to $116, driven by declines in outdoor and training sales.
Looking ahead, Under Armour said it expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range between $0.31 and $0.33 in 2019, while revenue is expected to increase approximately 3%-to-4%.
Gross margins rose for the second straight quarter - up 160 basis points to 45.0%, a development it put down to changes in the regional and channel mix, product cost improvements, lower promotional activity, and lower air freight costs.
""Our 2018 results demonstrate significant progress against our multi-year transformation toward becoming an even stronger brand and more operationally excellent company,"" said Under Armour Chairman and CEO Kevin Plank.
Under Armour's stock rose 1.2% in premarket trade to $21.04.
 On February 6, Toyota Motor ADR reported third quarter EPS of $1.14 on revenue of $71.04B, compared to forecasts of EPS of $3.32 on revenue of $68.23B.
Louis Vuitton ADR earnings matched analyst's expectations on January 29, with fourth quarter EPS of $1.56 on revenue of $15.65B. Investing.com analysts expected EPS of $1.56 on revenue of $15.65B

1376,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 06:25AM ET</span>","Citigroup sees Saudi, UAE as top Mideast markets for deals this year: executive","By Hadeel Al Sayegh
ABU DHABI (Reuters) -  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) expects the majority of investment banking opportunities in the Middle East to come from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates this year, said Miguel Azevedo, Citigroup's head of investment banking, Middle East and Africa.
The U.S. lender, which is working towards a full banking license in Saudi Arabia, ended a five-decade presence in the kingdom in 2004 but in 2015 won permission to invest directly in the local stock market and last year gained approval to begin investment banking operations.
""I can see real interest awareness and potential demand for Saudi exposure,"" Azevedo told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Abu Dhabi.
He said a number of companies in Saudi Arabia were working on initial public offerings and that he was optimistic on the level of demand for Saudi stocks.
Foreign investors dumped Saudi equities at the end of last year amid worries over the blow to Saudi Arabia’s relations with the West following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi - a critic of the Saudi leadership - in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
But demand for Saudi securities has picked up this year, ahead of the kingdom's inclusion in the emerging-market indexes of MSCI and FTSE Russell later this year. Last month foreigners bought a net 4.36 billion Saudi riyal ($1.2 billion) of Saudi stocks, according to stock exchange data. 
The Saudi index is up nearly 9.5 percent this year. 
Azevedo said market sentiment towards Saudi Arabia was ""neutral to positive.""
The inclusion in the indexes is expected to attract $15 billion of benchmark-linked funds and billions more in active funds.
Citi expects business in the region to come from the chemical sector, as well as real estate, retail, diversified industrial companies, and banking, said Azevedo.

The plan is meant to avoid a situation under which, after Britain leaves the bloc, national regulators can offer sweeteners to London-based financial firms.
Smaller EU states had tried to completely block the reform, fearing it would reduce their power to attract foreign financial firms. 
But after pressure from larger states led by France and Spain, a compromise was reached by EU finance ministers meeting in Brussels.
Meeting chairman Eugen Teodorovici, Romania's Finance Minister, said talks with EU lawmakers would begin this week to finalize the reform.
In January, the EU parliament adopted a much more ambitious text that would have given EU supervisors more clout. 
Negotiators will now need to find a common ground between governments and lawmakers for the reform to become law before EU elections in May.
The compromise also falls short of an initial plan proposed by the EU Commission two years ago. 

Financial services commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said that, while it ""does not match the high level of ambition"" of that proposal, he could accept the compromise as it was important to move forward with the reform.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The number of jobs in the U.S. solar industry dropped by 3.2 percent in 2018, a second year of losses, as the Trump administration's tariffs on foreign panels and state-level policy changes hit demand for installations, according to an industry report released on Tuesday.
The job losses reflect how changing trade and environmental policies can alter the trajectory of an industry that was among the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. energy industry.
The number of solar energy workers fell by 8,000 to 242,000 in 2018, according to the Solar Jobs Census, released annually by the non-profit research firm The Solar Foundation, following a loss of 10,000 jobs in 2017. But jobs are expected to rise next year, the report said.
In early 2018, President Donald Trump imposed 30 percent tariffs on imported solar panels to boost domestic manufacturing, the opening salvo in what has become a wide-ranging trade war. The move led developers to cancel or freeze billions of dollars of investments in large-installation projects because most of the solar panels used in the United States are made abroad.
On the manufacturing side, there is little evidence so far of a boost. Jobs in the industry's manufacturing sector - a small slice of the overall industry - fell 8 percent in 2018, according to the report. 
Policies of U.S. states are also critical to solar growth, and changes in incentives and rates for projects in large markets led to job losses there, according to the report.
In California, utility procurement slowed because power companies have fulfilled near-term renewable energy procurement requirements. The state's commercial market also slowed due to a shift to rates that are less favorable to solar. In Massachusetts, the commercial market stalled ahead of the introduction of a new incentive scheme at the end of the year. 
The Solar Foundation said it expects a rebound in jobs of 7 percent next year, however, due to recent declines in solar panel prices that have made them more affordable.
China last year slashed subsidies for solar installations, unleashing a flood of low-cost Chinese-made panels onto the international market and pushing prices below what they were before the tariffs were imposed.
Installation will receive the biggest bump, more than 9 percent, the report said, while manufacturing will rise 4 percent, the report said. 

JinkoSolar Holding Co Ltd, Hanwha Q CELLS, and some others are opening U.S. factories to avoid U.S. tariffs.

1386,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 05:31AM ET</span>",Exclusive: India watchdog probes accusations that Google abused Android - sources,"By Aditya Kalra and Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's antitrust commission is looking into accusations that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's unit Google abuses its popular Android mobile operating system to block its rivals, four sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has for the past six months been reviewing a case similar to one Google faced in Europe that led to a fine of 4.34 billion euro ($5 billion) by antitrust regulators last year, three of the sources said. Google has challenged that order.
The European Commission found Google had abused its market dominance since 2011 with practices such as forcing manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and its Chrome browser, together with its Google Play app store on Android devices. 
""It is on the lines of the EU case, but at a preliminary stage,"" said one of the sources, who is aware of the CCI investigation.
Google declined to comment. The CCI did not respond to Reuters' queries. 
The watchdog's enquiry into allegations against Google over its Android platform has not previously been reported. 
Google executives have in recent months met Indian antitrust officials at least once to discuss the complaint, which was filed by a group of individuals, one of the sources said.
The Indian watchdog could ask its investigations unit to further investigate the accusations against Google, or throw out the complaint if it lacks merit. The watchdog's investigations have historically taken years to complete.
Android, used by device makers for free, features on about 85 percent of the world's smartphones. In India, about 98 percent of the smartphones sold in 2018 used the platform, Counterpoint Research estimates.
In October, Google said it would charge smartphone makers a fee for using its popular Google Play app store and also allow them to use rival versions of Android to comply with the EU order.
The change, however, covered only the European Economic Area, which comprises the 28 EU countries and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.
""The CCI will have a tough time not initiating a formal investigation into Google given the EU case, unless they can show the problem has been addressed (by remedies),"" one of the sources said.
The Indian complaint presents the latest regulatory headache for the Mountain View, California-based company in a key growth market.
Last year, the Indian antitrust watchdog imposed a fine of 1.36 billion rupees ($19 million) on Google for ""search bias"" and abuse of its dominant position. It also found Google had put its commercial flight search function in a prominent position on the search results page.

Google appealed against that order, saying the ruling could cause it ""irreparable"" harm and reputational loss, Reuters reported.

(Reuters) - The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), the second largest U.S. pension fund said on Monday it made a $250 million investment with Impactive Capital, a new activist hedge fund that expects to start trading next month.
CalSTRS, which invests $215 billion on behalf of the state's educators, puts money into only a handful of hedge funds, typically favoring activists that engage with companies to help boost returns but often work behind the scenes.
""Their compelling strategy aligns with our long-term investment horizon and our commitment to promoting good governance and sustainable business practices that enhance returns for our members,"" CalSTRS' Chief Investment Officer Christopher Ailman said about Impactive in a statement.
The investment will raise the profile of Impactive, founded last year by hedge fund veterans Lauren Taylor Wolfe and Christian Asmar, and may help the pair raise capital at a time when activist funds have struggled to attract money as returns sagged.
Last year, the average activist hedge fund lost an average 11 percent, according to Hedge Fund Research data.
Taylor Wolfe and Asmar worked together at Blue Harbour Group, another activist hedge fund backed by CalSTRS, and plan to focus on companies' environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies in addition to pushing for better capital allocation and operations.
Traditionally activists prod companies to perform better by buying back shares or spinning off underperforming divisions but a recent growing focus on ESG, like having a diverse corporate board and taking steps to cut carbon emissions, has started to resonate with investors.
Impactive's Taylor Wolfe and Asmar stand out among activist hedge funds for being a woman and a Hispanic in an industry mostly run by white men. Many institutional investors are paying more attention to minority owned firms.
CalSTRS is investing with Impactive for six years, roughly three times longer than the average hedge fund industry investment. This will allow Impactive to make longer-term investments in companies at a time when many hedge funds are criticized for pulling their money out too quickly, before real change can be made.

""The length of the CalSTRS investment gives us the flexibility to look out into the future a little more,"" Taylor Wolfe said in an interview.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish mobile game maker Supercell reported a 26 percent drop in 2018 core profit on Tuesday due to falling revenue for its ageing hit games Clash of Clans and Clash Royale.
Supercell, founded in 2010 and valued in 2016 at around $10 billion, grew for years on the back of the success of its few hit games. Its biggest hit, Clash of Clans - the world's fourth-largest game in 2018 - was launched in 2012.
The Helsinki-based firm, majority owned by China's Tencent Holdings Ltd, said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) fell to 537 million euros ($605.15 million) from 729 million a year earlier.
Company revenue dropped 24 percent to 1.37 billion euros from 1.8 billion a year ago.
Chief Executive Ilkka Paananen said the company had high hopes for its fifth game, Brawl Stars, which it launched globally mid-December. The game has topped the charts in more than 50 countries, including Japan and Korea.
""Throughout history Asian markets have been difficult to conquer for Western game developers,"" Paananen said.
The bulk of its 2018 profit came from Supercell's four games - Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, Boom Beach and Hay Day - which have each generated more than $1 billion in revenue from in-game purchases since their launch.
The company did not disclose sales figures for its titles, but Paananen said its biggest titles, Clash of Clans and Clash Royale, saw the deepest declines.
Supercell slipped last year to the No 7 spot in the global mobile game publisher rankings, based on revenue collected on Apple's iOS and Google's Play stores, according to research company App Annie. It was ranked No 2 in 2016.
Supercell's Clash of Clans was the fourth most widely played game in 2018 - according to App Annie data - after Happy Elements' Anipop, Tencent's Honour of Kings and Activision Blizzard's Candy Crush Saga.

Supercell, which has kept its operational independence and Helsinki headquarters, first sold a stake to Japan's Softbank in 2013. Tencent bought Softbank's stake in 2016 for $8.6 billion and has increased its shareholding to 88 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares opened higher on Tuesday as investors cheered signs of a compromise in the standoff over the U.S. government funding and positive signals around U.S.-China trade talks, while Michelin's results pumped up tire stocks.
The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.6 percent at 0940 GMT, with Germany's trade-sensitive DAX up 1.1 percent and Paris' CAC 40 up 0.8 percent.
Automakers and their suppliers were the biggest gainers, up 2 percent after  Michelin  (PA:MICP) delivered better-than-expected results and pledged further gains in operating profit this year despite challenging conditions.
The French tire maker's shares rallied more than 10 percent and were on track for their best day in nearly a decade. 
Italy's Pirelli and Germany's Continental were among the top gainers in their domestic markets and on the STOXX 600.
London indices underperformed their euro-zone peers amid caution ahead of a parliamentary address by British Prime Minister Theresa May later in the day as she struggles to secure a Brexit deal.
Highlighting the headwinds that threaten the rally in global equities so far this year,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said it was shifting to a 'neutral' stance on global equities, taking profit on its 'overweight' view.
""While we continue to expect overall attractive total returns from global equities this year, we recognize certain mounting short-term risks,"" it said.
""In particular, we note that investors remain thin-skinned after last December's correction.""
Furthermore, the U.S.-China trade conflict could lead to renewed volatility, while growing political tensions in Italy, France and Germany and the still uncertain Brexit outcome could weigh further on European stocks, it said.
Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) shares turned positive in midmorning trade as investors took comfort from upbeat comments about the Q1 outlook.
Shares had fallen as much as 3.3 percent in early deals as the better-than-expected sales failed to impress investors, a sign of the demanding expectations for luxury brand earnings following solid numbers from the sector, including LVMH last week.
Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) shares fell 2 percent after its mixed report. The German steel-to-elevator maker stood by its 2018/19 targets, but warned the global economic environment is darkening after reporting a big drop in first-quarter results.
Investors continued to punish TUI as the tour operator reported a widening loss in its quarter to end-December. That follows its profit warning last week. 

Online trading platform Plus500 (LON:PLUSP) lost more than a third of its value after the company issued a profit and revenue warning, blaming tightening EU regulation on its retail business. The news dragged peer IG with it.

1392,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 04:55AM ET</span>",MarketPulse Europe - Automotives Bounce After Michelin Update,"Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are broadly higher on Tuesday on hopes that another U.S. government shutdown can be avoided, and on the back of some positive earnings surprises.
Automakers and their suppliers are faring well after French tiremaker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) raised its dividend and gave a solid – if still ‘mixed’ – outlook for 2019. Its shares, which lost over 30% in 2018, rose over 10%, also pulling rivals Continental (DE:CONG) and Pirelli (MI:PIRC) higher.
The Stoxx 600 Automobiles & Parts index was up 2.1% by 04:45 AM ET (0945 GMT), while the benchmark Stoxx 50 was up 0.7% at 3,189.15.
Tiremakers, like most automotive stocks, have been seen by some analysts as oversold after a relentless stream of bad news last year, most of it related to the U.S.-China trade war.
The news continues to be largely negative – Nissan slashed its profit forecast by nearly 20% this morning for the fiscal year ending in March, and there is no sign of a breakthrough yet in the trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Beijing. But the reaction to the Michelin numbers suggest that, for now at least, more than enough bad news has been priced in already.
Elsewhere, Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) more than met expectations for the fourth quarter, but its shares added only 0.6% after rallying 14% already this year on the back of strong earnings from its peers in the luxury sector.
While all the noise around luxury groups has been mainly about Chinese demand holding up well, it was the U.S. which gave Kering the biggest kick to sales last year: revenues from North America rose 37.8%, while those in Asia-Pacific rose ‘only’ 33.8%."

1397,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 02:30AM ET</span>","China Bond Rally Still Has Room to Run, Ex-HKMA Manager Says","(Bloomberg) -- China isn’t done with easing yet, which means shorter-maturity bonds are set to extend last year’s rally, according to Edmund Ng, a former head of investments at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
The People’s Bank of China may shift the interest-rate corridor down by 10 basis points in the second quarter if economic data continue to show softness, said Ng, who left the HKMA in 2015 and established investment firm Eastfort Asset Management Pte Ltd.
“2019 should still be a mild bull market for China bonds, at least for the first half of the year given a dovish Fed, slowing onshore growth and more aggressive PBOC stance,” said Ng, who favors the nation’s five-year notes. A tweak in in the interest-rate corridor would be a milder signal from the central bank, though it would still “achieve a reduction of financing costs,” he said.
Yields on China’s benchmark five- and 10-year notes have tumbled by almost 100 basis points over the past year as the U.S.-China trade war dent exports and factory output, spurring investors to seek havens. The nation’s sovereign bonds posted the best returns last year among 34 markets tracked by Bloomberg.
Ng joins other investors including Fidelity International in betting there will be further gains. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management said in December that yields on sovereign notes due in five and 10 years may decline by as much as 30 basis points by the end of the first quarter.
Yields on five-year notes dropped to about 2.90 percent at the end of January from around 3.90 percent a year earlier, while 10-year yields slipped to more than a three-year low of 3.08 percent on Thursday from almost 4 percent.
Read: How Low Can China Bond Yield Go? 10-Year Rate Flirts With 3%
Chinese bonds with maturities below five years “should be a better risk-reward trade” compared with longer-dated paper amid an upcoming influx of supply, Ng said.
Ng said he expects the yuan to strengthen in the next few months thanks partly to the inclusion of Chinese bonds into global benchmarks. It is a sentiment echoed by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) that sees the yuan rising to 6.55 per dollar by end-2019 as China opens its markets to foreign capital.
Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, said last month it would add yuan-denominated government and policy bank bonds to the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Global Aggregate Index from April.
The Federal Reserve signalling it will likely pause rather than hike rates in the near term “only means the PBOC can be more aggressive in providing liquidity or reducing financing costs of the real economy,” Ng said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - As the Chinese territory of Macau marks 20 years since its handover from Portuguese rule, slower mainland economic growth, a weaker yuan and a simmering trade war threaten to derail growth in the world's biggest casino hub.
Macau, on China's southern coast, is the only place in the country where casino gambling is legal. But casino revenue shrunk in January for the first time in more than two years, the government said, hampered by a lack of big-spending VIP players and a smoking ban imposed at the start of the year.
To compound matters, China this week lowered its economic growth target to 6-6.5 percent in 2019 as Beijing copes with U.S. tariffs and weakening domestic demand. ""We remain watching the situation with caution ... global growth is uncertain, and where the trade war ends up is also uncertain,"" Matthew Maddox, chief executive of Wynn Macau, said on a conference call with investors on Jan 30. ""We continue to experience peaks and valleys in Macau.""
Policy and regulatory changes are in focus this year with the election of a new leader in the Chinese special administrative region. And next year, casino licenses for Sands China, Wynn Macau, MGM China, Melco Resorts, SJM Holdings and Galaxy Entertainment will begin expiring.
Authorities have continued a multi-year clampdown on illicit capital flows from the mainland, taking aim at underground lending and illegal cash transfers. 
The most recent bust, in January, involved the seizure of more than 30 billion yuan ($4.42 billion) just after Chinese President Xi Jinping warned of deep and complicated risks to China's economy.
Regulators in Macau are also strengthening operating and disclosure rules for junket operators, such as tighter supervision of their accounts. 
Tasked with bringing in VIPs to play in the glitzy casinos, these middlemen provide credit for high rollers and collect on their debts. 
A new bill would regulate junkets further, said Paulo Chan, director of Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau. The legislation is meant to improve the compliance of junkets, which often use underground banking networks. 
The measures are expected to further cool the VIP market, which accounts for about half of the monthly $3 billion in casino revenue. 
FLOOD OF VISITORS
During the Chinese New Year holiday, there was a 26.6 percent jump in visitors to the territory, hitting a record 1.2 million arrivals over seven days, according to data from Macau's Tourism body. Hotels had an average occupancy rate of 97 percent. 
Those visitors, however, are spending less inside Macau's 39 casinos. Chinese consumers looking for more ""experiential"" holidays are instead heading out for egg tarts and to take selfies amid Macau's pastel-hued architecture. The lower growth adds pressure for casino operators struggling with rising costs, said Praveen Choudhary, an analyst at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) based in Hong Kong. 
Data on Chinese domestic loans and total social financing point to negative trends in the next six months, he added.
Although the newly opened Hong Kong-Macau-Zhuhai bridge now offers a 30-minute connection between Macau and Hong Kong's international airport, limited hotel supply constrains overnight visitor growth, executives say, and a weaker yuan could affect how much they spend.
Analysts are unsure how bad the casino slowdown this year will be, with forecasts ranging from low single-digit growth to a decline.
The political leader Macau chooses in 2019 will work with mainland authorities for the next five years. The two likely contenders are Ho Iat Seng, president of Macau's Legislative Assembly, and Lionel Leong, the secretary for economy and finance, which oversees the gaming industry.
Robert Goldstein, president of Las Vegas Sands, which controls Sands China, said the company remained strong believers in Macau.

""There is always something to worry about. We get that,"" he said. ""We are just very bullish and we are blinded by the extreme size of Macau, the market today but more important the market tomorrow.""

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 01:25AM ET</span>",Indian airline sector to shrink losses by two-thirds next year: CAPA India,"By Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's airlines are poised to cut their cumulative losses by as much as two-thirds in the financial year starting in April due to a more stable oil price, with low-cost carriers returning to profitability, aviation consultancy CAPA India said on Tuesday.
Its forecast is for Indian carriers to lose a collective $550 million to $700 million for financial year 2020, against an estimated $1.7 billion loss for the 2019 year ending in March. 
The latter figure is an improvement to CAPA India's last forecast for losses of up to $1.9 billion issued in September when oil prices were higher.
""The opportunity exists to create a sustainable, profitable future within 1-2 years,"" CAPA India CEO Kapil Kaul said as the forecast was released at its annual conference in New Delhi. ""This will drive serious investor interest given the size of the market.""
A narrowing of losses will ease the pressure on Indian carriers in financing the hundreds of Airbus SE and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co jets they have on order. They are tapping rising demand from a growing middle class in the world's fastest-growing major domestic aviation market and expanding operations internationally.
Domestic air traffic is forecast to rise by 14 to 16 percent in financial year 2020, CAPA India said, with international traffic set to be 10 to 12 percent higher as the Indian fleet expands by more than 90 aircraft.
Cut-throat competition has made India one of the world's cheapest domestic airline markets with deals such as $50 one-way tickets on the two-hour flight from Mumbai to Delhi. High fuel prices, a weak rupee and intense competition dragged down airline financial results for much of 2018.
But fares are on the rise with low-cost carriers IndiGo and SpiceJet Ltd reporting higher yields and swinging to net profits in the quarter ended Dec. 31 after losses earlier in the financial year.
Budget carriers, which include IndiGo, SpiceJet, AirAsia India and GoAir are expected to post a combined profit of $100 million to $150 million in the 2020 year, whereas full-service carriers Air India, Jet Airways Ltd and Vistara will rack up $700 million to $800 million of combined losses, CAPA India said on Tuesday.
Jet Airways, which controls a sixth of India's aviation market and has net debt of $1.13 billion, is seeking a financial bailout with money owed to employees, vendors and aircraft lessors.

The airline is in talks with shareholder Etihad Airways and key lender State Bank of India for a rescue deal but for any proposal to be accepted, its founder and chairman Naresh Goyal would need to give up his controlling stake, sources have said.

1401,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2019 01:24AM ET</span>",Renault's Senard to meet Nissan CEO Saikawa in Japan this week: Nissan,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Renault's (PA:RENA) chairman will meet Nissan Motor's (T:7201) CEO this week in Japan as they look at ways to cement their partnership after the ouster of former alliance leader Carlos Ghosn, the Japanese automaker said on Tuesday. 
Jean-Dominique Senard, named chairman of the French automaker last month, will visit Nissan's headquarters in Yokohama to meet the company's executives and become better acquainted with its Japanese partner.
""Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa is eager to familiarize Senard with Nissan and Alliance operations to optimize their work together,"" the automaker said in a statement.
Earlier in the day, Saikawa told Japanese media that he was keen to smooth Nissan-Renault relations that have been strained in the past few months following Ghosn's arrest in Tokyo and his immediate dismissal as Nissan chairman. 
""First of all, we have to restore trust and stabilize the relationship,"" the Nikkei quoted Saikawa as saying. ""We want him to know more about Nissan's (management) team.""
Kyodo news reported that Senard would visit for two days from Feb. 14. 
Senard, formerly CEO of tire maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP), joined  Renault  as chairman in late January after Ghosn was forced to resign from the French automaker in the wake of his arrest on allegations of financial misconduct. 
Ghosn has been indicted in Japan for under-reporting his Nissan salary for eight years and temporarily transferring personal losses on to the automaker's books around during the global financial crisis. 
The once-feted executive, credited for turning around both Renault and Nissan, remains in detention as he awaits trial that could be several months away. He denies any wrongdoing.
Speculation about the future capital structure of the Renault-Nissan partnership has been rife since the arrest of Ghosn, who had been exploring ways to make the alliance ""irreversible"" before his arrest.
But Saikawa has argued it is not time to discuss the ideal structure of the alliance, although he has said he wants to work closely with Senard who will likely sit on Nissan's board.
The automaking alliance has been underpinned by Renault's 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, which in turn owns a 15 percent non-voting stake in Renault. 
The French government owns a 15 percent stake in Renault.

The head of Japan's industry ministry on Tuesday denied media reports that the government had been told by France that it could lower its stake in Nissan, Jiji news reported, echoing a similar denial by France's finance ministry last week.

The comments raised hopes of a trade deal before a March 1 deadline for higher tariffs.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.7% and 1.4% by 9:25 PM ET (02:25 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.2%.
The gain in Chinese stocks came after White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News earlier in the day that Trump wants to meet with Chinese President Xi “very soon.”
“This president wants a deal. He wants it to be fair to Americans and American workers and American interests” Conway added.
“He has forged a mutually respectful relationship with President Xi. They will meet again soon.”
Earlier this month, Trump told reporters that he did not plan to meet Xi before the March deadline. If there is no deal by then, Trump has said he might double the rate of tariffs on around $200 billion in Chinese goods.
High-level officials including U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are gathering in Beijing this week for the latest round of trade discussions.
In other news, the Huawei saga returned to focus on Tuesday after U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo hinted at an us-or-them ultimatum to countries buying equipment from the Chinese telecoms company.
“If that equipment is co-located where we have important American systems, it makes it more difficult for us to partner alongside them,” Pompeo told reporters in Budapest on Monday.
Pompeo then warned that countries using Huawei equipment could expose themselves to “security risks.”
“They get to make their own decisions with respect to these things,” Pompeo said. “What is imperative is that we share with them the things we know about the risks that Huawei’s presence in their networks present.”
The news came as research firm IDC revealed in its latest report that Apple’s iPhone shipments fell 19.9% during the fourth quarter in China.
“Under the impact of China's severe macro environment and domestic brand innovation products, consumers' increasingly harsh eyes are also the reasons for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s continued decline in the domestic market,” IDC said, adding that the increasing strength of Huawei’s brand and its flagship phone’s “excellent technology” helped it to eat up Apple’s shipment losses in China.
Elsewhere in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 reopened today and jumped 2.6% in morning trade. A weaker yen was cited as a tailwind for local stocks.

Owens-Illinois was granted the award in 2015 by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, which said the company was entitled to $372 million plus interest, the filing in the U.S. District Court in Delaware showed.
The lawsuit names state oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA PDVSA and its U.S. refining unit Citgo Petroleum Corp, claiming that they are ""alter egos, and mere instrumentalities of Venezuela itself.""
The cash-strapped Venezuelan government has little in the way of offshore assets, which has encouraged creditors to consider creative ways to collect.
In November, Venezuela reached a deal with Canadian mining firm Crystallex International Corp that had sought to collect an arbitration award against Venezuela by seizing Citgo via a court order. The government agreed to pay $1.2 billion in installments to protect Citgo.
PDVSA in August agreed a $2 billion settlement with ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) after the U.S. producer had seized PDVSA Caribbean assets in an attempt to enforce its claim.
Previous agreements by the Venezuelan government and its state-run companies over dozens of arbitrations and legal claims related to late socialist President Hugo Chavez's nationalizations have mostly ended in renegotiations and legal disputes.
PDVSA and Citgo did not respond to requests for comment outside regular working hours.
It is unclear whether the case could be affected by U.S. sanctions against PDVSA, amid an intense power struggle for control in Venezuela between President Nicolas Maduro and self-declared head of state Juan Guaido.
The case is OI European Group BV v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 19-cv-00290, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>","Marathon, Galveston Bay workers to resume contract talks: official","HOUSTON (Reuters) - Union workers at Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) Corp's Galveston Bay Refinery are preparing to resume negotiations with the company after rejecting the last contract offer, a United Steelworkers (USW) official said.
The Galveston Bay Refinery, located in Texas City, Texas, was the site of a bitter strike in 2015, which began over a breakdown in national contract talks but lasted almost five months because of disagreements on local terms.
On Monday, Marathon spokesman Sid Barth said: ""Negotiations continue, operations continue.""
No date has been set for the talks, said David Jankowski, vice president of USW Local 13-1, which represents workers at the refinery.
""We're waiting on the company for dates and times,"" Jankowski said.
The Galveston Bay workers rejected Marathon's contract offer in voting last week.
One reason for the overwhelming vote against Marathon's offer was a proposed change in leadership on the production units to salaried staff from hourly chief operators, Jankowski said.
Marathon is also seeking changes in time off and sick leave.
Negotiators for the USW International union reached agreement on Jan. 31 with Shell (LON:RDSa) Oil Co, representing oil companies, on wages increases and benefits for 30,000 refinery, chemical plant, pipeline and terminal workers represented by the union, including the hourly employees at the Galveston Bay Refinery.
That agreement, which provides an 11 percent pay raise over its three-year length, will be paired with the agreement on local issues at Galveston Bay to make the contract for workers at the refinery.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.21%, the S&P 500 rose 0.07%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.13%.
A second round of trade talks between the U.S. and China got underway Monday, but investors remain uncertain of whether the two nations would be able to reach a consensus on trade before the current trade war truce ends on March 1.
If both nations fail to reach a deal by March 1, President Donald Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 25% from 10%, risking a potential escalation in the trade dispute, which will likely hurt investor sentiment on stocks.
Still, the trade-sensitive industrial sector ended the day higher, helped by solid gains in  Norfolk Southern  (NYSE:NSC) after the railroad company outlined a plan to increase revenue and growth.
In Washington, meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers showed little sign of averting a second government shutdown in less than two months after they failed to reach an agreement on Sunday over immigrant detention policy ahead of Trump's Feb. 15 deadline.
On the earnings front, Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) closed 1.7% higher after reporting above-consensus fourth-quarter earnings and in-line revenue. The company operates through the Tim Horton's coffee, Burger King and the Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen chains.
The beat on the bottom line was driven by comparable sales strength at Tim Hortons and Popeyes, though slowing comparables at Burger King held back gains.
A rise in the energy sector limited downside in the broader market, even though U.S. oil prices fell 0.6% as concerns that an escalation in the U.S.-China war may hurt oil demand.
The communications services sector was led lower by a plunge in Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI).
Activision Blizzard reportedly is planning to announce significant job cuts when it releases earnings on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Its shares fell 7.6%.
Other game publishers, including  Take-Two Interactive  (NASDAQ:TTWO) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) also ended the day lower.
In other corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose 2.3% after Canaccord Genuity upgraded its rating to buy from hold and hiked its price target on the stock to $450 a share from $330.
The bullish upgrade from Canaccord on Tesla comes as others on Wall Street turn their attention to the launch of company's Model 3 vehicle in Europe.
""The profitability picture for 2019 and the all-important Model 3 demand trajectory in Europe for Tesla looks encouraging for Musk & Co., but there is clearly heavy lifting ahead around Europe logistics/cost-cutting/driving incremental U.S. demand that will remain overhangs and thus make Tesla a 'prove me' story the next few quarters,"" Wedbush said.

1419,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 04:30PM ET</span>","U.S. Seeks Maduro Regime’s Venezuelan Bond Holdings, Sources Say","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. is seeking to loosen Nicolas Maduro’s grip on power in Venezuela by identifying accounts his regime could use to sell bonds and raise cash, according to six people familiar with the matter.
Treasury Department officials told investors that its ban on Venezuelan debt trading is in part designed to prevent sales that could benefit the authoritarian government, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to discuss the matter. The restrictions are so sweeping because at this point Treasury can’t be sure which transactions might be providing money to the regime or high-ranking officials, they said.
A Treasury Department spokesperson declined to comment.
Venezuela observers have long suspected that billions of dollars of the country’s bonds, most issued years ago, are held in local accounts controlled by individuals connected to the administration or by state-owned entities like the central bank, Banco de Venezuela and the Economic and Social Development Bank. Such notes came under scrutiny in May 2017, when Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management bought $2.8 billion of securities from the state oil company through a broker, providing cash to a financially strapped regime carrying out a deadly crackdown on street protests.
Treasury met with investors in Washington early last week to explain the scope of the sanctions and hear concerns, according to the people. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, a part of the Treasury Department, is gathering data from banks on Maduro’s access to raise cash, another person familiar with the matter said. The government can gather information from U.S. financial institutions to thwart money laundering and financial crime under the Bank Secrecy Act’s know-your-customer provision.
Officials have been reviewing intermediary accounts from Miami to Panama City and the Cayman Islands to look for connections to suspect accounts, the people said. While there’s optimism recent sanctions that largely prohibit trading in Venezuelan debt have been effective in cutting off sales that could benefit the government, the ban would need to be re-evaluated if a political transition takes longer than expected, the people said.
The U.S. and dozens of other nations have backed National Assembly leader Juan Guaido as interim president, and officials sees cutting off funding as a critical component of pressuring Maduro to leave office peacefully.
As of last year, roughly $17 billion worth of the nation’s notes were in local accounts, according to New York-based brokerage firm Torino Capital. About $60 billion of Venezuelan bonds are in default.
“Is it a crime or illegal for public banks to sell their securities in the secondary market?” Simon Zerpa, Venezuela’s Finance Minister, said in an interview. “The question comes with the stain that we cannot seek resources to help the economy of our country work.”
Venezuela’s benchmark bonds suffered their worst week in more than a year last week as trading restrictions sapped demand for the defaulted debt. The $4 billion of government notes due in 2027 tumbled 3.7 cents to about 30 cents on the dollar, according to price quotes compiled by Bloomberg. Investors had bid up the debt earlier this year as Guaido and his allies gained momentum in their efforts to oust Maduro from power.
On Monday, the Treasury Department updated its measures on Venezuela. The latest guidelines clarify that U.S. broker dealers can help facilitate the sale of Venezuelan debt as part of any divestment to non-U.S. entities and that U.S. clearinghouses can act as custodians for the bonds, according to F. Amanda DeBusk, chair of Dechert’s international trade practice in Washington.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Home furnishings retailer Crate and Barrel will partner with home services platform Handy to offer furniture assembly and home decor installation across the United States, joining a growing list of big box retailers seeking to win over shoppers with handyman services, a Handy spokesperson said on Monday.
Customers who dislike do-it-yourself chores will now be able to walk up to store associates at any of the 90 Crate and Barrel stores across the country and arrange for a Handy worker to come to their home between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m., any day of the week, to complete the task.
The Northbrook, Illinois-based retailer was expected to announce the partnership later on Monday. The decision is the latest example of a big box retailer responding to new online competition by offering a range of services complementing its furniture assortment.
Odd-jobs site Task Rabbit, a rival of Handy, was bought by Swedish furniture giant IKEA in September 2017. Determined to win over online shoppers, IKEA told Reuters it was expanding into interior design and looking at services such as furniture repair to gain an edge.
For now, Crate and Barrel customers will only be able to book a Handy worker while physically in the store and Handy installation is not currently available for Crate and Barrel products purchased online, a Handy spokesperson said.
Prices for the handyman services range from $59 to $199, a Handy spokesperson said. Hanging wall art, for example, costs $65. Desk assembly costs $109.
This is the first time Crate and Barrel is doing business with Handy, which also offers home services such as furniture assembly and television mounting via partnerships with retailers Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Wayfair Inc and eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY).
Separately, Walmart Inc on Friday debuted an online-exclusive furniture brand dubbed ""MoDRN"" and said in a company blog post it would launch new furniture and decor seasonally.
Over the past year, Walmart has seen a nearly 35 percent increase in visits to its home destination, with most customers spending more time on the site, according to the post.

The companies did not reveal financial terms of the partnership.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Swiss authorities are assisting Brazilian prosecutors in their investigation into an alleged corruption scheme involving global commodity trading firms Vitol,  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) and Trafigura, a spokesman for the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland said on Monday. 
The spokesman said the attorney general's office had received requests between June 2018 and January 2019 for ""mutual legal assistance"" from Brazilian prosecutors relating to their probe.
Brazilian prosecutors have alleged that executives of the commodities companies, including some in the United States, were involved in improper payments to executives at Brazil's state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA.
The U.S. Justice Department has launched its own investigation into these business dealings. 
The attorney general's spokesman added the requests concerned ""in particular two of the three companies mentioned, as well as several natural persons (individual people). These requests are still being executed."" He did not identify the two companies or the individuals.
Brazilian federal prosecutors and the trading firms did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Vitol and Glencore have previously said they are cooperating with Brazilian authorities, and Trafigura has said it takes the allegations seriously. All three have been suspended from business dealings with Petrobras.
In December last year, Brazilian prosecutors alleged the three firms and others collectively paid at least $31 million in bribes over a six-year period to Petrobras officials to secure advantages in deals. 
The announcement marked a new phase in the years long ""Car Wash"" corruption probe that has toppled presidents in two countries and sent more than 130 politicians and businessmen to jail across Latin America.
Swiss, U.S. and Brazilian authorities have worked closely on Car Wash cases that led to the world's largest ever leniency deal after industrial conglomerate Odebrecht agreed to pay $2.6 billion. 
The Swiss attorney general announced in November 2016 that it had opened a criminal probe into a Trafigura employee as part of a wider investigation into suspected corruption at Petrobras.

The spokesman said that investigation was ongoing, without providing an update.

Drawing on the movies about fictional boxer Rocky Balboa, Davis said that markets face a tough fight, even if they ultimately ride out the year. The odds of a recession in 2019 have increased to about 35 percent from 30 percent, he said during a speech at the annual Inside ETFs conference in Hollywood, Florida. The chances for a recession next year are 40 percent to 50 percent.
“Even when Rocky wins the fight he takes a pretty ugly beating along the way,” Davis said. “His down-but-not-out attitude truly aligns with our U.S. and global economic outlook,” he said, adding that the $5 trillion-plus asset manager isn’t expecting anything quite as dramatic as a boxing match.
Portfolio ‘Ballast’
Asset managers had a brutal 2018 -- an experience Davis homed in on -- as volatility spiked and stocks tumbled at year-end. One index of fund companies and custody banks lost 25 percent of its value for the year, according to Vanguard’s 2019 outlook.
Among the top questions that Davis said he gets from clients is what’s driving that volatility, and how stocks ended up in, or near, a bear market last year. Davis highlighted several drivers of price swings, including the Federal Reserve reaching “an inflection point” on whether to continue raising rates or pause. Higher valuations in credit markets and a projected slowdown in global growth could also contribute to market uncertainty, he said in a press briefing following his talk.
Davis said the solution for investors is to seek out fixed-income securities, which can provide “ballast” to a portfolio.
Vanguard itself has been positioning more defensively on active credit, expecting the yield curve to steepen as the Federal Reserve nears the end of its rate-rising cycle.
A down market may not be a problem for Vanguard’s own expansion. The Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based firm is poised to pass BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). as the world’s largest asset manager within the next decade, according to research by Bloomberg Intelligence analysts.
Vanguard already oversees more than $5 trillion, putting it within $1 trillion of BlackRock. It could gain even more quickly if markets decline, catching up with BlackRock in three to four years in a down market, according to the report.

Coty (NYSE:COTY) continued a big rally following its surge Friday, when the beauty products company reported above-forecast fiscal second-quarter earnings. Its shares rose nearly 4% to $9.70 Monday.
The company reported earnings of $0.24 a share on revenue of $2.51 billion, beating estimates compiled by Investing.com for $0.22 a share on revenue of $2.47 billion.
Human resources group Insperity (NYSE:NSP) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, sending its shares 18% higher to $131.

Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29 but has yet to seal a withdrawal agreement, posing a potential risk to airlines that do not meet EU rules requiring European carriers to be majority-owned and operated in the bloc.
Airlines that will no longer be majority owned by EU nationals once Britain leaves the EU face the threat of losing their right to fly within the bloc after Brexit due to share ownership rules.
European Commission sources told Reuters that Brussels encouraged IAG and all airlines concerned to check with the national licensing authorities whether they would still meet the operating license requirements in case of a ""no deal"" Brexit.
IAG said in a statement it would suspend the voting rights of any shares acquired by a relevant non-EU person and require the owner to sell the shares to a third party or to the airline group itself. 
But IAG said that United Kingdom citizens would not be subjected to this buying cap. 
IAG is registered in Spain and has its corporate headquarters in Britain. It has shareholders from around the world. 

The Spanish government has said it is confident national flag carrier Iberia is a Spanish company and will be able to fly across Europe in the event of a disorderly Brexit.

1443,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 02:20PM ET</span>",Investors Hedge a Stock Doomsday With Record Fixed-Income Inflows,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are amassing an expensive insurance policy against market doomsday.
Confident that fragile economies will keep monetary policy makers in dovish straight-jackets, they poured another $490 million into the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ:TLT) ETF last week -- bringing its year-to-date inflow to a record $2.3 billion.
That stocks will suffer as a result of this brittle growth outlook has also helped push three-month trailing inflows into fixed-income ETFs to the highest on record through end-January, according to  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
“Fears of worsening economic momentum coupled with geopolitical uncertainties and corporate earnings revisions that appear to have limited upside has triggered a rush for safety,” said Antoine Lesne, head of SPDR ETF Strategy & Research for Europe at State Street Global Advisors. “Fixed income is thus a good place to be relative to higher potential drawdowns in equity portfolio.”
After climbing up along with stocks, Treasury yields reversed course mid-January, signalling the bond market is prepping for slower growth and inflation.
A rally in German bonds pushed benchmark 10-year yields below 0.1 percent Monday morning to a two-year low on the heels of dimming economic projections.
Investors have added $18.4 billion into U.S.-listed fixed-income funds this year, nearly as much as they’ve pulled from equity funds -- $18.9 billion -- according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Though some of those outflows may be down to tax-loss harvesting, it’s the most lopsided relationship between the two asset classes since 2016.
Bonds aren’t rejecting risk altogether, of course: Strong inflows into U.S. high-yield credit persist, even though high corporate debt loads look vulnerable in an economic slowdown.

1444,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 02:10PM ET</span>",Weird Market Moves Mean No One Knows If It's Goldilocks Or Bust,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are riding helter-skelter markets -- causing headaches as they try to figure out whether Goldilocks is back or recession is nigh.
From stocks, currencies to commodities, a slew of assets are moving in seemingly erratic ways.
Take the U.S. dollar -- it’s on a rip higher ever since the Federal Reserve took a dovish pivot. Small-cap stocks are among the best-performing equities out there, even though the only thing everyone seems to agree on is that we’re late in the cycle. And industrial metals and miners are surging as the world’s biggest consumer slows down.
It all helps to explain the lack of consensus that’s been on display across markets this year.
“It’s very erratic and a clear direction is missing,” reckons Georgette Boele, a currency and commodity strategist at ABN Amro Bank NV. “There’s a lot of uncertainty with Brexit, trade negotiations, China’s economy, the weaker euro zone data and unclear picture about U.S. data -- this all makes it a very hard market to trade.”
While bulls in credit and emerging markets are on the rampage, government bonds are getting a mammoth bid and outflows are hitting rallying stocks.
Here are some other head-scratchers in markets right now.
Dovish Dollar Rally
Expectations of looser monetary policy in the world’s strongest economy would usually be a headwind for the greenback. Yet after an initial leg lower as the Federal Open Market Committee said it “will be patient"" on policy decisions at the end of January, the dollar hasn’t looked back.
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose on Monday for the eighth consecutive session, up about 1.5 percent since Jan. 30.
The key here appears to be taking the Fed pivot in context -- American policy makers may be signaling we’re near the end of the tightening cycle, but in other key regions the economic and inflationary outlook is even worse. On a relative basis, therefore, the dollar and U.S. assets remain attractive.
Risky and Resilient
Despite the headwind of a rising dollar, emerging-market assets have largely held on to the year’s stellar gains. The MSCI Emerging Market Index of shares is up 7.2 percent, while a gauge of developing-nation currencies is also higher.
Despite this, bearish positioning in options markets on these countries’ currencies and equities is below the historical average, according to analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
The market calculation: Developing-nation assets looked too cheap after a miserable fourth quarter, stimulus in China will fire up the world’s second-biggest economy and the dovish Fed suggests there’ll be less pressure on global liquidity.
Metals Mayhem
China is the world’s biggest consumer of big-name commodities, so a slowdown there might be thought of as negative for miners and metals prices, other things being equal. Looser U.S. policy, particularly on the expectation of slowing growth, should also tend to support gold more than other raw materials.
The yellow metal did indeed enjoy a robust start to 2019, as its status as a counter-cyclical haven came into play. But in a counter-intuitive move, pretty much every industrial raw material seems to have outperformed it.
While iron ore’s jump could be down to a deadly dam burst in Brazil, that doesn’t explain why nickel -- which isn’t as dependent on the same facility -- should also be on a tear. As with emerging-market assets, the logic for this may be linked to performance last year: These raw materials had such a miserable run that even as growth worries mount, investors see a lot of upside.
Industrial Revolution
This dynamic is echoed in stock markets, where basic resources companies are the best-performing sector in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Miners are typically pro-cyclical, making them a risky play this late in the cycle. However, the sector is up 11 percent since the start of the year, versus 7 percent for the main European gauge.
A rebound from an overwrought sell-off? Think again. To bulls, it’s another clear risk-on signal -- and a hint that global growth concerns are overdone.
“The miners are like cowboys, shooting the lights out,” said Rene Hochreiter, a mining analyst at Johannesburg Noah Capital Markets Ltd. “All these fears of a recession last year are disappearing.”
Small Rebellion
Here’s another set of stocks that’s not meant to flourish in late cycle: Small caps.
These U.S. companies have risen more than 10 percent in 2019, outperforming their large-cap counterparts. That’s happened even as earnings forecasts for the S&P Small Cap 600 Index were slashed by 3.9 percent, compared with around 2.5 percent or so for the S&P 500.
In other words, traders appear willing to take on greater risk for relatively lower returns.
Sure the dollar, easier credit conditions and a still-robust U.S. economy all have something to do with it. But it’s another confusing signal for investors grappling with risk-on, risk-off markets."

The series D funding round saw a $150 million investment from Tencent and the company's former investors, including Sequoia, Fidelity, Tacit and Snoop Dogg.
The investment from a China-based company, news of which started making the rounds around five days ago, quickly ignited censorship fears on Reddit, which calls itself the ""front page of the internet."" Reddit is banned in China under the country's censorship laws. Barring the latest funding, San Francisco, California-based Reddit has raised more than $250 million in three other funding rounds. Its last funding was on Aug. 1, at a valuation of around $1.8 billion. The company has over 20 investors, including Advance Publications, which owns Conde Nast, Reddit's one-time parent company. The company recently faced a user data breach where a hacker broke into its systems and accessed data, including current email addresses and a 2007 database backup containing old encrypted passwords. However, Reddit largely shrugged it off, saying the attacker gained read-only access to some systems that contained the backup data. 
Reddit has more than 330 million average monthly active users, with 14 billion screenviews per month, as of Nov. 12, 2017, it said on its website.

1450,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 01:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Bayer's Monsanto wins arbitration ruling over royalties from Indian seed company,"By Mayank Bhardwaj
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - German drugmaker Bayer (DE:BAYGN) AG's  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) unit has won proceedings against Indian seed maker Nuziveedu Seeds Ltd (NSL) in a royalty dispute, lawyers familiar with the matter said.
The lawyers, who did not wish to be named as the decision was not public, did not disclose the terms of the arbitration ruling.
Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India) (MMB), a joint venture between Missouri-based Monsanto and India's Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Co (Mahyco), ""has received a favorable award from the arbitration panel in the proceedings against NSL and Prabhat"", a Bayer spokesman said in an e-mailed statement when asked about the ruling.
He declined to say how much NSL and one of its affiliates, Prabhat Agri Biotech Ltd, had been told to pay MMB. By Monsanto's calculations, NSL and its two affiliates owed about $22.82 million to MMB.
""The award is confidential and we will not be able to share any further details at this stage,"" said the Bayer spokesman. 
NSL said the arbitration tribunal had directed both parties to maintain the confidentiality of proceedings and they were not allowed to make public statements.
NSL has the right to appeal the arbitration ruling in a court, the lawyers said. 
MMB sells genetically modified (GM) cotton seeds under license to nearly 40 Indian seed companies, which in turn sell the products to retailers. 
NSL and two of its affiliates were among the 40. 
But NSL and its affiliates decided to stop paying royalties, or trait fees, to MMB in 2015, arguing that Indian law did not provide Monsanto with patent protection on its GM cotton seeds, and if there were to be payments they should be set by the Indian government. Monsanto had insisted it has patent protection in India and it therefore could collect royalties through bilateral contracts with the Indian seed companies. A spokesman for Mahyco said it was referring all questions on the matter to Bayer.
The tribunal consisted of three retired judges, according to the lawyers, though their identities have not been disclosed.
Last month India's Supreme Court set aside an order by the Delhi High Court, which in April 2018 said that Monsanto could not claim patents on its GM cotton seeds.
Hindu nationalist groups close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party have opposed both Monsanto and GM technology in India's agriculture, Reuters revealed in a special report in 2017. (https://reut.rs/2p7eIrE)
India's farm ministry has twice slashed royalties that local seed companies pay to Monsanto. The ministry has also cut cotton seed prices.

After a spate of unfavorable government orders and a tussle over royalty payments, Monsanto in 2016 withdrew an application seeking approval for its next generation of GM cotton seeds in India. (https://reut.rs/2jbDq80)

1451,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 01:00PM ET</span>","Your Money: The IRS Form 1040 looks different, in more ways than one","By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - While this year's taxapalooza is off to a slow start because of the earlier U.S. government shutdown, one thing already is clear: your refund might be a whole lot smaller than you were expecting.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released its first set of filing season statistics last week. The average refund was down 8.4 percent from the equivalent period last year, at $1,865 from $2,035.
The lower refund amount is tied up in changes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that went into effect in 2018. To match the new law, the government last year changed the amount of tax withholding it takes out of paychecks.
Yet many people did not notice and adjust their withholding. So when it comes to tax time, filers may be getting back less - even if their overall tax burden was lower than the previous year.
Not everyone should expect smaller refunds. Some may get worse news, and actually end up owing, particularly single taxpayers in states with high local taxes.
Tynisa Gaines, an enrolled agent tax preparer based in Henrico, Virginia, has a single client who is going to owe more this year in taxes, even though he is now in a lower tax bracket. This is because he can no longer deduct as much of his state and local taxes, which results in a difference of about $5,000 more in taxable income for 2018. 
""He's going to be mad,"" Gaines said. ""I haven't told him yet.""
HIDDEN TEXT
One big change that will make refunds look different is the tax form itself. Filers used to skipping straight to line 76 to make sure their refund is correct can now find that information on line 19.
The new cosmetic look of the 1040 form belies all the changes within. The redesign squishes what used to be 79 lines of information into just 22, on two half-sheets of paper. 
But things did not get streamlined and simplified. All of those missing lines now correspond to six new numbered schedules and several worksheets. And that is in addition to the existing alphabetical schedules (A for itemizing deductions, B for interest and dividends, etc.)
""It's not a postcard, you can't mail it. It's maddening,"" said Jerry Gaddis, an enrolled agent tax preparer based in Winter Haven, Florida. 
If you are an Uber driver, for example, you used to have a simple return, with just a Schedule C for business income. This kind of return is now the most complicated, said Gaines, who is seeing 15 more pages per return, on average.
You need several new additional schedules and worksheets to figure out the new 20 percent deduction for qualified business income, she added. 
Phyllis Jo Kubey, an enrolled agent in New York, has basically given up trying to process the changes visually. Her tax software even comes with a ""1040 reconciliation worksheet,"" which takes everything on this year's tax form and makes it look like an old 1040.
""It’s easier for me to find things on the old form than to look at six different schedules,"" Kubey said. 
Kubey is especially concerned for senior citizens, who might be among the last of those who fill out the 1040 by hand.
""Can you imagine if you have been doing taxes every year of your life on paper, and then all the sudden you get this? I'd go nuts,"" Kubey said. 
For taxpayers who file electronically, the new form might not have that much of an impact. A professional tax preparer will take your information the same as always and deal with the changes for you.
DIY tax software will prompt you for the information needed in a similar manner to previous years, with just a few new questions. 
It is when the results are printed out that most people will notice the difference. Kubey decided to sidestep this by giving a copy of the old-style version to her clients with the file copy of their return. 
While Kubey wants them to understand the new tax system, she knows that they will have trouble comparing this year to any past years if they cannot see the information in a way that matches it up.
Gaddis is doing something similar for clients - his software creates a three-year comparison in the old form's style. 

""I don't even show them the new 1040,"" Gaddis said. ""They wouldn't understand it and I couldn't explain it.""

1461,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 11:49AM ET</span>","Wall Street treads water, eyes on U.S.-China trade talks","By Amy Caren Daniel
(Reuters) - Wall Street struggled for direction on Monday, with investors taking a pause as the United States and China began their latest trade negotiations and U.S. lawmakers tried to reach a deal on border funding.
The market started on a strong note over the trade talks after China's upbeat tone, with sentiment lifted by White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway expressing confidence of a possible deal.
The trade-sensitive industrials sector gained 0.55 percent, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors, helped by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Inc's 0.4 percent rise and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) Inc's 0.5 percent gain.
However, the indexes gave up their early gains after the healthcare sector fell 0.23 percent. The sector was dragged down by a more than 1 percent drop in the shares of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and Merck & Co.
The latest U.S.-China talks come in the face of a looming March 1 deadline set for reaching a trade pact. If the two countries fail to reach an agreement by then, additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports will come into force.
""Markets are taking a wait-and-see approach today,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas.
""Everyone would like to see a resolution on both trade and the government shutdown, but right now there aren't many new signs of progress in either.""
In Washington, the top four Democratic and Republican negotiators on border security funding plan to meet in a bid to reach an elusive deal by a Friday deadline to avert another partial government shutdown.
At 10:55 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 26.67 points, or 0.11 percent, at 25,079.66. The S&P 500 was up 0.89 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,708.77 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 13.74 points, or 0.19 percent, at 7,311.93.
The benchmark index is about 15 percent above its December lows, helped in part by a dovish Federal Reserve and largely upbeat earnings reports.
Of the S&P 500 companies that have reported fourth-quarter earnings, 71.2 percent topped estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. But analysts' estimates for first-quarter earnings have turned negative for the first time since 2016.
Among other stocks, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares gave up early gains to trade 0.2 percent lower, after research firm IDC showed iPhone sales falling 20 percent in China during the fourth quarter of 2018.
Electronics Arts Inc gained 5.2 percent, the most among S&P 500 companies, after analysts were upbeat about a strong start to the videogame publisher's newly launched rival to ""Fortnite"".
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.58-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.53-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 26 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 46 new highs and 12 new lows.

1470,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 11:20AM ET</span>",What It’s Like to Work Inside Apple’s ‘Black Site’,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple’s new campus in Cupertino, California, is a symbol of how the company views itself as an employer: simultaneously inspiring its workers with its magnificent scale while coddling them with its four-story café and 100,000-square-foot fitness center. But one group of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) contractors finds another building, six miles away on Hammerwood Avenue in Sunnyvale, to be a more apt symbol.
This building is as bland as the main Apple campus is striking. From the outside, there appears to be a reception area, but it’s unstaffed, which makes sense given that people working in this satellite office—mostly employees of Apple contractors working on Apple Maps—use the back door. Workers say managers instructed them to walk several blocks away before calling for a ride home. Several people who worked here say it’s widely referred to within Apple as a “black site,” as in a covert ops facility.
Inside the building, say former workers, they came to expect the vending machines to be understocked, and to have to wait in line to use the men’s bathrooms. Architectural surprise and delight wasn’t a priority here; after all, the contract workers at Hammerwood almost all leave after their assignments of 12 to 15 months are up.
It’s not uncommon for workers not to make it that long. According to 14 current and former contractors employed by Apex Systems, a firm that staffs the building as well as other Apple mapping offices, they operated under the constant threat of termination. “It was made pretty plain to us that we were at-will employees and they would fire us at any time,” says one former Hammerwood contractor, who, like most of the workers interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because he signed a nondisclosure agreement with Apex. “There was a culture of fear among the contractors which I got infected by and probably spread.”
 
Apex, not Apple, manages the workers it hires. Apple says it requires contracting firms to treat workers with “dignity and respect.” Following an inquiry from Bloomberg News, the company says, it conducted a surprise audit of the Hammerwood facility and found a work environment consistent with other Apple locations. “Like we do with other suppliers, we will work with Apex to review their management systems, including recruiting and termination protocols, to ensure the terms and conditions of employment are transparent and clearly communicated to workers in advance,” an Apple spokesperson says in a statement.
Buddy Omohundro, Apex’s chief services officer and general counsel, says in an email that his company strives to ensure it’s creating the best possible work experience. “Apex provides multiple avenues for employees to raise concerns, both directly and anonymously, and to have those concerns addressed,” he wrote.
Apex is one tiny part of a sprawling global network of staffing firms working with Apple; it is not even the only firm staffing the facility at Hammerwood Avenue. For Apple Maps alone, workers are spread across several locations in Silicon Valley, as well as in Austin, Texas; London; the Czech Republic; and India, according to people who worked on the project. The operation involves thousands of contractors. At Hammerwood, the population has exceeded 250 at times, although the number fluctuates and Apple declined to give a current count.
Places like Hammerwood undermine the mythology of Silicon Valley as a kind of industrial utopia where talented people work themselves to the bone in exchange for outsize salaries and stock options. A common perception in the Bay Area is that its only serious tech-labor issue is the high cost of living driven by the industry’s obscene salaries. But many of those poorer residents work in tech, too. For decades, contractors and other contingent workers have served meals, driven buses, and cleaned toilets at tech campuses. They’ve also built circuit boards and written and tested software, all in exchange for hourly wages and little or no job security.
In different forms, temporary labor as an alternative to full-time employment has grown across the U.S. economy. Companies in many industries now use staffing firms to handle work once done by full-time workers. The technology industry offers one of the starkest examples of how the groups’ fortunes have diverged. While companies aren’t required to disclose the sizes of their contingent workforces, there’s ample evidence that tech companies use large numbers of contractors and temps. Last year, Bloomberg News reported that direct employees at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google accounted for less than half its workforce.

The treatment of these workers is emerging alongside sexual harassment and military contracting as a principal target of the wave of tech worker activism that’s been building over the past two years. When Google employees staged a walkout last November, many contingent workers didn’t learn about it in advance because they don’t have access to internal mailing lists. A month later, Googlers sent an open letter to the company’s management demanding better working conditions for temporary workers, vendors, and contractors.
The Apple Maps operations staffed by Apex provide a dim view of contract work, according to current and former Apex workers. Some took jobs there with the hope of landing full-time work at Apple—a possibility they said Apex played up—only to find the chances were small. As Apple has faced headwinds in recent months, it has further reduced the practice of converting any contract workers to full-time positions, according to a person familiar with Apple’s operations.
Other Apex workers took the job just to put Apple on their resume. Even that benefit was tenuous. Apex managers initially distributed specific wording they could include on their LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profiles referring to their employer as Apple, via Apex Systems. Last summer, Apex said they had to remove the word “Apple,” describing their employer only as “A Major Tech Company Via Apex Systems,” according to two former employees.
The restrictions were just one of many reminders of the contractors’ inferior status, right down to the apple design on their ID badges. For direct employees, the apples were multi-colored; contractors got what one described as “sad grey.” It’s common for companies to distribute different badges to contractors, a practice that discontented workers across the industry have seized on as evidence of a caste system. Amber Lutsko, who worked for Apple through Apex in 2017 and 2018, described an opening-day pep talk that aimed to make her feel both honored and excluded. “‘You work at Apple now! You have made it!’” she recalls being told. “‘You’re not allowed to use the gym.’”
The companies of Silicon Valley have created vast fortunes with far fewer employees than the corporate behemoths that came before them. In part, this is because you can replicate software infinitely in a way you can’t with, say, a Model T. But the tech industry was also an early adopter of offloading core functions to contract workers. Tech was quick to embrace contractors because of rapid advancements requiring constant adjustments in the composition of the workforce, according to Louis Hyman, author of the 2018 book “Temp.” All those changes helped nurture Silicon Valley’s ideology of flexibility and speed, first in hardware, then in software and business operations. Hyman quotes a 1993 issue of Apple’s internal magazine that describes the transition away from direct employees to contractors and outsourcing firms as both a “predictable evolution” and “the future.”
Conflict is inevitable in a two-tiered workforce. As far back as the 1990s,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). contractors challenged their employment status in court and attempted to unionize. In 2014 a group of Microsoft bug-testers won the right to bargain with their employer, a staffing agency called Lionbridge Technologies Inc. Within a few years, Lionsbridge had eliminated all their jobs.
Apple, which has about 130,000 full-time employees, also accepts workers from about three dozen staffing firms, according to OnContracting, a website providing market information to staffing companies. Contracting firms work on iTunes and server infrastructure, handle customer support, and select articles for Apple News. Apex, the largest division of ASGN, a staffing company based in suburban Los Angeles, has provided Apple with a steady stream of mapping technicians, whose jobs consist of checking to make sure that Apple’s software is drawing roads in the right places, or responding to reports of inaccuracies in existing maps.
 
They’re largely in their early- to mid-20s, and have often just graduated from college. Wages are generally about $25 an hour, which some workers consider generous and others see as stingy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 2017 median hourly wage for mapping technicians nationwide was $20.84, while the median per-hour rate for the same jobs in California was $30.61.
Apex employees have access to health insurance, although the premiums are high enough that some people opt not to take it. Because the workforce is young, Apex workers often stay on their parents’ health insurance rather than figure things out on their own.
Apex has also changed aspects of employment suddenly. In November, it cut the maximum amount of paid sick time employees could take annually from 48 hours to 24 hours, saying the policy would go into effect in two days, according to two current employees and an internal email viewed by Bloomberg. The email, which Apex workers received on a Thursday afternoon, inspired a rare moment of collective action. A group of over a dozen workers said they had suddenly fallen ill, and left, according to one current Apex employee who participated in the protest.
“At all times, Apex has provided as much paid sick leave as required by applicable law,” says Omohundro, adding that the company worked to find exceptions in individual cases. 
Many Apex employees first heard about the company through LinkedIn. The company trawls the website for people with proficiency in skills for mapmaking like geographic information systems or geography, then messages them repeatedly. Lutsko had worked as an archaeologist and was in between jobs in 2017 when, as she describes it, she basically gave in. “They’re pretty aggressive, so it was easy to take the job,” she says.
At the beginning of the interview process, Apex doesn’t mention the company where people will work. But the revelation can tip wavering candidates over the edge. “They said it was with Apple—they were super hush-hush originally—and I was like, ‘Oh my God!’” says a former Apex worker who started in 2017. “‘That will be on my resume? Bang!’”
The secrecy just made the job seem sexier. Many Apex workers assumed discretion was required because Hammerwood had some connection to self-driving cars. Their own work turned out to be drudgery. Still, they gossiped about the mysterious group of direct Apple employees who also worked on the site. They never knew for sure what those people were up to, since they say managers at Apex kept them from communicating with Apple employees unless it was necessary to do their immediate jobs. One former Apex worker says the contractors weren’t allowed to use the bathrooms on the direct employees’ side of the building.
Complaints about the bathrooms were common. Lines formed outside the men’s rooms, especially around lunchtime, according to former employees. (Because the workforce was predominantly male, the women’s rooms had ample capacity.) Anonymous complaints about inadequate facilities were scrawled on white boards around the office. Twice in 2017, Hammerwood workers filed complaints against Apple with the state’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Cal/OSHA. Apple told Cal/OSHA it had examined the situation and determined it was in compliance with the law. There was no mention of Apex workers being discouraged from using certain bathrooms, according to records obtained by Bloomberg News through a public records request. The agency did not pursue the issue.
The working environment was uncomfortable in other ways, according to current and former contractors. Apex managers sometimes broke up unauthorized water-cooler socializing. Several workers say their managers would get notifications if their workstations were idle for too long. “Being monitored like that is super dehumanizing and terrifying,” says one former Apex mapping technician. 
If Apex seemed not to trust its workers, the feeling was mutual. They described a hiring process that was misleading in several ways. For one, Apex failed to explain the one-year assignments started with several weeks of training followed by a test, many say. Anyone who didn’t pass was terminated immediately. The company recruited nationwide, so some workers showed up in California, signed leases in one of the most expensive housing markets in the country, and lost their only source of income within a matter of weeks.
There are no reliable numbers on how common such firings were; Omohundro says the “vast majority” of employees complete their assignments. But they loomed large even for those who passed the test. Lutsko says watching colleagues suddenly lose their jobs soured her on her new employer. “I couldn’t handle the arbitrariness of everything,” she says. “The starry-eyed kids straight off the bus from Iowa thinking they’d made it in Silicon Valley straight out of college. The bait-and-switch. The, ‘Oh you didn’t make it through training, please give us your badge now.’”
Lutsko quit before her contract was up. The LinkedIn messages from Apex recruiters persisted. This was common. Two people who Apex had fired said the company periodically pitches them on jobs. “You got rid of me because of my quote-unquote performance, and every three months I get these emails,” says one of them. “It’s insulting, honestly.”
Like any group of people in shared circumstance, workers at Hammerwood bonded. Several former contractors say it was fun to be around with people their own age, and say the odd atmosphere only made them closer. Because many of them were young, new to the area, and not making enough money to live on their own, they ended up pooling resources to rent apartments or houses nearby.
Many people simply moved to similar contracting jobs with other tech firms once their positions at Apple end, so their homes ended up having a mixture of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google, and Uber contractors. Several people described the geographic information systems contracting workforce almost as if it were a resource the big tech companies shared. People who left Apple would join the GIS staff at another company and find it was staffed primarily by Apex veterans.
Those who left Apple often say their lives improved. Facebook’s management put signs up around campus reading “Contractors Are People Too,” and contingent workers participated in on-campus arts and crafts activities. Google paid more than competitors and let everyone use the gym, says Nick Wilson, who worked at Apple through Apex, then worked at Facebook, and is now a contractor doing mapping work at Google.
Moving between companies didn’t feel like advancement, says Wilson. “None of the skills I learned at Apple could be carried over,” he says, adding that his managers were indifferent to any attempts by employees to distinguish themselves. “There were many people who took initiative and made things, increased the efficiency. They weren’t rewarded in any way,” he says. “There were people who had abandoned any hope. They’d come in late, leave early, and just do nothing all day. They were treated the same as everyone else.” (Both Lutsko and Wilson declined to discuss the exact nature of their jobs or the building at which they worked, citing their nondisclosure agreements.)
 
The mood at Hammerwood dimmed late last year, after the changes in benefits and after Apex suddenly fired about two dozen people, according to two current Apex employees. One described the workplace as depressing and quiet, with everyone on edge. “I’m afraid of being too social because they might see that as not working hard enough,” he says. “Apex handles all terminations in a sensitive and confidential manner,” says Omohundro. “The company does not share the details of employee terminations, regardless of whether they are for cause or not for cause.”
Activists associated with the burgeoning labor movement in the tech industry say the contracting workforce is ripe for organization, but acknowledge it’s been challenging to organize white-collar workers. “It’s a new concept,” says Yana Calou, an organizer at Coworker.org. Information workers have been more reticent than security guards and cafeteria workers to confront tech companies because they’re angling for full-time work, says Calou. “I think there’s the tiny idea of, ‘I’ll be the exception that squeezes through.’ ”
That feeling eventually wears off. One former Apex worker, a 32-year-old who lives in the maid’s quarters of a house with eight roommates, says years of uncertainty have left him worn out. “How are you supposed to plan for your future if your job has an expiration date?” he says. He’s a California native who moved to San Francisco over a decade ago, got a master’s degree, and internalized Silicon Valley’s brand of optimism. But that evaporated at Apple’s so-called black site. “It sounds good when you say you work at Apple, but when you’re not being paid the same amount, and you’re not treated the same way, it gets old quickly,” he says. “I don’t see why they don’t just hire someone and give them a stake in the company.”

1480,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 10:40AM ET</span>","World stocks edge higher ahead of trade talks, Brexit","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets globally edged higher on Monday as investors eyed the resumption of trade talks between the United States and China and watched for signs of progress on Brexit.
European markets rebounded from last week's declines after Chinese shares rose 1 percent on the first day of trading after the week-long Lunar New Year holiday. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.55 points, or 0.03 percent, to 25,113.88, the S&P 500 gained 3.92 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,711.8 and the Nasdaq Composite added 17.81 points, or 0.24 percent, to 7,316.00.
Worries about a slowdown in global growth, the U.S.-China trade dispute and the possibility of another U.S. government shutdown have been foremost in investors' minds. At the same time, Britain is due to leave the European Union in six weeks though it still has no exit plan in place. Data on Monday showed the British economy grew last year at its slowest since 2012.
""The risk remains that investors are unwilling to commit to a breakout until we see what emerges from U.S.-China trade negotiations and Brexit,"" said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank. 
China struck an upbeat note as the trade talks resumed, but it also expressed anger at a U.S. Navy mission through the disputed South China Sea, casting a shadow over the prospect for improved Beijing-Washington ties.
The two sides are trying to come up with a deal before March 1, when U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent.
Safe-haven bonds and the dollar have gained amid the prolonged uncertainty. The dollar reached its highest in six weeks against a basket of other currencies, rising for an eighth consecutive day as investors piled into the greenback. 
Worries about Europe's economic slowdown and falling inflation expectations dominated morning trade in debt markets.
The yield on Germany's 10-year Bund, considered the risk-free benchmark for the region, held close to 0.10 percent after touching 0.077 percent on Friday, its lowest since October 2016. The European Commission downgraded its euro zone growth forecasts last week. 
U.S. benchmark 10-year notes last fell 8/32 in price to yield 2.659 percent, compared with 2.63 percent late on Friday.
A collapse in talks between U.S. Democratic and Republican lawmakers has meanwhile raised fears of another government shutdown.
""Trade talks and shutdown (worries) are really weighing on markets,"" said Sebastian Fellechner, rates strategist at DZ Bank. ""We don't see any major movements because of the general and global uncertainty.""
The rising threat to growth means equity markets will focus on earnings from major U.S. companies for clues about the health of consumer shares. These include Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD), Macy's Inc and Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS).
Analysts now expect first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies to decline 0.1 percent from a year earlier. That would be the first such quarterly profit decline since 2016, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Oil prices slipped on concern about slowing global demand and a pick-up in U.S. drilling activity.
U.S. crude was 0.8 percent lower at $52.31 per barrel. Brent was 0.2 percent lower at $61.97.

1481,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 10:33AM ET</span>",Apple iPhone sales in China fell by a fifth in fourth quarter: IDC,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone sales in China fell 20 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2018, while sales for smartphones made by home-grown rival Huawei soared by 23 percent, data from industry research firm IDC showed on Monday.
The report is the first to put a firm number on the scale of a recent decline in Apple's fortunes in the world's second largest economy, after Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook pointed to China as a big factor in a rare cut in the company's quarterly sales forecast last month.
Apple no longer breaks out detailed numbers on iPhone shipments in its quarterly results, meaning that surveys and channel checks by the likes of IDC are often the clearest indicator of shifts in sales. 
The figures in the report showed a 19.9 percent fall in Apple's smartphone shipments in the final quarter of 2018, while Huawei's grew 23.3 percent. That reduced Apple's market share to 11.5 percent from 12.9 percent a year earlier, the report said. 
""Besides regular performance upgrades in 2018 and small changes to the exterior, there has not been any major innovation that supports users to continue to change their phones at the greatly increased price,"" the report said.
""The severe macro environment in China and the assault of domestic brands' innovative products have also been reasons for Apple's continued decline.""
A separate report from another common industry source, Hong Kong-based Counterpoint, earlier this month confirmed a similar sharp fall in sales in India - another big emerging market where Apple is struggling. 

Counterpoint said iPhone sales in the fourth quarter, which includes India's electronics sales-heavy Diwali festival, fell 25 percent on the year, reducing total sales in 2018 to 1.7 million units from 3.2 million a year earlier.

Nuro was co-founded in 2016 by two former engineers of Google's self-driving car project, Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu. 
The funding by SoftBank came through its $100-billion Vision Fund, which usually picks up big stakes in fast-growing technology companies.
Last year, Nuro launched a self-driving delivery vehicle to run errands from picking up groceries to delivering dinner, and partnered with U.S. supermarket chain Kroger (NYSE:KR) co to extend its services.
The firm, which largely operates in the San Francisco Bay Area, said it will use the funds to expand its delivery service to new areas, add new partners, expand its fleet and grow its team.
Nuro has raised more than $1 billion from investors, including Greylock Partners and Gaorong Capital, which had participated in its Series A funding round.

1483,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 09:50AM ET</span>",Varley Would ‘Walk the Plank’ If Barclays Funding Had Failed,"(Bloomberg) -- A U.K. fraud trial of former  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc executives revealed how little some of them thought of the board, and how close they believed then-Chief Executive Officer John Varley was to losing his job as the lender tried to avoid a bailout at the peak of the financial crisis.
Roger Jenkins, who was negotiating a 2 billion pound ($2.6 billion) investment from Qatar, and Richard Boath, another executive working on the deal, were dismissive about the bank’s plans to avoid nationalization in June 2008 because the lender only approached four major sovereign investors for funding.
The pair vented their frustration on a phone call, which was played Monday to a jury in London where the two, Varley and a fourth man are on trial for allegedly deceiving investors in the course of the fundraising.
When Boath said the plan had been conceived by the board, Jenkins responded: ""That’s because they don’t have any bankers on the board.""
Even when Boath pointed out that Bob Diamond, then head of Barclays’s investment bank, was a board member, Jenkins repeated the statement. He then quipped that he’d be taking over from Varley if the fund-raising collapsed.
""Varley then has walked the plank and I’m in charge,"" said Jenkins, who was the bank’s Middle East head.
In the U.K.’s first jury trial of senior bankers related to the financial crisis, the Serious Fraud Office accuses the four defendants of agreeing to make secret payments to Qatar in order to secure two investments in 2008. They concealed the payments in fraudulent advisory agreements so that other investors wouldn’t demand similar terms, according to the prosecution. All four deny the charges. Diamond isn’t accused of any wrongdoing.
In June 2008, with time running out, Jenkins had secured the biggest chunk of the 4 billion pounds Barclays believed it needed to avoid nationalization. Late in the process, it emerged that the China Development Bank and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund were probably withdrawing from the placement. When Boath broke the news to Jenkins, his frustration was clear.
""You’re f---ing kidding me,"" Jenkins responded. ""Oh f--k’s sake.""
The call ends with Jenkins making another joke: ""Actually, Bob’s just called me. I think he wants me to come and measure his office up. See you later.""

The S&P 500 rose 8 points, or 0.32%, as of 9:34 AM ET (14:34 GMT), while the Dow gained 67 points, or 0.27%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite increased 34 points, or 0.47%.
Positive outlooks from Chinese officials were offset by comments last week from U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he does not plan to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before the deadline.
High-level talks are expected to take place Thursday and Friday.
Washington and Beijing officials are trying to make a deal ahead of the March 1 deadline when U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are due to increase from 10% to 25%.
""These trade talks are being viewed as a positive. There is still a lot of uncertainty but there's this pattern of markets embracing good news a little bit more than bad news,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was among the top gainers, rising 2.6% after CNBC reported that analysts at Canaccord Genuity upgraded the stock to buy and hiked its price target to $450 from $330.

Hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management LLC last month demanded the complete removal of the embattled Californian power company's board, saying the bankruptcy filing was unnecessary and harmed the interests of the company's shareholders.
""We fully understand that PG&E must re-earn trust and credibility with its customers, regulators, the communities it serves and all of its stakeholders,"" PG&E said in a statement on Monday.
""We recognize the importance of adding fresh perspectives to the Board to help address the serious challenges the business faces.""
A heated court hearing in San Francisco at the end of last month saw U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup hold off on changing the terms of the company's probation from its conviction for a 2010 natural gas pipeline blast.
Alsup also scolded the company for not being focused enough on safety.
The company has since outlined plans to increase the controversial practice of shutting off the power to communities at risk of wildfire when dangerous conditions such as high winds and dry heat are present.
The board said it was working to identify candidates who would improve its expertise in safety, operations and other critical areas.

BlueMountain did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The regulator announced the fine on Prasert, who was also CEO of Bangkok Dusit Medical Services, his daughter Poramaporn Prasarttong-osoth and another executive, Narumon Chainaknan, last month.
At the time the companies said all three accused would ""prove their innocence in the matter"". 
By agreeing to pay the fine, they now avoid the issue going to court.
The regulator said last month that it had found the three people had traded shares in Bangkok Airways among themselves between November 2015 and January 2016, causing the share price and trading volume to be inconsistent with market conditions.
Prasert resigned as CEO of Bangkok Airways and Bangkok Dusit Medical Services, Thailand's largest private hospital network, last month after the regulator barred him from holding executive positions in listed Thai firms citing share manipulation.
Poramaporn, who was chief operating officer of Bangkok Dusit, and Narumon, who was executive secretary to the CEO of Bangkok Airways, also resigned from their positions last month.
The regulator said on Monday that Poramaporn and Narumon were barred from holding directorships and executive positions at listed companies for two years, while Poramaporn was barred for one year.
Bangkok Airways could not be immediately reached for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss watchmaker Rolex raised its aquatic profile on Monday in a long-term partnership with SailGP, a new $1 million winner-takes-all series backed by Oracle (N:ORCL) boss Larry Ellison.
""Rolex timepieces and clocks will be visible throughout all SailGP events, and featured on each of the six supercharged F50 catamarans – the world's fastest race boat,"" SailGP said.
SailGP, which was launched last year, will make its debut in Sydney on Friday, pitting six crews against each other in 50 foot catamarans which are expected to hit speeds of more than 50 knots as they lift up on foils and ""fly"" above the water.
The teams from Australia, China, France, Britain, Japan and the United States have been assembled by former America's Cup winner Russell Coutts for SailGP, an annual competition kick-started by Coutts and sailing fanatic Ellison.
""We have always appreciated endeavors and sporting disciplines that combine the highest levels of technology with the most talented individuals. SailGP meets such a vision, while the art of foiling perfectly illustrates the sport's constant desire to innovate and improve efficiency,"" Arnaud Boetsch, Rolex communication and image director, said in a statement.
ONBOARD FOOTAGE
SailGP also said that its races, scheduled for Sydney, San Francisco, New York, Cowes in Britain and a September finale in Marseille, France, would be broadcast across linear and digital channels that ensure coverage in 90 countries.
Fox Sports in Australia, Canal+ (PA:VIV) in France, BT Sport (L:BT) in Britain, DAZN in Japan and SKY Sport in New Zealand have each secured exclusive deals for live coverage.
SailGP said it expects to announce a broadcast partner this week in the United States, where races will be streamed live on Facebook (O:FB), alongside full access on SailGP's own app, which will feature footage from onboard each catamaran.

""We will deliver a broadcast and digital product that caters to modern consumption habits and brings our sport to life in a way that hasn't been done before,"" SailGP's CEO Coutts said.

The tobacco company said it would issue the bonds in four tranches in denominations of 100,000 euros as it looks to prepay a term loan arranged by JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) to fund the deal. That loan matures on Dec. 19, 2019. 
The four-year tranche is expected to price at 110 to 115 basis points above the midswaps rate, according to pricing guidance published by Refinitiv's IFR.
Altria's deal for a 35 percent stake in the controversial e-cigarette maker Juul, along with a stake buy in Canadian cannabis company Cronos Group Inc in December last year, roughly doubled the company's total debt. 

The sharp increase in leverage was among the reasons behind rating agencies Standard & Poor's and Fitch's two-notch downgrades of Altria's credit rating in December.

1499,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 08:06AM ET</span>",Investors' cash buildup comes at a cost,"By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors sitting on a mountain of cash built up since late last year may be paying a price for playing it too safe in the first weeks of 2019.
Individuals and institutions have poured tens of billions of dollars into money market funds amid the aftershock of last year's punishing losses from stocks and next-to-nothing from bonds. Ongoing turmoil from trade tensions between China and the United States, political infighting in Washington and interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve have also inspired the rush into cash.
Despite those concerns, Wall Street has staged a comeback to kick off the new year, with the S&P 500 (SPX) recording its best month since 2015 in January, while junk bonds produced their strongest monthly return in more than seven years.
At same time, the yields on money funds stuffed with all that safe-haven cash have trickled lower.
Analysts and fund managers said the stampede into cash is understandable, but safety comes with a steep opportunity cost. 
""Investors can penalize themselves. While money market funds offer safety, they come at a cost as they accept a lower yield,"" said Jerome Schneider, head of short-term portfolio management at PIMCO in Newport Beach, California.
Money market funds' appeal skyrocketed as high-flying FAANG shares ( Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com (O:AMZN), Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Google's parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL)) took a spill with the rest of the stock market, and junk bonds sank deep into the red in the last weeks of 2018.
U.S. Treasuries eked out slim gains courtesy of the year-end safe-haven rally. Before then, the Fed's four rate increases in 2018 had been a drag on the bond market.
That left cash. 
Interest rates on cash investments, currently at around 2 percent, are hardly dazzling. But in the last year they have risen above the rate of inflation for the first time since the financial crisis, and are up from near zero over three years ago before the Fed began raising rates. 
Money fund assets crested at nearly $3.03 trillion in the beginning of January, their highest level since March 2010, and they remain close to that level, according to data firm iMoneyNet.
""I like cash now. You can earn a very reasonable return on cash,"" said James Sarni, senior portfolio manager at Payden & Rygel in Los Angeles.
For a graphic on U.S. money funds vs bonds, stocks, click: https://tmsnrt.rs/2tatyA8
Still, the price of playing it safe was never more evident than in January, when it became clear that the Fed was setting the stage for a hiatus from its three-year-old tightening cycle. Last week it pledged to be ""patient"" before lifting rates further.
Anticipating that dovish turn, the S&P 500 posted a 7.9 percent increase in January, nearly 6 percentage points above the average yielding money fund, while junk bonds racked up a 4.6 percent return.
""I worry those investors who have long-term horizons may be hurting themselves,"" said Kristina Hooper, global market strategist at Invesco in New York.
Risk-averse investors could shift some cash into short-term and floating-rate bond funds to pick up extra yields without extensively lifting their risk profile, analysts said. Yields on short-term bond funds are averaging about 2.7 percent, while those on floating-rate funds are averaging 2.4 percent. 
Such funds can lose money if interest rates rise further. But investors sticking to the sidelines are already underperforming the big rally in riskier assets so far in 2019. 
""They tend to play it safe for too long,"" PIMCO's Schneider said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN) said on Monday that they will slash the U.S. list price of their potent but expensive cholesterol fighter Praluent by 60 percent, as the drugmakers follow a similar move by rival  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) in hopes of increasing use of the drug.
The new list price for Praluent will be $5,850 a year, matching the price Amgen set when it lowered the list of its competing drug, Repatha, in October.
Sanofi and Regeneron said they expect the lower-priced Praluent to be available for pharmacies to order in early March. They said the new price should improve patient access and result in lower out-of-pocket costs for U.S. consumers.
Praluent and Repatha belong a class of injectable biotech drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that dramatically lower bad LDL cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart attacks and death.
Sales of both have been severely constrained by onerous roadblocks to patient access put up by insurers looking to limit spending on the expensive drugs.
They were approved in 2015 with initial list prices of more than $14,000 a year.
In March of last year, Regeneron and Sanofi said that they would be willing to charge less for their drug if insurers agreed to reduce barriers for high-risk heart patients.
A few months later they struck a deal with Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX), now part of  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI), to make the drug available to that company's customers at a price in the range of $4,500 to $6,600 a year.
The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other developed countries, where governments directly or indirectly control costs. That makes it by far the world's most lucrative market for manufacturers.
Congress has been targeting the pharmaceutical industry over the rising cost of prescription drugs for U.S. consumers, particularly since Democrats took over the House of Representatives in January.
Executives from at least six drugmakers plan to testify at a Senate hearing on rising prescription drug prices later this month.

Drug pricing is also a top priority of the administration of President Donald Trump, who had made it a central issue of the 2016 presidential campaign.

The investigation of Nelson Krahenbuhl Salgado, the chief financial officer and investor relations director, will seek to establish whether Embraer disclosed incomplete information about the degree of influence over the joint venture in which it will own a 20 percent stake, according to the paper.
A CVM spokeswoman confirmed the existence of the probe and said the next step involves Salgado presenting his defense. 
Embraer told Reuters in an emailed statement it has been regularly informing the market of all developments related to the joint venture and that it is open to answering any questions from market authorities. 
In a filing in July laying out the basic terms of the agreement to form the joint venture, Embraer disclosed it had signed a preliminary, nonbinding memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Boeing, the newspaper reported. 
""From our perspective, given the way it was communicated, the disclosure sought to diminish the importance of the fact that Embraer will have very limited means to influence operation of the NewCo,"" Raquel de Campos, a federal prosecutor who works for regulator CVM, was cited as saying in Valor.
The regulator did not find information in the filing that contradicts the MOU,Valor reported. But the filing allegedly only provides generic information regarding governance and veto rights to be retained by Embraer in the new company, Valor reported.
Campos was also quoted as saying CVM is not judging the merits of the transaction, but ensuring it is fairly communicated to investors in the market.

CVM made public remarks about the administrative probe, which started in November, in a class action filed by a group of minority shareholders over the terms of the agreement to form the joint venture, Valor said.

Outflows from Latin American markets were dominated by real money investors - a category that includes mutual, pension and sovereign wealth funds - pulling out of Chilean, Colombian and Peruvian assets. Leveraged money, which tends to be more speculative in nature, fled Brazilian assets, it added.

1505,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 06:25AM ET</span>","Airopack's debt revamp collapses, cites accounting issues","By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - Airopack's (S:AIRN) recapitalization plan collapsed as lenders including Apollo Global Management (N:APO) demanded repayment following the discovery of ""inadequate sales and accounting practices"", the Swiss aerosol packaging maker said on Monday.
Shares in the company, which makes plastic aerosol dispensers for Procter & Gamble's (N:PG) Gillette shaving cream, fell as much as 60 percent and have lost almost all their value since hitting 13.5 Swiss francs ($13.46) three years ago.
Airopack, whose net loss topped 40 million euros ($45.3 million) in 2017, has been seeking to slash debt via a recapitalization plan announced on Nov. 30. 
Its largest lender, U.S.-based private equity firm Apollo (N:APO), was to have received a controlling share in the deal.
But developments since then, including the discovery of what Airopack described as ""excessively overstated"" sales forecasts by former managers, now make the recapitalization plan ""completely unachievable"". 
Airopack's lenders, including Apollo and a major bank, on Saturday demanded repayment of loans in excess of $100 million.
Airopack said it would seek a short period of debt relief with Swiss courts in order to gain breathing room, negotiate with lenders and seek to avoid bankruptcy proceedings.
An Airopack spokeswoman said a court in Zug, near the company's headquarters in Baar, would consider the request. There was no projected deadline for a decision. 
The company said its major lenders did agree to extend a 15 million euro loan, with a possibility of 10 million more, to keep operating units afloat in the short- and mid-term. 
An Apollo spokesman in London did not immediately comment.
Problems intensified as Airopack merged its manufacturing at a new plant in 2017, taking on more and more debt from Apollo to help keep things running. Production of aerosols trailed expectations, however, as it tripled employees to 180 last year. 
Financing costs escalated and losses ballooned, requiring the recapitalization deal that collapsed amid rising concerns over accounting practices.
Airopack said that in addition to inflated sales forecasts, a review started by PriceWaterhouseCoopers in December found ""certain inadequate sales and accounting practices that will lead to corrections in the accounting and caused a severe lack of cost-control in the months prior to the announced recapitalization plan"".
The board ""is preparing the adequate procedural steps against former management and will coordinate such steps with the court-appointed administrator"", the company said. 
It did not provide contact details for Airopack co-founder Quint Kelders, who resigned as CEO last year as the recapitalization plan was announced. He could not immediately be reached for comment via email and LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD). 
Kelders's family owns 30 percent of Airopack, while Apollo controls about 23 percent of shares.

1516,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 05:20AM ET</span>",What It’s Like To Work Inside Apple’s ‘Black Site’,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple’s new campus in Cupertino, California, is a symbol of how the company views itself as an employer: simultaneously inspiring its workers with its magnificent scale while coddling them with its four-story café and 100,000-square-foot fitness center. But one group of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) contractors finds another building, six miles away on Hammerwood Avenue in Sunnyvale, to be a more apt symbol.
This building is as bland as the main Apple campus is striking. From the outside, there appears to be a reception area, but it’s unstaffed, which makes sense given that people working in this satellite office—mostly employees of Apple contractors working on Apple Maps—use the back door. Workers say managers instructed them to walk several blocks away before calling for a ride home. Several people who worked here say it’s widely referred to within Apple as a “black site,” as in a covert ops facility.
Inside the building, say former workers, they came to expect the vending machines to be understocked, and to have to wait in line to use the men’s bathrooms. Architectural surprise and delight wasn’t a priority here; after all, the contract workers at Hammerwood almost all leave after their assignments of 12 to 15 months are up.
It’s not uncommon for workers not to make it that long. According to 14 current and former contractors employed by Apex Systems, a firm that staffs the building as well as other Apple mapping offices, they operated under the constant threat of termination. “It was made pretty plain to us that we were at-will employees and they would fire us at any time,” says one former Hammerwood contractor, who, like most of the workers interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because he signed a nondisclosure agreement with Apex. “There was a culture of fear among the contractors which I got infected by and probably spread.”
 Apex, not Apple, manages the workers it hires. Apple says it requires contracting firms to treat workers with “dignity and respect.” Following an inquiry from Bloomberg News, the company says, it conducted a surprise audit of the Hammerwood facility and found a work environment consistent with other Apple locations. “Like we do with other suppliers, we will work with Apex to review their management systems, including recruiting and termination protocols, to ensure the terms and conditions of employment are transparent and clearly communicated to workers in advance,” an Apple spokesperson says in a statement.
Buddy Omohundro, Apex’s chief services officer and general counsel, says in an email that his company strives to ensure it’s creating the best possible work experience. “Apex provides multiple avenues for employees to raise concerns, both directly and anonymously, and to have those concerns addressed,” he wrote.
Apex is one tiny part of a sprawling global network of staffing firms working with Apple; it is not even the only firm staffing the facility at Hammerwood Avenue. For Apple Maps alone, workers are spread across several locations in Silicon Valley, as well as in Austin, Texas; London; the Czech Republic; and India, according to people who worked on the project. The operation involves thousands of contractors. At Hammerwood, the population has exceeded 250 at times, although the number fluctuates and Apple declined to give a current count.
Places like Hammerwood undermine the mythology of Silicon Valley as a kind of industrial utopia where talented people work themselves to the bone in exchange for outsize salaries and stock options. A common perception in the Bay Area is that its only serious tech-labor issue is the high cost of living driven by the industry’s obscene salaries. But many of those poorer residents work in tech, too. For decades, contractors and other contingent workers have served meals, driven buses, and cleaned toilets at tech campuses. They’ve also built circuit boards and written and tested software, all in exchange for hourly wages and little or no job security.
In different forms, temporary labor as an alternative to full-time employment has grown across the U.S. economy. Companies in many industries now use staffing firms to handle work once done by full-time workers. The technology industry offers one of the starkest examples of how the groups’ fortunes have diverged. While companies aren’t required to disclose the sizes of their contingent workforces, there’s ample evidence that tech companies use large numbers of contractors and temps. Last year, Bloomberg News reported that direct employees at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google accounted for less than half its workforce.

The treatment of these workers is emerging alongside sexual harassment and military contracting as a principal target of the wave of tech worker activism that’s been building over the past two years. When Google employees staged a walkout last November, many contingent workers didn’t learn about it in advance because they don’t have access to internal mailing lists. A month later, Googlers sent an open letter to the company’s management demanding better working conditions for temporary workers, vendors, and contractors.
The Apple Maps operations staffed by Apex provide a dim view of contract work, according to current and former Apex workers. Some took jobs there with the hope of landing full-time work at Apple—a possibility they said Apex played up—only to find the chances were small. As Apple has faced headwinds in recent months, it has further reduced the practice of converting any contract workers to full-time positions, according to a person familiar with Apple’s operations.
Other Apex workers took the job just to put Apple on their resume. Even that benefit was tenuous. Apex managers initially distributed specific wording they could include on their LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profiles referring to their employer as Apple, via Apex Systems. Last summer, Apex said they had to remove the word “Apple,” describing their employer only as “A Major Tech Company Via Apex Systems,” according to two former employees.
The restrictions were just one of many reminders of the contractors’ inferior status, right down to the apple design on their ID badges. For direct employees, the apples were multi-colored; contractors got what one described as “sad grey.” It’s common for companies to distribute different badges to contractors, a practice that discontented workers across the industry have seized on as evidence of a caste system. Amber Lutsko, who worked for Apple through Apex in 2017 and 2018, described an opening-day pep talk that aimed to make her feel both honored and excluded. “‘You work at Apple now! You have made it!’” she recalls being told. “‘You’re not allowed to use the gym.’”
The companies of Silicon Valley have created vast fortunes with far fewer employees than the corporate behemoths that came before them. In part, this is because you can replicate software infinitely in a way you can’t with, say, a Model T. But the tech industry was also an early adopter of offloading core functions to contract workers. Tech was quick to embrace contractors because of rapid advancements requiring constant adjustments in the composition of the workforce, according to Louis Hyman, author of the 2018 book “Temp.” All those changes helped nurture Silicon Valley’s ideology of flexibility and speed, first in hardware, then in software and business operations. Hyman quotes a 1993 issue of Apple’s internal magazine that describes the transition away from direct employees to contractors and outsourcing firms as both a “predictable evolution” and “the future.”
Conflict is inevitable in a two-tiered workforce. As far back as the 1990s,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). contractors challenged their employment status in court and attempted to unionize. In 2014 a group of Microsoft bug-testers won the right to bargain with their employer, a staffing agency called Lionbridge Technologies Inc. Within a few years, Lionsbridge had eliminated all their jobs.
Apple, which has about 130,000 full-time employees, also accepts workers from about three dozen staffing firms, according to OnContracting, a website providing market information to staffing companies. Contracting firms work on iTunes and server infrastructure, handle customer support, and select articles for Apple News. Apex, the largest division of ASGN, a staffing company based in suburban Los Angeles, has provided Apple with a steady stream of mapping technicians, whose jobs consist of checking to make sure that Apple’s software is drawing roads in the right places, or responding to reports of inaccuracies in existing maps.
They’re largely in their early- to mid-20s, and have often just graduated from college. Wages are generally about $25 an hour, which some workers consider generous and others see as stingy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 2017 median hourly wage for mapping technicians nationwide was $20.84, while the median per-hour rate for the same jobs in California was $30.61.
Apex employees have access to health insurance, although the premiums are high enough that some people opt not to take it. Because the workforce is young, Apex workers often stay on their parents’ health insurance rather than figure things out on their own.
Apex has also changed aspects of employment suddenly. In November, it cut the maximum amount of paid sick time employees could take annually from 48 hours to 24 hours, saying the policy would go into effect in two days, according to two current employees and an internal email viewed by Bloomberg. The email, which Apex workers received on a Thursday afternoon, inspired a rare moment of collective action. A group of over a dozen workers said they had suddenly fallen ill, and left, according to one current Apex employee who participated in the protest.
“At all times, Apex has provided as much paid sick leave as required by applicable law,” says Omohundro, adding that the company worked to find exceptions in individual cases. 
Many Apex employees first heard about the company through LinkedIn. The company trawls the website for people with proficiency in skills for mapmaking like geographic information systems or geography, then messages them repeatedly. Lutsko had worked as an archaeologist and was in between jobs in 2017 when, as she describes it, she basically gave in. “They’re pretty aggressive, so it was easy to take the job,” she says.
At the beginning of the interview process, Apex doesn’t mention the company where people will work. But the revelation can tip wavering candidates over the edge. “They said it was with Apple—they were super hush-hush originally—and I was like, ‘Oh my God!’” says a former Apex worker who started in 2017. “‘That will be on my resume? Bang!’”
The secrecy just made the job seem sexier. Many Apex workers assumed discretion was required because Hammerwood had some connection to self-driving cars. Their own work turned out to be drudgery. Still, they gossiped about the mysterious group of direct Apple employees who also worked on the site. They never knew for sure what those people were up to, since they say managers at Apex kept them from communicating with Apple employees unless it was necessary to do their immediate jobs. One former Apex worker says the contractors weren’t allowed to use the bathrooms on the direct employees’ side of the building.
Complaints about the bathrooms were common. Lines formed outside the men’s rooms, especially around lunchtime, according to former employees. (Because the workforce was predominantly male, the women’s rooms had ample capacity.) Anonymous complaints about inadequate facilities were scrawled on white boards around the office. Twice in 2017, Hammerwood workers filed complaints against Apple with the state’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Cal/OSHA. Apple told Cal/OSHA it had examined the situation and determined it was in compliance with the law. There was no mention of Apex workers being discouraged from using certain bathrooms, according to records obtained by Bloomberg News through a public records request. The agency did not pursue the issue.
The working environment was uncomfortable in other ways, according to current and former contractors. Apex managers sometimes broke up unauthorized water-cooler socializing. Several workers say their managers would get notifications if their workstations were idle for too long. “Being monitored like that is super dehumanizing and terrifying,” says one former Apex mapping technician. 
If Apex seemed not to trust its workers, the feeling was mutual. They described a hiring process that was misleading in several ways. For one, Apex failed to explain the one-year assignments started with several weeks of training followed by a test, many say. Anyone who didn’t pass was terminated immediately. The company recruited nationwide, so some workers showed up in California, signed leases in one of the most expensive housing markets in the country, and lost their only source of income within a matter of weeks.
There are no reliable numbers on how common such firings were; Omohundro says the “vast majority” of employees complete their assignments. But they loomed large even for those who passed the test. Lutsko says watching colleagues suddenly lose their jobs soured her on her new employer. “I couldn’t handle the arbitrariness of everything,” she says. “The starry-eyed kids straight off the bus from Iowa thinking they’d made it in Silicon Valley straight out of college. The bait-and-switch. The, ‘Oh you didn’t make it through training, please give us your badge now.’”
Lutsko quit before her contract was up. The LinkedIn messages from Apex recruiters persisted. This was common. Two people who Apex had fired said the company periodically pitches them on jobs. “You got rid of me because of my quote-unquote performance, and every three months I get these emails,” says one of them. “It’s insulting, honestly.”
Like any group of people in shared circumstance, workers at Hammerwood bonded. Several former contractors say it was fun to be around with people their own age, and say the odd atmosphere only made them closer. Because many of them were young, new to the area, and not making enough money to live on their own, they ended up pooling resources to rent apartments or houses nearby.
Many people simply moved to similar contracting jobs with other tech firms once their positions at Apple end, so their homes ended up having a mixture of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google, and Uber contractors. Several people described the geographic information systems contracting workforce almost as if it were a resource the big tech companies shared. People who left Apple would join the GIS staff at another company and find it was staffed primarily by Apex veterans.
Those who left Apple often say their lives improved. Facebook’s management put signs up around campus reading “Contractors Are People Too,” and contingent workers participated in on-campus arts and crafts activities. Google paid more than competitors and let everyone use the gym, says Nick Wilson, who worked at Apple through Apex, then worked at Facebook, and is now a contractor doing mapping work at Google.
Moving between companies didn’t feel like advancement, says Wilson. “None of the skills I learned at Apple could be carried over,” he says, adding that his managers were indifferent to any attempts by employees to distinguish themselves. “There were many people who took initiative and made things, increased the efficiency. They weren’t rewarded in any way,” he says. “There were people who had abandoned any hope. They’d come in late, leave early, and just do nothing all day. They were treated the same as everyone else.” (Both Lutsko and Wilson declined to discuss the exact nature of their jobs or the building at which they worked, citing their nondisclosure agreements.)
 
The mood at Hammerwood dimmed late last year, after the changes in benefits and after Apex suddenly fired about two dozen people, according to two current Apex employees. One described the workplace as depressing and quiet, with everyone on edge. “I’m afraid of being too social because they might see that as not working hard enough,” he says. “Apex handles all terminations in a sensitive and confidential manner,” says Omohundro. “The company does not share the details of employee terminations, regardless of whether they are for cause or not for cause.”
Activists associated with the burgeoning labor movement in the tech industry say the contracting workforce is ripe for organization, but acknowledge it’s been challenging to organize white-collar workers. “It’s a new concept,” says Yana Calou, an organizer at Coworker.org. Information workers have been more reticent than security guards and cafeteria workers to confront tech companies because they’re angling for full-time work, says Calou. “I think there’s the tiny idea of, ‘I’ll be the exception that squeezes through.’ ”
That feeling eventually wears off. One former Apex worker, a 32-year-old who lives in the maid’s quarters of a house with eight roommates, says years of uncertainty have left him worn out. “How are you supposed to plan for your future if your job has an expiration date?” he says. He’s a California native who moved to San Francisco over a decade ago, got a master’s degree, and internalized Silicon Valley’s brand of optimism. But that evaporated at Apple’s so-called black site. “It sounds good when you say you work at Apple, but when you’re not being paid the same amount, and you’re not treated the same way, it gets old quickly,” he says. “I don’t see why they don’t just hire someone and give them a stake in the company.”

1517,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 04:55AM ET</span>",MarketPulse Europe: Banks Lead Rebound on Hopes for New ECB Support,"Investing.com -- Banks are leading the rebound in European stocks Monday, on rising hopes that the European Central Bank will take action to support the flagging euro-zone economy.
Expectations are rising that the ECB will revive one of its crisis-era tools – so-called Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations, or TLTROs – to allow banks to lock in ultra-low funding costs that will help keep the business of lending – just about – profitable in an environment of near-zero interest rates. The ECB has over 700 billion euros in such four-year loans outstanding right now, but hasn't issued a new one in nearly two years.
At 04:45 AM ET (0945 GMT), the Euro STOXX Banks index was up 1.6%, while the benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 was up 1.1% at 3,168.45.
European Central Bank board member Luis de Guindos said Monday that the ECB hadn’t yet discussed when or how it would conduct any new operations, but did say in a speech that a “high degree of continuing monetary support is essential,” which strongly suggests that the central bank won’t let the existing TLTROs expire without some kind of replacement. The biggest outstanding TLTRO, at 379 billion euros, is due to expire in June 2020. Bloomberg reported de Guindos as saying that the TLTRO program would be analysed “in the coming months.”
As it was Spanish and Italian banks that made the most use of TLTRO funds during the crisis, they’re also the ones most vulnerable to losing the benefits of them. Spanish and Italian banks were performing best this morning, with Unicredit (MI:CRDI),  Intesa Sanpaolo  SpA (MI:ISP) and BBVA (MC:BBVA) all among the top performers.
Northern European banks, which don’t need the ECB’s safety net as much, were also higher. In the past, they’ve tended to suffer more from the side-effect of TLTROs – a glut of liquidity that caps lending margins and profits. But Germany’s Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) were both up, as was  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), possibly a reflection of chatter that the ECB will devote more attention to ensuring that a fresh round of long-term support doesn't also create a long-term flatlining of euro interest rates."

MILAN (Reuters) - Gains in heavyweight miners and banks helped European shares recover on Monday as investors turned their focus to the start of a new round of trade talks between Beijing and Washington.
The pan-regional STOXX 600 index rose 0.9 percent by 0931 GMT, having fallen to one-week lows on Friday amid worries over an economic slowdown and lack of progress in the trade negotiations. 
But as talks between the world's two largest economies resumed on Monday, China struck an upbeat note. It did however express anger at a U.S. Navy mission through the disputed South China Sea, casting a shadow over the prospect for improved bilateral ties.
""Growth, China, trade, Brexit – the big themes that have been front of mind for months now remain very much in play this week,"" said Neil Wilson, analyst for Markets.com. 
Among national benchmarks, Germany's trade-sensitive DAX index and London's FTSE 100 both added 0.9 percent, while France's CAC gained 1.1 percent.
Europe's basic resources index rose 1.3 percent, leading sectoral gainers, after Chinese iron ore prices hit a record high on worries that supply from Brazil may fall following the Vale dam collapse.
Shares in  Glencore  (LON:GLEN),  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) and BHP were up between 0.9 and 1.6 percent. 
Banks were also strong, up 1.3 percent, with Italian lenders leading the way after Banco BPM and UBI Banca and UniCredit said their capital ratios met European Central Bank standards. Their shares were up between 2.4 and 5.6 percent.
 Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn) rose 2.1 percent on a report saying that Germany was set to grant the postal services firm a higher-than-expected increase in postage for letters to account for fewer letters sent and higher costs. 
Just Eat rose 1.9 percent after its shareholder Cat Rock urged the British takeaway ordering website to start merger discussions. Shares in rival Delivery Hero were down 0.2 percent while Takeaway.com rose 0.7 percent.

Among the few fallers was Smith & Nephew (LON:SN), down 3.4 percent, following a report it has held talks to buy U.S. medical equipment maker NuVasive in a deal that would be worth more than $3 billion.

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 04:20AM ET</span>",German government eyes larger hike in postal charges; Post shares rally,"DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - The German government could order a larger increase in the cost of sending a letter than earlier planned, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported, sending shares in  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn) 2.6 percent higher on Monday.
Citing sources, the newspaper said that postage on a letter could be increased to 85 or 90 cents from this summer under legislative changes that the Economy Ministry is expected to initiate this week.
The hike would be larger, but come later, than a hike of up to 4.8 percent in the standard letter rate of 70 cents (79 U.S. cents) that had originally been penciled in for April and would have remained in force until the end of 2021.
No comment was immediately available from the Economy Ministry, but the Federal Network Regulator that oversees the postal market confirmed that the government was working on a new postal directive.
The regulator was aware of the government's deliberations, and was examining whether to make short-term changes in its ongoing deliberations on adjusting postal charges, a spokesman said.
Deutsche Post, which delivers 59 million letters a day in Germany and has a market share of 62 percent, welcomed the government's deliberations but declined to comment on how much postage costs would go up.
The company, which is partly state-owned, has enjoyed a boom in volumes thanks to the rapid growth in parcel shipments by online retailers such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Zalando but price increases have not kept pace with its costs.

1520,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 03:40AM ET</span>",Apple iPhone Shipments Dive in China as Huawei Tightens Grip,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for our new China newsletter, a weekly dispatch coming soon on where China stands now and where it's going next.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s Chinese smartphone shipments plummeted an estimated 20 percent in 2018’s final quarter, underscoring the scale of the iPhone maker’s retreat in the world’s largest mobile device arena against local rivals like Huawei Technologies Co.
The domestic market contracted 9.7 percent in the quarter, but Apple declined at about twice that pace, research firm IDC said in a report on Monday. A slowing economy, lengthening replacement times and the iPhone’s hefty price tag contributed to the U.S. giant’s decline, it said. Xiaomi Corp. fared even worse in the final months of last year, when shipments plunged almost 35 percent, the consultancy estimates.
Smartphone labels from Apple to Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. are contending with a plateauing global market after years of breakneck growth, as a lack of innovation discourages consumers from replacing devices as often as they used to. Apple also has to cope with the rise of Huawei, which is eroding its share of a market once pivotal to driving its growth. The country’s top electronics retailers slashed prices on the latest iPhones by as much as 20 percent in past months -- an unusual move that illustrated waning enthusiasm for Apple’s gadgets.
“Apple doesn’t have a good go-to market strategy that fits the rapidly changing Chinese market,” said Nicole Peng, a senior director at Canalys. “It also seemed to be slow in reacting to China’s economic slowdown and changes in consumption structure.”
Dissipating Chinese demand compounds the problems at Apple, which is struggling to deliver on another hit device as its marquee gadget loses some of its cachet. Revenue from the iPhone slid 15 percent in the October to December period. To compensate for the loss, Apple is trying to replace phone sales with revenue from services.
Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has seen China as a key part of Apple’s strategy: last fiscal year the company generated almost $52 billion in revenue from Greater China, a region that includes Hong Kong. But with the country announcing its slowest economic growth since 2009, Apple said its sales fell 27 percent in the holiday quarter. The Chinese slowdown was the driving factor behind Apple’s first revenue outlook cut in almost two decades. Cook however emphasized the long haul, highlighting 19 percent growth in services revenue.
“When smartphones became a commodity for Chinese customers, multinationals need to adjust their overall sales and marketing strategies,” Peng said. “Apple didn’t seem to change its Chinese marketing plans.”
Huawei, which briefly surpassed Apple to become the world’s No. 2 smartphone brand in 2018, remains the runaway leader at home. It shored up its lead after unit shipments soared 23.3 percent in the December quarter, leading all major brands, according to IDC. That’s despite grappling with an unusually turbulent few months during which its finance chief was arrested on allegations of bank fraud, and the U.S. marshaled its allies to try and block the company from selling next-generation networking gear.
Apple was ranked fourth by shipments in the country during the period, trailing China’s Oppo and Vivo, IDC said. Fifth-ranked Xiaomi, a Chinese name that experienced rapid growth just before its 2018 initial public offering, ran afoul of inventory corrections and an internal restructuring, IDC said.
The industry is now counting on innovations such as foldable screens, 3D cameras and 5G-ready phones to revitalize the market. The argument is that consumers will get hooked once they experience first-hand phones with data speeds more than 10 times faster than today’s devices.
Lei Jun, Xiaomi’s billionaire co-founder, is among those who expect the advent of 5G to energize demand. But IDC argues blazing-fast phones won’t become the standard until 2020, because the rollout of 5G networks is just getting underway.
“The domestic smartphone market environment in 2019 doesn’t look very optimistic,” IDC senior analyst Wang Xi said in the report. And “5G phones will still only comprise a very small portion of the overall market. We’ve a long way to go before they become mainstream,” IDC said.

1521,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 03:16AM ET</span>",Can 'Big Brother' technology clean up palm oil's image?,"By Ana Ionova and Martinne Geller
LONDON (Reuters) - Some of the world's major palm oil users, including Nestle,  Unilever  (LON:ULVR), and Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), are trying out new satellite technology to track deforestation, as pressure grows on them to source the ingredient responsibly.
They say the monitoring systems allow them to target people felling trees in producing countries like Malaysia and Indonesia, where forests are shrinking, more efficiently than policing supply chains on the ground. 
""They say you're Big Brother,"" said Benjamin Ware, global head of responsible sourcing at Nestle. ""It's not Big Brother - it's today's reality...there is nothing secret anymore.""
Interviews with leading brands, commodity traders and plantation owners show the systems have limitations and opinions on them vary, reflecting tension within the industry over how to tackle an issue with no easy answer.
Some say the technology is not enough to stop deforestation - that monitoring is not preventing. Others worry boycotting unsustainably made palm oil just drives bad practices elsewhere.
""Dividing the supply chain into the good versus the bad fundamentally does not solve deforestation,"" said John Hartmann, global sustainability lead for agricultural supply chains at commodities trader Cargill, which sells palm oil to firms like Nestle and Unilever.
Palm oil buyers have toyed with satellite imagery for years, but have now ramped up their use as they rush to meet a pledge of zero net deforestation by 2020, set by global umbrella body the Consumer Goods Forum.
The oil is in nearly half of all packaged goods from chocolate to soap, and is also used as a cooking oil and in biofuel.
As sustainability becomes more of a buzzword, multinational brands are trying to keep shoppers from switching to independent start-up brands, which often tout green credentials.
""There's more awareness,"" said consumer analyst Robert Waldschmit from Liberum. ""People want a sustainably-sourced product.""
BIG BROTHER
Palm oil contributes less to deforestation than beef or soy, which are responsible for much of the destruction in the Brazilian Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). But it has garnered attention because it thrives in biodiverse regions, threatening endangered species and exacerbating global warming.
The big players, including consumer brands, commodity traders like Cargill and Wilmar International and plantation operators and processors, have supply chains that span millions of smallholder farmers as well as many middlemen.
""They are trying to take it into their own hands on how it's monitored...Because they haven't gotten their supply chains under control at this time,"" said Phil Aikman, campaign director at environmental pressure group Mighty Earth.
Nestle, target of a 2010 video by Greenpeace International depicting a stick of KitKat bar as an orangutan finger, was briefly suspended by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) last year for not sharing time-bound plans for how it would boost purchases of certified palm oil.
The RSPO, which is backed by the World Wildlife Fund and other NGOs, sets varying levels of sustainability criteria that members must meet to certify their oil; the most stringent level involves ensuring it is separated from the rest and can be traced to a single certified source.
RSPO-certified oil comes with extra costs, which buyers are not always willing to swallow. Of the 11.9 million tonnes of RSPO-certified oil produced in 2017, only 52 percent was sold as such, the group said.
But the RSPO has itself faced criticism that it allows some deforestation as well as development on valuable peat lands: in November, it responded by tightening its rules.
Nestle says a quarter of its palm oil is RSPO-certified and all of it will be by 2023, but 100 percent will be ""responsibly sourced"" by 2020, partly with the help of satellites.
From next month, it plans to publish data online from an Airbus-developed satellite system called Starling, to ""put responsibility on the mill"" that extracts oil from palm fruit. 
Nestle says that once a Starling deforestation alert is verified, it will ban the offending supplier after 60 days of engagement unless it cleans up its act, although the firm has not yet suspended any since rolling out this new model last month.
""The challenge is figuring out how do we act on that information, who are the right people in the organizations to interact with to address deforestation,"" Emily Kunen, Nestle's global responsible sourcing leader for palm oil and seafood, told Reuters at a plantation under Starling's watch in Bahau, some 125 km south of Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur.
Unlike cocoa or coffee, palm oil is often not marked as sustainably or responsibly sourced even though Nielsen data suggests sales of products with environmental claims often fetch higher prices and grow faster than their peers.
""The image of palm oil is very bad,"" said Nestle's Ware. ""So, for the time being, we really struggle to see how we could market it positively.""

PALM-OIL FREE? 
Italy's Ferrero Group, which only buys RSPO-certified palm oil that has been separated from the rest, has tried Starling, but the Nutella maker said it is still assessing results of its pilot to decide whether to keep using it.
""One of the questions we would like to look at is whether there's an early warning system,"" said Giulia Di Tommaso, Ferrero's chief communications and sustainability officer. ""Are you able to address it before deforestation happens, or does it only allow you to understand when the damage is already done?""
Unilever says it is on track for all of its ""core volume"" purchases, the bulk of its usage, to be certified by the end of 2019 and is also using satellite technology.
Along with others, including its suppliers Cargill and Wilmar, it is piloting a satellite tracking tool called Global Forest Watch (GFW) Pro, which will launch this summer.
Wilmar, which was among RSPO members recently 'named and shamed' by Greenpeace, said from January it started immediately suspending purchases from mills with links to GFW Pro-identified deforestation.
""In the past, we have tried to engage, engage, engage,"" said Ginny Ng, global conservation lead at Wilmar, which handles 35 percent of global palm oil supply.
""Some suppliers are taking advantage of that. So now we're going to suspend first, and then we will chat.""
GFW Pro will be free, to encourage everyone to use it, but producers say low benchmark palm prices and the difficulty in securing a premium price make it difficult to offset the costs of taking action based on data from such platforms.
Benchmark palm oil futures are just 19 percent off a three-year low they hit in November, at $563 per tonne. RSPO-certified oil can cost from $2 to $40 more per tonne depending on the level of sustainability, according to Carl Bek-Nielsen, chief executive director of United Plantations and RSPO co-chair.
Palm oil is still cheaper than alternatives but several supermarkets have cut back or stopped using it, including SPAR in Austria and Coop in Italy, citing health and environmental concerns. Italy's Barilla is also challenging Ferrero's Nutella with a chocolate spread without the oil.
European Union lawmakers are set to phase out palm oil in transport fuels from 2030, angering producing countries, which see the export as key to economic growth and poverty reduction and have threatened retaliation.
But world demand is poised to continue expanding fast https://tmsnrt.rs/2HTZwLf as incomes climb in developing nations.
Some in the industry say ""dirty"" palm oil expelled from big players' supply chains is finding other buyers in booming markets in Asia and Africa, where price often trumps sustainability.
""If oil is produced, it finds a way to market,"" said Jonathan Horrell, director of sustainability at Cadbury chocolate maker Mondelez International. Mondelez buys RSPO credits to cover its palm oil volumes rather than sourcing only physically certified oil, while also piloting GFW Pro.

It says engaging with producers to improve their practices is more effective than cutting ""dirty"" oil out. ""I don't think exclusion from supply chains is the way forward.""

1524,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2019 01:47AM ET</span>",IKEA accelerates services drive as competition stiffens,"By Anna Ringstrom and Melissa Fares
STOCKHOLM/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jessica Reznik likes IKEA's prices but not do-it-yourself. So when the Swedish furniture giant said a handyman on odd-jobs site TaskRabbit could assemble her new dresser and nightstand in her New York apartment, she jumped at the offer.
Reznik, a 24-year-old teacher, is just the kind of busy millennial IKEA hoped it would attract when it bought TaskRabbit https://www.taskrabbit.com in September 2017 as part of a drive to offer a range of services complementing its trademark flat-pack furniture.
The focus on services by the world's biggest furniture retailer is a major strategic shift it has been forced to adopt to stay in the game as waves of new competitors in an increasingly online world erode its dominance.
It seems to be working. In the first readout on TaskRabbit's activity since IKEA bought it, executives told Reuters the number of jobs done by TaskRabbit handymen had more than doubled and 10 percent of the tasks were furniture assembly, up from 2 percent before.
Jesper Brodin, chief executive of Ingka Group, which owns most IKEA stores, said TaskRabbit was expanding into interior design and looking at services such as furniture repair to give IKEA an edge, while TaskRabbit's customer data could help IKEA come up with new ideas for furniture.
""As this community grows its not only about fixing one or two things but actually to add professionalism in interior decoration, into 'life at home' practicalities,"" Brodin said at TaskRabbit's San Francisco headquarters.
""TaskRabbit is a super interesting business case because it is scalable, not only geographically but also into services at home,"" he said.
Using TaskRabbit to bundle same-day delivery and assembly for IKEA is another service being rolled out, TaskRabbit chief executive Stacy Brown-Philpot said. 
AFTER-MARKET BATTLE
Winning the battle for online shoppers is crucial for IKEA. While online furniture retailing was relatively slow to take off, the market is now being flooded and the battle is increasingly in after-market services.
The United States is IKEA's second-biggest market behind Germany with 14 percent of its sales
GlobalData Retail analyst Neil Saunders put the overall U.S. home furnishing market at $282 billion in 2017. But he said IKEA's share was 2 percent, down from 2.2 percent in 2014 and well below Germany, where it has as 12 percent share.
Pure online furniture retailers such as Germany's Home24, Britain's MADE and Wayfair in the United States have been growing rapidly, online generalists such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are pushing furniture while some hypermarkets are branching out into home furnishings.
What's more, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Wayfair have also started offering inexpensive assembly services in the United States through TaskRabbit rival Handy https://www.handy.com.
""Anyone who sells furniture will have a delivery service,"" Kantar Retail analyst Ray Gaul said. ""The difference will be that instead of having just a delivery service, IKEA are trying to give some assistance in designing your space, and that's where TaskRabbit can be helpful.""
IKEA, which had global sales of 39 billion euros ($44 billion) last year, made its name selling inexpensive furniture mainly to people willing to travel to its vast stores, lug their merchandise home and assemble it themselves.
Now, more shoppers prefer the convenience of buying big-ticket items online and getting products delivered, assembled and installed. In Reznik's case, she paid $81 to have her furniture built, with TaskRabbit taking a 15 percent cut.
Since IKEA's acquisition, the first in its 76-year history, TaskRabbit has expanded to all 48 U.S. cities with IKEA stores, up from 41 before. In Britain, it has moved beyond London to 11 more cities and it launched in Toronto, Canada, in September. 
FEEDBACK LOOP
Since it was founded in 2008, TaskRabbit says its vetted ""taskers"" have assembled 545,000 pieces of furniture, moved over 340,000 households and mounted more than 190,000 TVs - though it didn't give a breakdown for before and after the IKEA deal.
""We are convinced this is a way to access new customers in our cities,"" said Brodin, who aims to take TaskRabbit to more countries. ""The convenience customer today has so many more choices, and they are used to getting a quick answer.""
But having TaskRabbit freelancers associated with the IKEA brand also brings new risks, even though they are vetted.
""You don't know if they are a good person or not. And, like it or not, it's associated with your brand. So if they steal something, or worse, it's back on IKEA,"" Kantar's Gaul said.
Brown-Philpot attributed much of TaskRabbit's growth since the deal to links on IKEA's website. 
""Once we closed the acquisition, yes, the branding happened: there was co-branding in the store, there's opportunity for people to see TaskRabbit in the catalog, we've been on a couple of commercials. But what's really happened is the seamlessness, the integration,"" she said.
Besides TaskRabbit, IKEA is rolling out accessible inner-city stores with staff on hand to advise on planning, as well as apps and digital tools to help customers tailor living spaces.
IKEA has offered assembly across its markets for more than four years, mostly through service partners. It has also entered partnerships with Airtasker https://www.airtasker.com in Australia and UrbanClap https://www.urbanclap.com in India.
But TaskRabbit is the only platform it has bought, and executives say that brings IKEA another benefit: it has access to TaskRabbit's customer data.
""The knowledge of the taskers and their interaction will be some sort of asset for us in the future for feedback for product development,"" said Brodin. ""That was not part of the strategy but that's something we are going to explore.""

The investment is part of a Series D fundraising round, the report said, adding that the investment could propel Reddit to a value of over $3 billion.
Some media later suggested that the investment created “a great deal of confusion,” as Reddit is currently blocked in China. Tencent also owns a stake in Snapchat, which is also blocked by China’s “Great Firewall,” the country’s network of internet censorship.
It was later reported that Reddit users were unhappy with the news and flooded the site with protest messages following the reported investment.
Tencent owns the all-in-one messaging app WeChat and is considered as one of the biggest gaming company in the world thanks to the ownership of the popular “League of Legends.”
The firm’s stocks tumbled since 2018 after authorities stopped approving the release of new titles from March last year amid regulatory overhaul triggered by growing concern about violent content and game addiction, particularly among young players.
The regulators resumed gaming approvals in December, but Tencent was being left out from the first three batches of new game titles that received the approval.
The stocks recovered slightly late last month however, as one of its game titles finally obtained approval from Chinese regulators on January 24. It was the first time the industry leader gained the green light since China resumed processing game titles applications.
Despite the slight recovery, Tencent’s shares are still down about 25% from its all-time high in January 2018."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The head of Australia's sovereign wealth fund criticized National Australia Bank Ltd on Monday for the double resignation of its CEO and chairman after a misconduct inquiry, saying it was ""not good practice"" for both to go at once.
The comments from Future Fund Chairman and former federal treasurer Peter Costello put Australia's big banks on notice that investors are paying close attention to governance issues in the wake of the year-long inquiry into financial-sector misconduct. The Future Fund is Australia's biggest investor with A$8.5 billion ($6 billion) in shares.
""If the NAB was managing itself well ... the chairman would go first and then a new chairman or chairwoman would appoint the CEO,"" Costello told reporters on a media call, referring to the resignations last week of NAB Chief Executive Andrew Thorburn and Chairman Ken Henry.
""I don't think it's good practice to have an outgoing chairman to appoint the new CEO (because) the first thing any CEO coming into the NAB is going to want to know is who's the chairman? I don't know if they've handled the transition well.""
Thorburn and Henry resigned on Thursday days after being singled out for strong criticism in the final report of the Royal Commission inquiry, which found widespread greed and wrongdoing in the financial sector.
The CEO would leave this month but Henry would stay until a replacement was found, the bank said.
Henry said last week he needed to stay to ""ensure an orderly succession of the CEO and also to ensure appropriate board renewal"". Asked about Costello's comments, an NAB representative had no further comment.
Costello also said the Royal Commission showed that regulators had to ""do a lot more"" to clean up the financial system.

Costello gave his remarks as the A$147 billion sovereign fund reported a 5.8 percent return for the year to end-December, below its 6.6 percent target but better than the average 0.6 percent return for managed funds following market turmoil in late 2018.

1529,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2019 09:15PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Apollo nears $3 billion deal to buy Cox TV stations - sources,"By Liana B. Baker and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Apollo Global Management LLC is nearing a roughly $3 billion agreement to acquire Cox Enterprises Inc's 14 regional TV stations, the biggest in a series of deals the private equity firm is lining up to become a force in U.S. broadcasting, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
Cox, a privately held media conglomerate whose holdings span automotive websites, newspapers and cable TV, has been seeking to exit the regional TV sector, which is going through a wave of consolidation. Operators are looking for scale to counter the rise of online streaming and the shift of advertising dollars to the internet. Cox and Apollo are also discussing some joint venture agreements for Cox's broadcast station in Atlanta, where Cox is headquartered and also has radio stations, the sources said.
There may be other cities where the companies decide to have joint ventures, the sources added.
An agreement between Apollo and Cox could be announced later this week, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. As with any negotiations, talks could always fall apart at the last minute, the people cautioned.
Apollo is also a bidder for a portfolio of local TV stations worth about $1 billion that Nexstar Media Group Inc plans to shed following its $4.1 billion takeover of Tribune Media Co, the sources added. That process is expected to wrap up later this year. Should Apollo prevail in that auction, it would combine the assets with the Cox TV stations, the people said.
Apollo also has an agreement to acquire the assets of Northwest Broadcasting, which owns more than a dozen TV stations in mostly rural markets in the Pacific Northwest, and combine them with the Cox assets, the sources said.
Apollo and Cox declined to comment. Northwest Broadcasting and Nexstar could not be reached for comment.
Cox said last July it was exploring options for its 14-station portfolio. The stations are in nine states, including Florida and Georgia, and reach more than 31 million viewers in their markets.
The broadcast media sector has seen a flurry of merger talks amid expectations that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission could relax restrictions on how many stations broadcasters can operate.
Private equity firms find broadcast TV stations appealing because of the cash-rich fees the stations generate from being carried by cable operators. Apollo would seek to use some of Northwest Broadcasting's contracts, which have higher fees thanCox's, to hike up fees from the cable operators, some of the sources said.
Apollo would also be able to cut costs at Cox's TV stations, which have been family-controlled for many years.
Apollo tried unsuccessfully last year to acquire both Nexstar and Tribune Media, in separate attempts.

1530,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 10, 2019 09:10PM ET</span>",SoftBank Buyback Magic May Soon Wear Thin,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Day traders may be rejoicing at SoftBank Group Corp.’s biggest ever buyback, but for loyal believers in Masayoshi Son’s magic wand, it’s another worrisome development. 
SoftBank unveiled the repurchase program last week, promising to spend as much as 600 billion yen ($5.5 billion) on its own stock over the coming year. That would be enough to buy 71 million shares, or 6.5 percent of the total, based on the closing price on Feb. 5. There’s an upper limit of 112 million shares, or 10.3 percent of the total.
That’s a lot of buybacks — good news, right? SoftBank’s shares soared 17.7 percent to a four-month high on Thursday.
There’s a risk in such largess, though. Buybacks shrink the public float, potentially reducing SoftBank’s weighting in benchmark indexes and causing passive investors that track those gauges to cut their holdings. As a result, market sentiment toward buybacks among institutional investors is shifting, with large repurchases increasingly seen as inferior to special dividends.
Passive investing has been on the rise since Japan’s central bank started buying stock ETFs in early 2013. Over the last three years alone, Japanese ETFs received more than $140 billion of net inflows. Billions will have gone into SoftBank, a member of both the Nikkei 225 Index and the Topix. Nomura Holdings Inc., which manages a $77 billion Topix ETF, owns 4.9 percent of the company. Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund has become the second-largest investor after tilting toward equities in late 2014.
Keeping a large public float is how to play passive money. Hong Kong-listed  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), for instance, is a master at that game. Dividends rather than share buybacks are the main channel through which the bank rewards its shareholders. Investors can elect to receive payments in cash, or as a scrip dividend in the form of new shares. As a result, HSBC has a 9.4 percent weighting — the third largest — on the benchmark Hang Seng Index, even though it’s not in the top five in terms of total market value.
Mindful of the unscientific construction of the Nikkei index, which assigns weightings based on price levels, the Bank of Japan has been steadily moving toward the market-weighted Topix Index, which scrutinizes a firm’s public float. Over the last three years, Nomura’s Topix ETF received more than $50 billion of net inflows, while its Nikkei 225 ETF got less than half that amount.
So SoftBank has to be careful. It has a 5.4 percent weighting in the Nikkei 225 because of its relatively high price stock price (about 10,000 yen compared with, say, less than 5,000 yen for Sony Corp (T:6758). or 570 for Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.). But SoftBank accounts for only 1.9 percent of the Topix.
It’s surprising that a company financially savvy enough to use collar trades to limit losses in its Nvidia Corp. holdings wouldn’t know the pitfalls of share repurchases.
Chances are, a splashy buyback was seen as having a public relations value that a dividend payout couldn’t provide. Son is now back in the media limelight, bemoaning the valuation gap his flagship holding company is suffering. The buyback also rewards investment banks, which can earn money from executing the trades. Dividends, on the other hand, are just boring checks from the company’s finance department that don’t involve reporters or brokers. 
Son has alienated many fans in the past year. Last March, he threw holders of SoftBank dollar bonds under the bus as part of preparations for the firm’s domestic telco IPO. Small individual investors in Japan, who long supported Son’s quest to buy up the world’s hottest unicorns, are now feeling burned after the offering flopped. 
Cash dividends are money in the bank, while a run-up in the stock price is just a paper gain that can evaporate quickly. With SoftBank’s fortunes increasingly tied to the Nasdaq, all it would take is another correction in U.S. tech stocks for that to happen. Son had better be careful not to alienate fund managers this time; otherwise he may find himself running out of supporters.

U.S. production growth has stalled — for now — and President Donald Trump’s sanctions on oil flows from a second OPEC producer (Venezuela joins Iran on the naughty step) will cut supplies even further.
The flow of OPEC crude to the U.S. fell to the lowest in five years in January, according to data from the cargo-tracking and intelligence company Kpler. Bloomberg’s own tanker tracking shows the flow of crude from the Persian Gulf to the U.S. last month was 36 percent lower than in December and almost 60 percent lower than in August.
Those flows matter, not because the Americans are OPEC’s biggest customer — they aren’t — but because the U.S. market is still the most transparent. Official weekly data on the country’s oil production, consumption, refining, stockpiles and trade flows are watched keenly by traders and policymakers. Those indicators drive sentiment.
That’s why Saudi Arabia decided to focus its output cuts on the U.S. in the middle of 2017 and has done so again now. While the kingdom’s crude shipments were cut by 10 percent between November and January, flows to the U.S. were slashed by 46 percent, taking them to the lowest level since OPEC and other oil producers began the last round of supply reductions at the start of 2017.
U.S. production growth is also expected to slow significantly in 2019. Output rose by about 1.8 million barrels a day between December 2017 and December 2018, almost three times the increase that was expected at the start of last year. This year, it’s expected to rise by just 520,000 barrels a day. The slowdown in U.S. output growth might be seen as bullish for crude — so long as you believe the Department of Energy has got its forecast right this time. 
And then there’s Venezuela. Sanctions on its oil exports, and on the sale to the country of the diluent needed to let its extra-heavy crude flow through pipelines, have had an instant impact. The country is now diverting some of its own light crude from export markets to mix it with the extra-heavy oil in an attempt to keep producing.
And things are going to get worse for Venezuela’s oil sector. The sanctions will hasten the decline in output and even if there’s a swift transition of power, which looks unlikely, it will be months before production is restored. Infrastructure is crumbling, the state oil company has lost much of its technical staff, and an interim government will struggle to enact promised changes.
The problem for bulls is that while oil supply has clearly tightened, demand is starting to look weaker again. Hopes of a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks were knocked back after Trump said he wouldn’t meet President Xi Jinping before a March 1 deadline to avert higher tariffs on Chinese goods.
Meanwhile, the European Commission has slashed growth forecasts for the euro area’s big economies and warned that Brexit and the slowdown in China threaten to make things even worse. That might start to weigh on oil demand forecasts, which have remained relatively robust. 
Last month, the International Energy Agency cited “average prices being below year-ago levels” as the main reason it saw demand growth holding up. We’ll have to wait for its next forecast on Wednesday to see whether it still thinks that’s the case. Oil prices have been flat for a month, which should be positive for demand, but the weakening economy is negative. And if the oil bulls do emerge from their January slumber, and start pushing up prices, they might just choke off that demand.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2019 02:51PM ET</span>","Shoplifter extortion case against Walmart, other retailers is dismissed","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A federal judge dismissed a racketeering lawsuit accusing Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and six other retailers of extortion by forcing accused shoplifters to take costly ""restorative justice"" classes or else be reported to the police.
In a decision late on Friday, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, found no proof of a nationwide conspiracy to steer accused shoplifters into paying $400 up front or $500 in installments for the classes from Utah-based Corrective Education Co, and admitting guilt, to avoid prosecution.
Shoplifting is the main source of inventory ""shrinkage"" for U.S. retailers, causing losses of about $559 per incident, and together with so-called organized retail crime about $17.1 billion in 2017, according to the National Retail Federation.
Koh said the three plaintiffs, who were accused in 2017 of shoplifting from Walmarts in Florida, Georgia and Texas, did not show that the retailers had specific knowledge of a conspiracy.
She said it did not matter that the retailers might use Corrective Education's database to conduct background checks before deciding to offer the six-to-eight-hour online classes, a portion of whose costs the plaintiffs said was reimbursed to retailers.
""The only alleged commonality each of the defendants have with one another is CEC, whom plaintiffs have chosen not to sue,"" Koh wrote. ""That is not enough to allege one single nationwide conspiracy.""
Koh also said she lacked jurisdiction over most defendants in the proposed class action because they did not have enough ties to California, and said the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue retailers that did not harm them.
She gave the plaintiffs 30 days to amend their claims against Walmart, Corrective Education's founders and some of its employees and directors.
Claims against Bloomingdale's, Burlington Coat Factory, Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co, 99 Cents Only, Save Mart and Sportsman's Warehouse were dismissed with prejudice, meaning they cannot be brought again.
The plaintiffs were identified as Jane Doe, Mary Moe and John Roe. Their lawyers did not immediately respond on Saturday to requests for comment. Walmart and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Scott Gant, a partner at Boies Schiller & Flexner representing the Corrective Education defendants, said he was pleased with Koh's thoughtful opinion.
Walmart suspended its use of Corrective Education's classes in December 2017, the Wall Street Journal said that month.

The case is Doe et al v Walmart Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-02125.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2019 12:47PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Venezuela moves to replace U.S. executives on Citgo board - sources,"By Marianna Parraga and Deisy Buitrago
(Reuters) - Venezuelan state-run oil company PDVSA is taking steps to remove at least two American executives from the board of directors of its U.S. refining subsidiary, Citgo Petroleum Corp, according to people close to the matter.
Citgo is facing unprecedented challenges to its finances and management after the U.S. government last week imposed tough sanctions on Petroleos de Venezuela [PDVSA.UL] designed to prevent oil revenue from going to leftist President Nicolas Maduro. The United States and dozens of other nations have refused to recognize Maduro, viewing his reelection last year to another six-year term as fraudulent. 
Venezuela's self-proclaimed president Juan Guaido is setting up bank accounts with U.S. help that would take income accrued by Citgo, Venezuela's top foreign asset, to finance an interim government. Maduro has denounced Guaido as a U.S. puppet who is seeking to foment a coup.
The board of Houston-based Citgo includes at least two U.S. citizens, Art Klein and Rick Esser, as well as Venezuelans Asdrubal Chavez, Frank Gygax, Nepmar Escalona, Simon Suarez and Alejandro Escarra, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.
PDVSA and Citgo did not respond to requests for comment. Esser and Klein did not immediately reply to emails and phone calls seeking comment on their status. 
It was unclear if PDVSA's board has already approved the changes at Citgo's board and who would replace the American executives.
Citgo also has an executive board that includes the refiner's general managers, its corporate treasurer and the controller, and other vice presidents.
Esser was among a team of Citgo executives who met with U.S. officials last month in Washington amid efforts by Guaido and the U.S. government to appoint a new Citgo board of directors.
Citgo operates three U.S. refineries that supply about 4 percent of total U.S. fuel production and is PDVSA's largest U.S. customer for its oil exports. Sanctions have forced Citgo and other U.S. refiners to seek crude oil supplies from other nations. 
Delaware-registered Citgo operates plants in Texas, Louisiana and Illinois that are capable of processing a combined 750,000 barrels per day of oil. It distributes fuel through about 5,500 independent retail stations in 29 U.S. states. 
Citgo, which has been owned by PDVSA for three decades, has not publicly detailed the composition of its current board since late 2017, when Asdrubal Chavez, a cousin of the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, was nominated by Maduro to run the business unit. 
Asdrubal Chavez, Escalona and Escarra have been working from an office in the Bahamas since the U.S. sanctions were issued, according to the sources. 

On Friday, Venezuelan oil minister and PDVSA President Manuel Quevedo held a meeting with his deputy ministers and directors, one of the people said. The agenda was not revealed.

Asked by Schweiz am Wochenende if the investment bank was tying up too much capital, Rohner said: ""No, we see 60 billion Swiss francs ($60 billion) in risk-weighted assets as a reasonable size for our trading business. You can hardly run this business with less.""
Like bigger rival UBS,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has cut investment banking to focus on wealth management, reducing the financial impact when markets turn volatile.
Rohner, who said Credit Suisse's merger advisory business made it the only European bank able to match up against U.S. rivals, also played down speculation that the bank's low share price could make it a takeover target. The stock fell more than a third last year and is down nearly 10 percent this year. 
""Banks operate in a very regulated environment. Hostile takeovers are almost ruled out these days,"" he said.
Asked whether the bank could have foreigners as both chairman and chief executive, the Swiss manager said: ""In theory yes, in practice hardly. 
""Our name is Credit Suisse, we have 1.5 million customers here, so it makes sense that one of the two top positions is held by someone who speaks our language and knows the country and its culture. The chairman in particular must have good contacts in Swiss politics."" 
French-Ivorian Tidjane Thiam is chief executive and Rohner said he hoped and expected this to still be the case when Rohner is due to retire in 2021.
""It is very important or us to have a strong leader who has shaped and implemented our restructuring,"" he said.

Rohner added that nearly everyone wanted an end to negative Swiss interest rates but it did no good to moan about them. ""It is to be assumed from today's perspective that we will have very, very low rates for some time still.""

1541,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2019 04:00AM ET</span>",U.S. fund managers brace for consumer slowdown,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - With expectations for slowing growth escalating, U.S. fund managers are selectively avoiding stocks in consumer companies as lofty valuations, concerns about declining earnings estimates, and consumer confidence keep them on guard.
Low U.S. unemployment and rising wages should point to a healthy consumer, but worries about global growth, domestic U.S. politics and a U.S.-China trade war have been wearing on consumer and investor moods.
Wall Street expects fourth-quarter earnings growth of 14.7 percent for the S&P 500's consumer discretionary index - below the 17.8 percent consensus from October at the beginning of the fourth quarter, according to data from Refinitiv as of Friday morning. 
And for the first quarter, analysts expect discretionary earnings to fall 1.7 percent, compared with expectations for 6 percent growth on Oct. 1.
For consumer staples, fourth-quarter earnings are expected to grow 4.2 percent, down from the 6.7 percent consensus in October, with 0.7 percent growth expected for the first quarter.
In comparison, the broader S&P benchmark is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings growth of 16.8 percent and decline 0.1 percent in the first quarter.
""Our thoughts on the global consumer is that the marginal data points coming in are more negative than positive,"" said Eric Freedman, Chief Investment Officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. His firm is ""market weight to slightly underweight"" on consumer discretionary while it views consumer staples valuations as ""fair to slightly over valued."" 
U.S consumer confidence fell to a 1-1/2 year-low in January as a partial shutdown of the government and financial markets turmoil left households nervous, according to a Conference Board survey. 
Shawn Kravetz, Esplanade Capital LLC's chief investment officer, said while the ""consumer remains generally robust, most people have had something in their life in the past few months that has given them pause."" 
""For the wealthy it was watching the stock market go down 15 percent in the fourth quarter,"" Kravetz said. ""For government workers, it was weeks of no cash flow and uncertainty. For many it was the uncertainty of the shutdown and what the secondary effects might be to them directly, to their jobs or businesses, or the economy at large ... everyone was touched directly or indirectly. That didn't pop the bubble but certainly let a little air out.""
Like other investors, Kravetz is largely avoiding consumer stocks because of their valuations.
The consumer discretionary index trades at roughly 19.8 times forward earnings estimates compared with 17.3 for consumer staples and a 15.8 multiple for the broader S&P, according to Refinitiv data. 
""You're paying more for less growth,"" said Burns McKinney, a portfolio manager at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors in Dallas. His firm holds stocks in consumer companies including  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) but is underweight the broader discretionary and staples sectors.
Companies that have yet to report their earnings include Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, Newell Brands Inc, and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, which fit into the staples category, while discretionary companies that have yet to report include retailers such as  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD), Macy's Inc, Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) and Target.
""The big retailers like Walmart are fairly valued with solid expectations but also with some risks,"" Kravetz said. ""The brands like Coca-Cola and Pepsi are mostly near their highs as safety in storms but with enough risks to keep us away. The stores like Macy's and Gap are challenged."" 
Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research at Refinitiv, said retail growth is still healthy, but because growth was ""significantly stronger"" earlier in 2018, ""some of the stocks could be punished"" when retailers report earnings. 
""We're already seeing that consumer confidence has lowered and analysts have been lowering expectations for 2019,"" said Martis. 
So far, 71 percent of consumer discretionary firms have beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations, with more than half of the results already released. About 64 percent of staples companies have beat estimates, with reports out from two-thirds of the sector, according to data from Refinitiv. 
A major challenge to first-quarter numbers for consumer companies was the 35-day partial U.S. government shutdown, when hundreds of thousands of federal workers went without paychecks.
Because of the shutdown, government data releases were delayed. The U.S. Commerce Department's Census Bureau announced earlier this week that it would release December's retail sales report on Feb. 14.
In a recent Reuters poll a majority of economists saw the shutdown having a significant impact on first quarter gross domestic product growth, with the median expectation for a 0.3 percentage point trim.

On top of this, a late-2018 equity market sell-off, which sliced 19.8 percent of the S&P 500 between Sept. 20 and Dec. 24, also scared consumers, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).

1542,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 09, 2019 03:50AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. IMF Rate Policy for ‘Inevitable’ Crisis
While rate watchers and currency traders were looking for any new inflection in the voice of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, the International Monetary Fund laid out a game plan for battling a potential global downturn.
The plan would see central banks implement negative interest rates, given their currently low levels.
As fretting over still-unresolved trade tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China, continues, the IMF took preemptive action to enable monetary policymakers to combat an ""inevitable"" crisis.
The organization explained that many central banks reduced policy interest rates to zero during the global financial crisis to boost growth and noted that, ten years later, interest rates remain low in most countries.
“While the global economy has been recovering, future downturns are inevitable,” the IMF warned. “Crises have historically required interest rate cuts in the order of three to six percentage points but only three OECD countries - Turkey, Mexico and Iceland - have that kind of room to maneuver today.”
The IMF staff study intends to show how central banks can set up a system that would make deeply negative interest rates a feasible option and comes even as the Federal Reserve is struggling to convince markets that they could move forward from the current range of 2.25% to 2.5% with two more rate increases this year.
But markets are skeptical, placing a probability of only about 4% on one increase in December, compared to odds of nearly 12% for a cut by the end of the year, according to fed funds futures.
2. We Have Nothing to Fear, but …
The volatility index (VIX) quietly hit its lowest since level since October on Wednesday.
That made sense given the continued rally. Following the most recent downturn in December, the VIX has plunged more than 50%, while the S&P 500 has surged about 15%.
The Dow eked out its seventh weekly win Friday after clawing back nearly all its losses mere minutes before the close. But the geopolitical headlines that were so prevalent in December are reappearing and weighed on stocks this week.
While it may be too early to call a short-term bottom in the VIX, the argument is not without a merit. There's plenty of uncertainty to go around in the coming the weeks, which may not only send the fear index into overdrive, but limit risk appetite.
The threat of another U.S. government shutdown as early as next week looms. There's little evidence so far that Congress and the White House is closing in on a budget deal by Feb. 15.
The United States' trade dispute with the European Union over auto imports is expected to return to the spotlight. The Commerce Department's recommendations into whether to slap tariffs of up to 25% on imported cars and parts from the EU are due by Feb. 17.
On the geopolitical front, Brexit is a concern as the U.K. and European Union are at loggerheads over the Irish backstop issue. The Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned earlier this week a no-deal Brexit could plunge the U.K. into a recession.
And global growth concerns remain front and center as Germany showed little sign that it'll avoid a second-consecutive quarter of negative growth, triggering a technical recession, after releasing a slew of dour economic data.
This uncertainty may not spark a vicious upward swing in VIX. But it does indicate a smooth path to swashbuckling gains in February faces a lot of potholes.
3. Will Walmart Be Forced Into India U-Turn?
Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) reports earnings in two weeks and there will be a strong examination of its e-commerce performance as usual.
But there should also be much more attention on its e-commerce business in India, which is facing an existential threat, according to a brokerage report out this week.
Walmart completed its $16 billion acquisition of Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart in August. But on Feb. 1, the Indian government implemented new regulations designed to help smaller Indian retailers in the face of competition from the likes of Flipkart and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Among the new rules, which chiefly target the those big two, companies with direct foreign investment are banned from selling products online from vendors in which they have a stake. E-commerce companies can’t have more than 25% of their inventory from a single vendor and can’t have products exclusive to their online portals.
Morgan Stanley stressed how onerous this would be on Walmart in a research note this week.
""(A)n exit is likely, not completely out of the question, with the Indian ecommerce market becoming more complicated""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said, according to The Economic Times.
Morgan also said Flipkart may need to remove as much as 25% of its products from its site to comply.
""There is a precedent for an exit as Amazon retreated from China in late 2017 after seeing that the model no longer worked for them,"" it added.
But Walmart reaffirmed its commitment to the market this week.
“Walmart’s and Flipkart’s commitment to India is deep and long term,” Dirk Van den Berghe, Walmart regional CEO of Asian and Canada, told Indo-Asian News Service. “Despite the recent changes in regulations, we remain optimistic about the country.”
According to the brokerage, given the above, Flipkart may need to remove about 25% of its products from its site."
1543,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2019 01:58AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Tesla's delivery team gutted in recent job cuts - sources,"By Alexandria Sage
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - When Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc announced last month a second round of job cuts to rein in costs, one crucial department was particularly badly hit. The automaker more than halved the division that delivers its electric vehicles to North American customers, two of the laid-off workers said. 
Some 150 employees out of a team of about 230 were let go in January at the Las Vegas facility that gets tens of thousands of Model 3s into the hands of U.S. and Canadian buyers, they said, in a sign the company expected the pace of deliveries to significantly slow in the near term. 
The cuts, which have not been previously reported, could fuel investor worries that demand for the Model 3 in the United States has tailed off after a large tax break for consumers expired last year and the car remains too expensive for most consumers. 
Tesla has said its focus this quarter is on supplying cars to customers waiting in China and Europe.
""There are not enough deliveries,"" one of the former employees told Reuters. ""You don't need a team because there are not that many cars coming through.""
Delivery of the Model 3 was the company's key priority in the latter half of 2018, as Tesla tried to supply all buyers wanting the full benefit of the $7,500 U.S. tax credit before it was cut in half at year's end. 
The Model 3 is crucial to Tesla's plans for long-term profitability. The company aims to post a profit in each quarter this year, based on the expectation that it will sell more Model 3s and continue to cut costs. 
Tesla declined to comment on the job reductions in the delivery team. The company still has an undisclosed number of delivery personnel attached to other locations. 
'EVERY BEING ON THE PLANET'
Even before the paring back of the delivery team, investors questioned the level of demand for the Model 3 remaining after Tesla's all-out push to supply buyers ahead of the tax credit cut. 
""Given the need for revenue to cover costs and generate cash, the financial community should be focused on the level of demand for Tesla vehicles – in particular the Model 3,"" wrote  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Brian Johnson in January.
The two former delivery workers said the 2018 sales push has left Tesla's reservations list plucked clean of North American buyers willing to pay current prices of over $40,000 to get their hands on a Model 3. 
Chief Executive Elon Musk initially said in 2016 the car would start at $35,000 - which sparked a rush of reservations - but Tesla has yet to actually sell any cars at that price, despite two price cuts already this year. 
""We sold through just about every car we had on the ground and we called almost every being on the planet who had ever expressed desire to own a Tesla to let them know the tax credit was expiring,"" said the other ex-employee. 
Tesla workers around the company were reassigned to pitch in, that source said.
""They said, 'Your job is off the table now, we have to get these cars delivered. Because if we don't get these cars delivered, you don't have a job tomorrow,'"" the former employee said.
HALF A MILLION BUYERS
At the Model 3 launch in July 2017, Musk said over half a million buyers had put down deposits on the new car. That helped send Tesla shares up almost 15 percent over the following six weeks. 
The company delivered 145,610 Model 3s in 2018, but all of them at prices far above $35,000. Musk said last week a $35,000 version that could be sold profitably was perhaps six months away. Even with two price cuts this year, the lowest price tag on a Model 3 is now $42,900. 
Musk maintains that Model 3 demand is ""insanely high,"" but his company has not released any figures to demonstrate that.
Asked about the reservations list last week by analysts, outgoing Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja declined to disclose how many people remained, calling it ""not relevant."" 
Musk has said Tesla has multiple ways of stoking demand, if it chose to, such as offering leases or boosting marketing efforts. 
The Model 3s now rolling out of Tesla's Fremont, California, factory are going to Chinese and European buyers, Tesla says. 
The two laid-off employees said delivery targets for North America - made up of mostly U.S. buyers - this quarter would be 55 percent to 60 percent of what they were in the last quarter of 2018. 
If Tesla does not cut prices soon, it risks losing potential customers - and ones already on its reservation list - to a slew of German and Asian competitors whose electric vehicles will hit the U.S. market this year. Each of the new entrant's first 200,000 buyers will be eligible for a full federal subsidy. 
Having met that number already, the U.S. tax credit for Tesla buyers drops in half to $3,750 for the first six months of 2019, then falls by half again in the second six months.
Musk said last month his ""rough guess"" was that Tesla would begin building the $35,000 Model 3 in mid-2019. 

One of the sources said that could recharge U.S. demand: ""If there was a Model 3 for $35,000 that was still a really good car, that blows away the competition, I could see demand going through the roof.""

Hebei will spend up to 100 million yuan ($14.83 million) a year to encourage companies in the province to list on stock markets either in China or abroad, the state-backed Hebei Daily newspaper said on Friday.
The incentives, while modest in financial scale, point to local governments stepping up efforts to push companies to expand funding channels. Traditional sources of off-balance sheet financing are on the wane under a multi-year crackdown by Beijing on the country's so-called shadow lending sector.
Hebei is a politically important province, located on the doorstep of the capital. It is also a key example of a local economy attempting to pivot away from traditional smokestack industries to less polluting and higher-value manufacturing. 
In 2017, President Xi Jinping declared that Xiongan in Hebei province will be the site of a new development zone that will become a hub for the economies of Hebei and nearby Beijing and Tianjin. 
Last month, the State Council, or cabinet, said China plans to set up a stock market in Xiongan in an effort to strengthen support of direct financing in the zone.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is exploring alternatives to locating part of its new headquarters in New York in case the plan should fail due to local opposition, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters on Friday.
The online retailer has not yet acquired any land for the project, which would make it easy to scrap its plans, the source said. The Washington Post reported the story earlier on Friday.
The person briefed on the matter said that Amazon was still working toward winning approval from New York officials and had not given up on the proposal, but was considering potential alternatives to New York.
Earlier, the Post, which is owned by Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, reported that Amazon executives had had internal discussions to reassess the situation in New York and explore alternatives. It cited two unnamed people familiar with the retailer's thinking.
In a statement on Friday, Amazon said it was working to engage with New Yorkers, but did not discuss whether it would change its plans.
""We're focused on engaging with our new neighbors - small business owners, educators, and community leaders,"" it said. ""Whether it's building a pipeline of local jobs through workforce training or funding computer science classes for thousands of New York City students, we are working hard to demonstrate what kind of neighbor we will be."" 
Amazon shares closed down 1.6 percent on Friday.
In November, Amazon said it would branch out from its home base in Seattle with plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in two new developments.
The world's largest online retailer plans to spend $5 billion on the developments in Long Island City in New York's Queens borough, and in Arlington, Virginia, near Washington, D.C, and expects to get more than $2 billion in tax credits and incentives with plans to apply for more.
Amazon has mailed flyers to Queens residents touting the economic benefits of its New York expansion.
But some residents in the rapidly transforming Long Island City neighborhood across the East River from mid town Manhattan's skyscrapers have loudly opposed Amazon's plan. They say they fear more crowded subway stations, an overburdened sewage system and rent increases that would drive out long-time residents.
""I would be happy not to have them,"" said Terri Gloyd, the co-owner of the LIC Corner Cafe. ""I think most of the neighborhood hasn't wanted them here."" She said her neighbors may have given the prospect of Amazon a warmer welcome had the subsidy package not been so large. 
A critic of the plan, Queens lawmaker Senator Michael Gianaris, was appointed to a state senate panel that has the power to block Amazon's campus, local media including the New York Times have reported. 
City council speaker Corey Johnson told local radio he is looking at subsidies for Amazon and that the plan is not yet final. One point of contention could be Amazon's opposition to labor unions. 
U.S. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district spans parts of Queens and the Bronx, has also criticized Amazon.
Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a link to the Post story on Friday and said: ""Can everyday people come together and effectively organize against creeping overreach of one of the world’s biggest corporations? Yes, they can.""
In one sign of opposition, artists spray-painted Amazon's logo - spelled ""AMAZNO"" - on streets near the proposed site. 
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio support Amazon's plan.
Cuomo defended the deal on Friday as the largest economic development the state had ever won and cited the Post story.
""If Amazon does not come to New York, it's because of the political opposition. Because it is so ironic for Amazon, after they spent one year with everyone seducing them, and everyone courting them, we win and then there's political opposition.""
BIDDING WAR
The split second headquarters, which Amazon called HQ2, attracted 238 proposals from across North America in a year-long bidding war. 
Amazon ended the frenzy by dividing the spoils between the two most powerful U.S. East Coast cities and offering a consolation prize of a 5,000-person center in Nashville, Tennessee.
At the outset of its search last year, Amazon said it was looking for a business-friendly environment. The company said it will receive performance-based incentives of $1.525 billion from the state of New York, including an average $48,000 for each job it creates.

It can also apply for other tax incentives, such as New York City's Relocation and Employment Assistance Program that offers tax breaks potentially worth $900 million over 12 years. What benefit the company would actually get was unclear.

1549,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 05:19PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Sneaks a Winning Week Despite Trade War Fears,"Investing.com - A last-minute surge that trimmed the day's losses let the Dow extend its weekly winning streak to seven. For most of the day, concerns the U.S. and China won't be able to resolve their bitter trade dispute before a key deadline kept stocks on the back foot.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.25%, the S&P 500 rose 0.07%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.14%. The Nasdaq also finished the weekly higher -- barely -- for a seventh-straight week.
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday the United States and China were far from an agreement ahead of the next round of trade talks in Beijing slated for next week.
Without a trade deal, or an extension to the March 1 deadline, President Donald Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on China to 25% from 10%, a move that could escalate the trade dispute and hurt risk sentiment.
The lack of progress on trade comes as investors fear the United States' trade dispute with the European Union over the bloc's trade practices in the auto industry could be next.
The Commerce Department by Feb. 17 is expected to release a broad report on auto imports, which could include a recommendation that tariffs be implemented on European autos.
Tensions over trade also played out in the energy sector as oil prices struggled for much of the day amid fears a U.S.-China trade war could hurt oil demand from Beijing, the biggest crude importer. WTI futures settled up 8 cents at $52.72 a barrel, and Brent, the global benchmark, settled up 47 cents to $62.10.
Financials also kept a lid on gains in the broader market, falling 0.55% as U.S. government bond yields fell for a fourth-straight day, as concerns about global growth weighed.
Tech stocks, however, managed to sidestep the selling in the broader market, led by sharp gains in Motorola Solutions and Electronic Arts.
Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI) surged 13% on better-than-expected fourth-quarter results.
Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) rallied 16% as its ""Apex Legends"" game reached 10 million players within 72 hours of its official launch. Apex Legends is seen as a challenger to Fortnite, a game whose popularity has hurt the growth of established video game publishers like EA and  Take-Two Interactive  (NASDAQ:TTWO).
Elsewhere on the corporate earnings front, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) fell 0.95%, closing well off session lows of $85.55, after reporting fourth-quarter earnings of $1.33 per share on revenue of $1.39 billion. That missed estimates compiled by Investing.com for earnings of $1.68 a share on revenue of $1.52 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq edged upward to snap a two-day losing streak on Friday as positive corporate results offset lingering skepticism over the United States and China reaching a trade deal before the March 1 deadline.
Shares of Coty Inc,  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT) and Motorola Solutions Inc (NYSE:MSI) jumped after the companies reported better-than-expected quarterly results.
In addition, shares of  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA), which plunged on Wednesday after the company's quarterly results, surged after the videogame publisher said that its game Apex Legends had attracted 10 million players in three days.
Electronic Arts and Motorola Solutions were among the top boosts to the S&P 500.
Earlier, U.S. stocks dragged as trade concerns continued to weigh on investor sentiment. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he did not plan to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping before the deadline set for reaching an agreement.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will travel to Beijing for principal-level meetings on Feb. 14-15, a statement from the White House said.
As the session wore on, Wall Street's major indexes regained lost ground.
""What's expected, based on the way the market has performed, is that there is a risk that we'll see another round of tariff-hiking, but that risk will be overridden by some type of agreement,"" said John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management in New York. ""These are not indices that are showing extreme investor concern at this point.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 63.2 points, or 0.25 percent, to 25,106.33, the S&P 500 gained 1.83 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,707.88 and the Nasdaq Composite added 9.85 points, or 0.14 percent, to 7,298.20.
For the week, the Dow added 0.17 percent, the S&P 500 rose 0.05 percent, and the Nasdaq gained 0.47 percent.
The S&P 500 has risen more than 15 percent from 20-month lows in December, spurred by a dovish Federal Reserve and largely positive fourth-quarter earnings, as well as hopes for an eventual U.S.-China trade deal.
Of the S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results, 71.5 percent have beaten profit estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
However, analysts now expect current-quarter profit to dip 0.1 percent from the year before, not grow the 5.3 percent estimated at the start of the year.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.15-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 35 new highs and 37 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.83 billion shares, compared to the 7.46 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

1552,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 04:39PM ET</span>",National Enquirer owner defends reporting on Amazon's Bezos,"By Nathan Layne
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The owner of U.S. tabloid newspaper the National Enquirer pushed back on Friday against accusations of ""extortion and blackmail"" from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, saying its reporting on an extramarital relationship involving the world's richest man was lawful and it would investigate his claims.
Bezos on Thursday accused American Media Inc (AMI) of trying to blackmail him with the threat of publishing ""intimate photos"" he allegedly sent to his girlfriend unless he said in public that the American supermarket tabloid's reporting on him was not politically motivated.
The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan is reviewing whether the alleged extortion violated a non-prosecution agreement, a person familiar with the matter said, confirming an earlier report by Bloomberg News.
AMI signed the agreement with federal prosecutors last year in connection with a $150,000 hush-money payment to a former Playboy model who claims she had an affair with U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump denies the affair.
The agreement can be voided if AMI commits any crimes. If the agreement is nullified, AMI or its executives could face prosecution for the hush payment and its conduct with Bezos, legal experts said.
AMI and its CEO David Pecker have had close links to Trump, who has attacked Bezos, Amazon and the newspaper he owns privately, the Washington Post, on Twitter.
""American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos,"" the company said in a statement.
Bezos and his wife announced last month that they were divorcing after 25 years of marriage. That same day, the National Enquirer touted it was publishing alleged intimate text messages between Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, a former television anchor whom he was said to be dating.
Bezos opened an investigation into how the messages could have ended up in the hands of the tabloid, led by longtime security consultant Gavin de Becker. De Becker told media that the leak was politically motivated.
'POLITICALLY MOTIVATED' 
In a blog post on Thursday, Bezos cited an email from AMI deputy general counsel, Jon Fine, to a lawyer representing de Becker. In it, AMI proposed a public acknowledgment from Bezos and de Becker that ""they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that (AMI's) coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.""
In return for such an acknowledgment, according to the email, AMI offered ""not to publish, distribute, share, or describe unpublished texts and photos,"" Bezos said.
Bezos said the statement AMI was proposing was false and described the offer as an ""extortionate proposal."" 
Bezos, Fine, and de Becker were not immediately available for comment. Amazon declined to comment. Shares of the world's largest online retailer were down 1.8 percent at $1,584.74.
Extortion typically involves an effort to obtain property, services, money or some other benefit by threatening violence, reputational harm or other injury, although definitions can vary across state and federal laws.
In Florida, where American Media is based, extortion includes maliciously threatening targets with disgrace, or to expose their secrets. In Washington state, where Amazon is based, it includes threatening to expose secrets that may subject targets to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or reveal information that the targets wanted to conceal.
Federal law defines extortion as someone seeking or actually obtaining ""property"" through the ""wrongful use"" of actual or threatened force, violence or fear. ""Property"" can be something of value not limited to a tangible object or money.
Elie Honig, a former prosecutor, argued in a column on CNN that the actions alleged by Bezos amounted to extortion because the act of stopping Bezos' investigation was of value to AMI and AMI's threat of exposing lurid photos met the ""wrongful"" test.
But criminal defense lawyer Page Pate said what AMI sought to gain from Bezos was ""too fuzzy"" and would not be enough to put them in violation of the non-prosecution deal. 
""I don't think there is a clear enough hook to show that what they wanted from Bezos was a thing of value,"" Pate said. 
On Friday, AMI said that at the time of Bezos' allegations it was ""in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him.""

""In light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary,"" it added.

The world's largest planemaker said in a filing that in 2018, it had recorded reach-forward losses of $736 million on the contract, reflecting higher estimated costs related to certification, flight testing and change incorporation on aircraft, among other things.
The U.S. Air Force recently accepted the long-delayed first delivery of the KC-46 tanker jet made by Boeing. Delivery means Boeing could begin to reverse what has been a steady stream of financial losses related to the KC-46 program, and a major public relations headache for Chicago-based aircraft manufacturer.
The delays and fixes for the program have been costly for Boeing and the company had recorded charges on the tanker program. 

The losses bring the total pre-tax cost of the program to $3.6 billion, or $2.4 billion after taxes, Boeing said.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Production at General Motors' Oshawa assembly plant in Canada came to a stop at about 12:30 p.m. EST (1730 GMT) on Friday, a spokesman said, after the U.S. automaker exhausted its supply of seats from Lear Corp, where workers are striking.
Over 200 workers at the feeder plant, which supplies seats for the cars and trucks assembled at Oshawa, did not work their day shift, but the next shift will start work at 2:30 p.m. EST (1930 GMT), said Local 222 President Colin James.
It was unclear if the output of both trucks and cars was affected, what impact the stoppage had on daily production, or when production would resume, said GM Canada spokesman David Paterson. 
The plant runs two truck shifts, but Paterson did not know if there would be adequate supplies for a second shift starting at 2:30 p.m. EST, or if that shift could be delayed until supplies arrived.
Oshawa produces about 250 Cadillac XTS and Chevrolet Impala cars daily, on one shift, and approximately 450 GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado trucks daily, on two shifts.
The strike at Lear, which has 350 unionized workers, is the latest measure in a Unifor campaign aimed at convincing GM to extend Oshawa production to September 2020, when the current contract expires. Under a broad restructuring announced in November, GM said it will close Oshawa by end-2019 and has repeatedly said it will not change that decision. 
The Oshawa plant operates on a just-in-time delivery system, keeping a limited supply of bulky commodities like seats on hand, said GM Canada spokeswoman Jennifer Wright.
Unifor represents 2,600 assembly-line workers at GM Oshawa and 1,800 workers at plants supplying GM's Oshawa operations.
""The message that we're sending is that it's not just about General Motors' workers. All the suppliers, including Lear Whitby, are impacted by a potential closure,"" James said.

This week, GM reported a market-beating quarterly profit, lifted by high-margin trucks and cost cutting. Large pickups, like the Silverado, generate at least $17,000 per vehicle in pre-tax profit, according to GM investor disclosures.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 01:50PM ET</span>","EU needs stronger anti-fraud curbs, lawmakers say, after Danske scandal","By Teis Jensen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The European Union needs tougher anti-fraud controls including a central body able to enforce laws against money laundering, European lawmakers said on Friday, describing financial crime as a security problem for the continent.
Curbs should be more uniform across the EU and its framework for swapping financial intelligence is inadequate and must improve, the European Parliament's tax crime committee added.
Europe has been hit by money laundering scandals in recent months, including a major one at Danske Bank's, the collapse of Latvia's ABLV Bank, the closure of Malta's Pilatus Bank and a 775 million euro fine imposed on Dutch lender ING.
The Financial Intelligence Units of many EU member states are ""clearly not up to the task"", committee chairman Petr Jezek told a news conference in Copenhagen.
""They do not have enough personnel or resources. In some countries their independence is also in question. This (proposed change) will certainly improve the situation,"" he said.
The committee has been in Estonia and Denmark this week to meet regulators, prosecutors and Danske Bank's new management to gather material for a report with proposals for new EU legislation to combat financial crime.
There has in the past been resistance from some member states against tougher and more centralized fraud controls, especially from those states that have worked as tax havens.
The recent scandals could however mean that those times are over, said committee spokesman Jeppe Kofod.
""Something is starting to happen,"" Kofod told Reuters on the sidelines of the news conference.
""Because everyone can see that, contrary to the United States, Europe has become the first destination for laundered crime money from Russia and other former Soviet Union states, and that is a problem for our security in Europe,"" he said.
Danske Bank is being investigated in Denmark, Estonia, Britain, United States, and from Thursday also France, over suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros ($228 billion) made through its tiny Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. 
The committee called for more direct EU regulation, instead of the current model where a so-called EU directive is implemented in each member state's own laws, with many different local practices as a consequence.
The lawmakers will also propose setting up a central EU body with powers to enforce anti money-laundering legislation in cooperation with national authorities.
EU governments reached a preliminary deal in December to clamp down on money laundering by strengthening bank supervision through the European Banking Authority (EBA).

Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) fell 5% after reporting fourth-quarter earnings of $1.33 on revenue of $1.39 billion, missing estimates compiled by Investing.com for earnings of $1.58 a share on revenue of $1.52 billion.
Sales during the crucial holiday period didn’t live up to expectations as the hit from the closure of Toys 'R' Us, one of the company's largest customers pre-bankruptcy, was worse than feared.
The poor performance comes amid growing concerns that tablets may soon usurp traditional toys as must-haves among children. But those fears are premature, even as Toys 'R' Us was sent to the toy graveyard, according to market researcher NPD Group.
The 2% decline in toy sales seen last year was ""a solid performance after such a significant shift in the retail landscape,"" according to Juli Lennett, vice president and industry advisor, for Toys at NPD Group.
Hasbro's slate of toys from blockbuster franchises for the coming year, including ""Star Wars,"" ""Frozen"" and Marvel's ""Avengers,"" offered a semblance of hope for market participants, as did its partnership with commercial behemoths like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
CFRA, an independent research provider, upgraded its rating on Hasbro to hold from sell, expressing optimism in the company's entertainment offerings, as well as the partnership with Amazon.
Rival toymaker Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) navigated the impact from the Toy 'R' Us collapse as strong sales of Barbie saw fourth-quarter earnings and revenue beat estimates compiled by Investing.com. Its shares soared 23%."

1566,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 12:39PM ET</span>",U.S. Steel wins tax breaks from one of America's poorest cities,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
GARY, Indiana (Reuters) - United States Steel Corporation founded Gary, Indiana in 1906 - naming it after co-founder Elbert Henry Gary - and the city's fortunes have been closely tied to the company ever since.
When the firm started losing business to cheap Asian imports in the 1970s, waves of layoffs followed as Gary became a haven of blight, crime and lost population.
Last year, the city harbored hopes for a revival after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on steel imports and the company planned a $750 million investment to modernize Gary Works, its largest North American plant. 
But it's now clear those hopes will not translate into new steel jobs, even after the city and state offered the firm a $47 million tax break package.
The whole point of the investment is to make the plant more efficient, so the incentives will help finance a project that city and company officials concede could ultimately result in job losses, not gains.
Gary's dimmed hopes for a tariff-driven renaissance underscore how the policy has so far provided a windfall for U.S. steel firms but only a marginal benefit to workers and struggling steel towns. 
Gary Works once employed more than 25,000 people but now supports only about 4,000 in a city that has seen its population plummet from 175,000 in 1970 to 77,000 today.
Steel industry employment nationwide increased by 1,000 jobs to 83,400 between March, when tariffs where imposed, and November, according to the latest available data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2t8sf4I )
In a statement to Reuters, Trump's Commerce Department called the 1.2 percent increase a ""welcome change from decades of decline and layoffs"" and said ""many more"" jobs would be created as planned industry investments and expansions are completed, without specifying how many.
""Improving efficiency is important and was one of the goals of the tariffs,"" a department spokesman said of the Gary investment. ""We are glad to see the American industry is making investments that will protect their long-term viability and ensure a strong domestic supply.""
The state of Indiana's investment of $10 million in tax credits, along with $2 million in worker training grants, comes with the condition that U.S. Steel retain at least 3,875 jobs at Gary Works. But a state spokesperson declined comment on whether the company could still collect part of the incentives if the number of jobs falls below that threshold.
The city would get no guarantees of job retention for its bigger and longer-term commitment of property tax breaks, a benefit estimated at $35 million over 25 years. The details of both deals are still being finalized, officials said.
U.S. Steel Vice President Douglas Matthews acknowledged the modernization would cut costs and reliance on manual labor. Productivity improvements would likely results in a ""decreasing headcount over time,"" he said. 
But without the investment, ""then the business is at risk, and then you put all the jobs at risk,"" Matthews said in an interview.
U.S. Steel declined to comment about why it needed tax breaks to make its investment viable and declined to provide details about its negotiations with the city.
U.S. Steel's 2018 profits shot up to $1.12 billion, from $387 million the previous year. The tariff-driven windfall has allowed the company to spend $300 million buying back its own stock. (GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Hqle9h )
Investors remain skeptical of the company's longer-term gains from tariffs, however. Despite recent gains after strong earnings, U.S. Steel's stock is down 51 percent since March 1, when Trump announced he would impose steel tariffs.
That's in part because company's underlying weaknesses remain largely unaddressed: It has among the highest production costs in the world, according to data compiled by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Its revenue per employee pales in comparison with that of rival steelmaker  Nucor  Corp (NYSE:NUE). And domestic steel prices, after rising with tariffs, are now drifting down amid rising supplies and slowing demand.
DESPERATE FOR INVESTMENT
Gary officials say the factory investment would bring the city about $1 million in new tax revenue, even after Gary allows the company to pay only half the property taxes associated with the upgrade. That will help close a city budget deficit of $14 million, they say, while giving some assurance that company won't abandon Gary entirely.
The harsh realities of life in Gary make it easier to understand why officials would cut whatever deal they can to keep U.S. Steel. About a third of its citizens live in poverty, and the city has long had among the nation's highest murder rates. A fifth of its homes and half of commercial properties are vacant or abandoned. (GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2S2xH7d )
For Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson, the incentives for U.S. Steel help ensure the city can retain its largest employer and taxpayer while providing an opportunity to re-engage the company in Gary's civic life.
""When you see an investment of this magnitude, then you see that there is a plan for a continued presence here,"" she said.
When the company shut down its coke plant at Gary Works four years ago, laying off hundreds of workers, the city feared the worst for the facility. Around the same time, Gary had watched the company idle most operations at its Granite City steel plant just outside of St. Louis.
Trump's tariffs prompted U.S. Steel to hire back about 800 of those Granite City workers last year after restarting two furnaces there. But there's no such hiring plans for Gary.
City and union leaders here have accepted a lower headcount as a fait accompli. The company has already eliminated 140 maintenance jobs on the west side of the plant since 2015, said Mark Lash, president of United Steelworkers Local 1066, which represents about 1,400 workers at the plant.
The city has had its own layoffs of maintenance workers - shedding 128 of 150 of them between 2006 and 2011. It has been managing with 22 staffers for the past eight years. New spending and hiring are frozen, and city buildings are being sold to raise funds.
LIMITED IMPACT
Public financing of corporate investments is hardly uncommon but is more typically tied to company commitments to create new jobs that boost the local economy.
Gary's deal with U.S. Steel is more like the 2016 deal Indiana cut with United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX) with the help of public pressure on the company from Trump. The firm agreed to retain at least 1,069 workers at its Carrier unit in Indianapolis instead of moving the jobs to Mexico, a deal that also included no new hires.
But the proposed Gary deal is much more expensive: While the state gave $7 million in tax breaks to United Technologies compared to the $47 the city and state have offered U.S. Steel.
Carrier has since laid off about 550 workers in two rounds of cuts, but has said it would maintain 1,100 workers.
Michael Hicks, a professor of Economics at Indiana's Ball State University, has examined the impact of such tax breaks on the state's public finances in the last decade. His study found that state incentives costing about $30,000 per job provided little benefit to Indiana's economy or tax base.
Hicks said the tax deal with U.S. Steel is not so expensive by comparison, costing an estimated $12,129 per job retained. 
But it's not a good deal, either, especially given the limited economic impact, Hicks said.

""It is a fifty percent tax cut for U.S. Steel to stay in Gary,"" Hicks said. ""This deal is not going to make people move to the city. This is not going to cause a population growth and employment opportunities.""

1567,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 12:37PM ET</span>",German banks maneuver in Washington to temper Russia sanction risk,"By Tom Sims and John O'Donnell
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German banks are seeking to blunt any fresh U.S. sanctions against Russia so they can continue existing business with Russian clients, according to an internal briefing paper prepared by a financial industry lobby group.
The risk of new restrictions on doing business with Russia has risen since the Democratic Party won control of the U.S. House of Representatives. New anti-Moscow measures could jeopardize funding for a multi-billion dollar gas pipeline between Germany and Russia.
In response, lenders in Europe's largest economy have ratcheted up their lobbying efforts with U.S. lawmakers and government officials, warning that current proposals to sanction major Russian banks would be so expansive that they could disrupt global markets.
""In their current form, the proposed bills would no longer just target the Russian President and oligarchs with close ties to Putin, but would effectively place an embargo against the Russian Federation,"" according to an extract from the document prepared by the Association of German Banks.
""International financial institutions which already operate in Russia would face new sanctions with massive business and compliance challenges.”
The three-page paper calls for exceptions to be made which would allow ""German banks and companies to complete business that cannot be unwound easily"".
The document, dated Dec. 3 2018, outlines key points for bankers to raise with U.S. officials. It reflects the consensus view of the association, which represents 180 banks, including  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and foreign lenders with units in Germany, such as Italy's Unicredit (MI:CRDI).
The 9.5 billion euro($10.78 billion) Nord Stream 2 project, which seeks to channel gas from Russia directly to Germany under the Baltic Sea, is not mentioned in the document but its future lies at the heart of the renewed lobbying push.
""Nord Stream is the elephant in the room,"" said one person with direct knowledge of the matter.
The pipeline project, which is majority owned by Russian energy giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), plans to tap lenders this year, a spokesman for Nord Stream 2 told Reuters. He did not comment on the risk of new sanctions. 
Russian news agency TASS quoted Nord Stream 2’s finance chief Paul Corcoran saying it was in discussions with export credit agencies and wanted to raise around 6 billion euros.
But lenders will not want to run afoul of any U.S. sanctions. 
German companies are already coming under pressure to distance themselves from Nord Stream. U.S. President Donald Trump has said the pipeline will make Germany ""captive"" to Russia and last month, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany sent a letter to companies involved in Nord Stream warning that they could face sanctions if they stick with it.
Gazprom declined to comment.
A RICOCHET EFFECT
Last month, Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told companies his government would try to protect them from potentially ""massive collateral damage"" if Washington levies further restrictions on Russia.
Almost five years of U.S. and European sanctions, imposed after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, have already damaged economic ties between Germany and Russia.
Trade between the two countries was worth 57 billion euros in the first 11 months of last year, more than Germany's trade with Japan and Canada combined but a way off the 71 billion euros recorded in the same period of 2013, the year before a wave of sanctions was introduced.
German banks are still among the most exposed international lenders to Russia with outstanding claims of nearly $7 billion in the third quarter of 2018, according to figures from the Bank for International Settlements, but that is less than a third of the $22.5 billion recorded for the same period in 2013.
The newly elected U.S. congress is expected to move swiftly to bring new sanctions against Moscow.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham introduced a bill in August called the ""Defending American Security from Kremlin Aggression Act"", which proposes sanctions against big Russian banks and the country's energy sector.
The German bankers' attempt to moderate such moves comes at a delicate time for the country's largest lender, Deutsche Bank. It faces renewed scrutiny from Congress over its most prominent customer – President Donald Trump – and its own past dealings with Russia.
Deutsche declined to comment on its role in any lobbying 
Martin Zielke, the chief executive of Commerzbank, Germany’s second-largest listed bank, has met with Treasury officials and members of Congress in recent months to argue for leniency, according to two Washington-based sources.
Commerzbank declined to comment. Both it and Deutsche Bank have subsidiaries in Russia with a combined workforce of more than 1,000 employees.
Further entreaties are expected to be made by top German bank executives in the run-up to April, when finance officials and bankers gather for the annual Spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund IMF and World Bank in Washington DC.
Senator Chris Van Hollen told Reuters in a telephone interview he planned to reintroduce a Russian sanctions bill in the coming months, or even sooner.
The Democrat, who this week called for a Senate investigation of allegations of money laundering involving Deutsche Bank, said that sanctions should be designed to limit ""to the extent possible, any ricochet on European banks and others.""
""However, there is usually going to be some fallout and some repercussions for European banks given that there are these relationships,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Barclays  (LON:BARC) is shifting some jobs in its London-based credit and equity derivatives sales teams to Paris as it reorganizes its operations ahead of Brexit, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Last month the bank warned staff in charge of credit and equity derivatives sales for the Nordics that their jobs would be relocated to Paris by the end of March, giving them just two months' notice, one of the sources said.
A spokesman for Barclays declined to comment.
The likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has increased substantially since British Prime Minister Theresa May's plan for maintaining ties with the EU was rejected on Jan. 15 by the UK parliament as well as by many politicians in her own Conservative Party.
Many financial institutions have started putting Brexit contingency plans into action and moving staff to newly leased offices in Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin and other financial hubs on the continent.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said on Friday that it had begun relocating some jobs to Paris, with staff moving in to a new 11,000 square meter office in the eighth arrondissement, near the Elysee Palace. 
The French government has been actively seeking to convince banks to move jobs to Paris, introducing tax incentives and pledging to open more English-language schools for bankers' children.
Barclays has made Ireland its main post-Brexit EU banking hub, and got court approval last week to move 190 billion euros ($215 billion) of assets from Britain to its Dublin subsidiary.
A source familiar with the moves said only ""a relatively small number of people"" would relocate to Paris as well as other EU centers and that decisions had to be fast-tracked after Theresa May's historic defeat on her Brexit deal in Parliament on Jan. 15.
Britain's financial services industry has so far emerged largely unscathed from the build-up to Brexit, with only about 2,000 roles expected to have moved or been created overseas even as the risk of a disorderly exit grows, a Reuters survey showed. 
Most bankers remain confident a compromise deal between Britain and the EU will be hammered out. They are waiting to see what will be agreed and what the relationship will be, before making any final decisions about relocations.

Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) stock soared midday after it announced its battle royal game “Apex Legends” attracted 10 million players in 72 hours.
Shares of EA jumped about 13%, making it the leader, and one of the few stocks in the green, in the S&P Communications Services index, which was down about 0.4%.
“Apex Legends” was created by EA division Respawn Entertainment and is designed to compete with other multiplayer battle-royal games, where the standard bearer is “Fortnite.”
“In 72 hours, over 10 million players have jumped into Apex Legends and we’ve breached 1 million concurrent players!” Respawn CEO Vince Zampella wrote on EA.com.
“We knew it would be risky to take the franchise in this direction, to go free to play, and do a surprise launch,” Zampella said. “But we fell in love with Apex Legends and wanted, needed, other people to play it too.”
By comparison, Fortnite reported a peak concurrent player level of 8.3 million, according to Engadget. 
EA shares tumbled when it reported quarterly results that missed on revenue and guided earnings and revenue below consensus for its fiscal fourth quarter on Tuesday.

Volkswagen has paid out more than 27 billion euros ($31 billion) in penalties for using illegal software to disguise excessive levels of pollution from its diesel cars, triggering a global regulatory clampdown that has now reached Bosch. 
""It is correct that the Public Prosecutor's Office of Stuttgart has opened monetary fine proceedings against Robert Bosch GmbH,"" a spokesman for the company said in a statement on Friday.
""The proceedings relate to the investigations against employees of Robert Bosch GmbH in connection with the use of allegedly manipulated software in control units of diesel vehicles,"" Bosch added.
German prosecutors last year fined Volkswagen 1 billion euros and its sister brand Audi 800 million euros for management oversight lapses which allowed polluting cars to hit the road. 
German weekly magazine Der Spiegel reported on Friday that Volkswagen was reviewing whether to seek damages of up to 1 billion euros from Bosch. Volkswagen declined to comment on the report.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Prominent short seller Carson Block is saying that medical device company Inogen Inc has inflated the size of its markets and expects the stock price to fall.
Block, whose research firm Muddy Waters is best known for targeting the shares of China-based companies, has written a new report that asserts that Inogen's management has made overly optimistic growth forecasts.
The company's stock fell 6.2 percent Friday morning to $131.07. It had climbed steadily to as high as $282.92 in September.
Calls to the company's media relations and investor relations departments seeking comment were not returned.
Muddy Waters is short Inogen Inc because it question's Inogen's statements about total addressable market (TAM) size and potential growth, the report seen by Reuters said.
Inogen has a market capitalization of $3 billion and makes lightweight portable oxygen concentrators that free its users from being tethered to heavy tanks.
While the company has said the U.S. TAM is roughly 3 million users and is growing at 7 percent to 10 percent a year, Block said the real U.S. TAM is far smaller at about 1.3 million, citing Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) data. He also said CMS data shows that the oxygen therapy market has been shrinking. He wrote that Inogen based its estimates on data from Wintergreen Research.
""The key to INGN's extreme multiple is its blue sky story,"" the report said. 
Block sees more room for it to fall, arguing that ""INGN will hit peak sales as soon as this year, and likely no later than next."" Block wrote in the report ""At our forecast of peak earnings, we value INGN at $46 per share, a 67 percent decrease
from its current price.""
Block ranks among the industry's most closely followed short-sellers, who seek to make money when a stock price falls. Some occasionally publish research reports detailing what they consider to be wrong with a company.
Dedicated short-sellers like Block, whose fund oversees roughly $210 million, tend to manage small amounts of money and often face uphill battles when the stock market is zooming higher.
Last year when Block published three reports, including one on Chinese tutoring company TAL Education Group, his fund earned 20 percent after fees. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 4.4 percent and the activist investors on average lost 11.25 percent.
Block, who trained as a lawyer but started his career as an equity analyst, distributed his research for free for years and said it took him years to create his hedge fund, which was launched in 2016.

AT&T customers were seeing ""5G E"" logo on their mobile devices in over 400 markets. Even though users are still on 4G network, AT&T is calling it 5G Evolution, Sprint said in the lawsuit. 
5G can offer data speeds up to 50 or 100 times faster than 4G networks. 
Smartphones running on both Android and Apple's iOS platforms are sporting ""5G E"" for AT&T customers, even though those phones are not equipped to support 5G.
Sprint said that a survey showed 54 percent of AT&T's consumers believed their ""5G E"" network is the same as or better than a 5G network and 43 percent said if they buy an AT&T phone today, it would be capable of running on 5G.
""We will fight this lawsuit while continuing to deploy 5G Evolution in addition to standards-based mobile 5G. Customers want and deserve to know when they are getting better speeds,"" AT&T said in response to the lawsuit.
5G Evolution and the 5GE indicator let customers know when their device is in an area where speeds up to twice as fast as standard LTE are available, AT&T said.
AT&T's Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson said in an interview https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1093877514638888961 with CNBC that the company's customers are seeing an increase in speed and performance on the ""5G E"" network and this is a step required to get to ""ultimate 5G"".

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 10:35AM ET</span>","Explainer: Germany, France face hurdles in push to rewrite EU antitrust rules","By Foo Yun Chee, Andreas Rinke and Leigh Thomas
BRUSSELS/BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Germany and France want to overhaul EU mergers rules following the European Commission's veto of efforts by Siemens and  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) to create a European rail champion to compete with larger foreign rivals.
This is why they want change, and the hurdles ahead:
WHAT FRANCE WANTS
The French want a broader definition of relevant markets, recognition that markets are not set in stone but evolve quickly, and powers for EU ministers to override a Commission decision.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire says this broader approach would go hand-in-hand with an already planned increase in vetting of foreign investment to protect Europe's key industrial assets, and also with a more muscular trade policy. 
The aim is to have joint Franco-German proposals by the end of March. Le Maire will discuss the issue with German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier when he visits Germany on Feb. 19.
GERMANY'S VIEWS
Altmaier set out his National Industry Strategy 2030 on Tuesday, saying a revamp at German and EU level was necessary to allow businesses to compete fairly at an international level.
Germany wants regulators to take a global view of markets, take into account rivals backed by state financial and political support and give veto power to the European Council -- that is the leaders of member states.
    Germany's pivot to a more defensive industrial policy is driven by concerns in Berlin about foreign -- particularly Chinese - companies acquiring its know-how and eroding the manufacturing base on which much of its wealth is built.
    Altmaier and Le Maire want to work on reforming EU competition law in the coming three months, before European Parliament elections in May.
    The German government has set up an expert commission which will come up with reforms proposals by autumn. The goal is to push the overhaul during country's EU presidency in the second half of 2020. 
WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE OF EU MERGER RULES?
Drafted in 1989 and revised in 2004, the European Commission rules ensure that mergers will not significantly reduce competition and push up consumer prices in the 28-country bloc. Regulators have three options: clear the deal, block it or wave it through with concessions.
Complainants can appeal decisions at Europe's top courts in Luxembourg. The EU model has been replicated in a number of Asian countries including China, Africa and parts of South America.
EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager points out the Commission has blocked only nine deals http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-19-889_en.htm over the past decade, giving more than 3,000 the green light. 
HOW DO RULES DIFFER ELSEWHERE?
In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice share the job but the procedures differ from the EU. The principle is to stop deals which substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly.
The U.S. model is common in the Americas and several Asian countries such as South Korea. 
In China, the Anti-Monopoly Bureau at the State Administration of Industry and Commerce is responsible for regulating and enforcing merger control. Critics say China regulates mergers as part of its industrial policy to boost economic growth.
WHO HAS TO APPROVE CHANGES TO EU MERGER RULES?
All EU countries have to agree to the changes. The European Parliament also has to give its consent.
OTHER TOOLS TO DEAL WITH UNFAIR FOREIGN COMPETITION

Vestager says beefing up global rules on subsidies and trade defense instruments, controlling foreign investments, strengthening public procurement rules to ensure mutual access to markets and reinforcing data protection and privacy rules should be part of the tool kit.

1585,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 10:35AM ET</span>","Brazil farmers halt soy sales as real strengthens, China buys U.S. supplies","By Ana Mano
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Farmers have halted sales of Brazil's soybeans as port premiums swooned, the real currency strengthened and a pause in a trade war prompted top importer China to purchase soy from the United States, growers and trading companies said.
Poor market conditions are also affecting planting decisions for Brazil's 2019/2020 crop that will be sown starting from September. Farmers generally buy inputs like seeds and fertilizers through barter arrangements with traders, used as a form of credit until the crop is harvested, and such deals are way behind schedule, farmers and companies said.
""The market is stalled,"" said a soy buyer representing a large trading firm in Mato Grosso, Brazil's top soy-producing state, who asked for anonymity to speak freely. 
Unlike other years, grain handlers did not launch barter campaigns in December attempting to lock in farmer's 2019/20 harvests, as prices for imported fertilizers rose and locally priced soybeans fell on a stronger real, the buyer said.
Mato Grosso, which will collect an estimated 32 million tonnes of soybeans this season, still has not sold about half of its 2018/2019 output. 
""Spot sales slowed as farmers await better prices,"" soy grower Cayron Giacomelli said by telephone. At the same time forward sales are hampered by trade war uncertainties, he added. 
Growers have sold about at 46.6 percent of Mato Grosso's estimated output for this season, according to farmer-backed state research institute Imea, below a 49.9 percent five-year average.
The situation bodes ill for the entire supply chain as farmers displeased with margins tend to hold out and pressure transport, trading and fertilizer firms to cut their own margins.
Soybean exports are also below expectations in early 2019 given how advanced the harvesting is, said Frederico Humberg, founder of AgriBrasil, a fast-growing grain origination firm in São Paulo.
Humberg said China's return to the U.S. soy market after a truce in the trade war slashed Brazil's port premiums and hindered a potential rise in local soy prices. Farmer hoarding is also keeping a lid on freight prices, he said.
""Price-wise, this is a pessimistic scenario for farmers,"" Humberg said, arguing high U.S. soy inventories tend to continue to constrain Chicago. 
Grain grower association Aprosoja said the trade war is bad for local farmers because their benchmark is Chicago and the spat left U.S. soy silos filled to the brim.
As harvesting progresses over the next 20 days, Brazilian farmers who lack storage space may be forced to sell, according to Daniel Latorraca, Imea superintendent. 

""Whatever is left in storage will only be sold after the peak of the season around June,"" he said.

Representatives of the EU's 28 nations endorsed a last ditch German and French proposal to amend some of the language of the new rules on how to regulate the pipeline project.
The two major European powers, which both have energy firms invested in the new gas link across the Baltic Sea, were publicly at odds ahead of the EU meeting.
The initial proposal would extend the EU's internal energy market laws to offshore gas pipelines under construction, giving it a say over how the pipeline is operated.
Diplomatic sources had said that Germany had pressured other European capitals to block the new directive.
Former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is chairman of Nord Stream's shareholders committee. 
In its current form, Nord Stream 2, being built by Russian state energy firm Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), would not comply with tougher new rules foreseen for new infrastructure projects.
The newer draft, seen by Reuters, suggests Berlin is looking to take the lead on authorizing the pipeline, which will run from Russia directly to Germany.
""The aim of the proposal is ... to clarify that the mentioned rules refer to the territory and the territorial sea of the member state concerned,"" the proposal states, adding that refers to the first point of connection with the grid.
EU sources said the proposed changes would make it more difficult and expensive to build the pipeline but would permit it to go ahead.
Any delay in building the pipeline would create uncertainty for Gazprom's partners: Germany's Uniper and BASF's Wintershall unit, Anglo-Dutch firm Shell (LON:RDSa), Austria's OMV and France's Engie.
The EU is divided over in the project.

Eastern European, Nordic and Baltic Sea countries see the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline increasing EU reliance on Moscow, while those in northern Europe, especially Germany, prioritize the economic benefits.

Days of talks at the Mining Indaba in Cape Town - Africa's premier mining investment conference - yielded no tangible breakthrough between the miners and governments increasingly keen to reassert control over their natural resources.
Copper and cobalt reserves are giving nations such as Zambia and Democratic Republic of Congo confidence because of the difficulty in finding supplies elsewhere to meet the expected surge in demand. This has emboldened them to seek higher tax revenues from foreign mining companies.
Mark Bristow, CEO of the newly enlarged Barrick Gold, emerged this week as the big miners' most prominent voice, holding meeting after meeting with mining ministers, culminating in a grand dinner on Wednesday night. 
But Bristow declined to be drawn on when he might get a deal in the toughest jurisdictions of Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania, whose governments are demanding terms the international mining companies say are untenable. 
""You can't negotiate with a deadline, especially in Africa,"" he told reporters. The challenge, he said, was to avoid undoing decades of progress as international lenders start calling in loan repayments, piling the pressure on nations, such as indebted Zambia, and populist governments make sweeping promises to their electorates. 
""Everyone has a responsibility to ensure the progress we have seen since the end of the Cold War across sub-Saharan Africa,"" he told Reuters. 
""One of the biggest challenges right round the globe is populism and people hanging on to power by promising things that are improbable when it comes to delivering. That puts a lot of stress on a lot of things."" 
Bristow has however made clear he is prepared to get rid of less profitable assets, which may be in Africa. 
After Zambia announced new mining taxes, Barrick said it was considering all options for its Lumwana copper mine there because the changes would make it hard to generate adequate returns.
NEW TAXES
Zambia says it is open to discussions but will enforce the new taxes to maximize earnings from its own resources.
While Bristow has been the big miners' most audible representative in Cape Town, nations rich in mineral resources were represented by Nana Akufo-Addo, president of Ghana, Africa's biggest gold producer after South Africa.
He said countries such as his had ""come of age"" and international companies should no longer expect to be given unusual tax advantages in return for the right to mine.
""The people of Africa do not have to be poor for others to be rich,"" he said.
But as far as the miners are concerned, Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania are demanding far too much. 
Gold miner Acacia, majority-owned by Barrick, is in talks with the Tanzanian government over a $190 billion tax claim.
Tanzania sent no senior officials to the Indaba. And Congo stuck to its guns.
On stage with Bristow during a panel on Congo's new mining code, the secretary-general for mines, Joseph Ikoli, said that, while the government was always open to discussions with its partners, the law, now approved, cannot be changed. 
Doing so would require sending it back to parliament, and analysts believe the law's popularity with the Congolese people make rolling it back politically unpalatable.
In the light of these difficulties, miners said it would take years to re-establish trust, and investment would be driven away for decades. Industry would look for ways to make electric vehicles without cobalt, for example, because so much of it is concentrated in Congo.
""If you look at a map of Africa, the mines are not necessarily built where the best geology is,"" said Daniel Betts, managing director of west African gold miner Hummingbird. Instead, they tend to be built where there is political stability.
Many of the African governments remain confident, however, that companies will not go elsewhere, especially once they have already invested heavily in mines.
Asked about foreign companies' complaints that their business would be damaged by Zambia's tax changes, Zambia's Mining Minister Richard Musukwa was dismissive.
""They are always cry babies,"" he said.
However, other African nations in need of the kind of infrastructure development and employment big corporations can provide are offering tempting terms.
Ethiopia, for example, is rolling out pro-business reforms after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed swept into office nearly a year ago.

The nation's Mines and Petroleum Minister Samuel Urkato said promoting the mining sector had become a priority and indicated further tax incentives were likely.

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 08:03AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. considers withdrawal of zero tariffs for India - sources,"By Sanjeev Miglani and Neha Dasgupta
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India could lose a vital U.S. trade concession, under which it enjoys zero tariffs on $5.6 billion of exports to the United States, amid a widening dispute over its trade and investment policies, people with close knowledge of the matter said.
A move to withdraw the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) from India, the world’s largest beneficiary of a scheme that has been in force since the 1970s, would be the strongest punitive action against India since President Donald Trump took office in 2017 vowing to reduce the U.S. deficit with large economies. 
Trump has repeatedly called out India for its high tariffs. 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has courted foreign investment as part of his Make-in-India campaign to turn India into a manufacturing hub and deliver jobs to the millions of youth entering the workforce.
Trump, for his part, has pushed for U.S. manufacturing to return home as part of his Make America Great Again campaign.
The trigger for the latest downturn in trade ties was India’s new rules on e-commerce that restrict the way Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart-backed Flipkart do business in a rapidly growing online market set to touch $200 billion by 2027.
That, coming on top of a drive to force global card payments companies such as Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) to move their data to India and the imposition of higher tariffs on electronic products and smartphones, left a broader trade package the two sides were working on through last year in tatters. 
The GSP was tied to the trade package and since that deal had slipped further away, the United States was considering withdrawing or scaling back the preferential arrangement, people familiar with the matter said. 
The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) was completing a review of India’s status as a GSP beneficiary and an announcement was expected over the next two weeks, they said.
""(The two sides) were trying to sort out the trade package, but were not able to actually finish the deal. In the meantime these other things, data localization and e-commerce, have come along,"" one of them said. ""In a sense its like someone has rained on the parade.""
India and the United States have developed close political and security ties. But bilateral trade, which stood at $126 billion in 2017, is widely seen to be performing at nearly a quarter of its potential. 
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is due in New Delhi next week where he is expected to raise concerns about the e-commerce policy and data localization, officials said. 
VARIOUS NEW POLICIES
New Indian rules announced in December for the e-commerce sector banned companies such as Amazon and Flipkart from striking exclusive deals with sellers, restricted their ability to offer discounts and barred them from selling products via vendors in which they have an equity interest.
The move disrupted product listings on Amazon's India website and forced it to change its business structures. Amazon and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), as well as the U.S. government, had lobbied against the move, Reuters reported earlier.
The new rules, coming ahead of a general election, were seen as a bid by Modi to placate small traders, who had for years complained about business practices of large e-commerce players.
They form a key voter base for Modi who is facing a tightening election in the next few months.
The idea of the policy was to foster healthy competition and promote India’s e-commerce, an Indian government official involved in trade issues said, defending the curbs on the big firms.
But companies disagree and decry such sudden policy changes.
""These types of actions can really put a negative view on India as an investment destination,"" one of the sources said.
India last year also announced proposals to force foreign companies to store more of their user data locally, in a bid to better conduct legal investigations. U.S. lobby groups had voiced concerns about those proposals too, saying they made it difficult for companies to do business in the country.
POSSIBLE INDIA SETBACK
If the United States eliminates duty-free access for about 2,000 Indian product lines, it will mostly hurt small businesses such as jewelry, said one of the sources. The number of goods qualifying for preferential treatment could be reduced, or the whole program could be withdrawn.
There was no response to a request for comment from the USTR or the U.S. Embassy. India's trade ministry also did not answer questions emailed to them about trade differences with the United States.
But an Indian government official briefed on the trade discussions said the trade package under which the two sides were negotiating better access to each other's farm and dairy markets was unlikely until the elections in India this spring. 
Talks on U.S. demands to relax India's decision to cap prices of medical devices made in the United States had also got stuck, the official said. 
""The list of grievances is getting bigger, now with e-commerce added in,"" he said.

India fears Trump may demand a free trade agreement if both sides fail to reach a compromise on the trade package. Such a pact would mean zero tariffs for U.S. goods arriving in India, further threatening local industry.

1593,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 07:58AM ET</span>",Activist Elliott tells Pernod there is still work to do,"By Dominique Vidalon and Sudip Kar-Gupta
PARIS (Reuters) - Activist investor Elliott kept up the pressure on French spirits group  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), welcoming this week's first-half results but calling for boardroom changes and better margins.
Elliott, which has built a stake of just over 2.5 percent in Pernod Ricard, has called on the family-backed group to raise profit margins to bring them more into line with British rival  Diageo  (LON:DGE).
Elliott has suggested 500 million euros ($565 million) in cost cuts and options such as merging with another spirits company.
The hedge fund, which has become increasingly active in Europe in recent years, issued a statement on Friday after Pernod's results this week when the group raised its profit growth outlook for 2018-2019 and unveiled new margin goals in a three-year strategy plan.
""Pernod's half-year earnings announcement confirmed the strong growth potential and solid financial performance of the company. It also reflected a first small step in starting to address the company's shortcomings in operational efficiency,"" Elliott said.
Last month, Pernod Ricard took a step towards improving its governance, naming Patricia Barbizet to the newly created role of lead independent director.
Nevertheless, Elliott on Friday made clear it wanted more.
""Necessary enhancements to the company's board and corporate governance have yet to be addressed,"" Elliott said.
FAMILY TIES
Chief Executive Alexandre Ricard, 46-year-old grandson of the firm's founder, made sales growth his top priority when he took over in 2015 and has defended his long-term value strategy.
Elliott has blamed Pernod's underperformance in part on what it views as poor governance, having highlighted that Pernod's 15-member board needs more diversity and independence, since many directors are linked to the Ricard family.
One indicator of the family's influence, which was controversial, was double-voting rights at Pernod Ricard, a source familiar with the situation said. Most French companies have a two-year period before an investor can get these rights while at Pernod Ricard it is 10 years, restricting the influence of outsiders.
Elliott also said Pernod's targeted savings of 100 million euros and a margin step-up of 50-60 basis points per year over the next three years were ""modest goals"" for a company of its size.
Liberum analysts, which had hoped for a margin step up of some 150 basis points, also called Pernod's plan a ""a bit soft"".
Pernod shares traded 0.6 percent lower by 1115 GMT.
A spokesman for Pernod Ricard told Reuters that its first-half results this week showed how its strategy was working, and that Pernod ""remains focused on executing its strategy plan while continuing a regular dialogue with all its shareholders"".

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 07:50AM ET</span>",Roadblocks circle Ramaphosa's plan to fix South Africa's Eskom,"By Alexander Winning and Joe Brock
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's plan to split struggling state power utility Eskom is a positive show of intent to investors but a lack of detail has raised market concerns that concrete change will take years to deliver.
Eskom, which produces over 90 percent of South Africa's electricity and employs 48,000 people, is a lynchpin of Africa's most developed economy but is drowning in $31 billion of debt.
Facing a parliamentary election on May 8, Ramaphosa said on Thursday that to avert an economic crisis, Eskom's generation, transmission and distribution businesses would become separate entities.
Crucially, Ramaphosa added that the newly created units would remain under an Eskom holding company, meaning its inefficient and unwieldy monopoly would remain. 
He also said another Eskom bailout would be laid out in the budget later this month.
What markets were hoping for was the creation of three independent companies that could more easily cut costs, raise finance and be partially privatized in the future.
Most Eskom dollar-denominated bonds eased very slightly on Friday, with the 2028 bond softening 0.1 cent to trade at 103.22 cents in the dollar. However, Eskom's bonds had chalked up stellar gains in previous weeks, with many issues seeing their best monthly gains on record.
""The risk is very little will change in this structure,"" said Peter Attard Montalto, head of capital markets research at Intellidex.
""The intention may well be to have this as a first step and then separate out after that from the umbrella. However, we think the market underestimates how complex this separation process will be,"" he added, forecasting it could take two years.
MAY ELECTION
Even if Ramaphosa intends eventually to create independent units that could be partly sold off, he will face fierce resistance from left-wing elements of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and powerful trade unions.
The ANC is expected to win May's election but Ramaphosa will need the support of a united ruling party and union allies if he is to deliver the decisive victory that would give him a mandate to push through unpopular, but much-needed, reforms.
The two largest unions at Eskom, who say they account for half of the utility's workforce, said on Friday they would fight Ramaphosa's plan, with one calling it a ""war"".
In the short term, Ramaphosa will need to raise Eskom's revenues and cut its debt if he is to delay inevitable job cuts until after the election. That means tariff increases and bailouts that are toxic with voters.
""I agree with Mr. President that we need drastic action, but we can't be paying for them screwing up all the time,"" said Thokozane, a taxi driver in Johannesburg.
""If they have to cut jobs, it is sad, but we can't go on year after year with these bailouts and tariffs.""
Ramaphosa is also trying to hold together the ANC to avoid the fate of his scandal-plagued predecessor Jacob Zuma, whom he ousted a year ago in a bitter internal battle.
""PROXY WAR""
The anti-apartheid liberation movement remains deeply divided between socialist and reformist elements, and Ramaphosa faces resistance from a powerful pro-Zuma faction.
A task team formed by Ramaphosa to create a reform program for Eskom recommended more market-friendly policies than were announced, however a backlash from left-wing members of his cabinet saw the plans diluted, an ANC source said.
""Ramaphosa's opponents will be obstructing him every step of the way with his plan for Eskom,"" said Darias Jonker, director for Africa at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.
""This is yet another proxy war involving entrenched interests linked to the Zuma faction in the ANC.""
It is likely Ramaphosa will avoid major job cuts at Eskom until after the election, while the details of restructuring could be delayed so as not to rile allies, analysts say.
But with Eskom expected to lose more than $1 billion a year this year and next, there is only so long Ramaphosa can delay reforms without risking economic malaise, investor departure and credit rating downgrades.
""The Eskom issue needs a clear resolution, and we did not get that yesterday,"" said Jonas David, strategist at Swiss bank UBS.
""Eskom is a big concern for us.""

LONDON (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Friday he was in talks with banks about their future and called reports of a merger of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) ""speculation"".
Media reports have said Germany would want a merger of its two main banks to go through before European Parliament elections in May.
Scholz said he couldn't imagine what the elections have to do with the banking sector and was speculation that he could not understand.
""The truth is we are discussing the situation of the financial industry in Germany, it's the task of our government,"" Scholz told a Bloomberg event in London.
""We are discussing about clearing, we discuss about the development of the banking sector. We are debating whether the different banks, about their situation, for being able to do the necessary things when something needs to be done.""
""Today is not a situation where it's necessary to report anything,"" Scholz said.
There was ""no debate"" about a setting up a bad bank to hold souring loans of lenders.
Deutsche is considered one of the most important banks for the global financial system, along with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). 
But Deutsche has been plagued by three years of losses, ratings downgrades, failed stress tests, and money laundering scandals. Commerzbank is still partially held by government after a bailout.
""There are two banks, they are doing anything to get enough profits. We are discussing with them about the situation of the banking industry in Germany,"" Scholz said.
A stable banking system is needed to underpin German companies who want to go abroad to export, he said. It was important to have both international and national banks operating in Germany to serve the economy.
""It's important to have a strong banking sector to do what national champions are doing and able to do.""
HARD BREXIT-PROOF
WirtschaftsWoche magazine cited an unnamed source on Friday saying Berlin and Brussels would decide on a potential merger between before the next EU elections in May.
WirtschaftsWoche said Germany and the EU needed to coordinate on the matter because a potential merger could entail action by the German state which could be seen as state aid.
Britain is set to leave the European Union on March 29, but has so far not agreed a divorce settlement with the bloc to ensure a smooth and orderly departure.
Scholz said nobody would have expected that it would still be unclear what sort of Brexit deal there will be just two months before Britain is due to leave the bloc.
""In the end we have to find a solution,"" Scholz said.
Many of the banks that use London as their EU hub have opened or expanded units in Frankfurt, Paris and elsewhere to avoid disruption from any hard Brexit or limited access to the single market in future.
""It's obvious there will be a lot of business that moves to the EU,"" Scholz said of the financial services sector, adding that Germany was prepared for a no-deal Brexit.
""Looking at the financial sector, I am absolutely sure that we will be able to manage all the questions related to that,"" Scholz said.

""There will be a different landscape ... There will still be business in London and it's necessary that we cooperate. We are a prepared for a hard Brexit.""

1597,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 07:18AM ET</span>","Fifty years on, Boeing's 747 clings to life as cargo carrier","By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing's 747 jumbo jet, an aircraft that democratized global air travel in the 1970s but fell behind modern twin-engine passenger jets, has bounced back from near death to mark its 50-year flying anniversary on Saturday, thanks to a cargo market boom fueled by online shopping. 
Boeing's ""Queen of the Skies"" is the world's most easily recognized jetliner with its humped fuselage and four engines. It is now enjoying a second, perhaps less glamorous life, as a cargo mule for companies like  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS).
""It's an efficiency machine for us,"" said Jim Mayer, a spokesman for UPS, the world's largest package deliverer.
UPS ordered 14 more 747-8 freighters in 2018, a lifeline that helps ease doubts over the future of the jumbo, which looks set to outlive its European competitor, Airbus SE's A380.
Airbus is looking ""extremely seriously"" at closing its superjumbo A380 factories sooner than expected, Reuters reported in January, after Dubai's Emirates indicated it might switch its A380 orders to the smaller A350.
Unlike the 747, Europe's superjumbo does not have a freighter version to help absorb slack demand.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) had said in 2016 it could end 747 production amid falling orders and pricing pressure. Major U.S. carriers like United Continental Holdings Inc and Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) have already said goodbye to the 747. 
By keeping the 747 alive, Boeing avoids charges and layoffs for halting production at the mammoth wide-body plant outside Seattle.
It also shields newer programs like the 787 Dreamliner and the latest model of 777, which would have to bear a larger share of the plant's huge overhead if the 747 line went dark.
Still, the 747's extended lifespan could be tempered by U.S.-China trade tensions and concerns about a broader economic slowdown threatening freighter demand.
Global air cargo rose 3.5 percent in 2018 compared with 9.7 percent in 2017, according to the latest data from the International Air Transport Association. 
The 747, which had its maiden flight on Feb. 9, 1969 and entered service on Pan American World Airways in January 1970, allowed for more affordable air travel due to its size and range. 
It still flies passengers for Lufthansa, Korean Air and Air China, and does have one other role.
The U.S. government asked Boeing in 2017 to repurpose two 747-8 jetliners for use as Air Force One by the U.S. president. The two aircraft are due to be delivered by December 2024, painted red, white and blue.

The $3.9 billion contract followed President Donald Trump's objection to the $4 billion price tag of a previous Air Force One deal. He tweeted that ""costs are out of control"" and added ""Cancel order!""

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 06:55AM ET</span>",World share index set for weekly loss as 'economic skies darken',"By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares fell for a third straight day on Friday and were set to post their first weekly loss in seven, as investors worried about a broadening global economic slowdown and the lack of any sign of a resolution to the U.S.-China trade row.
Safe-haven government bonds benefited, with the German 10-year bund yield falling closer towards the zero percent mark and the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield hitting its lowest point in a week.
Weak earnings saw a subdued open for European stocks although most major indices climbed into the black for the day, putting the pan-European STOXX 600 in positive territory. Spain's IBEX fell half a percent. 
But stock markets in Asia earlier eased, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shedding half a percent, easing back from a four-month peak touched the previous day.
The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.3 percent on the day. It was down for a third straight day and was set to break a six-week streak of gains.
The European Commission on Thursday slashed its forecasts for euro zone economic growth this year and next, stoking concern that a global slowdown is spreading to Europe as businesses and investors grapple with trade friction.
The Bank of England on Thursday said Britain faces its weakest economic growth in a decade this year, as uncertainty over Brexit mounts and the global economy slows.
Earlier in the week, Australia's central bank signaled monetary easing in the face of economic headwinds, joining the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank in signaling policy shifts. The Fed has all but abandoned plans for further rate hikes, while the ECB also sounded less certain that it will start tightening policy this year.
""If there was a single takeaway from the last few days it would appear to be this - ever since the Fed started to backtrack on its growth expectations for the U.S. economy, the global economic skies, to coin an aphorism from the recent World Bank report, have started to darken further,"" said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London.
In a report last month titled 'Darkening Skies', the World Bank said global economic growth is expected to slow to 2.9 percent in 2019, compared with 3 percent in 2018.
Hewson added that the tone in markets on the day wasn't helped by remarks from U.S. President Donald Trump's chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow, that U.S.-China trade talks still had sizable differences to overcome.
Trump himself said on Thursday he did not plan to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping before a March 1 deadline set by the two countries to achieve a trade deal.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Robert Lighthizer are expected to kick off another round of trade talks in Beijing next week to push for a deal to protect American intellectual property and avert a March 2 increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield extended its overnight decline to a one-week low of 2.643 percent. The 20-year Japanese government bond yield dropped to a 27-month trough of 0.400 percent.
The 10-year German bund yield fell to 0.105 percent on Thursday, its lowest since November 2016 after the European Commission's sharp cuts to growth and inflation forecasts. 
The euro was on course for its biggest weekly loss in more than four months against the dollar, though traders seemed to be puzzled that it was finding support. The single currency was 0.1 percent lower on the day at $1.13240 after dropping to a two-week low of $1.1325 the previous day. 
It was on track for a 1 percent weekly loss.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was 0.15 percent higher.
The Australian dollar was on course to end a bearish week firmly on the back foot, last trading down 0.25 percent at $0.7083.
The Aussie slid sharply on Wednesday after the Reserve Bank of Australia stepped back from its long-standing tightening bias, saying the next move in rates could just as well be down as up. The currency was headed for a weekly loss of 2.3 percent.
In commodities, oil fell, pulled down by worries over a global economic slowdown, although OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions against Venezuela provided crude with some support.

U.S. crude futures slipped half a percent to $52.39 per barrel, extending losses after dropping 2.5 percent in the previous session. Brent crude was down 0.3 percent at $61.47 per barrel.

""We began the relocation of roles to our new Paris office this week. This is a critical milestone in the development of our EU business and our Brexit preparations"", Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag told employees in a memo.
A spokeswoman for Bank of America confirmed the contents of the memo.
Bank of America's announcement is the latest among a series of such moves by international banks as they seek to ensure they can continue serving clients in Europe after Britain leaves the EU on March 29. 
Although the outcome and timing of Brexit remain clouded by political uncertainty, in the worst-case scenario financial firms will lose the ability to serve EU clients from London and banks are shifting staff and assets to the continent to prepare.
Shannon Lilly will relocate from the bank's headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina to Paris to serve as deputy CEO of the new unit, Bank of America said.
Zaimi will head the unit in addition to her existing roles as head of Global FICC (fixed income, currencies and commodities) Sales and France country executive, according to the memo. 
The creation of the new broker-dealer unit follows the establishment in December of the bank's Dublin business as its main European banking entity, Bank of America said.

1603,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 06:05AM ET</span>",Explainer: How will finance work if there's a no-deal Brexit?,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29 but so far has no exit agreement with the bloc to ensure an orderly departure.
London is Europe's biggest financial center, with the EU its top export market, meaning that without contingency arrangements markets, banking, asset management and insurance across Europe would be left in chaos. 
But preparations are underway on both sides of the Channel to avoid the worst effects of any no-deal Brexit.
TEMPORARY WORKAROUNDS
Britain is approving a law that would allow branches of EU banks and insurers in Britain to continue serving UK customers, giving them time to apply for permanent authorization.
After the EU refused to reciprocate to cover British banks doing business with European clients, EU states have begun taking unilateral action.
Germany, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg, Ireland and Norway are planning to allow UK financial firms to keep undertaking limited business for a fixed period of time after March if there is no deal, giving breathing space for new EU banking and insurance hubs to get bedded down.
British and EU regulators have agreed pacts to exchange information and cooperate on supervision in the event of a no-deal Brexit to avoid immediate disruption to cross-border activity in derivatives clearing, credit ratings agencies, trade reporting venues and asset management.
WHAT ARE THE BANKS UP TO?
Many international banks use London as their European base but with the possibility of a hard Brexit in the short term, and the likelihood of patchy EU access from Britain in future, they are moving to open hubs in the bloc by March 29.
The banks, which trade stocks, bonds, repos and derivatives, are moving 800 billion pounds of assets to make their new hubs in Frankfurt and Paris operational by next month, according to consultancy EY.
The new hubs will be allowed to continue booking some trades centrally in London for now, on condition they build up activities and staffing within their new operations over the next few years.
LLOYD'S OF BRUSSELS
Lloyd's of London insurance market has opened a Brussels subsidiary to write European policies and avoid potential disruption to EU customers.
Insurers like AIG (NYSE:AIG) are shifting blocks of policies from EU customers to new hubs in the EU to become Brexit-proof by March.
EU insurance watchdog EIOPA has calculated there are 9 million customers across Europe still facing potential disruption to policies worth a collective 7.4 billion euros if there is a no-deal Brexit, but say that is not likely to threaten financial stability and require EU contingency action.
DERIVATIVES ON ICE?
ICE (NYSE:ICE) Futures in London is one of Europe's two main derivatives exchanges - the other is Eurex in Frankfurt. 
Unlike stock and bond trading platforms, ICE has no plans to shift trading to the continent. Instead it is obtaining permission from individual EU states like Germany and the Netherlands to allow customers there to continue trading on ICE in London.
Banks are shifting some outstanding derivatives contracts for EU customers from London to new hubs in the bloc.
DELEGATION WINS A REPRIEVE
Asset managers in Britain feared that a no-deal Brexit would stop them from managing funds listed in Luxembourg, Dublin and elsewhere in Europe, a cross-border activity known as delegation.
But regulators from Britain and the EU agreed a pact this month to share information in the event of a no-deal Brexit to allow delegation to continue, triggering a huge sigh of relief in the sector. [nL5N1ZV5A7]
SHARES GOING DUTCH
London-based Cboe Europe, the biggest pan-European stock exchange, is opening a new hub in Amsterdam to which its trading in euro-denominated shares will move from the start of April, irrespective of what sort of Brexit is agreed.
London Stock Exchange's pan-European Turquoise platform is also opening a hub in Amsterdam by the end of March and could move trading in euro-denominated shares there. 
Aquis is opening a new hub in Paris to which it will move its euro-denominated share trading. Shifting trading could be followed by a similar relocation in some clearing to EuroCCP in the Netherlands.
Cutting off Britain would, however, disrupt the operation of EU rules that ensure transparency in share trading. 
EURO BONDS AND REPOS RETURN TO THEIR ROOTS
CME-owned BrokerTec, a bond and repurchase agreement (repo) trading platform, is moving its 210 billion-a-day euro-denominated trading to a new Amsterdam hub by March 18 to avoid splitting liquidity, even if there is a Brexit deal.
Likewise, MTS will shift Italian bond trading from London to Italy.
SPOT STAYS BUT FORWARDS FLEE
Spot forex trading is set to stay in London even if there is a no-deal Brexit.
But CME unit EBS is moving foreign-exchange forwards and swaps trading from London to Amsterdam by March 18, even if there is a Brexit deal. 
Likewise, Refinitiv is transferring its $300 billion-a-day forex derivatives trading to Dublin from London, while leaving its $100 billion-a-day spot trading in London.
METALS IN FINE FETTLE FOR NOW
The London Metal Exchange has applied to German and Dutch regulators for dispensation from the requirement to be licensed as a foreign trading venue so that customers in those two countries can continue using the UK-based platform for trading copper, aluminum and other metals. 
No such license is required in France, Cyprus, Ireland or Norway.
The EU has said if there is no deal, customers in the bloc could continue clearing their metals trades on LME for up to a year.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE EURO CLEARING EXODUS?
London dominates euro-denominated derivatives clearing but it would be impossible to shift trillions of euros of contracts to the continent by March to avoid disruption from a no-deal Brexit that could threaten financial stability.
Brussels has acknowledged this by saying that in the event of a hard Brexit it would allow EU customers to continue using UK-based clearing houses like LCH until the end of 2020 to give more time to shift positions, and for rival clearers like Eurex in Frankfurt to build up capacity.

EU securities regulators and the Bank of England have also agreed a cooperation pact for supervising cross-border clearing operations.

""In the article published yesterday, Wirecard employees are slanderously prejudged with unproven and false allegations,"" Wirecard said in a statement issued in English that described the FT's reporting as defamatory.
""We will use all available legal means to protect the company and in particular our employees and their personal rights. Wirecard is taking legal actions against FT and its unethical reporting.""
Wirecard did not say in which jurisdiction it planned to bring a lawsuit. A spokeswoman added the company would act to protect the personal reputations of individuals named in the newspaper's reporting.
The company is cooperating with the authorities in ongoing investigations into suspected market manipulation in Wirecard stock being conducted by Germany's Bafin financial regulator and the Munich state prosecutor.
The FT did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 05:03AM ET</span>","Thailand launches Huawei 5G test bed, even as U.S. urges allies to bar Chinese gear","By Patpicha Tanakasempipat
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand launched a Huawei Technologies 5G test bed on Friday, even as the United States urges its allies to bar the Chinese telecoms giant from building next-generation mobile networks.
Huawei, the world's top producer of telecoms equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones, has been facing mounting international scrutiny amid fears China could use its equipment for espionage, a concern the company says is unfounded.
The 5G test bed in Thailand, the United States' oldest ally in Asia, will be Huawei's first in Southeast Asia. 
Thailand's cooperation with Huawei on the test bed does not mean it is not concerned about security issues, Minister of Digital Economy Pichet Durongkaveroj told Reuters at the launch. 
""We keep a close watch on the allegations worldwide. However, this 5G test bed project is a testing period for the country,"" Pichet added. ""We can make observations which will be useful to either confirm or disconfirm the allegations."" 
Pichet was speaking at the test site in Chonburi, the heart of the Thai military government's $45 billion economic project - the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC)- about 90 km (55.92 miles) southeast of Bangkok. 
Vendors like Nokia (HE:NOKIA), Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Thai telecoms operators have also set up 5G labs at the site. 
Huawei, which gets nearly half of its revenue from outside China, says it has secured more than 30 commercial 5G contracts globally. But it has not yet signed a 5G contract in Thailand. 
Huawei is in talks with telecoms operators, such as Advanced Info Service Pcl and TRUE, to secure local partnerships ahead of a national rollout scheduled for December 2020, industry sources with knowledge of the matter said. 
Asked if the United States had reached out to Thailand about barring Huawei, Pichet said: ""I have no knowledge of that"".
U.S. CALLS FOR VIGILANCE
Huawei has repeatedly denied U.S.-led allegations that its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying.
""There is no evidence indicating that our equipment posed a security threat, no matter in Thailand or globally,"" Huawei Thailand said in a statement to Reuters on Friday.
Cybersecurity has been made into a ""political and maybe ideological issue"" which is ""not fair"" for a technology company, Huawei added in its statement. 
Earlier, a U.S. embassy spokesperson in Bangkok said the United States ""advocates for secure telecoms networks and supply chains that are free from suppliers subject to foreign government control or undue influence that poses risks of unauthorized access and malicious cyber activity"". 
""We routinely urge allies and partners to consider such risks and exercise similar vigilance in ensuring the security of their own telecoms networks and supply chains, including when awarding contracts,"" the spokesperson added.
Ties between the United States and Thailand have cooled since the Thai military took power in a 2014 coup. Relations between Bangkok and Beijing, on the other hand have, warmed in recent years as evident from a pick up in defense trade and Chinese investment in the Southeast Asian nation.
CHINESE INVESTMENT
Huawei has previously set up a cloud data center worth $22.5 million in Thailand's EEC, a centerpiece of the government's policy to boost growth in the country that has struggled to attract foreign investors besides the Chinese. 
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Tencent, Kingsoft and JD.com have also pledged to invest in the EEC.
This stands in stark contrast to the intense scrutiny being faced by Chinese investment in other parts of the world amid a crippling Sino-U.S. trade war. 
Reuters reported exclusively on Jan. 30 that the European Commission was considering proposals that would ban Huawei from 5G networks, but that work was at an early stage.
For Thailand, security concerns over Huawei's equipment come second to its competitive pricing versus that by U.S. firms, Pranontha Titavunno, Chairman of the Information Technology Industry Club of the Federation of Thai Industries, said. 
""We don't think about it because their products are decent and affordable,"" Pranontha told Reuters. 

""There are always surveillance concerns when it comes to China ... But Thailand doesn't really have anything exciting that might be of interest to Beijing.""

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 04:52AM ET</span>",Sony stock jumps after first-ever share buyback announcement,"By Makiko Yamazaki and Junko Fujita
TOKYO (Reuters) - Sony Corp (T:6758) announced its first-ever major share buyback on Friday, worth 100 billion yen ($910 million), helping its stock recover from a hammering days earlier when investors freaked over lackluster earnings.
The announcement marked Japan's second major buyback this week after tech investor SoftBank Group Corp scheduled the repurchase of 600 billion yen in shares using proceeds from the IPO of its telecoms unit, sending its stock price soaring.
Japanese firms have been increasing buybacks as investors call for higher returns in a country not known for showering its shareholders in riches. The government has also chimed in, hoping higher returns will attract more foreign money to Japan.
The amount of buybacks announced by listed companies has jumped around 2.5 times over the past five years, according to financial data service firm I-N Information Systems.
In the past week, buyback announcements have accompanied the earnings reports of instruments maker Yamaha Corp, trading house Itochu Corp, energy firm JXTG Holdings Inc and Japan Tobacco Inc.
Sony said its buyback, its first ever aimed at boosting shareholder returns, will be equivalent to 2.36 percent of its outstanding shares and will be conducted through March 22. Its shares closed 4 percent higher at 4,906 yen on Friday. 
""Our financial health has improved enough to conduct the repurchases,"" a Sony spokesman said, adding that recently low share prices were also a factor in its decision.
Sony shares plunged 14 percent to their lowest in over a year after the firm reported sagging numbers in its previously thriving gaming business. Sony also cut its outlook for imaging sensors, citing weakness in the global smartphone market.
Analysts nevertheless applaud Sony's turnaround in the past few years spearheaded by Kenichiro Yoshida, first as chief financial officer and, since last year, as chief executive. The firm struggled for profitability as its consumer electronics business lost market share to Asian rivals, before reinventing itself as an entertainment firm with stable revenue from music content and gaming.
Hiroyasu Nishikawa, senior analyst at IwaiCosmo Securities, said the buyback showed how Sony had become more sensitive to investors in recent years.
""This announcement was well timed, and it shows it's watching the market very well,"" he said. ""In the past few years Sony gradually started recovering what it'd lost in the previous 20, 25 years. This latest move is one that's attuned to the stock market.""
Sony has been steadily increasing shareholder return through higher dividends over the last couple of years, paying 7.09 percent of its profit in dividend in the last fiscal year, Refinitiv data showed. That compared with 22.5 percent at U.S. tech giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Stephen Givens, a corporate lawyer based in Tokyo, said while Sony's and SoftBank's buybacks may have been aimed shoring up stock prices, they were a part of the trend of Japanese firms seeing the advantages of buybacks compared with cash dividends.

""A stock buyback gives shareholders a choice to sell out or stay invested, whereas a dividend forces all shareholders not only to disinvest but to pay tax at higher rates on the cash dividend than they would pay if they sold their stock back to the company,"" he said.

At 04:45 AM ET (0945 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 was little changed at 3,155.55, reversing early losses after stronger-than-expected trade data from Germany and industrial production figures from France tempered the prevailing pessimism.
But trade tensions are keeping the pressure on the auto sector, after a Wall Street Journal report said it’s “highly unlikely” that the U.S. and Chinese presidents will meet to clear up their differences on trade before a new raft of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods comes into force in March.
Mercedes-Benz parent  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) is again toward the bottom of the Stoxx 50, and has lost 7.7% this week, while BMW (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) have lost 4.8% each and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) has lost over 11%.
Bad news continues to come out of suppliers too: German cable and wiring maker Leoni (DE:LEOGn) fell 25% after swinging to a loss in the fourth quarter and suspending its dividend.
China isn't the only risk to automakers.  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM), the Indian parent of Jaguar Land Rover, fell by 30% after a historic multibillion-dollar write-off of investments in the U.K. – a combination of the collapse of diesel sales, weaker Chinese demand and uncertainties over Brexit.
Luxury goods continue to stand out from an otherwise uninspiring earnings season: Hermes (PA:HRMS) rose 0.6% after saying sales rose over 10% in the fourth quarter amid no signs of a slowdown in China, while L’Oreal (PA:OREP) said its strong fourth-quarter was also due to higher-end products, notably skin creams.
Elsewhere, German payments company Wirecard (DE:WDIG) is recovering from another report alleging irregularities in its accounting in Asia. The company has denied the allegations, but the stock is now down over 30% since they first surfaced."
1611,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 04:00AM ET</span>",U.S. Stock Funds Are Left in the Cold as Even Europe Sees Inflow,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. is now the only major equity region that investors continue to exit, as even unloved European stocks are seeing money return for the first time in months.
U.S. stock funds saw outflows of $700 million in the week through Feb. 6, bringing the year-to-date total redemption to $41 billion, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) note, which cited EPFR Global data. European equity funds had their first inflow in 22 weeks, with about $200 million coming in.
Japanese and emerging-market equity funds as well as investment-grade, high-yield and EM debt pools continued to see an influx of cash as traders embraced the best new-year rally in decades after a brutal fourth-quarter sell-off. Even after the S&P 500 Index’s 8 percent gain this year, many investors remain hesitant about U.S. equities amid concerns about elevated valuations and as earnings growth is projected to slow this year.
“Positioning, policy, profits and populism argue the correct early 2019 trading strategy is to ‘buy-the-dip,’” said Bank of America strategists, including Michael Hartnett, in the note. “Investors are back to discounting secular stagnation and buying yield and growth.”
Since the start of the year, traders have invested $36 billion into bonds and sold $10 billion of stocks, according to Bank of America. The 2019 rebound in U.S. equities has been curious because many traders lack conviction that the rally can last and prefer to stay on the sidelines, which has been reflected in lower trading volumes and price swings.
European equity funds were the pariah of 2018, seeing the biggest outflows among major geographic regions. Messy politics from Italy to the U.K. and earnings growth at a fraction of the pace seen in the U.S. made investors shun the region last year, but appealing valuations are making some fund managers take a second look at European stocks."

The pan-European STOXX 600 hovered flat by 0825 GMT, in line with the DAX, while the FTSE 100 and CAC 40 managed to inch up 0.2 percent. 
French Cosmetics giant L'Oreal said strong demand for luxury skin creams helped it beat fourth-quarter sales forecasts - another company reporting better-than-feared demand from China after LVMH last week.
Its shares rose 1.2 percent in early deals before giving back gains to trade up just 0.4 percent. Traders put the move down to profit-taking after a strong run - L'Oreal hit a record high on Feb 5. 
Luxury handbag maker Hermes topped the CAC 40 with a 1.5-percent gain after it also said sales momentum in its Chinese stores stayed strong. 
Luxury rivals  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH also rose 0.6 percent each.
Swedish electronics group Dometic shone, topping the STOXX with a 16-percent jump after reporting fourth-quarter profit rose and giving a positive outlook for 2019 sales growth.
On the flipside, Belgian chemicals and cobalt refiner Umicore fell 4.7 percent after saying it expected 2019 growth to be hit by subdued demand in cars and consumer electronics, and R&D costs.
Construction was a weak spot with Denmark's Rockwool sinking 13 percent after full-year earnings missed expectations, and Sweden's Skanska losing 7.8 percent after it cut its dividend and lagged profit estimates.
Autos fell 0.8 percent, extending losses from Thursday when the sector suffered its biggest one-day drop since the Brexit vote aftermath in June 2016.

Tata Motors warned Jaguar Land Rover would swing to a loss due to weak sales, and that latest negative news on car demand weighed on auto suppliers  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and Faurecia, down 2.6 to 3 percent.

Tata Motors Ltd. shares had their biggest drop in 26 years in Mumbai trading after the company unveiled a writedown in its luxury Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc unit. The decline of as much as 30 percent was the biggest since February 1993 on intraday basis and sent Tata Motors shares to their lowest level in almost a decade.
Plummeting sales in China are compounding Jaguar Land Rover’s challenges that include the industry’s shift away from vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel -- a stronghold for the company. Another wild card is its heavy production presence in the U.K. that exposes it to a disorderly Brexit, should that occur.
“Jaguar Land Rover is facing headwinds in multiple fronts, including geopolitical uncertainty and technological disruption apart from sluggish demand scenario in a strong market like China,” said Debjit Maji, an analyst at Stewart & Mackertich Wealth Management in Kolkata, India. “For Jaguar Land Rover, it will be catastrophic if Britain go for no-deal Brexit.”
Tata Motors shares were down 18 percent at 150.65 rupees as of 1:23 p.m. in Mumbai. They had already lost more than 50 percent in the past 12 months through Thursday on concerns about Jaguar Land Rover’s waning sales, profitability, high capital-expenditure need and the impact of Brexit.
Carmakers around the planet are getting hurt by the slump in China, whose car market shrank for the first time in more than two decades last year.  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW AG reduced profit forecasts last year amid pressures from the U.S.-China trade war that’s hit auto demand, while Hyundai Motor Co. said last month it’s letting workers go as it reviews production plans in the world’s biggest market.
The “overall performance continued to be impacted by challenging market conditions in China,” Ralf Speth, head of Jaguar Land Rover, said in a statement on Thursday. “We continue to work closely with Chinese retailers to respond to current market conditions.”
The company said it’s overhauling its China operation, cutting back on deliveries to reduce stock. It’s also streamlined its commercial policies to help compensate for retailers’ losses, and launching extensive on-site training programs to improve the customer experience as well as operations.
Tata Motors wrote down its investment in Jaguar Land Rover by $3.9 billion due to market challenges, especially in China, technology disruptions and rising debt costs. The parent’s net loss was 270 billion rupees ($3.8 billion) in the three months through December, exceeding the deficit reported by Indian Oil Corp. in 2012.
“Tata Motors has bitten the bullet,” Ajay Bodke, the Mumbai-based head of investment strategy at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd. said by phone. “They are reinforcing that they are serious about achieving a turnaround, saving costs and taking measures that might be tough.”
As part of Jaguar Land Rover’s plans to achieve 2.5 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) of investment, working capital and profit improvements by March 2020, the company in January said it would slash its global workforce by 4,500. This is expected to result in a one-time exceptional redundancy cost of around 200 million pounds for the luxury unit of Tata Motors. The cost of the voluntary scheme will be recognized in the quarter ending March 31, the company said."
1615,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 02:43AM ET</span>",Explainer: Why Shanghai's new Nasdaq-style tech board may be a game-changer,"By Julia Fioretti and Samuel Shen
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The detailed rules for a Nasdaq-style start-up board in Shanghai have fueled hopes among early-stage companies the new regime could bring about positive changes in China's stance towards raising equity that investors have been seeking. 
Published just two months after President Xi Jinping surprised financiers by announcing plans for the board, the rules come as China and the United States are locked in a bitter trade war, with Chinese technology firms in the cross-fire.
Here's what the board is expected to look like and why it matters:
WHY DOES THIS MATTER?
The biggest problem for companies hoping to tap China's existing equity capital markets is that listings are entirely overseen by regulators who have often halted the process for public listings for months on end during times of market weakness that have produced a backlog of 18 months at times. 
China's rules, like those of many emerging markets, also require IPO candidates to be profitable - something many capital-seeking start-ups have not yet managed. 
Both concerns will be addressed by the new ""technology innovation board"" with a registration-based system limiting official powers to control the timing of listings, and new rules that allow some ""pre-profit"" companies to go public. 
The choice of sectors able to list is important too. The main ones are in emerging industries considered strategically important, including high-tech equipment manufacturing, new energy, biotechnology, big data and cloud computing.
Some of the more sensitive industries, such as network information security and coding technology, are also not allowed to receive foreign capital or list overseas, meaning a domestic funding alternative is especially important.
WHY IS SHANGHAI DOING THIS?
China has long wanted its home-grown tech champions to list closer to home. 
Many of the best-known Chinese groups including e-commerce firm  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and gaming and social media giant Tencent Holdings, chose to raise funds in international markets such as New York and Hong Kong - and investors there, not in China, reaped the benefits. 
Last year, Chinese companies raised $64.2 billion globally - almost a third of the worldwide total - via initial public offerings (IPOs), but less than one-third of that was raised in Shanghai or Shenzhen, according to Refinitiv data.
Shenzhen's start-up friendly board, ChiNext, set up in 2009, and once a hotbed of speculation, is struggling to gain traction. It saw only 27 listings in 2018, with volumes slumping 43 percent from the previous year to $4.3 billion, Refinitiv data show.
Shenzhen's main stock exchange has not done much better, with IPO fundraising slumping 39 percent in 2018 to $8.1 billion.
An earlier effort, the New Third Board set up in Beijing in 2006, has suffered a similar fate and is languishing amid poor liquidity and waning investor interest. 
In the past year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange has sought to aggressively expand its offering, working on plans to help overseas-listed Chinese companies sell shares at home, while also building a link with London to allow UK companies to raise funds in China. 
The new board is also viewed as a move by Beijing to counter U.S. curbs on China's technology advancement. Washington is demanding that Beijing tighten rules around intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers.
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT TIMING AND DETAILS?
Listing hopefuls can submit an application as soon as the rules are officially published. The draft rules published just before the Lunar New Year are open for consultation until Feb. 28.
China aims to officially launch the board by June, according to local media. 
In addition to the U.S.-style registration system the new board will let loss-making firms raise money publicly for the first time, as long as they own core technologies, or have growth potential. A tech committee is being formed to decide who meets those standards.
Companies with weighted voting rights (WVR) will also be accepted, helping Shanghai compete better with Hong Kong and New York which already allow companies to weight votes in favor of small groups and company founders.     
The draft rules also propose letting new board stocks rise or fall by up to 20 percent a day, compared with a 10 percent cap currently in general use.
There will also be no daily limits for the first five days of trading in new stocks, compared with the existing 44 percent limit on other boards.
WHO ARE THE LIKELY WINNERS AND LOSERS?
Chinese tech start-ups and the investors who pick the future superstars from among them are the most likely winners. 
If successful, the board could also position Shanghai as a capital-raising competitor to Hong Kong and New York, who between them accounted for 68.7 percent of the money raised through Chinese IPOs last year. 

The biggest loser risks being Hong Kong, which has worked to position itself as the international gateway to and from China. IPOs are big business in the city and Chinese companies represent almost all the funds raised, unlike New York where they are only a fraction of the total.

1616,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 02:15AM ET</span>",Starbucks 'unlikely' to be overtaken in China by Luckin in 2019: CEO,"By David Alire Garcia
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) is unlikely to cede its leading position in China, the company's fastest-growing major market, to Chinese startup Luckin in 2019, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said in an interview on Thursday.
Seattle-based Starbucks, the world's largest coffee chain, has been building its presence in the world's second-biggest economy for the past couple of decades, while Luckin only launched at the beginning of last year, expanding rapidly with a focus on technology and heavy discounting even at the cost of mounting losses.
""I think it's unlikely,"" said Johnson when asked if Luckin might overtake Starbucks in China by the end of 2019, pointing to the 18 percent growth in new Chinese stores the company racked up in the fourth quarter.
""Just this last quarter we entered 10 new cities in China,"" he said, adding that each of those cites is larger than Los Angeles, the sprawling southern California metropolis with a population of around 4 million.
Luckin has said it is targeting a total of more than 4,500 stores in China by the end of 2019, which would take it past Starbucks, which has long dominated the Chinese coffee market and currently has over 3,600 stores in the country.
Many Luckin units are much smaller “points of presence” and not comparable to full-service Starbucks cafes, Johnson said.
Johnson, who replaced Howard Schultz as Starbucks chief executive in April 2017, said he expects the company to be able to repeat last quarter's growth in China due to what he described as ""a first-mover advantage"" in the Asian giant. 
""I think we will simply because much of that growth, it's about building new stores,"" he said, noting that Starbucks opens a new store every 15 hours on average in China.
Johnson added that ""thus far"" U.S-China trade tensions has not affected the company's bottom line.
""We haven't seen much impact,"" he said.
This week, Johnson was visiting Mexico, Starbucks' biggest market in Latin America with over 700 stores, and touted the company's long-standing relationship with Mexico City-based operator Alsea.
Alsea operates over a 1,000 Starbucks stores across Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay, and late last month announced its acquisition and expansion of the Starbucks brand into Europe, including France.
The company expects around 35 percent of its total sales will come from Europe this year, while about 45 percent will come its core Mexican operations. 

Alsea's new store growth this year is expected to increase by about 6 percent compared to 2018, according to company officials.

1618,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 12:41AM ET</span>",Australia's bruised big banks offered respite in inquiry wash-up,"By Jonathan Barrett and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - After a year of bruising interrogation, Australia's oligopoly banking system has emerged from a government-appointed inquiry with reputations tarnished and some top executives removed - but also an unexpected opportunity to rebuild.
Proposed reforms to the mortgage broking industry revealed on Monday will potentially put billions of dollars of broker-originated loans in play in the banks' most important profit-generating sector.
Australia's ""Big Four"" banks - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and Westpac Banking Corp - now have the opportunity to battle for the money projected to leak from the mortgage broking sector and capture extra margins by cutting out an intermediary. 
Stockbroker Bell Potter has priced in an anticipated 15 percent reduction in loans moving through brokers, on the basis that customers will balk at the proposed changes, where the borrower - not the lender - would pay a fee to the mortgage broker.
""With their huge customer base and mortgage books, the large incumbent banks are very well positioned to benefit from a post-Royal Commission world where they can win (market share),"" said one bank official, who was not authorized to speak to the media.
""Banks could also open branches in strategic high-growth areas to capture more customers.""
At the same time as bank shares surged in the wash-up of the inquiry's final report on Feb 4, listed mortgage brokers were left nursing huge losses.
Finance Brokers Association of Australia managing director Peter White said the big banks would use their branches to take the lion's share, at a cost to consumers.
""All that happens through this is that everything just gets pushed back to the four major banks,"" said White.
The proposed broking changes still need to go before parliament, and a general election expected in May could determine which reforms are implemented.
The powerful inquiry, called a Royal Commission, also recommended retaining a level playing field. That could result in a Dutch-styled model where customers pay an upfront fee, regardless of where they get their loan, which could help limit the fallout for mortgage brokers. 
Banks that built up their direct distribution networks for mortgage loans rather than rely on brokers could improve their net interest margins, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analysts. 
Mortgages are the biggest share of Australian banks' lending books, making them a key determinant of profitability. Broker-originated loans currently account for up to half of some of the big banks' mortgage books.
Past decisions by CBA and Westpac to retain large local branch networks has left them well positioned to sell mortgages directly to customers, according to investors' modeling of the changes.
But the major banks, which already hold about 80 percent of all home loans in the country, will need to weigh up the benefits of using capital to reinvest in their branches at a time when the prevailing strategy is to cut costs.
""Some of the bigger ones might think they have got an opportunity here to possibly gain more market share through their branches,"" said Azib Khan, a banking analyst at Morgans Financial.
NAB, which lost its chairman and chief executive in the inquiry fallout, could try and use its UBank digital arm to take advantage of any money leaking from traditional brokers.
Representatives of CBA and ANZ declined to comment on their strategy to Reuters. Westpac and NAB did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment.

While the inquiry savaged the industry's behavior and lack of ethics, there was no overhaul of regulations, no clampdown on credit and no push to break up the operations of the biggest banks. 
The banks could now attempt to re-build their once sprawling empires or continue with a more defensive strategy amid local and global economic headwinds, including trade tensions between the United States and China.
CBA, the country's biggest lender, is forecast to have an estimated A$6 billion ($4.26 billion) in extra capital in its coffers by the end of the year, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts, while ANZ is planning to hand back A$3 billion to investors via share buybacks.
Investors don't expect the sector to go on an overseas spending binge anytime soon after a period of poorly executed forays.
""Investors would be horrified if any of them went offshore buying assets,"" said Hugh Dive, chief Investment Officer of Atlas Funds Management, which invests in bank shares.
""I think the strategy for the next couple of years is to focus on their core banking businesses, and trying to get the costs down.""
The big Australian banks also need to retain sufficient capital to meet new regulator-imposed requirements being imposed in Australia and New Zealand, where they also operate. 
Many of the wealth management, insurance and financial planning units divested by big Australian banks in recent years were profitable but breeding grounds for unethical behavior, exposed in part by the inquiry.
While analysts do not expect banks to buy back in right away, they are free to do so in the future when the cost-cutting era gives way to more aggressive strategies.
While bank shares are still trading between 7 and 15 percent lower than they were over a year ago when the inquiry hearings began, a big cloud of uncertainty has been lifted from their outlooks.

""While we do not anticipate a loosening of underwriting standards or re-acceleration of lending, the soft recommendations of the Royal Commission final report are a clear win for the banks,"" investment bank UBS said.

1619,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2019 12:00AM ET</span>",Facebook toughens political ad policies in India ahead of election,"By Sankalp Phartiyal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) is toughening up the rules governing political advertisements in India to create more transparency ahead of the country's general elections due before May, the social media giant said late on Thursday. 
Users will see political advertisements with ""published by"" and ""paid by"" disclaimers, the Menlo Park, California-headquartered company said in a statement. 
The move comes weeks after Facebook told Reuters it would extend some of its political advertising rules and tools for curbing election interference to India, Nigeria, Ukraine and the European Union before significant votes in these places in the next few months.
Users will be able to access a library that allows them to search and find out more about political advertisements such as how much is spent on them and the demographics of advertising views, Facebook said. 
People will soon also be able to see country locations of users who manage Facebook pages that carry political ads. 
""By increasing transparency around ads and pages on Facebook, we hope to increase accountability for advertisers, help people assess the content they're seeing and prevent future abuse in elections,"" Facebook said. 
The new features and policy becomes effective Feb. 21. 
The moves are part of Facebook's attempts to reshape its public image which took a beating last year after a privacy scandal involving British data consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
The company has also faced intense pressure from India, one of the world's biggest Internet markets, to curb the spread of misinformation through its WhatsApp messenger that has lead to a spate of killings. 
Facebook said it is also making it tougher to run a page using a fake account by introducing two-factor authentication and by asking for page administrators' primary country location. 
In past few years Facebook has effectively been used globally by politicians and their adversaries to distribute fake news and other propaganda.
Ads on Facebook can widen the reach of such material, but some of those influence efforts may violate election rules and the company's policies.

Under intense global public scrutiny, Facebook last year introduced several initiatives to increase oversight of political ads.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), has accused the owner of the National Enquirer of trying to blackmail him with the threat of publishing ""intimate photos"" he allegedly sent to his girlfriend unless he said in public that the supermarket tabloid's reporting on him was not politically motivated.
The accusation, published in a blog post (https:// is the latest twist in a weeks-long saga that has brought the world's richest person's private life into the spotlight and thrusts him deeper into a battle with the leading U.S. tabloid publisher, which has had close links with the president of the United States. 
""Of course I don’t want personal photos published, but I also won’t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption,"" Bezos wrote. ""I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.""
American Media Inc (AMI), the owner of the National Enquirer, did not immediately return a request for comment.
Bezos and his wife announced last month that they were divorcing after 25 years of marriage, following a period of ""loving exploration"" and trial separation. That same day, the National Enquirer touted it was publishing alleged intimate text messages between Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, a former television anchor whom he was said to be dating.
Shortly after that, Bezos opened an investigation into the leak led by Gavin de Becker, a longtime security consultant and former appointee of U.S. President Ronald Reagan. De Becker proceeded to tell media that the leak was politically motivated.
Bezos, Amazon and the newspaper he owns privately, the Washington Post, have all been targets of attacks on Twitter by U.S. President Donald Trump. 
The Washington Post has published many articles critical of the president. It acts as Amazon's ""chief lobbyist,"" Trump has said on Twitter, without presenting evidence. Trump called Bezos ""Jeff Bozo"" in a tweet last month about the National Enquirer's coverage of his divorce.
""It’s unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy,"" Bezos wrote. ""President Trump is one of those people, obvious by his many tweets."" 
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In his blog, Bezos cited an email from AMI deputy general counsel, Jon Fine, to a lawyer representing de Becker. In it, AMI proposed a public acknowledgment from Bezos and de Becker that ""they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that (AMI's) coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.""
In return for such an acknowledgement, according to the email, AMI offered ""not to publish, distribute, share, or describe unpublished texts and photos.""
Bezos said the statement AMI was proposing was false and described the offer as an ""extortionate proposal."" 
Fine and de Becker could not immediately be reached for comment.
The alleged extortion raises questions among some legal observers about whether AMI and its chief executive David Pecker have violated a cooperation agreement AMI made last year with federal prosecutors in connection with a $150,000 hush-money payment given to Karen McDougal, the Playboy model who claims she had an affair with President Donald Trump.
The payment was made during the 2016 presidential election to influence that election, according to the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York (SDNY). The deal not to prosecute was conditional on AMI not committing another crime, the office said.
A spokesman for the SDNY attorney's office declined to comment on the matter. 

Bezos, who owns more than $120 billion in Amazon stock, said in his blog: ""If in my position I can’t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?""

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, which returned to trade after being offline since Tuesday due to the Lunar New Year holidays, was down 0.7% by 9:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). Chinese markets remained closed.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 1.8%. Sony Corp (T:6758) jumped almost 5% after the company announced its first-ever share buyback on Friday, worth 100 billion yen ($910 million).
The buyback will be equivalent to 2.36% of its outstanding shares, the company added. ""Our financial health has improved enough to conduct the repurchases,"" a Sony spokesman said.
Meanwhile, government data showed on Friday that Japan’s household spending rebounded 0.1% year-on-year in December, although the gain fell short of the expected 0.8% rise.
South Korea’s KOSPI dropped 1.1%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 edged down 0.5%, with the energy sub-index underperformed as oil stocks declined on the back of Thursday's drop in crude prices.
Santos Ltd (AX:STO) shares fell 4%, Woodside Petroleum Ltd (AX:WPL) slipped almost 2%, and Beach Energy Ltd (AX:BPT) plunged 9%.
The fall in Asian stocks on Friday came amid renewed uncertainties over whether China and the U.S. could reach a trade agreement before a deadline on March 1.
On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters that he would not meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before the March deadline.
Earlier this week, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said there is a ""pretty sizable distance to go"" before the two sides could reach an agreement.
""The president has indicated that he's optimistic with respect to a potential trade deal,"" Kudlow said on Fox Business. ""But we've got a pretty sizable distance to go here.""
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also noted this week that ""wide range of issues"" remains to be worked out, although he said the talks so far have been “very productive.”
China and the U.S. have until the start of March to strike a trade deal. Otherwise, additional tariffs on Chinese goods take effect.
The U.S. charges against Huawei also undermined the prospect of a successful trade deal, reports said. Citing three sources, Politico reported that Trump is expected to sign an executive order next week banning Chinese telecommunication equipment from U.S. wireless networks."
1622,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 10:00PM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler paid $77 million in U.S. fuel economy penalties in 2018,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV told Reuters on Thursday it paid $77 million in U.S. civil penalties late last year for failing to meet 2016 model year fuel economy requirements, the first significant sign the industry is facing hurdles meeting rising emissions rules.
The Italian-American automaker has been lobbying the Trump administration to revise fuel economy requirements and last year regulators proposed freezing requirements at 2020 model-year levels through 2026.
Shane Karr, head of external affairs for Fiat Chrysler in North America, said in a statement the fuel economy program should be reformed rather than ""requiring companies to make large compliance payments because assumptions made in 2011 turned out to be wrong.""
Karr added that the automaker is ""committed to improving the fuel efficiency of our fleet and expanding our U.S. manufacturing footprint.""
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in a report dated Dec. 21 that the industry faced $77 million in fines in 2016 and that one unnamed manufacturer ""is expected to pay significant civil penalties."" The agency did not immediately comment on Thursday.
The civil penalty payment is much higher than in prior model years. The industry paid $2.3 million in civil penalties in 2014 and $40 million in 2011. 
Under federal rules, automakers can accrue credits for overcomplying in some years. In 2012, the Obama administration finalized rules requiring automakers to nearly double the fleet-wide fuel efficiency of vehicles to more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025, but the Trump administration has proposed rolling back those requirements starting in the 2021 model year.
NHTSA also noted that the number of automakers' fleets with credit shortfalls had risen to 26 in 2016, up from 18 in 2011, and the number of surpluses fell from 26 in 2011 to 15.
Steve Bartoli, a Fiat Chrysler vice president who oversees fuel economy issues, said in September at a public hearing on the fuel rules that starting in 2016 the auto industry had been unable to meet current requirements without using credits earned from prior model years. Bartoli called the gap ""a wake-up call that assumptions made seven years ago about the U.S. auto market need to be revisited.""
The NHTSA report also said automakers collectively face projected shortfalls of about $1.2 billion for both the 2017 and 2018 model years, but it was unclear how much in credits can be used to offset the deficits.
Fiat Chrysler said the payment was anticipated and the costs were included in the company’s fourth-quarter financial results released on Thursday.
The company has previously purchased emissions credits from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co. 
Fiat Chrysler paid penalties for its domestically produced car fleet that did not meet efficiency requirements. It noted rules governing domestically produced cars restrict the use of credits.
The company explained the shortfall in part by noting that starting in the 2011 model year some front-wheel-drive utility vehicles previously classified as trucks were moved to the car fleet, which have much tougher fuel-efficiency requirements.
Fiat Chrysler noted those vehicles are taller and require more energy than sedans. In 2016, the company produced four such vehicles: the two-row Dodge Journey, Jeep Cherokee, Jeep Compass and Jeep Patriot.
By contrast, Fiat Chrysler said its average light-truck fuel economy in 2016 was higher than Toyota, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), while its car numbers were significantly lower.
The Trump administration said last year the fuel economy freeze would save the automakers more than $300 billion in regulatory costs.

Trump’s proposed freeze would result in 500,000 barrels per day more oil consumption by the year 2030. California says the proposal ""would worsen air quality for the most vulnerable (and) waste billions of gallons of gasoline.""

1623,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 09:42PM ET</span>",U.S. bankruptcy judge approves sale of Sears to Chairman Lampert,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge on Thursday approved Sears Holdings Corp Chairman Edward Lampert's $5.2 billion takeover of the beleaguered retailer, allowing the department store chain to avert liquidation and preserve tens of thousands of jobs. 
Judge Robert Drain approved the sale after a hearing spanning several days in a White Plains, N.Y., federal bankruptcy court. He overruled objections, including from an unsecured creditors committee, which said the process for selling Sears was unfair to them and argued for a liquidation. 
Lampert, who arranged an $11 billion merger between Sears and discounter Kmart in 2005 and tried for years to boost business, wins another chance to try to revive what once was the biggest U.S. retailer.
Lampert, the only bidder offering to keep Sears alive through his hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc, agreed to a deal for 425 stores after round-the-clock negotiations in January. The takeover aims to preserve about 45,000 jobs.
""I conclude that the process here was proper and appropriate,"" Drain said in his reasoning for approving the sale.
Terms of the sale allow for some litigation to continue against Lampert and ESL. 
Drain said Lampert was ""subject to substantial verbal abuse"" during the proceedings, noting that critics had characterized the Sears chairman in ways that evoked a ruthless robber baron and a blowhard sitcom character.
""He is a wealthy individual and a big boy and I guess he can take it,"" Drain said, adding that some of the abuse may have been justified.
Sears Chief Restructuring Officer Mohsin Meghji and company directors Bill Transier and Alan Carr were among those questioned on a witness stand during the court hearing on Lampert's offer.
Lampert stepped down as CEO when Sears filed for bankruptcy Oct. 15, though he remained the retailer's chairman, largest shareholder and creditor. A restructuring committee of independent directors negotiated with Lampert and his advisers.
Drain grew impatient as the proceedings wore on Thursday. ""Give me a break,"" the judge said, when a creditors committee lawyer argued an objection to the takeover bid. 
Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based Sears will still face fierce competition from big rivals including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. Founded in the 19th Century, Sears built itself into an American institution with its famous mail-order catalogs in practically every middle-class home. Its Sears tower in Chicago was once the tallest building in the world. But it failed to adapt to the modern era of online shopping. 
When Lampert combined Sears and rival chain Kmart, the merged retailer had nearly 3,500 stores and employed more than 300,000 people, a workforce that shrank to 68,000 when it filed for bankruptcy. 
Lampert's offer came after the retailer had been pushed to the brink of liquidation multiple times. In the end, he boosted his initial offer by $800 million, largely in the assumption of Sears bills for taxes and merchandise. 
Money owned to lawyers, bankers and other advisers working on the retailer's bankruptcy case also proved contentious as Sears lacked enough money to meet all its obligations. 
Lampert agreed to take on one of the company’s bankruptcy loans, which debtors typically repay, in its entirety. Lampert was allowed to use $1.3 billion Sears owed him as currency in the offer, a maneuver known as a credit bid, which some creditors had opposed. He received a legal release protecting him from litigation regarding money he loaned Sears. 
Lampert still remains exposed to lawsuits related to certain transactions he engaged in while leading Sears before filing for bankruptcy. Sears directors rejected his request to receive a broader legal release covering those deals, which creditors contend robbed them of value. 
Sears over the years spun off clothing manufacturer Lands’ End and parted with 235 of its best stores for $2.7 billion to a company Lampert created called Seritage Growth Properties 

Drain intervened multiple times to urge Sears advisers and Lampert's negotiators to keep working toward a deal.

1624,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 06:52PM ET</span>",No talks between Trump and China's Xi before trade deadline,"By Jeff Mason and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he did not plan to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before a March 1 deadline set by the two countries to achieve a trade deal.
Asked during an event in the Oval Office whether there would be a meeting before the deadline, Trump said: ""No.""
When asked whether there would be a meeting in the next month or so, Trump said: ""Not yet. Maybe. Probably too soon. Probably too soon.""
The remarks confirmed comments from administration officials who said the two men were unlikely to meet before the deadline, dampening hopes of a quick trade pact and sparking a drop in U.S stock markets.
Late last year during a dinner between Trump and Xi in Argentina, the two men agreed to take a 90-day hiatus in their trade war to give their teams time to negotiate an agreement. 
If the talks do not succeed, Trump has threatened to increase U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. Another round of talks is scheduled for next week in Beijing. 
Trump, who is proud of having a warm relationship with Xi, said last week he would meet with him again to hammer out a final deal, after Chinese Vice Premier Liu He presented Xi's invitation at the White House.
A person briefed on the talks said that Trump's advisers were concerned that accepting a meeting invitation at this stage would raise unfounded expectations for a quick deal and erode U.S. leverage in the talks, where the two sides remain far apart on core structural intellectual property issues.
""There was concern about the downside for markets in particular if they don't reach a deal,"" the source said. 
The president is scheduled to travel to Asia at the end of this month for a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam, and some had speculated that he could meet with Xi on the same trip. Trump had indicated that was one option, or Xi could come to the United States.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters that the leaders of the two economic superpowers could still meet at a later date.
""At some point the two presidents will meet, that is what Mr. Trump has been saying. But that is off in the distance still at the moment,"" he said.
The news prompted a sharp selloff in U.S. stocks, dashing the optimism that had been building that the countries were progressing toward a deal before tariffs on Chinese imports rise to 25 percent after the March 1 deadline.
The S&P 500 Index closed down 0.93 percent in its biggest drop in two weeks. Treasury bond yields dropped as investors sought safety in sovereign U.S. debt. The benchmark 10-year yield slid 4 basis points to 2.66 percent, the lowest in nearly a week.
""I could see where that would impact the markets because obviously we had a lift in the month of January from optimism surrounding these trade talks,"" said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. 
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are leaving on Monday for the next round of talks in China, one administration official said. ""They're hoping for more success,"" he said. 
The United States is pressing China to make major reforms, including on structural issues related to how it treats U.S. companies doing business there. Washington accuses China of stealing U.S. intellectual property and forcing American businesses to share their technology with Chinese companies. China denies the accusations. 
Trump said in his State of the Union address on Tuesday that any new trade deal with Beijing ""must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices.""
Such reforms have been a sticking point in talks so far. 
Lighthizer told reporters last week that the two leaders may not meet if the negotiations do not progress sufficiently.
""If we do make headway, and the president thinks we're close enough that he can close the deal on major issues, then I think he'll want to have a meeting and do that,"" he told reporters. ""I have complete confidence in the president, both to close a deal if we get to that point, but also to make that judgment.""
Trump has vowed to increase U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent currently if the two sides cannot reach a deal by 12:01 a.m. (0501 GMT) on March 2.
CNBC reported that the tariffs were likely to remain at the 10 percent rate. Three sources familiar with the matter indicated that report was wrong. The president has said repeatedly that the tariffs would go up if no deal has been reached, and that position has not changed, one source said. 

Lighthizer said last week that tariffs had not been a subject of the talks.

(Reuters) -  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT) posted a surprise fourth-quarter profit on Thursday, as the toymaker benefited from a makeover of its iconic Barbie doll, while keeping a tight lid on costs, sending its shares soaring 19 percent in extended trading.
Barbie ended the year with its highest gross sales in five years, Mattel said, highlighting the company's success in diversifying the traditionally blonde doll by giving it different skin tones and dressing it in attires ranging from hijabs to space suits.
""Barbie has got every career a girl could aspire to and especially in the current environment ... female empowerment is huge and that's really helping Barbie do well at retail,"" said Jackie Breyer, editorial director at trade magazine the Toy Book.
The Barbie Dreamhouse, which retails for $200, was among the top ten best-selling toys in the United States in 2018, according to market research firm NPD group.
Gross sales rose 12 percent for Barbie and 9 percent for Hot Wheels in the fourth quarter, handily beating analysts' estimates for both brands.
To tap into the renewed popularity of the doll, Mattel has partnered with Warner Bros. to make a live-action feature movie on Barbie, starring Oscar-nominated actress Margot Robbie.
COST CONTROL 
The company also benefited from its plans to streamline its operations, with costs falling 27 percent to $814.7 million in the quarter. 
Mattel has been aiming to cut at least $650 million in net costs by the end of 2019 through job cuts and other measures such as looking at options for its manufacturing facilities.
""Restoring profitability for the company this year has been the core focus,"" Chief Executive Officer Ynon Kreiz told Reuters, adding that he expects Mattel to exceed its cost-saving target.
Mattel reported net income of $14.9 million, or 4 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $281.3 million, or 82 cents per share, a year earlier, when it took a one-time charge related to changes in U.S. tax laws. 
Analysts had expected a loss of 16 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
However, gross sales in North America fell 10.1 percent to $744.5 million, reflecting Mattel's struggles with finding a major retailer to make up for lost sales from the shuttering of Toys 'R' Us.

Overall, Mattel's net revenue fell 5.4 percent to $1.52 billion, but was still above analysts' estimates of $1.44 billion.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) said on Thursday it will start adding the price of its medicines to television commercials by next month, becoming the first drugmaker to heed a call by U.S. President Donald Trump for price transparency of drugs advertised directly to consumers on TV.
The healthcare conglomerate said it will include both the list price of a product - the price before any rebates or discounts to insurers or pharmacy benefit managers - as well as potential out-of-pocket costs that patients will pay.
The move, announced in a statement on J&J's website, won swift praise from U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Last May, Azar's office released a blueprint for reducing the cost of drug prices, which included a proposal to require disclosure of list prices in TV ads for drugs.
""We commend Johnson & Johnson for recognizing the value of informing consumers about list prices and for doing so voluntarily. We call on other manufacturers to follow their lead,"" Azar said in a statement.
Trump made lowering the cost of prescription drugs for U.S. consumers a central issue of the 2016 presidential campaign and emphasized it again in his State of the Union Address this week.
Ads for the blood thinner Xarelto, J&J's most widely prescribed medicine, will be the first television spot to include pricing information, the company said. The treatment used to prevent blood clots costs about $450 to $540 a month.
Congress has increased its scrutiny of U.S. drug pricing since Democrats took over control of the House of Representatives in January, while pressure is also coming from the Republican-led Senate.

Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, ranking member of the committee, on Monday invited executives from seven pharmaceutical companies, including J&J, to testify at a Feb. 26 hearing on rising drug prices.

1627,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 06:50PM ET</span>","New York Grand Hyatt, Trump's first big project, faces demolition","By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York developer and a partner plan to demolish the Grand Hyatt New York, the hotel that launched U.S. President Donald Trump's real estate career in Manhattan decades ago, the two companies said on Thursday.
Developer TF Cornerstone and MSD Partners, which manages the assets of Dell Technologies founder Michael Dell and his family, said they would develop 2 million square feet (186,000 square metres) of office and retail space and a new luxury Grand Hyatt Hotel.
The redevelopment would be in collaboration with an affiliate of Hyatt Hotels Corp, TF Cornerstone and MSD Partners said in a statement.
The Grand Hyatt is immediately east of the Grand Central train station on 42nd Street and was the former Commodore Hotel, a derelict stone building built in 1919 that Trump gutted and re-skinned with a glass facade after its purchase in 1978.
The hotel was Trump's first success in Manhattan after he started in real estate with his father, a wealthy developer in the New York City borough of Queens where the president grew up. Entering Manhattan established Trump's name as a businessman and made him a source of tabloid fascination. 
The new development would provide new subway entrances and enhanced connectivity to the subway system underneath Grand Central, and a significant increase in tax revenue, according to the statement.
The project marks a further step in the revitalization of east Midtown where a 1,401-foot (427-m) skyscraper, One Vanderbilt, is rising next to Grand Central on its west side, and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) plans to build a new headquarters nearby on Park Avenue.
State and city approval is required and construction financing must be arranged, the statement said. 
The project may deter potential tenants from relocating to Hudson Yards, a district rising on Manhattan's West Side where a number of marquee companies have decided to relocate.
""This will be a draw for new office tenants and potentially lure tenants away that would have otherwise considered Hudson Yards,"" said Myers Mermel, chief executive and co-founder of TenantWise, a real estate research and advisory firm.
""It will re-establish Midtown East as the pre-eminent office district,"" he said.

1630,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 06:11PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. The Strange Case of PG&E Stock
As usual, the earnings calendar thins out on Friday, but there are still companies of note reporting.
The most interesting will likely be Pacific Gas & Electric (NYSE:PCG), which is in the rare position of having filed bankruptcy only to see its stock remain above 12-month lows.
PG&E filed for Chapter 11 protection at the end of January in anticipation of liabilities for California wildfires.
The stock is down about 70% in the last three months, trading around $13.50, which is well above its 52-week low of $5.07 seen at the height of the liability concern.
For earnings, the company is expected to post a profit of 63 cents per share on revenue of about $4.3 billion, according to Investing.com estimates.
Also reporting tomorrow will be toymaker Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS).
Analysts forecast quarterly earnings of $1.68 a share, with sales of about $1.5 billion.
Any discussions of the impact of the trade war between the U.S. and China will be carefully parsed, as toys are one of the products hit hard by tariffs. Both countries are still at an impasse as a March deadline looms.
2. Rig Count May Counter Politics
Oil prices were weaker today on geopolitics, as Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak poured cold water over Saudi Arabia's reported hopes to lure Moscow and the group of 10 non-OPEC oil producers it leads into a formal pact.
But tomorrow traders get more data on which to hang their hats.
The Baker Hughes rig count arrives tomorrow at 1 PM ET (18:00 GMT).
The rig reading has been volatile lately, rising by 10 units and falling by 21 in the previous two weeks. And while the current number may mark a nine-month low, it is still higher than a year ago, when only 765 rigs were active.
Reuters suggested that last week’s rig count drop could be due to some drillers following through with plans from last year to spend less on new oil wells when crude prices were crashing to the low $40s.
3. Watch for Trade Jawboning
Investors should be on the lookout for any updates or comments from officials on the U.S.-China trade war tomorrow.
There was pessimism about progress today after CNBC reported that a meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping was ""highly unlikely"" before the March 1 deadline set by the U.S. for reaching a trade deal.
But there were signals Thursday that the tariff increases could be delayed.
Often when the market struggles following discouraging trade news, bulls can count on a tweet from Trump or optimistic comments from administration officials to spark hopes for progress."

The warning adds to signs that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is pushing for a blanket ban on Chinese companies from new 5G wireless networks, autonomous vehicles and other lucrative contracts in the technology sector throughout Europe, North America and other American allies. It comes as the EU weighs the introduction of a new sanctions regime against companies or countries involved in cyber-espionage and intellectual property theft.
“There are no compelling reasons that I can see to do business with the Chinese, so long as they have the structure in place to reach in and manipulate or spy on their customers,” Ambassador Gordon Sondland, Trump’s envoy in Brussels, said Thursday in an interview. “Those who are charging ahead blindly and embracing the Chinese technology without regard to these concerns may find themselves in a disadvantage in dealing with us.”
Depending on the Chinese equipment used by Western countries, the U.S. may have to be “more careful in sharing information, in transacting business,” and a “host of things,” Sondland said. He urged European countries to pick Finnish and other Scandinavian companies for their 5G contracts, citing a Chinese law that allegedly compels any private company in the country to cooperate with the government “on any intelligence matters in secret and without refusal.”
Senior European officials have echoed Sondland’s concerns. In an interview last month, Andrus Ansip, European Commission vice president for digital affairs, said China’s National Intelligence Law, passed in 2017, has increased the risk in dealing with Chinese companies in Europe. The law mandates any organization and citizen to support and assist national intelligence in their investigations and to keep information related to such investigations.
While Ansip stopped short of urging restrictions for Chinese companies, he urged “all the governments, all the responsible people, to deal with the risk assessment in a very serious way.” No EU-wide law has been introduced on the matter to date, and any restrictions on 5G contracts for national security reasons remain a decision for individual nations.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.87%. The S&P 500 lost 0.94%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.18%.
Hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal were thrown into doubt as CNBC reported that a meeting between Trump and Xi is ""highly unlikely"" to take place before March 1, after which, in the absence of a deal, the U.S. could impose another round of tariffs and raise duties on imports to 25% from 10%.
Without a deal, many fear the tit-for-tat tariff exchange between the two nations could resume, pressuring global economic growth, potentially undoing the strong stock gains seen so far this year.
The U.S. has slapped tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, about half the value of U.S. imports from the country. China has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion worth of American exports.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), widely viewed as barometers of trade given their large international exposure, fell 1%, dragging industrials lower.
Beyond trade, falling energy stocks deepened losses in the broader market as U.S. oil prices fell 2% on fears that a prolonged U.S.-China trade war could hurt global oil demand growth, pressuring prices.
Tech stocks, meanwhile, were led sharply lower by a plunge in Twitter.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) fell 9.8% as the company’s better-than-expected quarterly results played second fiddle to first-quarter guidance, which fell short of estimates.
Other social media companies, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP), also ended the day in the red.

Ladhabhoy, a managing director, will be based at Barclays' Menlo Park, California office and will start in the spring. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. 
He will report to Laurence Braham and Greg Dalvito, co-heads of Technology Banking. Brian Yick is the other co-head of the Internet group. 
Barclays is adding to its internet banking division, as this year is expected to be a record breaking one for Internet IPOs. Reuters has reported that ride sharing companies Uber and Lyft have filed confidentially for offerings, while Pinterest has also hired banks for an IPO. 
Barclays last year hired another banker from Deustche Bank, Ed Wehle to focus on technology services deals. It also brought on Mark Zanoli in January, formerly of UBS Group AG, as vice chairman of technology investment banking. 

Barclays has been active on numerous large deals in the technology space recently, including KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC) Corp's $3.4 billion acquisition of Orbotech Ltd, II-VI Inc's $3.2 purchase of Finisar Corp, and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Inc's $2.35 billion buyout of Duo Security.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Thursday it is investing more than $1 billion in its Chicago operations and adding 500 jobs as it prepares to launch three new SUVs this year and end production of the Taurus.
Ford said it is building a new body shop and paint shop at its Chicago Assembly plant, and making major modifications to the final assembly area. At Chicago Stamping, Ford is adding stamping lines, the company added.
The investment comes as Americans continue to shift away from cars in favor of SUVs, pickup trucks and other larger vehicles. Last year, U.S. industry car sales fell 13 percent, while light trucks rose 8 percent to 10.9 million, accounting for about 63 percent of vehicle sales.
Ford announced last year it was largely exiting the sedan market in the United States with the exception of the Ford Mustang. The company's U.S. car sales fell 18 percent last year, while SUV sales rose 0.5 percent.
The Chicago assembly plant will stop building the Ford Taurus at this end of this month as it boosts SUV production. Ford said last year it was ending North American production of cars like the Focus, Fusion, Fiesta and C-Max.
The full-size Taurus, when introduced in 1985, was credited with reviving profits at Ford. It redefined U.S. car design with its jelly bean shape and was the top-selling model in the United States five times between 1992 and 1997. U.S. Taurus sales, which peaked at 409,000 in 1992, fell to 28,706 last year.
The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker is eager to highlight that it is building more vehicles than its rivals do in the United States. Ford built nearly 2.4 million vehicles in the United States in 2018.
""We are furthering our commitment to America with this billion-dollar manufacturing investment in Chicago and 500 more good-paying jobs,"" said Joe Hinrichs, president of global operations.
By contrast, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) announced in November it would halt production at five plants in North America, including four in Michigan, Ohio and Maryland, as it cuts about 15,000 jobs.
GM announced this week it will add 1,000 workers to build new heavy-duty pickup trucks in Flint, Michigan. GM is also ending North American production of six car models.

Ford said last month it will slash ""thousands"" of jobs in Europe as part of an overhaul that could result in plant closures and the discontinuation of some models.

By Simon Jessop and Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - A record number of 'socially conscious' mutual funds and exchange-traded funds were launched by asset managers last year, keen to tap growing demand from retail investors.
A total of 382 such funds were launched globally during 2018 to take the total to 3,160, industry tracker Morningstar said. Collectively, they manage $1.2 trillion in assets, double the $622 billion managed in 2009.
Total flows into the funds were $39 billion, down from the prior year's $72 billion, in part as a result of weaker investor sentiment that saw global stock markets sell off on fears tighter central bank monetary policy could hit economic growth.

(Graphic: Demand for socially conscious funds on the rise - https://tmsnrt.rs/2SkqcZm)
""Over 2018, you really saw ESG adopted across the industry,"" said Anastasia Georgiou, Director of Product Management at Morningstar, referring to the environmental, social and governance-related issues (ESG) that help determine what to include or exclude from the funds.
However, there is currently no clear-cut regulatory or industry standard for 'sustainable' investing, a gray area policymakers are concerned could mislead investors.
""Most of the industry seems to have adopted ESG, but how people are applying it is different. From an investors' perspective they want to be able to compare these ESG measures on a like-for-like basis,"" said Morningstar's Georgiou.
A broader measure of investing ""sustainably"" used by the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance, which includes institutional money and funds not explicitly badged as ESG but which use some measure of ESG in their investment process, put total assets at $23 trillion at end-2016.
Calls from policymakers for better oversight of the sector have become louder as governments, particularly in Europe, look to help the financial industry better allocate capital in the global fight against climate change.
European Union rulemakers have proposed tightening the rules. ""We see divergences and differences between difference types of products... some are clearly more 'green' than others,"" a European Commission official said.
In France, the government has launched a certificate to help identify sustainable funds, while in Britain trade body the Investment Association has proposed a series of changes aimed at shoring up confidence in the sector.
As well as marketing some funds explicitly as socially responsible, most fund managers are also weaving the principles into their mainstream products on the basis that it can help avoid riskier investments.

(Graphic: Fund and ETF statistics - https://tmsnrt.rs/2TmJz17) 
The move is being driven by major institutional investors such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies, many of which want ESG risk assessed more fully.
A survey by New City Initiative, a fund-backed industry group, found 90.5 percent of its members incorporated ESG-related assessments into their investment process in some way.

1662,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 03:43PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. opens probe into Brazilian oil bribery scheme - sources,"By Gary McWilliams
(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is investigating a former U.S.-based oil trader for Brazil's Petrobras already charged in his home country with taking part in a corruption scheme involving commodity companies Vitol SA,  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) PLC and Trafigura AG, according to people familiar with the matter.
It was the first confirmation that U.S. investigators have joined a new phase of Brazil's ""Car Wash"" corruption probe, which has toppled presidents in two countries and sent more than 130 politicians and businessmen to jail across Latin America.
The U.S. Attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York is talking to Rodrigo Garcia Berkowitz, a Houston-based oil trader wanted on charges in Brazil for accepting millions of dollars in kickbacks for himself and others, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.
Berkowitz, 39, is cooperating with U.S. authorities in the investigation and could face charges in the United States, one of the people said, although he has not been currently charged.
Berkowitz could not be reached for comment through associates, phone or emails, and it was not immediately known what law firm was representing him. 
Brazilian prosecutors said executives of the commodities companies, including some in the United States, were involved in improper payments to executives at state-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA, and that Berkowitz and others worked directly with those firms. 
Vitol, Glencore, Trafigura and others collectively paid at least $31 million in bribes over a six-year period to Petrobras officials to secure advantages in deals, Brazilian prosecutors said. 
The New York case signals prosecutors there are examining the U.S. arms of Vitol and others implicated by Brazilian officials, as some of those funds moved through U.S. and European banking systems. 
Bribes paid to Petrobras moved through bank accounts in the United States, Britain, Sweden, Switzerland and Uruguay, Brazilian authorities have said, opening an avenue for U.S. prosecutors to probe for violations of U.S. money laundering laws. 
In December, Mike Loya, the Houston-based head of Vitol's U.S. operations, was named in Brazilian charging documents against Berkowitz and others of having full knowledge of the trading scheme. Loya has not been charged. He did not reply to requests for comment.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Bini is handling the case, the people said. Reached by phone, Bini declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department declined to comment.
Federal prosecutors in Brazil declined on Thursday to say if they were collaborating with the U.S. Justice Department on the case. 
Investigators from New York's Eastern District office have worked hand-in-hand with Brazilian prosecutors on the Car Wash probe in the past. In late 2016, they jointly negotiated with construction firm Odebrecht that resulted in a $2.6 billion fine and access to company executives who could provide testimony about decades of bribes paid across Latin America.
Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore declined to comment on the U.S. investigation. Vitol and Glencore reiterated past statements that they are cooperating with Brazilian authorities, and Trafigura said it takes the allegations seriously. All have been suspended from business dealings with Petrobras. 
Brazil issued an Interpol red notice in early December calling Berkowitz a fugitive from prosecution and requesting his detention. The U.S. Marshals office in Houston said this month it has not received a request to arrest Berkowitz. 
U.S. authorities two months ago arrested Luiz Eduardo Loureiro Andrade, a Brazilian businessman, over allegations he funneled bribes to Petrobras officials from Vitol and others, according to Brazilian court documents. 

Andrade, Berkowitz and nine others were charged in Brazil in December with allegations they funneled business to Vitol and other trading firms between 2011 and 2014. Andrade could not be located to request comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks sank more than 1 percent on Thursday as worries that the United States and China would not be able to reach a trade deal intensified earlier concerns about slowing global economic growth.
President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were unlikely to meet by an early March deadline set by the two countries for reaching a deal, two U.S. administration officials and a source familiar with the negotiations said.
That news came after White House adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox Business Network there was a ""pretty sizable distance"" between the countries, which are set to resume discussions in Beijing next week.
""Any concern that the stalemate won't be overcome by China and the U.S. is going to create negative sentiment for the markets just because trade is the single largest overhang,"" said Mike Loewengart, vice-president of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial in New York.
Among the S&P 500's major sectors, only the defensive utilities and real estate indexes were positive, illustrating Thursday's risk-off sentiment.
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index tumbled 2.7 percent. Chipmakers get a large chunk of their revenue from Chinese customers.
Wall Street had already been under pressure after the European Commission slashed its euro zone growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020 due to an expected slowdown in the largest countries of the bloc, partly on trade tensions.
""There's a resurfacing of global growth fears, which has pushed U.S. stocks down,"" said Veronica Willis, investment strategy analyst at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis. ""There are still some concerns surrounding trade, and I think those issues will linger for some time.""
Disappointing financial forecasts from several U.S. companies, including  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), have also given investors pause.
More than half of S&P 500 companies have reported fourth-quarter results, with about 71 percent beating profit estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. However, current-quarter earnings growth estimates have shrunk to 0.1 percent from 5.3 percent at the start of the year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 285.26 points, or 1.12 percent, to 25,105.04, the S&P 500 lost 34.55 points, or 1.26 percent, to 2,697.06 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 105.41 points, or 1.43 percent, to 7,269.87.
Energy stocks fell 2.3 percent, the largest percentage drop among S&P 500 sectors, as crude prices sank on worries of tapering demand as a result of trade tensions.
Twitter shares tumbled 9.6 percent after the social media company forecasted that revenue in the first quarter would be weaker than expected and that its full-year operating costs would rise.
SunTrust Banks Inc (NYSE:STI) shares jumped 8.8 percent after the bank agreed to be bought for about $28 billion in stock by fellow regional lender BB&T Corp (NYSE:BBT), whose shares rose 2.6 percent.
The prospects of further deals sparked gains in other regional banks, although a drop in the large Wall Street lenders led to declines in the S&P 500 banks and financials indexes.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.74-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.37-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 27 new lows.

Confirming its earlier signals, Australia's Qantas said it would not take any more of the giant planes and would stick at a fleet of 12 instead of 20 originally ordered.
The cancellation comes after the A380's largest customer, Emirates, began discussions with Airbus over switching some A380 orders to smaller models after it failed to secure an engine contract for its latest batch of orders, Reuters reported last week.
Barring a surprise agreement to prop up the A380, Airbus is preparing to close production of the double-decker earlier than planned and could make a detailed announcement as early as its annual results on Feb 14, people familiar with the matter said.
""It is the end of the A380,"" an industry source said.
Airbus declined comment.
The spacious 544-seat, four-engined A380 is widely seen as a success with passengers but has come under pressure due to advances in the efficiency of the largest twin-engined jets.
At the opposite end of its portfolio, Airbus also reported the cancellation of orders for five of its smallest model, the 110-seat A220-100, a monthly order tally showed. Airbus recently acquired the A220 program from Canada's Bombardier.
The five planes had previously been assigned to unnamed government or private buyers.
The combined cancellations meant that Airbus began the year with a negative net total of 13 orders after unusually failing to win any new business during January. 
It delivered 39 jets in the same month.
Airbus, whose management has stressed the need to overcome recent glitches in the supply chain and focus on delivering jets against a record backlog of orders, played down the lack of any new orders in the first month of the year.
""One month does not make a year,"" a spokesman said.
The company is expected to give 2019 forecasts on Feb 14.
U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) won the order race against Airbus last year. It has yet to publish data for January this year.

Other regional banks, including Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG), up 2.8%, Cincinnati Financial (NASDAQ:CINF), up 3.1%, and Comerica (NYSE:CMA), up 5.2%, rallied on the news, keeping lid on losses in financials.
The S&P 500 Financial sector was down 1.3% for the day.
Under the terms of the deal, BB&T (NYSE:BBT) shareholders will own about 57% of the newly-formed company while SunTrust Banks (NYSE:STI) shareholders will own the remaining 43%.
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter and generate $1.6 billion in cost synergies by 2022 for the combined bank, according to the companies.
Both stocks have been trading at heavy discounts to historical price-to-earnings averages since November, with the market concerned about the lack of meaningful catalysts. But the merger opens the door to lower costs and higher profits, analysts said.
""This merger shows how banks can reduce expenses and increase profitability in what many consider to be a lackluster operating environment,"" Piper Jaffrary said.
The deal, the largest big bank deal since the financial crisis, cranked up the rumor mill with many speculating the decade-long slumber in merger activity within the regional banking sector may be coming to an end.
""We expect the market to cheer the news of the merger and all regional bank stocks to rally as we sort out who might be next,"" Piper Jaffray added."

The company beat comparable-restaurant sales estimates by the biggest margin in nearly two years on Wednesday, driven by Niccol's decision to focus on food delivery and partner with services Doordash and Postmates.
Niccol, the former head of Taco bell where he introduced mobile ordering, also gave a marketing blitz to Chipotle to highlight the freshness of ingredients used in its tacos and burritos.
Wall Street was convinced that Chipotle's December quarter was not a just a flash in the pan and more of a sign of things to come, as it comes out of the shadow of food safety scares that plagued it over three years ago. 
""Chipotle's fourth-quarter update offered the clearest evidence to date that it has corrected organizational issues that led to underwhelming customer experience the past several years,"" Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy said.
At least 13 analysts raised their price target on the stock to as high as $650, a level Chipotle's shares have not seen since 2015 when a raft of food safety lapses wreaked havoc on the company's reputation and stock price.
Chipotle shares were last up 13.8 percent at $598.62, touching a three-year high. 
The company's traffic growth of 2 percent is among the best in the restaurant industry, with acceleration expected throughout 2019, Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said.
The California-based company is also working to freshen up its menu with quesadillas and Mexican chocolate milkshakes to incentivise customers who are tired of burritos and tacos. 
""To those who argue/worry that those are specific, non-repeatable promotions, we would argue that there are plenty of ideas still to come and that the convenience and speed that digital & delivery offer has created new, incremental occasions,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst John Glass said.

1671,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 12:32PM ET</span>",BB&T to buy SunTrust in biggest U.S. bank deal in a decade,"By Aparajita Saxena, Imani Moise and Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) - A more permissive regulatory environment culminated Thursday in the biggest bank merger since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and more deals are likely, analysts and investors said.
U.S. regional lender BB&T Corp (NYSE:BBT) said it will buy rival SunTrust Banks Inc (NYSE:STI) for about $28 billion in stock. 
The banks hope to close the deal later this year. The timetable would have been improbable before the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump began easing crisis-era regulations, which had restricted expansion and boosted scrutiny of banks.
The merger will pressure other regional banks to consider their own deals, analysts said. 
""The BB&T/SunTrust merger will open more eyes on the potential for more sizeable bank M&A to occur,"" Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin wrote in a client note. 
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) Chief Executive Brian Moynihan this year predicted a new wave of big bank mergers at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
BB&T and SunTrust said the combined bank would produce annual cost savings of around $1.6 billion by 2022. In a CNBC interview, executives said the merger would allow them to invest more heavily in new technology demanded by customers.
""The business has been changing and will be changing,"" SunTrust Chief Executive William Rogers said. ""This gives us the opportunity to be absolutely the most competitive bank.""
The combined company will operate under a new name and have around $442 billion in assets, $301 billion in loans and $324 billion in deposits. It will rival U.S. Bancorp, which has about $467 billion in assets.
Its footprint will cover the U.S. East Coast, with new corporate headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. The combined company will retain operations in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and Atlanta, the home markets for both companies.
The two banks have long been considered natural partners and advisers said they do not expect another bank to make a bid. Hostile takeovers are rare in the banking world. 
'POWERFUL COMPANY'
The banks struck the deal from a position of strength, analysts said. Each reported strong fourth-quarter earnings last month and there were no signs of pressure near to mid-term, said Terry McEvoy, managing director at Stephens.
""The end result of the transaction is a very powerful company in some of the best markets in the United States,"" he said. 
Analysts largely expect regulators to approve the deal, although it will likely draw scrutiny from vocal bank critics like U.S. senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. 
The combined company will remain comfortably under the asset threshold that would make it a systematically important financial institution, sparing it increased regulatory scrutiny. 
Shares of Atlanta-based SunTrust jumped 8.3 percent to $63.62, above the acquisition price, while BB&T rose 2.4 percent to $49.71.
McEvoy said he expects the market's positive reaction to the deal to drive similar transactions throughout the year. Regional bank stocks, including KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Inc and Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) rallied on Thursday.
Super regional banks, with typically have between $50 billion and $500 billion in assets, have been grappling with how to grow with fewer resources than the four largest U.S. banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corp.
The talks between the two banks began in 2018, according to advisers. Even though BB&T shareholders will end up with a majority of shares, a key point for SunTrust was that the deal would treat the banks as equals.
The two banks have hundreds of branches within two miles of each other, but they serve different segments of the market. SunTrust has more of a commercial focus and larger clients, while BB&T has a substantial insurance business.
WAVE OF DEALMAKING?
Deal activity in the banking sector languished after the financial crisis a decade ago as stricter rules were imposed on lenders with more than $50 billion in assets and regulators barred banks with compliance issues from expanding. 
Changes in U.S. tax laws have lowered corporate taxes, freeing up capital, and Wall Street has long been expecting a wave of dealmaking in banking.
On Dec. 7, the Federal Reserve Board quickly approved two of the largest bank mergers of the year, Cadence Bancorp’s merger with State Bank Financial Corporation and Synovus Financial Corp’s merger with FCB Financial Holdings. 
A Wachtell Lipton memo said the speed of the approvals was evidence of an ""increasingly favorable regulatory environment for bank M&A.""
As part of the deal, SunTrust shareholders will receive 1.295 shares of BB&T for each share they own. The per share deal value of $62.85 is at a 7 percent premium to SunTrust's closing price on Wednesday, according to a Reuters calculation. 
BB&T shareholders will own 57 percent of the combined company and SunTrust will own the rest. 
Analyst Stephen Scouten of brokerage Sandler O'Neill said he expected the deal to get regulatory approval. ""These are both very clean banks. So ultimately, (it) should get done."" 
Kelly King, BB&T's chief executive officer, will be CEO of the combined company until Sept. 12, 2021, after which SunTrust CEO Rogers will take over.
The two companies called it a merger of equals, valued at $66 billion.

RBC and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advised BB&T while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) along with the investment banking unit of SunTrust and Sullivan & Cromwell advised SunTrust.

1676,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 12:10PM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler shares tumble as 2019 guidance disappoints,"By Agnieszka Flak and Paul Lienert
MILAN/DETROIT (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler (FCA) shares fell 12 percent on Thursday after weaker-than-expected guidance for profits and industrial free cash flow this year raised doubts about the Italian-American carmaker's longer-term targets. 
Chief Executive Mike Manley sought to persuade investors that the 2020 goals - set by late boss Sergio Marchionne - were still achievable, especially if the carmaker's North American profit engine keeps spinning, new product launches lift margins and steps to fix weaknesses elsewhere pay off.
""I wouldn't put 2020 out of the picture. It's something that's still very much there,"" the 54-year-old Briton told analysts on a call, adding the pending launches of the new Jeep Gladiator and Ram heavy-duty pickup would help drive sales.
But the comments did little to reassure investors who worry about FCA's over-reliance on one region, its weak performance in China and persistently low profitability in Europe. 
Weaker margins in North America in the last quarter compared with the previous three months also raised concerns, especially given stiff competition in the SUV and truck markets that are vital for FCA, and the fact U.S. demand is starting to slow.
""The U.S. market remains key for near term growth,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst, adding he would be watching how the sales of higher-margin pickups and utility vehicles develop in the second part of 2019 and next year.
Milan-listed FCA shares closed down 12.2 percent, their biggest daily drop since a profit warning on July 25, when the news of Marchionne's death was also announced. 
Thursday's share drop also weighed on U.S. rivals General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford.
OPEN TO PARTNERSHIPS
FCA promised in June to deliver 2020 adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) - excluding the Magneti Marelli unit it has agreed to sell - of 9.2-10.4 billion euros. 
On Thursday, the world's seventh-largest carmaker said it expected 2019 adjusted EBIT of more than 6.7 billion euros ($7.6 billion). That is below analysts' average forecast of 7.3 billion euros and suggests little improvement on 2018, when FCA posted an adjusted EBIT on the same basis of 6.7 billion euros. 
Guidance for industrial free cash flow of more than 1.5 billion euros was also down from last year's outcome, due to higher capital spending, fines and other costs related to its U.S. settlement for diesel emissions infringements. 
Last year's results came in roughly in line with analysts' expectations, with North America accounting for 85.5 percent of profits. 
FCA has retooled some U.S. plants to boost output of lucrative SUVs and trucks, while ending production of unprofitable sedans, and helping make up for weakness in Asia, Europe and at luxury brand Maserati.
FCA's operations in Europe, long plagued by low plant utilization rates, were hit by the transition towards tougher emissions tests which became mandatory from September. 
The carmaker pledged to spend 5 billion euros on new models and engines in Italy to try make better use of factories and boost jobs and margins.
Chinese market weakness weighed on FCA's performance in Asia and hit Maserati sales, which Manley does not expect to pick up until the later part of this year. The brand's 2018 margins slumped to 5.7 percent from 13.8 percent a year earlier.
Manley said FCA was open to partnerships to gain scale and drive down costs, but only with companies that ""have very similar values to us.""
""We can either find scale within our brands, and we have opportunity to do that, or we can find it with a partnership,"" he said. 
Capital spending is forecast to rise this year and next, in part to fund the 2020 redesign of the high-margin Jeep Grand Cherokee and the introduction of an all-new Jeep Grand Wagoneer, both of which should bolster profits. 

FCA's global portfolio lacks a mid-size pickup truck, a product the company had promised by 2022, and Manley said the company was still considering whether to approve production.

1677,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 12:10PM ET</span>",U.S. farm finances 'relatively stable' despite China trade war: Nutrien,"By Rod Nickel
(Reuters) - U.S. farmers are in ""relatively stable"" financial health despite a bruising trade war between the United States and China that has weakened crop prices, the chief executive of farm supplier Nutrien Ltd said on Thursday.
Farmer bankruptcies in 2018 were lower than the previous year, and below the 10-year average, CEO Chuck Magro said on a quarterly conference call.
Farmers' increasing debt is largely due to purchases of land, the value of which has been firm, he said. Nutrien has also seen an increase this year in pre-payments for crop inputs such as seed, fertilizer and chemicals.
""Their balance sheets are relatively stable,"" Magro said. ""What we have to worry about is liquidity and the cash flow from the farms. That comes down to margins.""
Prices of U.S. soybeans, which face steep tariffs in China, are down year over year, but have recouped some of their losses since hitting a low point last summer.
Magro said he expects farmer economics to improve in 2019.
Nutrien is the world's biggest fertilizer producer and sells directly to U.S. farmers via a large chain of retail supply stores.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said in November that U.S. net farm income for 2018 was likely to decline by 12 percent to $66.3 billion.
U.S. Farm Credit chief executives warned White House officials in January that 2019 could cause more financial losses for farmers if the trade dispute with China is not resolved.

A trade settlement between the U.S. and China would boost crop prices and lift ""a cloud of uncertainty"" from the sector, Magro said.

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 11:40AM ET</span>",U.S. commercial paper supply retreats from four-and-a-half month peak,"By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. commercial paper supply decreased this week, retreating from a 4-1/2-month high, as fund managers took a breather from their recent purchases of these debt securities, according to Federal Reserve data released on Thursday.
Investors have been shifting more cash into money market funds, which are major buyers of commercial paper, since early December, which has likely encouraged companies to step up their issuance of these securities.
Commercial paper outstanding fell $8.9 billion to $1.081 trillion in the week ended Feb. 6. A week ago, it reached $1.090 trillion, the highest level since the week of Sept. 19.
Companies issue this type of debt to fund their payrolls and inventories, and banks and dealers use them to finance their loans and trading positions.
After adjusting for seasonal factors, the size of the commercial paper market declined from its the highest level in about 1-1/2 months.
It fell by $21.5 billion, which was its steepest seasonally adjusted decline since the week of Feb. 21, 2018, to $1.057 trillion in the latest week.

Meanwhile, investors put more cash into money funds in the latest week.
Money fund assets grew by $12.41 billion to $3.019 trillion in the week ended Feb. 5, iMoneyNet said on Wednesday.
Prime money funds, which can own commercial paper in addition to Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and agency discount notes, recorded $9.7 billion in inflows in the latest week, according to iMoneyNet.
At the end of December, prime funds owned $304.2 billion, or 39.8 percent of their total holdings in commercial paper, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission data showed.

1696,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 10:15AM ET</span>","GrubHub results, forecast miss estimates, shares tank","By Shariq Khan
(Reuters) - GrubHub Inc reported lower-than-expected quarterly results on Thursday and forecast adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the full year below Wall Street estimates, sending its shares down 21 percent to a two-year low.
The online food delivery company expects first quarter adjusted EBITDA between $40 million and $50 million and for the full year between $235 million and $265 million.
Analysts were expecting EBITDA to be $58.48 million for the first quarter and $284.16 million for the year.
""GrubHub does not have any long lasting competitive advantage and at some point it needs to spend much more to keep getting more people to use its app,"" Morningstar Research Services analyst Ali Mogharabi told Reuters.
""This is coming to fruition where the bigger names like Uber Eats have been eating into GrubHub's market share in the US.""
For the fourth quarter, GrubHub results missed analysts' estimates as the company increased its spending on marketing and expansion activities to attract more people to its platforms.
GrubHub, which has been under heavy pressure from rivals Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) owned Amazon Restaurants and Uber Eats, has been an active player in the acquisitions market and spends heavily on expanding its delivery network and marketing activities.
The company said it spent $69.9 million on sales and marketing in the fourth quarter, an increase of nearly 54 percent.
Uber Eats could also raise the pressure on GrubHub if its deep-pocketed parent Uber Technologies Inc were to use some of the added funding it would get in a potential IPO which it has confidentially filed for with the U.S. SEC.
GrubHub reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $5.2 million, or 6 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to a profit of $53.5 million, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned 19 cents per share, missing analysts' average estimate of 28 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue rose about 40 percent to $287.7 million, also missing analysts estimate of $290.5 million.

1697,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2019 10:09AM ET</span>",Renault to alert prosecutors over ex-CEO Ghosn's wedding costs,"PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) has found evidence that it paid part of Carlos Ghosn's wedding costs and is preparing to turn the investigation over to prosecutors, two weeks after the French carmaker's scandal-hit chairman and chief executive was forced out.
An internal probe established that a 2016 sponsorship deal with the Chateau de Versailles included a 50,000 euro ($57,000) personal benefit to Ghosn, the carmaker said on Thursday, confirming a report in Le Figaro.
The carmaker replaced Ghosn on Jan. 24, more than two months after his arrest in Japan over allegations of financial misconduct uncovered by Renault's Japanese affiliate Nissan, which he also chaired.
Renault began its own examination of payments to Ghosn within days of his detention but had not flagged any irregularities until now.
Renault has discovered that ""Mr Ghosn was accorded a personal benefit valued at 50,000 euros under the terms of a sponsorship contract with the Chateau de Versailles"", the company said in a statement on Thursday.
""Renault has decided to bring these findings to the attention of the judicial authorities.""
The office of Ghosn's Japanese lawyer Motonari Otsuru did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ghosn remains in detention in Tokyo with limited opportunity to respond publicly to allegations against him.
Renault had agreed before the wedding to sponsor 2.3 million euros of Versailles renovations in return for a credit granting the carmaker services from the chateau worth 25 percent of that amount, or 575,000 euros, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The rental fee was deducted from Renault's credit for use of the Grand Trianon at Versailles on Oct. 8, 2016, when Ghosn and his second wife Carole hosted their wedding reception at the 17th-century palace, the source said. The event had already attracted public attention for its opulence and Marie Antoinette-themed costumes.
The Renault board was informed about the discovery on Wednesday, as reported by Le Figaro, the source added.

But bondholders as well as some Venezuelan politicians aligned with Juan Guaido, the U.S.-backed lawmaker trying to oust Maduro, are now actively lobbying to get JPMorgan to keep the debt in the index.
For creditors, the rationale is straight-forward: Removing Venezuela from the index would pressure them to dump the securities at rock-bottom prices. For those in Guaido’s camp, it’s a bit more complicated. Their concern is that by forcing mutual funds, ETFs and other traditional investors to unload the debt, it will wind up in the hands of hedge funds that are more aggressive and potentially even litigious in bond restructurings. That in turn will hurt their efforts to impose a sizable haircut on creditors -- a key part of their plan to stabilize the crisis-torn country if they manage to take power.
A group of Venezuelan lawmakers has been holding calls with officials at JPMorgan. They fear a messy debt restructuring akin to the one seen in Argentina after its 2001 default, which resulted in years of legal wrangling that left the country locked out of international capital markets for more than a decade. Already, some London-based hedge funds have shown an increased interest in Venezuelan debt on the possibility that it may soon become cheap.
“There have been conversations with JPMorgan,” said Carlos Paparoni, an opposition lawmaker and president of the congressional finance commission, adding that he didn’t personally take part in the talks. “Our interest is in a fast, trustworthy and friendly restructuring.”
Earlier this week, a contingent of creditors including Greylock Capital and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). met with Treasury Department officials to voice concerns that some of them would be required to sell at steep discounts if Venezuela was bounced from the index, according to three people familiar with the matter. The country’s benchmark notes due in 2027 last traded at about 33 cents on the dollar.
JPMorgan declined to comment, but on Monday confirmed that it was reviewing Venezuela’s inclusion in its indexes. Goldman Sachs and Greylock declined to comment. The Treasury Department didn’t respond to requests for comment.
While Venezuelan bonds for many years made up at least 5 percent of JPMorgan’s benchmark indexes, that weighting has declined to less than 2 percent more recently. Still, it was enough to compel the majority of emerging-market mutual funds to have some exposure to the debt, most of which fell into default over the past year and a half as Venezuela’s economy was battered by hyperinflation, declining oil production and widespread shortages.
But after last week’s measures by the Treasury Department all but halted trading in the bonds, JPMorgan is now reviewing whether the low liquidity disqualifies Venezuela from the indexes. Its guidelines don’t specify a time period for potential removal. Last April, the Russian aluminum producer Rusal was ejected from JPMorgan’s indexes three weeks after U.S. sanctions.
“Exclusion would mean technical forced selling,” said David Tawil, president and co-founder of Maglan Capital LP in New York. “It’s a big binary risk and there’s no telling how low bonds could go.”
Not all Venezuelan opposition members are pushing for the bonds to stay in JPMorgan’s indexes. One faction of lawmakers has touted the arguments made years earlier by Harvard economist Ricardo Hausmann, an informal adviser to Guaido, that the bonds should be stripped from the benchmark. His proposal at the time was for JPMorgan to create a “Decent Emerging Markets index” that would allow fund managers to invest in countries that adhere to ""minimal standards of respect for their citizens.""
Yet even Hausmann himself recognizes times are different today.
“In May 2017, Venezuela hadn’t defaulted on its debt,” he said. “The issues have changed.”
