(Reuters) - A surge in U.S. government bond yields to their highest level in almost seven years sent Wall Street shares sliding on Tuesday after strong retail sales data stoked inflation concerns and investors fretted about looming trade talks between the United States and China.
All three major U.S. stock indexes closed down, with the S&P 500 ending a four-day winning streak and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting its first loss in eight sessions.
The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes jumped to its highest level since July 2011, suggesting an uptick in inflation and sending the dollar index (DXY) to its highest close in 2018, raising expectations for further interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
""A combination of firm growth and higher interest rates is unnerving,"" said Anthony Chan, chief economist for Chase in New York. ""A stronger dollar means downward pressure. ... A creeping up of these things continues to keep the market nervous."" 
Core April retail sales - which excludes gasoline, automobiles, building materials and food services - rose at a brisker 0.4 percent monthly pace over March, as consumer spending is quickening its pace after a first-quarter slowdown.
Investors also remain preoccupied by the run-up to high-level talks between China and the United States set to commence this week in Washington. U.S. ambassador to China Terry Branstad said the two countries remain ""very far apart"" regarding a tariff resolution, after which White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Politico he supports efforts to reach an agreement.
""A little bit of today's jitters are related to a hangover to yesterday's wrongly placed exuberance that a trade deal was imminent, and the reality is we are in for a long slugfest between the U.S. and China,"" said Jon Mackay, investment strategist at  Schroders  (LON:SDR) North America in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 193 points, or 0.78 percent, to 24,706.41, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 18.68 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,711.45 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 59.69 points, or 0.81 percent, to 7,351.63.
The losses were broad-based, with all 11 major S&P sectors except energy (SPNY) closing down. Real estate <.SPLRCR>, healthcare (SPXHC) and technology (SPLRCT) stocks posted the biggest percentage losses. 
 Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) shares slipped 1.6 percent after the home improvement retailer missed sales forecasts as the long winter put a damper on demand for spring products. Smaller rival Lowe's Companies Inc (N:LOW) was down 1.0 percent.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.14-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and seven new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 51 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.60 billion shares, compared with the 6.67 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

3,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2018 10:49AM ET</span>",Triumvirate to run strike-hit Air France-KLM for now after pay row,"By Cyril Altmeyer and Victoria Bryan
PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) installed a triumvirate of executives led by its finance chief to run the strike-hit airline while it searches for a new CEO, following a standoff over staff pay.
Tuesday's move is designed to fill a gap left by the abrupt departure of chief executive Jean-Marc Janaillac after Air France staff earlier this month rejected a pay proposal aimed at ending a series of strikes that have resulted in heavy losses.
In a statement ahead of an annual shareholder meeting, Air France-KLM said the new three-person executive committee would comprise group Finance Director Frederic Gagey, who would take on the role of chief executive, and the existing heads of the two national brands that merged in 2004: Air France and KLM.
Shares in the group dropped after the announcement and were down 3.3 percent at 1344 GMT. 
Bernstein analysts said in a note that while the move provides some stability, a formal successor was still required. 
""Whoever that person is will face significant challenges throughout the business, from competitive threats in AF KLM's key markets, an emboldened union in France which is likely to ramp up its demands and the lack of a coherent long-term strategy,"" they wrote. 
Air France-KLM also named board member Anne-Marie Couderc as non-executive chairwoman.
""This transitional governance structure is established for the shortest-possible period required to effectively complete the succession process for the roles vacated by Jean-Marc Janaillac,"" the company said in a statement.
The interim leadership of Europe's second-largest network carrier by revenue will face French unions emboldened by the exit of Janaillac, who announced his resignation on May 4 after putting his job on the line as French staff voted on pay.
The French government, already locked in a battle over reforms at state railway operator SNCF, has said it will not bail out Air France - where a protracted dispute between management and unions over pay has resulted in 15 days of walkouts this year, costing the group 400 million euros ($479 million).
On Tuesday, an adviser to President Emmanuel Macron said the French government had no plans to reduce its 14.3 percent stake in Air France-KLM, but may not maintain this level forever.
In a sign that the board is ready to hold the line over the labor dispute at Air France, the statement said the French subsidiary's chief executive, Franck Terner, would not have a mandate to take any decisions that would jeopardize the growth strategy already approved by the board.
""The board is aware of the difficulties currently being traversed by Air France and requested to be kept regularly informed of the company's labor situation,"" it said.
Terner and KLM counterpart Pieter Elbers will remain in their posts and sit inside the top triumvirate alongside Gagey.
""It is important that, throughout the group, we restore the good spirit, cohesion, and stability that we had in the early days of our partnership,"" Elbers said in a statement. 
Speaking at the AGM, outgoing CEO Janaillac said the group had to work on that cohesion, plus improve its profit margins, which are below that of rivals. 

""We have to be strong to capture growth in this industry. If we do not grow as fast as rivals, then we will lose ground,"" Janaillac said on his final day at the company.

4,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2018 07:37AM ET</span>","A bid to save $300 million at HCR ManorCare, and disrupt U.S. healthcare","By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Thomas DeRosa is making a $4 billion bet that he can build a national, low-cost healthcare network for America's aging population that will succeed where so many other models have struggled.
His secret: strip out the ""for-profit"" business model, and leverage the real estate in nursing homes for outpatient care.
DeRosa's strategy starts with buying out the property of the huge bankrupt nursing home chain HCR ManorCare, and teaming up with a non-profit hospital operator, ProMedica, to create a 30-state healthcare system.
His own company, real estate investment trust Welltower Inc (N:WELL), is purchasing the ManorCare real estate for $2.7 billion under a deal unveiled April 24 and awaiting approval from a U.S. bankruptcy court.
ProMedica is buying ManorCare's operations for $1.3 billion and combining them with its own surgery centers, clinics and health plan to form a network with $7 billion of annual revenues and 70,000 employees.
""This is about a health system moving into a beleaguered sector of healthcare,"" DeRosa told Reuters in an interview. ""We're breaking down the wall of what has traditionally been acute care services and services for the aging.""
The aim is to strip out $300 million in costs from the operation, mainly from cheaper rent, once HCR ManorCare emerges from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy this year, according to interviews with Welltower and ProMedica executives.
ProMedica Chief Executive Randy Oostra expects the merger - which will propel the group into the 25 largest U.S. health systems by revenue alongside names like Mayo Clinic, Geisinger and Johns Hopkins - to boost margins by two percentage points to between 3 percent and 4 percent over the next few years.
ProMedica will also invest $400 million to revamp ManorCare's facilities, and size up every site as an opportunity for different services or partnerships.
And by turning non-profit under ProMedica's existing business model, ManorCare will see other annual cost savings of $30 million.
""It is a disruptor,"" Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at the New York University School of Medicine, said of the deal.
Yet the merged group must still overcome a perfect storm of eroding reimbursement rates, depressed occupancies, and competition from home health that has weighed on nursing facilities nation-wide.

A NEW APPROACH
The proposal comes at a time when companies from hospitals and pharmacy chains including  Tenet Healthcare  Corp (N:THC) and CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) to insurance providers and retailers like  Humana Inc  (N:HUM) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT) are jostling to create new healthcare models for an aging population as U.S. medical costs continue to soar.
Outside the health sector, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) has joined forces with  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) for a new model to help bring down healthcare costs.
REITs, including Welltower, invested heavily in skilled nursing centers at the turn of the decade but have struggled to collect, let alone raise, rents. Large REITs like  Ventas Inc  (N:VTR) have since abandoned the sector.
For hospitals, declining payments by Medicare - the largest payer for the 65 and over population - and declining admissions are driving a search for lower cost, non-hospital settings to deliver care, Oostra said.
Medicare penalties for patient readmissions are also forcing hospitals to follow up on recoveries, which often occur at a skilled nursing facility.
""Increasingly we're getting more focused on things that go on outside of our walls,"" Oostra told Reuters. He calls it a ""blurring of the lines"" in where clinical care starts and stops.
Enter HCR ManorCare, which in March filed one of the largest bankruptcies this year, dragged down by debt from private equity fund  Carlyle Group  LP's (O:CG) $6.3 billion buyout in 2007 and unable to keep up with $450 million in annual rent payments to REIT landlord  Quality Care Properties Inc  (N:QCP).
Under the new structure, DeRosa plans to capitalize on the trend of more healthcare taking place outside of hospitals. This could mean basic surgeries like hip replacements or treatment for conditions such as congestive heart failure being provided directly in a skilled nursing center instead of a hospital.
For a person who traditionally would have recovered from knee or hip surgery in a skilled nursing facility, they may now receive more outpatient rehab or home health.
Medicare already covers certain home health services and has a pilot program that allows patients to receive care directly at a skilled nursing facility without prior hospitalization, as is the case currently.
""Medicare is testing this out and this is where people think healthcare is ultimately going and they want to be skating in that direction,"" said Chas Roades, head of Washington D.C.-based consultancy Gist Healthcare.
Roades said the deal with ManorCare, expected to close in the third quarter, is the first bet by a major health system on the post-acute space.
Welltower will own 160 skilled nursing and 59 assisted living and memory care centers run by ManorCare through a 80:20 joint venture with ProMedica. ProMedica will own ManorCare's home health, hospice and outpatient rehabilitation businesses.
If the U.S. bankruptcy court approves the deal, ManorCare's rent will fall by 60 percent to $180 million in the first year of a 15-year master lease, with lower annual bumps than its previous lease, according to court filings.
Welltower estimates an 8 percent cash yield from the deal.
""This is the way we'll start to drive some of the services that this aging population will need,"" DeRosa said, adding that it gives the distressed skilled nursing industry a chance of ""rebirth.""

""I think it's going to make other health systems stand up and take notice.""

5,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>","Qualcomm-NXP deal still on hold in China, trade talks with U.S. eyed: sources","By Michael Martina and Adam Jourdan
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Qualcomm's proposed $44 billion takeover of rival NXP Semiconductors is yet to see a concrete breakthrough in China, sources said, tempering hopes a lull in trade tensions with the United States had prompted Beijing to speed up its ruling on the deal.
China's approval would likely depend on the progress of broader trade discussions, three people with knowledge of the deal said, as senior Chinese and U.S. officials meet this week in Washington for their second round of high-stake talks.
They made little apparent progress in discussions in Beijing earlier this month. The U.S. ambassador to China said on Tuesday the two countries were still ""very far apart"" on resolving trade frictions.
Washington and Beijing have proposed tens of billions of dollars in tariffs in recent weeks, fanning worries of a full-blown trade war that could hurt global supply chains and dent business investment plans.
Qualcomm's takeover of NXP has been caught in the crosshairs of the trade tensions. The deal has received approval from eight of the nine required global regulators, with Chinese clearance the only one pending.
NXP shares jumped on Monday after a media report said China had resumed its review of the deal and that the commerce ministry had been asked to speed up the process.
This followed President Donald Trump's pledge on Sunday to help China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763) get ""back into business"" after a U.S. ban hurt the telecom equipment maker, signaling a thaw in trade relations.
However, two sources told Reuters there had been no outward change in the review process that has been ongoing since Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) refiled its application for the deal in April.
There has been no clear new signs since Sunday pointing to an imminent approval of the deal, one of the sources said.
The second source, who is familiar with Qualcomm's dealings with Chinese regulators, said the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) had not provided the company with any updates on the review.
The Ministry of Commerce and SAMR did not have an immediate comment when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday. Qualcomm did not respond to requests for comment.
BROADER TALKS IN FOCUS
China is unlikely to approve the deal while broader trade talks and discussion around ZTE are still in the balance, but it could quickly give the go-ahead at the ""right political moment"", antitrust lawyers and people close to Qualcomm said.
""Because of the current trade tensions and the ZTE incident they are just waiting for the right timing to do it,"" said one Beijing-based antitrust lawyer, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak about the matter.
He added that Chinese regulators had already been looking at the case for a ""very long time"" and had identified remedies that Qualcomm needed to implement to resolve competition issues and push the deal through.
""From a procedural perspective, (the Chinese regulators) could clear the case even tomorrow or this week,"" he said.
Clinching the deal is key for Qualcomm, which is looking to diversify its customer base and become the leading chip supplier to the fast-growing automotive market.
The sharp change in Trump's stance on ZTE has fueled optimism about the prospects of the deal, sources said.
""This is the first positive indicator I've seen for some time,"" said a third U.S.-based technology industry executive with knowledge of the deal.
""For suppliers to ZTE - including Qualcomm, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and InterDigital - positive engagement is a good outcome.""

Revenue and comparable-store sales at the world’s largest home-improvement retailer missed analysts’ estimates, although profit beat expectations for the 16th-straight quarter.
Home Depot’s fortunes are so tightly intertwined with the housing market that they are often viewed as a proxy for the sector. The rationale is simple: If Americans feel like their properties are rising in value, they’ll spend more fixing them up.
But prices have been sagging in some parts of the U.S. and mortgage rates have risen. Labor shortages have also slowed the building of new homes. While that can maintain demand for existing ones, it often limits the number of first-time homebuyers.
Home Depot shares fell as much as 2.4 percent to $186.51 in premarket trading. They had climbed 22 percent in the past year through Monday’s close.
Revenue rose to $24.9 billion in the period that ended April 29, missing the average projection of $25.2 billion.
The company reiterated its annual forecast for revenue of about $107.5 billion and profit of $9.31 a share, confirming a February projection.
Earnings in the first quarter amounted to $2.08 a share, Atlanta-based Home Depot said. Analysts projected $2.05.
Sales at stores open for more than a year -- a key benchmark for investors -- rose 4.2 percent. That missed analysts’ prediction for growth of 5.6 percent, according to Consensus Metrix.
In December, Home Depot laid out long-term goals of boosting annual sales to as much as $120 billion by 2020, from $100.9 billion last year. That would equate to revenue growth of 6 percent a year. It also plans to boost capital expenditures to bolster its supply chain, cut checkout times and train employees.

11,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2018 12:07PM ET</span>",Home Depot posts rare sales miss as delayed spring hits demand,"By Aishwarya Venugopal and Nandita Bose
(Reuters) -  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) on Tuesday missed Wall Street forecasts for sales at established stores as an unusually long winter hit sales of springtime gardening products, but the retailer said it expects to recoup a majority of those lost sales.
The sales outlook helped the company's shares trim initial losses. The stock, which fell over 3 percent in early trade, was last down 1.8 percent at $187.63.
The miss was the first in seven quarters for the top U.S. home improvement chain, which has in recent years largely bucked the trend of big-box stores losing shoppers to online retailers including Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
""The miss in terms of garden was significant against what we planned,"" Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear said on a call with analysts. He was referring to sales of garden-related products such as fertilizers and mulch, which account for 15 percent to 20 percent of revenue, and took a beating in the first quarter. 
Still, Home Depot kept its full-year sales and earnings forecasts intact and said it was seeing double-digit sales growth in May.
In terms of profitability for the year, the retailer expects to invest a significant portion of its operating margin back into improving its stores, enhancing customer experience and strengthening its supply chain, Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said in an interview. 
Sales at Home Depot stores open for more than a year rose 4.2 percent in the first quarter ended April 29, falling short of analysts' average expectation of a 5.4-percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
A winter that prolonged into March and April in some parts of the United States caused a 1.3-percent decline in customer traffic and forced Home Depot to slap deep discounts on several seasonal products.
Patio furniture, for instance, was marked down by up to 30 percent, Home Depot's website showed.
Recent data has suggested that U.S. homebuilding activity may be slowing, after construction of single-family homes — the biggest share of the housing market — fell 3.7 percent in March.
The figures have also raised concerns that rising mortgage and interest rates — though historically low — were weighing on construction activity and consumer spending.
Home Depot's Menear allayed some of those fears, saying: ""The U.S. economy is strong and housing fundamentals continue to be supportive of our business ... we do not expect interest rates to lead to a slowdown in customer desires or demand.""

The company's total net sales rose 4.4 percent to $24.95 billion in the first quarter but fell short of expectations, while earnings per share topped estimates.

12,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>","Japan's biggest banks revamp, close branches in efficiency drive","By Taiga Uranaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's biggest banks have begun major revamps of their domestic retail networks, as the cost of maintaining traditional branches weighs heavily at a time of diminishing revenue and a shift in how consumers conduct financial transactions.
The top three lenders reported weak earnings at their core commercial banking units, propped up by lower bad loan costs, gains in stock holdings and other factors. 
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (MUFG) (T:8306), Japan's largest lender, said on Tuesday it will cut its number of domestic branches by 20 percent over six years from about 500.
Under the plan, part of a medium-term strategy, MUFG said the number of conventional retail branches will be halved, as many will be replaced by self service-style branches.
""Domestic branch network's profitability has been falling,"" said Chief Executive Nobuyuki Hirano at an earnings briefing. He also said the bank will accelerate a shift to digital, hoping to increase the number of internet banking users by three times to 12 million in the six years.
MUFG and rivals are under growing pressure to reduce costs, which have steadily risen amid a slowdown in revenue growth in recent years. At the same time, aggressive overseas expansion has brought increased expenses.
Mizuho Financial Group Inc (T:8411), the least profitable among Japan's biggest three lenders, has also suffered a rise in costs in recent years.
The bank has said it would cut about 100 domestic locations, or one-fifth of the current total, by the end of March 2025. Together with a headcount reduction of 14,000 by that time, the bank plans to cut more than 100 billion yen ($913.99 million) in costs.
""We have not been able to offset revenue decline with cost control,"" said Mizuho CEO Tatsufumi Sakai at an earnings briefing.
Traditionally, banks have kept spacious branches in prime, high-rent locations with dozens of staff working behind counters to process documents. 
""As the importance of physical retail branches declines, banks should not stick to keeping full-scale, big branches if they determine they cannot be No. 1 in the market the branches cover,"" said banking analyst Keisuke Moriyama at Macquarie Capital Securities.
 Sumitomo Mitsui Financial  Group Inc (SMFG) (T:8316), Japan's second-largest lender by market valuation, has said it does not plan to reduce the number of domestic branches, currently at about 430. But it has started to replace them with ""next generation branches"", with a plan for a complete switch by the end of March 2020.
Replacement includes relocation to less convenient spots, reduced size and staff, and with the bulk of back-office work consolidated at off-site centers. SMFG has said the move will eventually cut 30 billion yen in costs, or about 20 percent of retail branch expenses.
""We don't necessarily have to have branches in the prime spots, like we did in the past, in order to meet customers' needs,"" said SMFG CEO Takeshi Kunibe at an earnings briefing on Monday.

14,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2018 06:14AM ET</span>",Comcast's all-cash bid could pit Murdoch against Fox shareholders,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Jessica Toonkel
(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch is used to getting his way at the company he built into a media empire. But a challenge to a $52 billion deal he put together six months ago could test his sway with shareholders. 
Several Fox investors told Reuters they would be open to terminating the company's agreement, inked in December, to sell most of its media assets to Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) if Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) follows through on its plan, revealed by Reuters last week, to launch a rival all-cash bid for as much as $60 billion.
Murdoch, Fox's largest shareholder, will be tough to win over, however. His family trust holds a 17 percent stake in the U.S. TV and movie giant and would face a multi-billion dollar capital gains tax bill if he accepted an all-cash offer from Comcast, tax experts told Reuters. 
""If the deal was done exactly the same way, but for cash rather than stock, the tax liability would be mammoth,"" said Robert Willens, president of tax and consulting firm Robert Willens LLC. ""Gains would be taxed at capital gain rates which, for a New York resident, amounts to about 30 percent."" 
The exact tax hit for 87-year-old Murdoch cannot be ascertained because details of his trust are not public. A Fox spokesman declined to comment on behalf of Murdoch on his tax affairs and how they would influence deal considerations.
However, sources close to the deal between Disney and Fox said the financial impact on Murdoch would be big enough for him to prefer an all-stock transaction, which would be non-taxable for all Fox shareholders. 
That potentially puts Murdoch, who remains the most powerful voice inside the company, at odds with some Fox shareholders who would be open to abandoning the Disney deal if Comcast's cash offer was high enough.
""I always prefer cash deals,"" said Salvatore Muoio, whose New York-based investment firm S. Muoio & Co owns 26,000 shares of Fox, according to Thomson Reuters data. ""The value of a cash deal is certain.""
Other Fox investors said their decision would be based on the price that Comcast offered. ""I would have to look at the tax dynamic and what it would mean for my taxable clients,"" said Mario Gabelli, chairman and CEO of Gamco Investors, whose firm owns 9.6 million shares of Fox. 
Fox's large institutional investors, such as index fund managers BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and Vanguard, do not factor in taxes when choosing between cash and stock deals, because they are not taxed on any income they distribute to shareholders, even though this might affect some of their individual investors. 
Fox, Comcast, Disney, BlackRock and Vanguard all declined to comment.
MURDOCH V SHAREHOLDERS 
Murdoch's family trust controls 39 percent of Fox due to shares it holds with special voting rights. 
However, under the company's bylaws, those special rights do not apply to a vote on the Disney deal, when the Murdoch trust will only have 17 percent of the vote. That makes it easier for other shareholders to defeat him in the vote, which is expected as early as next month.
Comcast made an all-stock offer for Fox's assets late last year, before Disney clinched a deal, and is now considering an all-cash offer after the value of its shares declined by 20 percent in the last six months, sources told Reuters last week. Comcast also believes it has capacity to borrow more money, according to sources familiar with the U.S. cable operator's thinking.
To be sure, Comcast has hurdles to overcome beyond Murdoch's taxes. Its all-stock bid last November for $34.41 per share was rejected by the board due to antitrust concerns, even though it was higher than Disney's $29.54 per share offer. 
Sources said last week Comcast will make a new offer only if a U.S. judge allows AT&T Inc (N:T) to proceed with its planned $85 billion acquisition of  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX), which has been challenged by the U.S. Department of Justice on antitrust grounds.
Should Comcast's all-cash bid materialize, some shareholders could argue the Murdoch family should recuse itself from the deal deliberations due to the tax issue, corporate governance experts told Reuters. 
""If there was a marked difference on the tax effect on Murdoch compared to other Fox shareholders, that could give rise to a conflict that would make it desirable to use an independent special board committee,"" said John Coffee, a law professor and director of Columbia Law School's Center on Corporate Governance. ""Without information on his estate, I can't tell you if this marked difference exists."" 
Rupert Murdoch and his sons James and Lachlan - who are chief executive and executive chairman of Fox, respectively - participated in the negotiations and board deliberations that resulted in the deal with Disney, according to a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Although they wield outsized influence on Fox's 12-member board because of the voting power of the Murdoch trust, Fox still technically has a majority of independent directors on its board.
The only way Comcast could woo Murdoch is by offering a much higher pre-tax price for the deal compared to Disney, Willens said.

""It is not advisable for a man of Murdoch's age to engage in a taxable sale of his property,"" Willens said. ""If he passed away while still owning the property, his heirs would achieve a basis step-up for the property, thus eliminating, forever, any capital gains tax on the appreciation in the assets that accrued during the scions' lifetime.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said on Tuesday a second Vision Fund would be set up in the near future, adding that investment for the new fund could come from investors in the first fund or from institutional investors.
""Vision Fund 2 will definitely come,"" Son told a conference in Tokyo. He said the fund won't be launched in the next six months but would be ""in the near future"". Son did not say how big the new fund could be. 
Son's reputation as a visionary investor has attracted enough money to create the world's largest private equity fund which, as of last May, stood at over $93 billion, with a second Vision Fund potentially further upending the world of dealmaking. 
With the Vision Fund and a smaller affiliate fund already investing about $30 billion, and about $13 billion worth of SoftBank's stake in ride-sharing firms set to be transferred into the Vision Fund, attention is turning to future investment plans.
Son said the new fund could see a return of investors in the original Vision Fund, which include the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) (TW:2317).
""I think our existing partners are extremely happy about how we are progressing,"" he said. 

Institutional investors are showing interest, Son added. ""Now we are building our track record so they are showing their interest,"" he said.

22,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>","Statoil to become Equinor, dropping 'oil' to attract young talent","By Nerijus Adomaitis
OSLO (Reuters) - Shareholders in Norway's largest company,  Statoil  (OL:STL), will approve on Tuesday the board's proposal to drop ""oil"" from its name as its seeks to diversify its business and attract young talent concerned about fossil fuels' impact on climate change.
From Wednesday, the majority state-owned company will change its 46-year-old name to Equinor and trade on the Oslo Exchange under the new ticker EQNR. 
The Norwegian government, which has a 67 percent stake in the firm, has said it will back the move.
The oil and gas company said the name change was a natural step after it decided last year to become a ""broad energy"" firm, investing up to 15-20 percent of annual capital expenditure in ""new energy solutions"" by 2030, mostly in offshore wind.
""The key reason for a company to change its name is when it wants to widen the scope of its activity or direction. Another reason would be because it is in trouble, and it has a reputational problem,"" Allyson Stewart-Allen, a London-based international branding expert and the CEO of International Marketing Partners, told Reuters.
""I don't believe that's the case with Statoil.""
While the company's profits are growing again, its hydrocarbon business has come under increased scrutiny after the Paris climate deal in 2016.
""A name with 'oil' as a component would increasingly be a disadvantage. None of our competitors has that. It served us really well for 50 years, I don't think it will be the best name for the next 50 years,"" Eldar Saetre, Statoil's chief executive, told Reuters.
The new name was meant to arouse curiosity among young people so they see the other aspects of Statoil, including renewable energy, he added. 
Technology students became less interested in working for oil firms after oil prices crashed in 2014 and renewable energy gained in prominence.
Statoil ranked 15th in an annual survey of the Nordic country's most attractive employers conducted by karrierestart.no, a Norwegian careers website, and Norwegian firm Evidente, published on May 3. In 2013, it ranked first.
There are signs, however, that the name change could help it climb the ranks.
""Students who answered the survey after (news of) the name change found Statoil to be between 5 percent and 10 percent more attractive as an employer,"" Arne Kvalsvik at Evidente said.
""It's likely that Statoil's name change will have a positive impact on its reputation going forward.""
Statoil said it remained the first choice among technology students, citing another survey by Swedish firm Universum.

Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace Norway, said the name change would not be sufficient to improve Statoil's image as long as the firm was exploring in vulnerable areas, such as the Arctic or the Great Australian Bight.

Fixed asset investment in China rose 7% in the first four months of 2018 from a year earlier, compared to the general consensus of a 7.4% gain, official data showed on Tuesday, suggesting that the country’s economy might be losing steam.
Meanwhile, retail sales grew 9.4% from a year earlier, compared to the estimates of 10.0%. Property sales growth also softened to 1.3% in January-April, down from 3.6% in January-March, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement.
On the other hand, industrial production output gained 7.0% in April, the NBS said, outperforming the general consensus of 6.4%.

Reports that China’s top economic official Liu He has arrived in Washington on Tuesday also garnered some attention, as Liu is scheduled to have trade talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that would run until Saturday. Reports suggested that Liu might be ready to offer U.S. companies easier access to Chinese markets.
The news came after the U.S.’s request of a more precise timetable on when and how China would open up its markets, as U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said on Tuesday that the two countries are still ""very far apart"" on resolving trade frictions.
""The Chinese have said 'we want to see the specifics.' We gave them all the specifics in terms of trade issues. So they can't say they don't know what we're asking for,"" he said.

""There are many areas where China has promised to do but haven't. We want to see a timetable. We want to see these things happen sooner or later,"" he said at a conference in Tokyo.
Reports on Monday also suggested that China and the U.S. were close to agreeing a deal that would lift the ban on ZTE (HK:0763). In return, the U.S. requested China to remove tariffs on billions of dollars of agricultural products.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Google is under investigation in Australia following claims that it collects data from millions of Android smartphone users, who unwittingly pay their telecom service providers for gigabytes consumed by the activity, regulators said on Tuesday.
Responding to the latest privacy concerns surrounding Google, a spokesman for the U.S. based search engine operator said the company has users' permission to collect data.
""Any charges for transmission of data over a cellular connection, including any location-related data, would be governed by a user's mobile carrier plan,"" Google said in a statement. ""The types and quantity of such data that a user's device transmits would depend on the products or services they use, and in some cases a user's settings,"" it added. The Australian investigations are set to focus on allegations made by  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) in a report provided as part of an Australian review into the impact that Google, owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, and Facebook have on the advertising market. 
Both the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the country's Privacy Commissioner said they were reviewing the report's findings. 
""The ACCC met with Oracle and is considering information it has provided about Google services,"" said Geesche Jacobsen, a spokeswoman for the competition regulator.
""We are exploring how much consumers know about the use of location data and are working closely with the Privacy Commissioner.""
Oracle, according to The Australian newspaper, said Alphabet receives detailed information about people's internet searches and user locations if they have a phone that carries Android - the mobile operating system developed by Google.
Transferring that information to Google means using up gigabytes of data that consumers have paid for under data packages purchased from local telecom service providers, according to the Oracle report.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the content of the Oracle report.
Data privacy advocates said many consumers are unlikely to understand what they agreed to when signing up to use a smartphone. Industry analysts estimate there are more than 10 million Android users in Australia.
""Some mobile plans may only include a few gigabytes of data so if Google is harvesting a gigabyte of data, it is a very real cost to consumers,"" said David Vaile, chairman of the industry group, the Australian Privacy Foundation.
Australian telecommunications companies said they were seeking confirmation from Google on the allegations.
""We are aware of the reports in the media and we have asked Google to advise whether they are accurate,"" a spokesman for Australia's biggest telecom company Telsta said.
Earlier this year, social media giant  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) apologized after web marketing firm Cambridge Analytica was accused of obtaining users' data without permission for the 2016 election campaign of United States President Donald Trump.

Oracle has its own long-running dispute with Google. The U.S. based software company is seeking royalties for Google's use of some of the Java language, while Google argues it should be able to use Java without paying a fee.

26,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2018 05:48AM ET</span>",Toshiba upbeat about Chinese review of $18 billion chip unit sale,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp is upbeat about the prospects of clearing China's antimonopoly review of the $18 billion sale of its chip unit, its CEO said, dismissing reports it may pursue alternative plans if the review drags beyond the deal's deadline.
""We haven't heard anything negative from Chinese regulators,"" Chief Executive Nobuaki Kurumatani said at an earnings briefing on Tuesday.
""We haven't changed our stance (on the sale),"" he added. ""We aren't in any discussions (for alternative plans) based on the premise that the deal is canceled."" 
The Japanese conglomerate last year agreed to sell its prized flash memory chip unit to a consortium led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital LP and South Korea's SK Hynix Inc at a time when the conglomerate was desperate for cash.
People familiar with the matter told Reuters that if the deal is not approved by Chinese regulators this month, Toshiba - which is no longer in need of immediate funds - may seek to drop the sale in favor of other options including listing the unit directly.
The people said the China's review is due for completion by May 28. They also cited concerns of China delaying reviews of major global chip deals due to Sino-U.S. trade friction.
Asked how long Toshiba can wait, Kurumatani said, ""We don't think the Chinese regulators will remain silent. They will make some response."" 
If approval is not granted, Toshiba can walk away from the deal. It is no longer desperate for cash after a $5.4 billion new share issue to foreign investors late last year. Some activist shareholders have opposed the sale, arguing the deal significantly undervalues the unit.
Kurumatani on Tuesday repeatedly said there was no change to the plan to sell the unit. The company will use the sale proceeds to invest in growth areas and make returns to shareholders including through share buybacks.
The company expects to post 970 billion yen in profit from the sale, boosting net income by 33 percent to 1.07 trillion yen ($9.75 billion) this financial year.
That would mark a second consecutive year of profit after years of financial crisis due to accounting scandals and cost-overruns at its U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse.
The flash memory chip business accounted for nearly 90 percent of Toshiba's operating profit in the year ended March, as Toshiba struggled to grow other key businesses such as energy and social infrastructure.

27,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>","In some Chinese cities, authorities reduce curbs on new apartment pre-sales","By Clare Jim and Yawen Chen
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - The local authorities running several major Chinese cities have begun to ease restrictions on pre-sales of new apartment buildings, and are in some cases for the first time in about a year allowing developers to raise prices slightly.
The loosening in cities such as Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Xiamen has led to a surge in the marketing of new home developments over the past two months, with developers also eager to ramp up the launches to boost their cashflow.
""Both factors will lead to an obvious rise in housing supply in the top cities in the second quarter,"" said David Hong, the Hong Kong head of research at CRIC, a real estate research firm.. ""Many developments which have already reached the pre-sales requirements last year will be launched into the market."" 
Pre-sales refer to the selling of homes in housing developments before they are ready to occupy, and often before the construction has been completed. 
The changes highlight competing interests between China's stability-minded central government and revenue-hungry local authorities, as well as the challenges in artificially containing a still hot market that has remained a one-way bet. 
The mild loosening is city specific, according to nine developers interviewed by Reuters, and there is little expectation of a nationwide easing in curbs anytime soon. Developers said, for example, pre-sale approvals remain extremely strict in Beijing because it is closely monitored by the central government.
But real estate experts said it could be a sign of things to come elsewhere in the country as the cities, relying heavily on land sales and property taxes, try to boost real estate sales and keep housing supply in line with demand. 
Any relaxation should bolster the developers' profitability and could help to support economic growth at a time when there are fears it could be flagging, though if it is restricted to only a few cities the impact will be modest, economists and analysts said.
The pent-up demand for land development is high as Chinese cities sold a record 5.2 trillion yuan worth of land usage rights in 2017, up 40.7 percent from a year earlier, data from the finance ministry shows. 
The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (MOHURD) did not respond to faxed requests for comment. The housing authorities in Shanghai, Nanjing, Xiamen and Hangzhou didn't answer calls from Reuters.
The official Xinhua news agency reported last week that MOHURD has reiterated that policies to control home prices and prevent speculative investment in the property market will not be changed or loosened.
PRICES STILL RISING
The latest housing price data for March shows that average new home prices rose for their 35th consecutive month, with more cities reporting growth, though the annual price appreciation has dropped to 4.9 percent in the latest period from a record 12.6 percent in November 2016. The next monthly figures, for April, are due out on Wednesday.
But China's official housing data has been criticized for being artificial – local authorities can have an impact on the figures by setting price caps and changing home sales and purchase approval speed so that they aren’t seen to be undermining Beijing’s policies. 
""To stabilize prices, the local government has been delaying approvals for expensive projects until there are enough cheaper projects to offset such price gains,"" said a government source in Hefei, the capital city of Anhui province, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. 
In Shanghai, pre-sale permits approved in March and April alone totaled 47 for an area of 1.74 million square meters, almost 50 percent of the figure for all of last year, according to CRIC, suggesting the pace of new developments is picking up.
“We expect more flexibility in price setting in some first- and second-tier cities,” said Eva Lau, investor relations manager for Shanghai-based Shimao Property (HK:0813), which is among the top 20 developers in China in terms of sales.
One developer, who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the topic, said Shanghai and Nanjing are two cities it has seen some loosening recently. 
""In Nanjing, the authority came to us and asked if we would launch the project if they raise the approval price by 1,000 yuan,"" the developer added, citing a 5 percent increase in the medium-sized apartment sales prices by an average 20,000 yuan. 
And another developer, that has recently launched new apartments in Shanghai, said some pre-sale approval requirements in place since last year - such as allowing developers to apply for each sales permit only after building more than 30,000 square meters - have been removed. The easing allows developers to start selling more quickly.
INVENTORY DOWN
February inventory levels in Shanghai dropped to 4.9 months, compared to 7.8 months a year ago, while Nanjing was only 3.8 months, versus 6.7 months a year ago, according to CRIC. Figures lower than six months indicate that the market is undersupplied, CRIC's Hong said. 
Recent approval prices have also crept higher in second-tier cities, such as Xiamen and Hangzhou. One Hangzhou-based developer said the eastern city has unofficially stated that if sales registration for a development is suspended for three months, developers can then raise the price by up to 20 percent. 
Aside from the official restrictions, the developers last year held back sales of some prime projects in the hope that prices would soon start surging again, but those hopes have since dimmed. 
""Developers don't want to wait anymore,"" said a Shenzhen-based developer. 
""When people see there's a pick up in the speed of sales permits, then they push out new launches faster for cash collection."" 
Developers were also more willing to make concessions in the pricing of luxury projects, after Shanghai resumed pre-sale approvals this year, a move that developers and property analysts said was able to be made given a relaxation of political sentiment after the Communist Party Congress last October. 
At least seven luxury projects with prices over 80,000 yuan per square meter were approved for pre-sale in April, but the approved selling prices were lower than the secondary market, where no price caps are imposed. 

""Our approved selling price was around 95,000, compared to 110,000 in the secondary market,"" said an official at one of the Shanghai developers, also in reference to the price in yuan per square meter. ""The price cap has a larger impact on us since we're a high-end developer, but we can't keep the projects indefinitely.""

28,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler CEO reprimands colleague for commenting on emissions,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne reprimanded the company's top U.S. spokesman for issuing press releases about Fiat's vehicle emissions practices days after Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) disclosure in September 2015 that the German automaker had used illegal software to evade emissions tests, documents released Monday show.
Lawyers suing Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (N:FCAU) in a securities case filed excerpts of an email from Marchionne to Gualberto Ranieri, then the company's U.S. spokesman, in a filing in federal court in New York criticizing him for saying that the company does not use defeat devices.
“Are you out of your goddam mind?” Marchionne wrote in an email on Sept. 22, 2015, adding that Ranieri should be fired and calling his actions ""utterly stupid and unconscionable.""
The company said in a statement on Monday it was ""understandable that our CEO would have a forceful response to any employee who would opine on such a significant and complex matter, without the matter having been fully reviewed through its appropriate channels.""
The statement added that Ranieri's comments came just days after VW's emissions issue became public ""and before a comprehensive internal review and discussions with component suppliers was possible.""
Fiat Chrysler was sued in 2015 along with Marchionne and other executives over claims it defrauded shareholders by overstating its ability to comply with vehicle safety laws. An amended version of the complaint filed in 2017 added claims about its compliance with emissions laws.
The shareholders accused the defendants of inflating Fiat Chrysler’s share price by hundreds of millions of dollars from October 2014 to October 2015 by downplaying safety concerns.
They said the shortcomings materialized in 2015 when the automaker was fined $175 million by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and took a roughly $670 million charge for recalls.
Plaintiffs filed the excerpts seeking approval to take up to 40 additional depositions, including Marchionne's.
The U.S. Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler in May 2017, accusing it of illegally using software to bypass emission controls in 104,000 diesel vehicles sold since 2014.
Fiat Chrysler has held numerous rounds of settlement talks with the Justice Department and California Air Resources Board to settle the civil suit, including talks as recently as earlier this month. It faces a separate criminal probe into the matter.
The Justice Department sent Fiat Chrysler lawyers a Jan. 27 settlement offer that would require the company to offset excess pollution and take steps to prevent future excess emissions, Reuters reported in February. The letter included language that a settlement must include very substantial civil penalties.
Regulators have said Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles had undisclosed emissions controls that allowed vehicles to emit excess pollution during normal driving. The company has denied wrongdoing, saying it never engaged in any deliberate scheme to cheat emissions rules.

In a separate court filing Monday in Detroit, lawyers filed amended class-action lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler and  Cummins Inc  (N:CMI) asserted there were at least two diesel emissions defeat devices installed in 2007-2012 Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500 trucks to evade emissions testing after a prior version was dismissed in March. Both companies have denied wrongdoing.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Gunmaker Sturm Ruger & Co (N:RGR) directors faced little opposition at its recent board election, a securities filing showed on Monday, despite its policy of not talking with shareholders even in the midst of a national debate over gun control.
Additionally, a proposal calling for Ruger to produce a report on the safety of its products was supported by 7.2 million votes, with 3.3 million votes cast ""against."" 
All nine of Ruger's candidates won more than 10 million votes ""for"" a one-year board term at its annual meeting on May 9, the filing showed. The highest number of votes ""withheld"" from any director was 425,763.
Ruger's proxy showed BlackRock with 2.9 million shares of Ruger's common stock, just under 17 percent, as of March 15, and Vanguard with 1.7 million shares, or 9.5 percent, meaning neither could have withheld all support from the directors.
BlackRock and Vanguard declined to state how they voted. 
Both fund managers were among major financial firms that had said they would speak with weapons companies about the safety of their products after the February shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida that left 17 dead. BlackRock has also made plans to offer gun-free investment strategies.
Ruger's meeting had been seen as an early test of how far the investment firms would push their concerns. 
Chief Executive Christopher Killoy declined to meet with gun safety activists at the meeting, saying the company does not meet even with major investors BlackRock or Vanguard.
Ruger had said the directors were elected and the shareholder proposal passed but it had not provided vote tallies.
University of Pennsylvania law professor Jill Fisch, who follows corporate governance, said opposition to the directors seemed low considering the concern financial companies expressed about gun safety issues after the Parkland shooting. 
""I'm surprised given the current debate that the withhold levels are as small as they are,"" Fisch said in a telephone interview. ""Clearly the institutional investors are not trying to make a statement through their voting on directors.""
For each nominee and for the shareholder proposal there were also 5.1 million ""non-votes,"" the filing showed. 
Ruger did not reply to a request for comment on the tallies.
Monday's filing showed that at the meeting Killoy said a reason for Ruger's no-meeting policy was a federal securities rule known as ""Regulation FD"" for fair disclosure that is meant to prevent companies from selectively disclosing material information to investors.
Asked about Killoy's comments, Carolyn Wegemann, a spokeswoman for Vanguard of Pennsylvania, said by email that it ""has had 1000+ engagements with public portfolio companies over the past year alone (hundreds of these discussions have included members of the board), all without raising Reg. FD concerns.""
In 2016 and 2017, BlackRock voted against directors at  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) over the company barring talks with outside directors. Last year, Exxon said its board had ended a prohibition on outside directors meeting with shareholders. 
BlackRock's proxy voting guidelines posted on its website state that it expects boards to be ""engaged and responsive."" 

Although rules do not require talks with investors, representatives of big investment firms and academics who follow corporate governance said such meetings are common.

32,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 10:57PM ET</span>","Seattle passes scaled-back tax on Amazon, big companies","By Gregory Scruggs
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Seattle's city council on Monday approved a new tax for the city's biggest companies, including Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), to combat a housing crisis attributed in part to a local economic boom that has driven up real estate costs at the expense of the working class.
Amazon, the city's largest employer, said after the vote that it would go ahead with planning for a major downtown office building that it earlier had put on hold over its objections to a much stiffer tax plan originally proposed.
As passed on a 9-0 vote after a boisterous public hearing, the measure would apply to most companies grossing at least $20 million a year, levying a tax of roughly 14 cents per employee per hour worked within the city - about $275 annually for each worker.
That ""head tax"" formula is designed to raise $45 million to $49 million a year over the five-year life of the tax - down from an original $75 million annually - to build more affordable housing and support services for the homeless. The tax would end after five years unless renewed by the city.
Amazon had led private-sector opposition to the plan, saying earlier this month it was freezing expansion planning for Seattle pending the outcome of Monday's action. The move by the world's largest online retailer, owned by billionaire entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, put in question more than 7,000 new jobs.
Following the council vote, Amazon's vice president, Drew Herdener, said the company has resumed construction planning for its so-called Block 18 project in downtown Seattle, following the pause it announced two weeks ago.
However, he added, ""We remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council's hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here.""
Amazon said it is still evaluating whether to sub-lease space in a second future office tower in Seattle, a project called Rainier Square (NYSE:SQ), meaning it may move some planned jobs elsewhere and thus avoid further raising its tax liability.
The tax also would hit such Seattle-based stalwarts as coffee retailer Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and department store chain Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), as well as California-based tech giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that have enough of a presence in Seattle that they would be subject to the new levy. 
The tax is expected to be borne by about 500 companies, accounting for 3 percent of the city's private sector. Healthcare companies are exempt, as are non-profits.
Sponsors of the tax said Seattle's biggest-earning businesses should bear some burden for easing a shortage in low-cost housing that they helped create by driving up real estate prices to the point where the working poor and many middle-class families can no longer afford to live in the city.
Supporters cite data showing Seattle's median home prices have soared to $820,000, and more than 41 percent of renters in the city ranked as ""rent-burdened,"" meaning they pay at least 30 percent of their income on housing.
The Seattle metropolitan area also is home to the third-largest concentrations of homeless people, nearly 12,000 counted in a January U.S. government survey, and almost half of them were living on the streets or otherwise unsheltered.
Mayor Jenny Durkan, who expressed concern that the original proposal would lead to an economic backlash, said she would sign the new tax ordinance into law. 
She had offered an amendment to essentially cut the original $75 million tax proposal in half, but her proposal was rejected last Friday. Council members then negotiated over the weekend to craft a compromise that would gain greater support and was certain to win a veto-proof majority.
On Monday, about 40 elected officials from across the United States, some representing local governments in the running to host Amazon's second headquarters, published an open letter to Seattle in support of the head tax and expressing concern that Amazon opposed the measure.
""By threatening Seattle over this tax, Amazon is sending a message to all of our cities: we play by our own rules,"" the officials wrote.

The head tax approved on Monday is not the first. Denver has enacted a similar tax, and Chicago had one but repealed it. Seattle itself had a head tax in effect from 2006 to 2009 but it was repealed to help businesses in the midst of the recession.

33,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 07:54PM ET</span>",Cargill has 'significant concerns' over U.S.-China trade strategy,"By P.J. Huffstutter
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) is concerned the White House's strategy to address unfair trade practices with China will not work and could lead to an escalating trade war, according to prepared comments the global grain merchant sent to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
The five-page letter, submitted on Friday and made public on Monday, was in response to a request for public comments by Lighthizer's office over its ""Section 301"" investigation, which authorizes tariffs in a bid to force changes to Chinese government policies over intellectual property.
The Trade Representative on Tuesday will begin holding three days of public hearings on proposed U.S. tariffs of $50 billion on Chinese goods. The hearings, being held in Washington, are part of an expected 60-day public consultation period that USTR is pursuing before any of the so-called 301 tariffs can be activated. 
President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, and China has threatened to retaliate with duties on U.S. products, including soybeans and aircraft.
""Cargill has significant concerns with the potential enactment of unilateral tariffs and investment restrictions against China, and threats of escalating tariffs,"" wrote Devry Boughner Vorwerk, Cargill's vice president of global corporate affairs.
""While we understand the Administration’s intent is to generate substantive bilateral dialogue, we are concerned that this approach will not effectively advance the goal of addressing distortive trade practices,"" she wrote.
Global grain marketers such as Cargill and rivals Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM) and  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG) have seized upon trade tensions between the United States and several of its top export markets, including China, to turn around struggling trading units following one of the toughest years ever for the industry.
However, growing trade disputes are disrupting agricultural supply chains worldwide, with ships carrying U.S. sorghum exports turning around after China raised prices for buyers.
In the short term, U.S. farmers will be hurt the most by declining prices linked to China's tariffs on soybeans, Boughner Vorwerk said. The crop is the top U.S. agricultural export to China, worth $12 billion last year.
""History has shown that the use of tariffs is unsuccessful in achieving lasting solutions – the current challenges between the United States and China are no different,"" she said.

Top U.S. trade and economic officials are preparing to meet this week in Washington with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He for talks on trade concerns ranging from intellectual property protections to farm goods to steel capacity.

34,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 06:31PM ET</span>",J&J defends itself in trial over baby powder asbestos claims,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - A trial for a lawsuit alleging that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Baby Powder was responsible for the death of a woman due to her exposure to cancer-causing asbestos began in South Carolina on Monday in the latest case against the healthcare conglomerate and a supplier over their talc-based products.
J&J said that its widely-used baby powder never contained asbestos, a known carcinogen linked to mesothelioma.
The case also names as a defendant a local unit of Rite Aid, one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains, which allegedly sold the baby powder used by the woman.
The case marked the first time a drugstore was involved in a talcum powder liability trial and a lawyer for the company, Sarah Johnston, said there was no reason for Rite Aid to be part of the suit.
In opening statements, a lawyer for the family of Bertila Boyd-Bostic, who died of a rare form of cancer in 2017 at the age of 30, told a jury in the Darlington County Court of Common Pleas that J&J had known for decades that its baby powder contained asbestos. 
J&J and its supplier, a unit of Imerys SA, deny the allegations, and their lawyers said their talc product did not cause any form of cancer, according to an online broadcast of the trial by Courtroom View Network. 
The case is one of several in recent months that alleged asbestos in talc products caused mesothelioma..
A New Jersey state court jury in April ordered J&J and Imerys to pay $117 million to a man who alleged he developed mesothelioma due to asbestos exposure from J&J Baby Powder. An appeal is pending.
J&J has also been battling some 6,000 cases claiming its baby powder caused ovarian cancer.
Boyd-Bostic used baby powder nearly all her life, her family's lawyer, Christopher Swett, said on Monday. In 2016, she was diagnosed with pericardial mesothelioma, an extremely rare form of cancer that develops in the lining around the heart.
""J&J's choices are why we're here,"" Swett said. He accused the company of concealing knowledge of asbestos contamination since the 1970s and choosing not to warn consumers of the risks.
Bruce Bishop, a lawyer for J&J, said there was no evidence in Boyd-Bostic's medical records that her mesothelioma was in any way related to asbestos exposure. 
Michael Brown, another J&J lawyer, said millions of people had used Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder without developing any diseases. ""And that's because it does not contain asbestos,"" he said.

WILMINGTON, Del (Reuters) - Next month, Toys 'R' Us is putting its famous mascot, Geoffrey the Giraffe, on the auction block. Also up for sale: sex-toys-r-us.com.
    The adult-oriented domain name is one of hundreds of website addresses that the bankrupt toy-store chain is looking to find a buyer for as it winds down its business and shutters 735 U.S. stores, according to court records.
Also up for sale: ihatetoysrus.com, toysrussucks.com, kinkytoysrus.com and adult-toys-r-us.com.
The company is selling its intellectual property, which includes its name, Geoffrey the Giraffe logo, and the Babies 'R' Us brand, to raise money to repay its creditors. Brand specialists said it could be one of the most valuable brands ever sold by a company going out of business. 
A spokeswoman for Toys 'R' Us did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Companies like Toys 'R' Us often register related domain names to guard against someone hijacking their brand for their own business, said Bob Phibbs, a brand specialist and chief executive of the Retail Doctor consulting firm.
""They just went crazy,"" said Phibbs. ""I'm sure they were laughing and drinking Red Bull and then just came up with every iteration they could.""
Phibbs said the long list of domain names owned by the company reveals the allure of the Toys 'R' Us brand. The company registered dozens of domain names: lodges-r-us.com, bistros-r-us.com, recipes-r-us.com, burgers-r-us.com and even cigars-r-us.com.
""It shows the power of the brand,"" said Phibbs. ""The 'R' Us is the key to the brand, not the Toys.""

None of the domain names are currently active.

Co-founder and largest shareholder Elaine Wynn who has been in a proxy fight with the board, has been asking shareholders to vote against Hagenbuch's re-election, whom she called a close friend of the company founder and former Chief Executive Officer Steve Wynn.
Steve, Elaine's ex-husband, resigned earlier this year on allegations of sexual misconduct and disposed his entire 11.8 percent stake in the firm for $2.1 billion. 
In a letter, Elaine said ""Mr. Hagenbuch represents all that is wrong with the long-serving legacy directors,"" suggesting a revamp of the board, given the proximity of board members to Steve.
In April new Chief Executive Officer Matt Maddox detailed steps the company had taken to distance itself from its founder and adjust its corporate culture, including adding three women to its board.
The company also said on Monday Robert Miller has resigned from the board.

The company's shares were down 2 percent at $191.70 in after-market trading.

42,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>","Puerto Rico bondholders offer debt deal, snubbed by oversight board","By Nick Brown
NEW YORK (Reuters) - An offer by Puerto Rico's biggest bondholder groups to settle a dispute covering about half the bankrupt U.S. territory's $71.5 billion in bond debt appeared dead on arrival on Monday, rejected by the island's federal financial oversight board. 
The board issued a statement soon after the bondholders offered to give storm-ravaged Puerto Rico $9.7 billion worth of debt relief, calling the settlement offer ""completely unaffordable."" 
It is a sign, though, that mediation to resolve Puerto Rico’s debts, and stem costly litigation, may be making headway. 
Under the current agreement between general obligation bondholders and so-called COFINA holders, whose debt is backed by sales tax revenue, a new trust would have been created to own Puerto Rico's sales tax. 
Puerto Rico owes about $18 billion each in general obligation and COFINA debt, meaning that the groups combined own roughly half of the island's bonds.
COFINA creditors would get certificates in the new trust entitling them to 52.5 percent of the tax revenue, while 46.2 percent would benefit GO holders. 
The remaining 1.3 percent would go to general unsecured creditors.
The new paper would be structured as current interest bonds with a 6 percent rate, and capital appreciation bonds with a 6.5 percent rate. GO bondholders would also get so-called remainder claims against the trust for amounts not covered by their stake in it. 
The deal was aimed at resolving the single biggest dispute in Puerto Rico's massive, $120 billion bankruptcy. 
For years, GO and COFINA holders have disputed which side is entitled to Puerto Rico's sales tax revenue, and litigation has been working its way through federal court. COLD WATER 
The board, appointed by the U.S. Congress in 2016, said the proposed settlement deal did not align with a previously-imposed blueprint for Puerto Rico's fiscal turnaround. 
""The economic terms of this creditor proposal were not crafted with any prior input from either the oversight board or the government and are completely unaffordable,"" the board said in a statement on Monday morning. 
The board, which must approve settlements in Puerto Rico's bankruptcy, added that the terms ""would create large and recurring structural deficits over the long-run.""
Puerto Rico's government also opposed the deal. The island's financial authority, AAFAF, said in a statement that the debt service levels contemplated under the deal ""are not sustainable in light of Puerto Rico’s projected fiscal and economic situation.""
Puerto Rico is battling the twin scourges of fiscal and natural disaster. With $71.5 billion in bond debt and another $50 billion in pension debt, it filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. government history last year. 
Then, in September, it was hit by Hurricane Maria, which decimated its infrastructure, killed dozens, and sent bond prices plummeting. 
They have since recovered somewhat. 
Statements from the creditor groups suggest the terms of the deal may be re-workable while maintaining the basic structure. 
COFINA creditors revealed that in April, they proposed a similarly-structured deal to the Puerto Rican government and a committee of retirees, in which COFINA holders would receive two-thirds of sales tax proceeds, and the government would have gotten 34 percent on behalf of its creditors.
""While members of the [senior COFINA] coalition support the COFINA-GO settlement framework, the group also proposed alternative settlement terms ... to other constituencies,"" including retirees, the group said in a statement on Monday.
It added that discussions remain ongoing, saying the coalition was “committed to exploring restructuring solutions.” 
The GO bondholders said the deal was a way to speed up the bankruptcy process and avoid costly litigation. 
""The supporting parties have come together for the first time in years to forge an agreement on a settlement framework that provides for a consensual path to a successful restructuring,"" the GO creditors said in a statement. 
Puerto Rico's defaulted benchmark general obligation debt carrying an 8 percent coupon rose to a high of 46.50 cents on the dollar from Friday's closing price of 41.375, according to Thomson Reuters data.. It currently trades at around 43.25 cents. 
Sales tax-backed senior COFINA debt surged up to 72.25 cents on the dollar from Friday's close of 60 cents, while COFINA's junior debt traded up to 35.25 cents from Friday's close of 30.25 cents.

43,By Investing.com,"<span>May 14, 2018 04:28PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. Retail Sales, Housing Data, Fed Speakers on Tap 
Retail sales, housing data and a duo of Fed speeches due Tuesday will provide market participants with insight into the strength of the U.S. economy and insight into the Fed’s thinking on monetary policy. 
Speeches by Fed officials’ Robert Kaplan at 8:00AM ET, and John Williams at 1:00PM ET will likely be monitored for clues on whether Fed policymakers remained optimistic on inflation given the duo of bearish inflation reports seen last week.
Retail sales growth data due 8:30AM ET is forecast to show a 5% increase for March  after a rebounding in February. The retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP – is expected to rise 0.4%.
A monthly index of builder sentiment from the National Association of Home Builders due 10:00AM ET is forecast show a reading of 70 for May, up from 69 in April. A reading above 50 is considered positive.
The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies on Monday, recovering from an early-session slump, as the EUR/USD gave up most of its gains.
2. API Data, Middle East Tensions in Focus
A fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) is slated for Tuesday after data last week showed a fall in weekly U.S. crude stockpiles for the first time in three weeks.
The American Petroleum Institute reported last Tuesday crude oil stockpiles fell by 1.850 barrels.
Oil prices made a positive start to the week after OPEC said the glut in global crude supplies has been nearly eliminated while escalating Middle East tensions also lifted sentiment.
Crude oil futures on Monday settled higher at $70.96 a barrel, up 26 cents.
3. Earnings, Casino Stocks Eyed
Shares of casino companies will likely be in focus again on Tuesday after rallying sharply on Monday.
The rally emerged after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that banned sports gambling, potentially paving the way for states across the U.S. to legalise sports betting.
 Scientific Games  Corp (NASDAQ:SGMS), Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) and Caesars Entertainment Corporation (NASDAQ:CZR) rose sharply following the decision.
Wynn Resorts Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) and  Las Vegas Sands  Corp (NYSE:LVS) fell, however, as their operations are more leveraged to Nevada, whose monopoly on legalised sports betting will likely cease to exit under the new legislation.
Elsewhere,  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) will likely be in focus as the home improvement leader reports earnings on Tuesday before the markets open.
Home Depot is expected to report earnings of $2.06 per share on revenue of $25.21 billion."

47,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",U.S. senators oppose trade group's lawyer as consumer watchdog,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission should delay a vote to name its top consumer advocate, three Democratic U.S. senators said on Monday, citing the appointee's work for Equifax (NYSE:EFX), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Uber [UBER.UL] and other companies the FTC has probed.
The FTC is considering making Andrew Smith, a partner at Covington and Burling, LLP, head of its consumer protection bureau. Smith has worked for the Consumer Data Industry Association, whose members include credit reporting companies like Equifax, which is under FTC scrutiny following a massive data breach last year.
Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren, Richard Blumenthal and Brian Schatz said in a letter that Smith's prior work, and the likelihood that he would be recused from big FTC investigations, meant he was ""unfit and unable to function as the FTC's top consumer advocate.""
""Mr. Smith has every right to represent corporations that have harmed consumers, and those companies have every right to be represented by Mr. Smith,"" the lawmakers wrote in the letter to FTC Chairman Joseph Simons. ""It is impossible to believe that the best candidate (to head consumer protection) is someone with a long record of representing companies that have been accused of hurting consumers.""
The lawmakers asked the commissioners to delay a vote on Smith while they dug into his past work, and potential conflicts of interest.
In addition to the Equifax probe, the FTC is also reviewing whether Facebook violated a 2011 FTC consent decree over its privacy practices following allegations that Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to user data for 50 million people without users being notified.
Uber has settled with the FTC over a 2016 cybersecurity hack and over allegations that it misled drivers about potential earnings.
Smith declined comment. The FTC declined comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russia tycoon Oleg Deripaska gave evidence in the London High Court on Monday in a case challenging the sale of shares in Norilsk Nickel (Nornickel) (MM:GMKN) by soccer club owner Roman Abramovich.
Deripaska, making his first public appearance since being made a target of U.S. sanctions, wants to stop Abramovich selling Nornickel shares to another Russian billionaire Vladimir Potanin, saying it violates a 2012 shareholder deal. 
The hearing, which is expected to last four days, is part of a long-running battle for control of the mining firm, one of the world's biggest producers of nickel.
Deripaska, the co-owner of En+  and Rusal (HK:0486) that have also been targeted by U.S. sanctions, told the court he was ""quite upset that Rusal's interests could be seriously damaged"" when asked about discussions with Potanin.
Deripaska, who was dressed in a dark blue suit and tie, spoke to the court in Russian via an interpreter.
Deripaska and Potanin have periodically been at loggerheads since Rusal bought a stake in Nornickel just before the 2008 global financial crash. Court documents said Deripaska and Potanin disagreed on how Nornickel should be run.
Potanin's Interros Holding said in March it had completed the purchase from Abramovich of a 2 percent stake in Nornickel, a deal that could be reversed if the London court rules in favor of Rusal.
Before purchasing the additional 2 percent, Potanin had 30.4 percent of Nornickel, against Rusal's 27.8 percent stake.
Nornickel is a $27.68 billion company that competes with Brazil's Vale  for the rank of the world's top nickel producer. It is also the world's largest palladium producer.
Abramovich, who also owns England's Chelsea football club, stepped in as a ""white knight"" minority shareholder in 2012 to act as a buffer between Potanin and Deripaska.
He and his partners have a stake in Nornickel amounting to 6.3 percent, including 4.2 percent that is owned via a Cyprus-based company called Crispian.
The deal involved a five-year lock-up period, which the court heard was intended to be long enough to ""build trust"". During that period, the parties were barred from selling most of their Nornickel stakes.
Deripaska was ranked Russia's 19th richest man worth $6.7 billion by Forbes magazine before Washington imposed sanctions in April on him, as well as on Rusal and En+, in response to what the United States called Russia's ""malign activities"".
Potanin is expected to appear before the court on Tuesday.
The hearing is due to last until Thursday, after which further written submissions are expected.

After that, legal sources said the judge could take about two weeks to deliver his judgment.

63,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>","Home Depot well placed to withstand 'Amazon effect,' investors say","By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) shares have climbed with the approach of spring weather, as some investors believe the retailer is well positioned to fend off the competitive threat of online retailers as the peak season for home improvement begins.
Home Depot shares are up 0.7 percent year to date after being weighed down earlier this year in part because of the impact of an unusually long and snowy winter on sales, investors and analysts said. For the first three months of 2018, its shares fell 6 percent, while the S&P 500 Retailing index <.SPXRT> rose 11.3 percent.
Since April 13, Home Depot shares have climbed 10.6 percent, ahead of the S&P 500 Retailing index, which has risen 8 percent in the same period. Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) stock saw a 12.1-percent advance.
Home Depot, the largest U.S. home improvement chain by sales, will report its first-quarter results on Tuesday. 
Homeowners catching up on home-improvement projects are more likely to buy supplies in person over perusing products online, some investors believe. Home Depot also has a strong business among contractors, which has helped it to outperform rival Lowe's Companies Inc (N:LOW), whose sales have lagged. It is scheduled to report its results on May 23.
Shares of Lowe's have gained just 0.5 percent in the past month. 
Several other big-box retailers' shares have not performed as well. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (O:BBBY) stock has declined 1.1 percent over the same period, after having dived 20 percent on April 12 on the company's quarterly results.  Target  Corp (N:TGT) shares have risen 1.9 percent, while Walmart Inc (N:WMT) shares have fallen 1.7 percent.
""It's the season where contractors start getting busy,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist of Bruderman Asset Management in New York, which owns Home Depot shares. ""That bodes well for Home Depot and similar companies.""
Home-improvement retailers are also subject to concerns that rising U.S. interest rates could slow the growth of the housing market, said Greg Melich, an analyst at MoffettNathanson in New York. That anxiety has particularly hurt shares of homebuilders such as  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) and D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI).
But the limited supply of houses has pushed up home values and encouraged homeowners to spend money on renovation projects. Renovation activity is projected to increase at an above-average 7.2 percent in 2018 over the previous year, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.
""Homeowners are feeling encouraged by market conditions,"" said Abbe Will, a research associate at the Joint Center for Housing Studies. ""They're motivated to do bigger projects: the kitchen, the bathroom.""
Home Depot has also made steps to improve its footing against online competitors such as Amazon. In December, it announced that it would double its total investment spending over three years. According to the company's fiscal year guidance issued in February, its capital expenditures are expected to total $2.5 billion.

""It has a strategy to compete and win in multi-channel (retail),"" Melich said. ""As spring comes, it should be a pretty good investment.""

64,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 03:54PM ET</span>","U.S. small caps near record highs, outperform larger rivals","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wall Street's modestly-sized publicly listed companies are beating out the heavyweights. The Russell 2000 (RUT), which tracks U.S. small capitalization companies, on Monday slipped 0.2 percent, but earlier in the session rose to within less than two points of its previous record high of 1,615.5 points.
Another small cap index, the S&P 600 (SPCY), closed at a record high on Friday, underscoring the ascent of a section of the stock market often overlooked by investors. 
Many small cap companies have benefited from an expanding U.S. economy and deep corporate tax cut enacted this year. 
""When the economy is stronger than normal, small caps do better,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial. ""With a good economy like we've seen happening this year, we fully expect this to keep playing out in the second half of the year."" 
Widely used by small-cap oriented investment funds to benchmark their performance, the Russell 2000 has gained over 4 percent in 2018, compared to the S&P 500's 2 percent rise. That is a reversal from last year, when the Russell 2000 rose 13 percent, underperforming compared to the S&P 500's 19 percent rally.
The Russell has gained 9 percent from its lowest 2018 close on Feb. 8, while the S&P 500 has recovered 6 percent from the same date. 
Following a strong quarterly earnings season on Wall Street, the energy and technology sectors have led among small cap stocks, in line with the broader market. 
Energy stocks in the Russell 2000 are up about 14 percent on average since the end of March, with technology small caps up about 5.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.
The index tracks the performance of the smaller two thirds of the largest 3000 companies on the U.S. stock market.
Small cap companies in the past have often paid higher tax rates than their larger rivals, which means that in many cases they have more to gain from Republican-led tax cuts introduced this year.

The domestic focus of many small U.S. companies also makes them less vulnerable ahead of trade talks between the United States and China aimed at resolving a trade dispute between the countries.

65,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 05:04PM ET</span>",Gaming investors eye jackpot from U.S. sports betting ruling,"By Sinéad Carew
New York (Reuters) - Shares in gaming and casino companies jumped on Monday, led by  Scientific Games  Corp (O:SGMS), as investors wagered on new business opportunities for the industry after the U.S. Supreme Court paved the way for states to legalize sports betting.
The ruling endorsed New Jersey's bid to allow sports betting and struck down a 1992 federal law that widely prohibited the practice, potentially adding a new line of business for many casinos and for betting technology providers such as Scientific Games and International Game Technology (N:IGT).
It takes the United States a step closer to the possible expansion of legal sports betting nationwide, rather than in select places such as Nevada, home to gambling capital Las Vegas. The illegal sports betting market is worth billions of dollars annually.
Scientific Games is particularly well placed to benefit from the ruling due to its acquisition in January of Canadian digital gaming and sports betting firm NYX Gaming Group Ltd, said Todd Eilers, analyst at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming. 
""I'd say there's a lot of states that would move forward with sports betting,"" said Eilers, who expects Scientific Games and International Game Technology to seek contracts with casino operators looking to expand into sports betting. 
""Any regional casino operator with a lot of casinos across a lot of states would be the best positioned,"" he added.
Scientific Games shares were last up 11.6 percent at $59.53, a record high, with trading volume 4.6 times the 10-day moving average.
International Game Technology shares were up 3.4 percent, on track for their biggest one-day percentage gain since early March. Shares in racetrack and casino operator  Churchill Downs  (O:CHDN) hit a record high and were last up 5.5 percent at $294.41 with trading volume 2.9 times the 10-day moving average.
In London, shares in  William Hill  (L:WMH), which operates legal sports betting in Nevada and is preparing to start operating in New Jersey, rose 10.7 percent. 
The company could be ready to take bets in less than a month from New Jersey's Monmouth Park Racetrack if the state gives it the legal go-ahead, William Hill US Chief Executive Joe Asher told reporters on a conference call. 
""We're going to get ready to open for business as soon as possible,"" said Asher, who estimated that $10 billion is bet on sports annually in New Jersey. Since bookmakers typically keep about 5 percent of a wager, that would represent a $500-million business in that state alone.
William Hill has infrastructure in place in Delaware as well as New Jersey, but Asher did not give a timeline for starting operations in that state.
Jefferies analyst David Katz estimated in an April research note that the market for legal sports betting could range between $1.2 billion and $57.6 billion of total wagers, with proceeds for gaming operators between $62 million and $2.9 billion. 
Katz also said negotiating regulations and issuing licenses could be time-consuming and push earnings out further than some investors might expect. 
Casino and race track operator Penn National (O:PENN) shares registered a record high, last up 4.3 percent at $33.62. Shares in Caesars Entertainment (O:CZR), which operates casinos in 13 U.S. states and five countries, were last up 4.6 percent at $12.45. 
Madison Square Garden (N:MSG), owner of the New York Knicks basketball team and the New York Rangers hockey team, was last up 2.9 percent at $261.48. 

Shares in overseas bookmakers  Paddy Power  Betfair (I:PPB) and GVC Holdings (L:GVC) also jumped in brisk trading on Monday.

It is the first instance of state support to a Russian company targeted in a wave of U.S. sanctions imposed in April in response to Moscow's alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections and what Washington called other ""malign activities"".
Earlier on Monday, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said the government was working on extending credit support, via Promsvyazbank, to two other companies hit by the sanctions: aluminum tycoon Oleg Deripaska's Rusal (HK:0486) and GAZ .
""The Renova company, sanctioned by the United States, last week received support in the form of credit line from Promsvyazbank, provided on a repayable basis,"" the finance ministry said in a statement.
""Government funds were not used for this purpose,"" the finance ministry added.
Russia's central bank took over Promsvyazbank in a bailout last year. The lender was then earmarked by the government to provide credit to sanctioned entities so that other lenders could offload the risk.

As a result of Washington's sanctions, all U.S. dollar bank accounts of companies controlled by Renova have been blocked and assets totaling between $1.5 billion and $2 billion have been frozen, sources told Reuters in April.

81,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 07:06PM ET</span>",Musk says 'thorough reorganization' underway at Tesla,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) chief Elon Musk told employees on Monday the company was undergoing a ""thorough reorganization"" as it contends with production problems, senior staff departures and recent crashes involving its electric cars.
In his email to staff, Musk said Tesla was ""flattening the management structure to improve communication,"" combining functions and trimming activities ""not vital to the success of our mission"" in the reorganization.
The company confirmed the contents of the email, which was first reported on by the Wall Street Journal.
Tesla is at a critical juncture as it tries to fix an inauspicious launch of the Model 3 sedan, a mid-market car crucial to its success and future profitability that has been plagued by early production problems.
Tesla shares fell 3 percent to close at $291.97 on Monday.
Amid the manufacturing problems, senior Tesla executives have departed or cut back work. Waymo, Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) self-driving unit, said on Sunday that Matthew Schwall had joined from Tesla, where he was its main technical contact with U.S. safety investigators.
Last week, Tesla said Doug Field, senior vice president of engineering, was taking time off to recharge.
The company is developing multiple new vehicles, including a semi truck, and has registered a new car firm in Shanghai in a likely step toward production in China.
On a May 2 earnings call, Musk said Tesla would conduct ""a reorganization restructuring"" this month, without providing more details.
He added that he would reduce the number of third-party contracting companies engaged by Tesla, equating them with ""barnacles"" needing to be scrubbed off.
Tesla will still rapidly hire people to fill critical positions ""to support the Model 3 production ramp and future product development,"" Musk said in Monday's email.
Tesla faces a slew of other issues, from increased skepticism over its finances to safety probes by regulators.
Investors gave a rare rebuke to Musk after he cut off financial analysts on the earnings call, sending shares down 5 percent despite promises that Model 3 production was on track.
The company changed the terms of its borrowing agreement with banks to allow it to pledge its Fremont, California, auto plant as collateral.
A U.S. traffic safety regulator on May 2 contradicted Tesla's claim that the agency had found that its Autopilot technology significantly reduced crashes.
Autopilot, a form of advanced cruise control, handles some driving tasks and warns those behind the wheel they are always responsible for the vehicle's safe operation, Tesla has said.
In a Twitter post on Monday, Musk denied a Wall Street Journal report that Tesla had rejected a system that would have tracked driver eye movement when using Autopilot for cost reasons.
""This is false,"" Musk wrote. ""Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg,"" Musk said. He said Tesla's record of a fatality every 320 million miles compared with last year's national average of 86 million miles, per safety regulators. 
Tesla's record of miles driven could not be confirmed by Reuters.
In another Twitter message on Monday, Musk said the ""probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla,"" saying Tesla would begin reporting safety numbers beginning in the second quarter.
On Monday, firefighters in Switzerland said a fatal accident involving a Tesla may have set off a fire in the car's battery. [L5N1SL7R8] It was the latest accident involving a Tesla. 
A Tesla Model S sedan was traveling at 60 miles (97 km) per hour when it smashed into a fire truck stopped at a red light about 20 miles south of Salt Lake City, Utah, on Friday night, according to police. [L3N1SL52C]
Police said on Monday that the driver, who suffered a broken ankle, said she had been using Autopilot before the crash.
The National Transportation Safety Board said it was not investigating the Utah crash.
Tesla said it had not yet received car data and did not yet know the facts, including whether Autopilot was engaged.

The NTSB said last week it was investigating a Tesla accident in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on May 8 that killed two teenagers and injured another - the agency's fourth active probe into crashes of the company's electric vehicles.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday defended his decision to revisit penalties for Chinese company ZTE Corp for flouting U.S. sanctions on trade with Iran, saying the telecom maker is a big buyer for U.S. suppliers.
Trump, known for his fiery rhetoric against Chinese trade practices he says hurt U.S. jobs, faced backlash from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers after he pledged to work with Chinese President Xi Jinping to help ZTE, saying too many jobs in China had been lost.
The company shut its main operations after the Commerce Department banned U.S. companies from selling components to ZTE for seven years after it violated the terms of a settlement deal for illegally shipping goods made with U.S. parts to Iran and North Korea.
""ZTE, the large Chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies. This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi,"" Trump said on Monday.
ZTE paid more than $2.3 billion to 211 U.S. exporters in 2017, a senior ZTE official said on Friday. U.S. companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of components used in ZTE's smartphones, network gear and other products.
The U.S. Commerce Department is exploring options besides a supplier ban to punish ZTE (SZ:000063) (HK:0763), China's second-largest telecom maker, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said.
""ZTE did do some inappropriate things ... the question is are there alternative remedies to the ones we had originally put forward and that's the area we will be exploring very, very promptly,"" Ross told journalists at the National Press Club in Washington.
ZTE declined comment on Monday. Ross did not provide details about options under consideration.
Washington export control lawyer Doug Jacobson, who represents ZTE suppliers, said Trump's tweet ""gives ZTE light at the end of the tunnel.""
Shares of ZTE suppliers rose after Trump's pledge. Acacia Communications Inc (O:ACIA), an optical component maker, jumped nearly 9 percent.
Since the ZTE ban went into effect last month, U.S. suppliers have sought guidance from the Commerce Department about inventory.
The companies would like to withdraw the inventory so they can sell the components elsewhere. But in a possible indication the government is considering easing the ban, suppliers are being told to wait a week or so before taking further action, a source familiar with the situation said.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
Trump's olive branch comes as his top trade and economic officials prepare to meet this week in Washington with Chinese Vice Premier Liu for talks on trade concerns ranging from intellectual property protections to farm goods to steel capacity.
Trump has threatened $150 billion in tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, and China has threatened to retaliate against U.S. exports, including soybeans and aircraft.
Ross said ""the gap remains wide"" on how to address the trade imbalance between the two nations.
Sources briefed on the matter said Beijing demanded the ZTE issue be resolved as a prerequisite for broader trade talks.
The Wall Street Journal reported Beijing would back away from threats to slap tariffs on U.S. farm goods in exchange for easing the ban on selling components to ZTE, citing people in both countries briefed on the emerging deal.
Two sources, who declined to be identified, told Reuters on Sunday China was willing in principle to import more U.S. agriculture products in return for Washington smoothing out penalties against ZTE.
A U.S. official briefed on the matter said a possible deal involving ZTE and U.S. agriculture products could include Chinese concessions to allow completion of Qualcomm Inc's (O:QCOM) $44 billion takeover of  NXP Semiconductors  (O:NXPI), which has been delayed by a lengthy antitrust review by Chinese regulators.
NXP shares surged 11.8 percent on Monday.
CAUGHT OFF GUARD
U.S. intelligence officials on Sunday evening and Monday said they were caught off guard by Trump’s reversal and remained concerned about security threats they said the Chinese company poses to the United States and its allies.
Speaking on the condition of anonymity, three officials said the Chinese government, which has close ties to ZTE, could use its mobile phones and other technology to spy on U.S. citizens, companies and government activities.
By handing the decision to the Commerce Department, Trump appeared to prioritize commercial issues over security concerns, and cut national security officials out of the process, they said.
Republican senators Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton have backed legislation that would prevent the U.S. government from buying or leasing equipment from ZTE or Huawei, the largest Chinese telecom maker.
""I hope this isn't the beginning of backing down to China,"" Rubio said on Twitter. ""We are crazy to allow them to operate in U.S. without tighter restrictions."" 
The White House said Trump wanted Ross to look at the issue ""consistent with applicable laws and regulations"" after Chinese officials raised the matter in various talks.

""This is part of a very complex relationship between the United States and China that involves economic issues, national security issues, and the like,"" White House spokesman Raj Shah said on Monday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. auto safety agency wants to meet with 12 major automakers that failed to fulfill a December 2017 target deadline for completing repairs on the highest-priority vehicles with dangerous Takata air bag inflators.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Monday it had written letters on May 3 to automakers including Honda Motor Co (T:7267), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), General Motors Co (N:GM),  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA),  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F).
NHTSA said the 12 automakers have collectively repaired 65 percent of 20 million vehicles in the highest priority groups, leaving about 7 million unrepaired.
In total, nearly 30 million U.S. vehicles remain unrepaired in an air bag recall affecting 19 automakers, the largest auto recall recorded. At least 22 deaths and more than 290 injuries worldwide are linked to Takata inflators that can explode, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June 2017.
A trade group representing major automakers did not immediately comment on the NHTSA request to meet with company representatives.
The NHTSA has been criticized by some Democratic lawmakers for not doing more to prod automakers to fix vehicles faster. A U.S. Senate hearing in March also looked at the issue.
Heidi King, who has served as deputy NHTSA administrator since September, has been tapped by President Donald Trump to run the agency and faces a confirmation hearing on Wednesday. King said in the letter she was ""deeply concerned"" that millions of vehicles in the highest risk category remain unrepaired. 
Senator Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the Commerce Committee, said last week he wants King to work to speed up efforts to get Takata airbags replaced. Of the 22 deaths worldwide, 15 are in the United States. In total, 20 deaths have been reported in Honda vehicle and two in Ford pickup trucks.
""These numbers show that we still have a huge problem with getting these dangerous airbags replaced and off our highways,” Nelson said.
Other companies with vehicles include Nissan Motor Co (T:7201), Subaru Corp (T:7270) and Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261). 

Takata pleaded guilty in 2017 single felony count of wire fraud to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation and agreed to a $1 billion settlement. The company is under the oversight of an independent monitor for three years.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Thieves siphoned hundreds of millions of pesos out of Mexican banks, including No. 2 Banorte, by creating phantom orders that wired funds to bogus accounts and promptly withdrew the money, two sources close to the government's investigation said. 
Hackers sent hundreds of false orders to move amounts ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of pesos from banks including Banorte, to fake accounts in other banks, the sources said, and accomplices then emptied the accounts in cash withdrawals in dozens of branch offices. 
One source said the thieves transferred more than 300 million pesos ($15.4 million). 
Daily newspaper El Financiero said about 400 million pesos had been stolen in the hack, citing an anonymous source.
It was not clear how much of the money transferred was later withdrawn in cash. 
Some of the attempts to fraudulently transfer funds were blocked, the sources said. 
Lorenza Martinez, head of Banxico's payment system, told Reuters on Friday that five institutions saw ""unauthorized transfers.""
Both she and the central bank stopped short of calling it a cyber attack. 
Inter-bank transfers slowed in later April, feeding worries that Latin America's second biggest economy could be the latest victim in a global wave of cyber attacks.
Hackers may have had help inside bank branches, since such big cash withdrawals are uncommon, one source said. 
""In terms of the security of the bank's offices, I think that is part of the analysis that each bank is doing,"" Martinez said.
Martinez said that the central bank's SPEI interbank transfer system was not compromised but that the problem had to do with software developed by institutions or third-party providers to connect to the payment system.
Many banks have migrated to an alternate, slower technology to connect to the payment system, she said.
A Banorte spokeswoman declined to answer questions from Reuters on Monday, and pointed to May 9 statement from the bank that said clients' deposits were not affected by the ""incident."" 
Mexico's SPEI system is a domestic network similar to the SWIFT global messaging system that moves trillions of dollars each day. Hackers have used SWIFT connections to attack banks around the world. 

The central bank also said that no clients had been affected so far. Martinez said that the transfers hit accounts of financial institutions in the central bank.

 Speaking to Bloomberg TV, Steve Eisman said: ""Deutsche Bank has real profitability issues, they haven't spent money on technology in a long time, they're probably under capitalised, I think they're probably raising capital next year.
""Deutsche Bank is a problem bank, I think it has to shrink dramatically.""
Deutsche Bank in February  reported a full year loss of €497 million ($621 million) for 2017, its third year of losses in a row.  John Cryan was ousted as CEO in April and his replacement, Christian Sewing, has  announced plans to scale back US operations and cut jobs as a result.
Eisman is famous for being the main character in ""The Big Short,"" the non-fiction book about the 2008 subprime mortgage bubble in the US written by Michael Lewis. Eisman was played by Steve Carrell in the 2015 film adaptation of the book.
Eisman, who is now a money manager at the Neuberger Berman Group, told Bloomberg TV he thought ""regulators in the United States did a good job post-crisis"" in fixing structural issues but said: ""Europe is better, but not good enough.""
Eisman said he couldn't comment on consolidation among European banks but said: ""I think there's definitely going to be consolidation [of banks] in the United States, which is driven by how much companies like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) are spending on technology which is $10-11 billion a year, versus the much smaller regional banks.""
NEXT UP: Deutsche Bank ousts CEO Cryan — and his replacement sees 'tough decisions' ahead"
94,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 05:24PM ET</span>",CBS sues controlling Redstone family in bid for independence,"By Jessica Toonkel and Tom Hals
(Reuters) - CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS) filed a lawsuit on Monday to reduce the voting power of controlling shareholder National Amusements Inc, the movie theater company owned by Sumner and Shari Redstone, in an act of defiance aimed at thwarting the Redstones' plan to merge CBS with Viacom Inc. 
CBS said in its lawsuit it is seeking to prevent the Redstones from ousting any directors or changing the company's bylaws before its full board meets on Thursday to consider issuing a dividend that would curb National Amusements' voting power.
If the dividend is approved, National Amusements' voting rights in CBS would shrink to about 17 percent from about 80 percent, more in line with National Amusements' economic stake in CBS of 10.3 percent, according to CBS's lawsuit, filed with the Court of Chancery in Delaware. 
Legal experts said the lawsuit was a rare example of a company attempting to use a ""nuclear option"" to free itself from its controlling shareholder, setting the stage for a high-stakes legal battle over the future of one of the biggest U.S. entertainment companies. 
CBS is ""at least sending the signal and creating evidence they had the best interests of everyone in mind, and not (Shari Redstone),"" said Brian Quinn, a professor at the Boston College Law School.
National Amusements denied it had any plan to oust CBS's board. 
""National Amusements had absolutely no intention of replacing the CBS board or forcing a deal that was not supported by both companies,"" it said in a statement. ""National Amusements' conduct throughout supports this, and reflects its commitment to a well-governed process.""
Shari Redstone was surprised by the lawsuit, particularly since CBS and Viacom had informally agreed on a stock exchange ratio for a deal of 0.6135 CBS shares for every Viacom class B share, according to people familiar with the situation. CNBC first reported the exact ratio earlier on Monday.
BULLYING ACCUSATION 
In its statement, National Amusements said it believes CBS filed its lawsuit because National Amusements had raised specific concerns about incidents of bullying and intimidation by one CBS director, dating back to 2016. 
National Amusements brought these concerns up again with CBS last week, according to one of the sources familiar with the situation.
CBS declined to comment on the bullying accusation.
CBS shares ended trading up 2.2 percent at $53.65 on Monday on hopes of a better deal for the company. Viacom shares fell 5 percent at $28.74, as investors fretted over the company's prospects as a standalone company.
CBS's lawsuit comes after its merger negotiations with smaller peer Viacom, which National Amusements also controls, failed to produce a deal. The talks, that started in February, had hit an impasse over disagreements about price as well as the leadership of the combined company, sources have said. 
It was the second attempt in three years by Shari Redstone to merge CBS and Viacom, after her father separated them 12 years ago.
National Amusements believes a deal is needed for the two media companies to gain scale and compete with growing internet powers Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) pushing deeper into the media business.
In its lawsuit, CBS cited the battle for control of publisher Hollinger International Inc, which like CBS had a controlling shareholder, Conrad Black, who wanted to sell control of the company over opposition from the board. 
A Delaware court ruled in 2004 that the Hollinger board could dilute Black’s voting control in response to what it considered to be the damage he had done to the company.
""Ms. Redstone has acted to undermine the (CBS) management team, including, without board authority, talking to potential CEO replacements, deriding the chief operating officer and threatening to change the board,"" the lawsuit said.
CBS sees good reason to worry about Redstone replacing directors. In 2016, National Amusements waged a legal battle and took back control of Viacom after ousting its CEO Philippe Dauman. 
INTEREST FROM VERIZON
In a sign that CBS is keeping the door open to negotiations with Redstone, CBS said in its lawsuit that if it is granted an injunction against Redstone, it would agree not to issue the dividend once it approves it, pending further orders from the court. 
CBS said in its lawsuit that Shari Redstone had taken actions over the past two years that have led the special committee of the board considering the merger to conclude that she presents a ""significant threat"" to the company and its stockholders.
Its proposed dividend would not dilute the economic interests of any CBS stockholder, but would help the company to operate as an independent, non-controlled company and fully evaluate strategic alternatives, the company said.
CBS's lawsuit also said Redstone rejected an approach by an unnamed potential acquirer of CBS, citing that as another reason her interests are not aligned with other CBS shareholders. 
The undisclosed party is U.S. wireless carrier  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ), according to two sources familiar with the situation who requested anonymity to disclose confidential details. Verizon declined to comment.

CBS's lawsuit has been assigned to Delaware Chancellor Andre Bouchard, who will consider the request for a temporary restraining order on Wednesday.

Janaillac, who announced his resignation on May 4 after French staff voted against a pay proposal, has been asked to remain on until after the end of Tuesday's annual shareholder meeting, which starts at 1230 GMT.
Among contenders in the frame for the interim CEO role is Anne-Marie Idrac, 66, an independent director on the Air France-KLM governing board who joined the group in November 2017.
Idrac was previously head of the RATP Paris public transport authority and the SNCF state railway operator, and was also previously secretary of state for transport. 
The French government, Air France-KLM's largest shareholder with a 14 percent stake, has said it would like someone with experience of the aviation industry.
Other names cited by French media include Fabrice Bregier, former head of the planemaking arm of aerospace and defense group Airbus, Franck Terner, currently CEO of the Air France business and Gilles Gateau, head of HR at Air France.
The new boss will be appointed on an interim basis but it is not clear how long that means. 
The unions have suspended their strike action while Air France-KLM replaces Janaillac. So far, 15 days of walkouts this year have cost Air France-KLM around 400 million euros, while rising oil prices are adding to the pressure on the company. 
Although the unions have said they feel vindicated in their strike action by Janaillac's resignation, the signals are that change is coming for Air France. 
French President Emmanuel Macron is trying to push through labor reforms, also prompting strikes on the railways. Air France-KLM also has two relatively new shareholders in Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and China Eastern (SS:600115) , which each hold a 9 percent stake. 

""Given the changes to both board and politics, we expect the new CEO to be appointed with a mandate to restructure rather than appease,"" HSBC analyst Andrew Lobbenberg said in a note.

Coming off the strong rally of more than 2% last week when stocks saw their best weekly gain since March, the Dow was on track at the open to log its eighth straight session of gains.
Sentiment was boosted by an apparent thawing of trade relations between China and the U.S. as President Donald Trump announced over the weekend that he planned to help Chinese telecom ZTE (HK:0763) “get back to business”.
The announcement arrived ahead of a second round of trade talks that begin on Tuesday, even though Beijing has indicated that it does not plan to change its current stance in the trade dispute.
With no major economic reports scheduled for release on Monday, investors will watch for clues from Federal Reserve policy makers on the pace of future rate hikes this year.
Speaking earlier on Monday, Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester reiterated her support for “the continued gradual removal of policy accommodation”.
While Mester said that she does not expect inflation to pick up sharply, she warned that the Fed may need to raise interest rates above 3% if the U.S. economy grew faster than expected.
Markets have fully priced in a rate hike at the Fed’s next two-day meeting ending on June 13, with another increase to come at the September policy decision. However, market participants remain on the fence over whether an additional rate hike will arrive in December.

DUBAI (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund are in early talks with banks about potential funding for a multi-billion dollar solar power project planned in the kingdom, say sources familiar with the matter.
The talks follow an agreement, signed and announced in March, between PIF and SoftBank to create the New Solar Energy Plan 2030, the world's largest project of its type.
Saudi Arabia is embarking on a huge push to transform its economy and reduce its dependence on oil. One of the world's biggest oil exporters, Saudi Arabia's rulers view solar power as a way to cut the amount of crude it uses to generate power at home and raise its overseas shipments.
Nobody from SoftBank or PIF immediately responded to a Reuters request for comment.
The pair had started preliminary talks in the past few weeks with Saudi Arabian and some international banks to assess which financing tools would be available for a project of that size, one of the sources said. The other described the discussions as an unofficial sounding-out of banks.
At the time of the announcement in March, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said the project was expected to have the capacity to produce up to 200 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, adding to around 400 GW of globally installed solar power capacity. 
The initial phase of the project, for 7.2 GW of solar capacity, will cost $5 billion, with $1 billion coming from SoftBank's Vision Fund and the rest from project financing, Son said in March. The final investment total for the entire project will eventually total around $200 billion, Son said.
Last May, Softbank said it raised over $93 billion for the Vision Fund, the world's largest private equity fund with backers including PIF and Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
Bankers say the size and scale of the project mean it might be given priority by the government ahead of other energy infrastructure plans.
Despite its sunny climate, Saudi Arabia produces most of its electricity from oil-fired power plants.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street ended a choppy session slightly higher on Monday as weakness in defensive stocks offset optimism following U.S. President Donald Trump's conciliatory remarks toward China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763) that calmed the waters of U.S.-China trade tensions.
The S&P 500 (SPX) pared its gains after hitting a roughly two-month high earlier in the session, but at closing bell the index held onto its four-day winning streak.
Trump vowed on Sunday to help China-based communications firm ZTE (SZ:000063) ""get back into business, fast"" nearly a month after the Commerce Department implemented a ban on U.S. companies selling to the company.
Trump's reversal arrived on the cusp of high-level talks between the world's two largest economies, due to resume this week after back-and-forth rhetoric between the countries stoked fears that retaliatory tariffs could be imposed.
""Hopefully they can strike some deals that are amenable to both countries but also keep the economies on the rails and not force a trade war,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 68.24 points, or 0.27 percent, to 24,899.41, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 2.41 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,730.13 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 8.43 points, or 0.11 percent, to 7,411.32.
With 91 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported first-quarter results, earnings were on pace for a 26.1 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
""I think the issue is not so much are the earnings that are being reported today going to be good,"" Carlson said. ""It's almost like: Are they going to be too good? Are they setting up difficult comparisons 12 months hence, and how is the market going to respond to that?"" 
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, defensive utilities (SPLRCU), telecoms (SPLRCL) and real estate <.SPLRCR> stocks were the biggest percentage losers. 
Healthcare (SPXHC) stocks saw the largest gains after the Trump administration unveiled its drug price proposals. 
Meanwhile, energy (SPNY) companies advanced as oil prices (CLc1) rose following an OPEC report that the global oil glut had been all but eliminated.
Smaller-sized U.S. stocks are outperforming the heavyweights; while the Russell 2000 (RUT) slipped 0.2 percent, earlier in the session it came within less than two points of its previous record high.
Gaming company stocks jumped as the U.S. Supreme Court paved the way for states to legalize sports betting. Casino and race track operator Penn National (O:PENN) posted a record high, last up 4.7 percent. Caesars Entertainment (O:CZR), and Madison Square Garden (N:MSG) gained 5.5 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively.
U.S. optical component maker stocks received a boost from the ZTE news, with Acacia Communications (O:ACIA) up 8.7 percent.  Oclaro  Inc (O:OCLR) and  Lumentum Holdings Inc  (O:LITE) advanced 2.9 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively.
Shares of defense contractors such as Raytheon (N:RTN),  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) and  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC) weighed on the markets as investors pointed to easing geopolitical tensions.
 Xerox Corp  (N:XRX) shares slid 4.3 percent after abandoning a planned $6.1 billion deal with Fujifilm Holdings Corp (T:4901).
Shares of Viacom Inc (O:VIAB) dropped 4.9 percent after CBS Corp (N:CBS) sued to stop controlling shareholder Shari Redstone's planned merger with Viacom. CBS was up 2.0 percent.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 114 new highs and 34 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.96 billion shares, compared to the 6.65 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

103,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 07:23AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Saudi Aramco trading arm ATC sells first U.S. oil to United Arab Emirates: sources,"By Florence Tan, Devika Krishna Kumar and Nidhi Verma
SINGAPORE/NEW YORK/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Saudi oil producer Aramco's trading arm has begun supplying U.S. condensate, an ultra-light crude oil, to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), four people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Monday, underlining the giant firm's global ambitions.
The sale marks Aramco Trading Company's (ATC) first U.S. crude spot trade, the people said, with ATC tapping Aramco's Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] unit in the United States as a supply source for two shipments to the UAE.
Aramco sells almost all its crude under long-term contracts, but decided last year to trade in non-Saudi crude in the short-term spot market.
For the UAE trades, a first shipment of 1 million barrels (bbl) of U.S. condensate aboard the tanker 'Astra' was unloaded at Ruwais on May 12, according to the sources and shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon. All the sources declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to media.
Motiva has also chartered the tanker 'South Sea' to ship about 1 million bbl of condensate from the U.S. Gulf to Ruwais in May for about $2 million, one U.S.-based shipping source said. Both vessels are 'Suezmax' tankers, with capacities from 120,000-200,000 deadweight tonnes, named after the Suez Canal as they are able to transit the canal fully laden.
As of May 12, the 'South Sea' was docked at Corpus Christi in Texas, shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed.
Motiva, which operates a 603,000-barrel-per-day refinery at Port Arthur, Texas, and ATC did not respond to requests for comment.
NEW STRATEGY
While the shipments from the United States are a first, the move fits into a strategy outlined by Aramco executives last month.
""ATC has started supplying some condensate from West to the East. It started only a few weeks back, slowly, but we will have to make sure that there is an economic sense for us for crude trading,"" Saudi Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser told Reuters, speaking on the sidelines of a conference in April.
Nasser said ATC had been focusing on crude oil processing arrangements at refineries with spare capacity, which are mainly located in Europe.
But more ATC trades with U.S. oil are set to follow. Motiva is still looking for ships to move U.S. oil to the East, the shipping source said, as price differentials between U.S. crude (CLc1) and international crude (LCOc1) make such trades profitable.
Earlier this month, ATC was also one of the successful bidders in a tender issued by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) to buy condensate for delivery in July to September, the sources said.
ADNOC bought 6.5 million barrels of condensate in the tender with the bulk of the supplies coming from the United States, a source familiar with the matter said.
Abdulla Salem Al Dhaheri, Director, Marketing Sales & Trading at ADNOC, told Reuters: ""By tendering our condensate we are able to diversify our supply and achieve better commercial value. For example, we are able to take advantage of arbitrage cargoes from long distances that have delivered ADNOC more value and higher returns.""
He added that ADNOC now buys condensate from various suppliers.
ADNOC started importing U.S. oil in the second half of last year after a diplomatic row with Qatar.
ATC is also looking to extend its trading operations in Asia.
ATC's CEO Ibrahim al-Buainain told Reuters last month it plans to handle crude in Asia through its Singapore office in the third quarter of this year, and aims to boost its volumes for trading crude and refined products globally to 6 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2020, up from negligible amounts currently.

Buainain said his company mostly handles third-party crude and has traded ""very small"" Saudi crude volumes in processing deals in return for refined products.

The blue-chip Dow futures gained 63 points, or 0.25%, by 6:48AM ET (10:48GMT), the S&P 500 futures rose 4 points, or 0.15%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 16 points, or 0.23%
Coming off the strong rally of more than 2% last week when stocks saw their best weekly gain since March, investors looked set to continue the bullish momentum on Monday.
The fact that U.S. President Donald Trump announced over the weekend that he planned to help Chinese telecom ZTE (HK:0763) “get back to business” eased tensions ahead of a second round of trade talks that begin on Tuesday, even though Beijing has indicated that it does not plan to change its current stance in the trade dispute.
With no major economic reports scheduled for release on Monday, investors will watch for clues from Federal Reserve policy makers on the pace of future rate hikes this year.
Speaking earlier on Monday, Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester reiterated her support for “the continued gradual removal of policy accommodation”.
While Mester said that she does not expect inflation to pick up sharply, she warned that the Fed may need to raise interest rates above 3% if the U.S. economy grew faster than expected.
Markets have fully priced in a rate hike at the Fed’s next two-day meeting ending on June 13, with another increase to come at the September policy decision. However, market participants remain on the fence over whether an additional rate hike will arrive in December.
St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard is slated to speak about cryptocurrencies at the CoinDesk Consensus 2018 conference in New York at 9:40AMET (13:40GMT).
The dollar continued to move lower against a basket of the other major currencies on Monday, putting it on track for its fourth straight session of declines.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.25% at 92.21 by 6:49AM ET (10:49GMT), as investors waited for retail sales to be released on Tuesday.
With the first quarter earnings season coming to an end (only 10 S&P firms will report this week), retailers will pick up the reporting baton with  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) starting things off on Tuesday. Results from Macy's (NYSE:M) are on the agenda for Wednesday; while Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the world’s largest retailer, is due to report earnings on Thursday.
Meanwhile, oil prices were under pressure, as a rise in U.S. drilling for new production dampened sentiment.
U.S. drillers added 10 oil rigs last week, bringing the total count to 844, the highest number since March 2015. That was the sixth consecutive weekly increase in the rig count, underscoring worries about rising U.S. output.
U.S. crude futures fell 0.17% to $70.58 by 6:50AM ET (10:50GMT), while Brent oil was unchanged at $77.12.
Elsewhere, European stock markets were slightly lower around midday trade, as investors focused on Italian politics, trade relations between the U.S. and China and the drop in oil prices.
Earlier, Asian shares closed higher as the apparent thawing in relations between China and the U.S. boosted sentiment."
105,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 08:29AM ET</span>",Tesla registers Shanghai electric car firm ahead of ownership rule change,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) has registered a new electric car firm in Shanghai, as China prepares to scrap rules on capping foreign ownership of new-energy vehicle (NEV) ventures.
The new company, Tesla (Shanghai) Co Ltd, was registered on May 10, according to a filing with the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System seen by Reuters. 
The new company will focus on electric cars, spare parts and batteries, according to the filing.
The U.S. carmaker has been in protracted negotiations to set up its own plant in Shanghai to produce vehicles locally, helping bolster its position in the country's fast-growing market for electric cars and to avoid high import tariffs.
It was not clear if the new firm was related to the anticipated Shanghai plant.
""We don't have anything new to add on this registration for now,"" a Tesla spokeswoman told Reuters on Monday.
The new company, registered in south-east Shanghai within the city's free-trade zone area lists Tesla China head Zhu Xiaotong as its legal representative, and  Tesla Motors  HK Limited as the sole shareholder in the firm.
Tesla currently imports all the cars it sells in China from the United States. It has other wholly-owned firms registered in China focused on sales and research and development.
China has said it will scrap limits on foreign ownership of NEV ventures this year and all automotive ventures by 2022, a major policy shift in the world's top car market that has capped foreign ownership at 50 percent for over two decades.
U.S. firms have also been caught up in the crossfire of a bruising trade dispute between the two countries, although there are signs of a thaw in relations ahead of a second round of trade talks in Washington later this week.
Analysts have said the main beneficiaries of looser ownership rules would be NEV makers like Tesla, which has been keen to maintain control of its own plant and protect its technology rather than cede a 50 percent share.

Tesla boss Elon Musk has previously criticized China's tough auto rules for foreign businesses, saying they created an uneven playing field. However, earlier this month he said the firm could soon unveil the location of a Chinese gigafactory.

Pieter Elbers said KLM had benefited from the increased scale of the joint company, created in 2004, and the two businesses needed each other. 
""Just as it’s not feasible for KLM to continue independently, it’s also not feasible for Air France to go on alone,"" he said in an interview on Dutch television.
""That’s the strength of the combination, we need each other badly.”
Elbers' remarks come ahead of a meeting by Air France-KLM's board on Tuesday to decide on an interim leadership team in the wake of the resignation of CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac, after Air France workers rejected his pay increase proposal..
Elbers said profits at Air France had totaled 500 million euros in recent years, while strikes this year by the French business's workers had cost the company 400 million euros.
Striking is a right, but ""it brings, in my view, an enormous responsibility with it,"" he said on the Buitenhof program on Sunday.
""Not every goal justifies using any means."" 

He said hopes the French government would ultimately come to the company's rescue were also an ""illusion"" because state aid is forbidden by European Union law.

110,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>",Credit raters put pressure on Deutsche Bank over new strategy,"By Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) new chief executive Christian Sewing needs to come up with a convincing strategy swiftly to stave off the threat of costly credit downgrades, the leading rating agencies told Reuters.
Standard & Poor's is expected to say by the end of the month whether it will cut the rating of Germany's largest lender after putting it on ""credit watch"" in April.
Chances of a downgrade are ""at least 50 percent"", Giles Edwards, S&P's lead ratings analyst on  Deutsche Bank , said in an interview with Reuters.
S&P, like its counterparts Moody's and Fitch, is awaiting details on Deutsche's future strategy after the bank announced the outline of a revamp last month.
""We want to see that it's not going to take a lot longer than previously thought to deliver, that it's not going to be more expensive, and that it is credible,"" S&P's Edwards told Reuters. ""Banks need their clients to be confident.""
Edwards and the other analysts interviewed for this article are the lead or primary analysts at their agencies for Deutsche Bank. Final decisions on ratings are made by committees of which they are a part. 
S&P rates Deutsche Bank's long-term credit at A-, on negative credit watch. That is one or two notches below most major European competitors. By comparison, S&P rates Switzerland's UBS (S:UBSG) at A+ with a stable outlook.
Credit ratings are critical for any company but especially crucial for a bank such as Deutsche, whose perceived health is important in winning business.
Sewing, who has been with Deutsche for almost three decades, announced in late April that the bank would pare back the U.S. and Asia operations of its sprawling investment bank and refocus on Germany and Europe. He also said that Deutsche would invest in retail banking in its home market and in asset management.
The bank holds its annual general meeting on May 24 and is expected to provide more details on strategy by then.
The bank's credit ratings have come under pressure in the weeks since it announced the promotion of retail banking specialist Sewing following a board meeting on the evening of Sunday April 8.
Three of four major ratings agencies have warned of a dimmer outlook for the bank, with DRBS being the latest last week.
HIGH STAKES
A lot is riding on the ratings calls for Deutsche, which like all financial institutions, is among big issuers of debt securities and highly reliant upon credit ratings.
Lower ratings can result in higher funding costs, which could further hamper Deutsche's attempt to return to profitability after three consecutive years of losses.
The bank said earlier this year that it had fallen behind in its original 2018 cost cutting targets as revenue dwindles.
Deutsche has also been struggling to win back clients after speculation of a government bailout in 2016, and any vote of less confidence from ratings agencies could send anxious customers scurrying, analysts say.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment on its ratings but Dixit Joshi, the bank's group treasurer, told fixed-income analysts this month that Deutsche was disappointed by the agencies' stance. 
""We don't think our ratings accurately reflect the strength of our balance sheet and our low risk levels, but we will continue to work with the agencies to allay their concerns,"" Joshi said.
Those concerns were heightened after the ousting of Chief Executive Officer John Cryan last month and the departure of several other senior executives. 
Moody's changed its outlook to negative on some of its ratings the day after Sewing announced changes at the investment bank amid ""rising execution challenges at Deutsche Bank.""
Peter Nerby, lead analyst for Moody's on Deutsche Bank, told Reuters in an interview that the agency normally resolves changes in outlook in 12 to 18 months.
Nerby is studying the timing and path toward his definition of an ""idealized future state"" for the bank, which he defines as 5.4 billion euros ($6.4 billion) in annual profit and 30 billion euros in revenue. Last year, the bank posted a loss of 735 million euros and generated 26 billion euros in revenue.
""If we conclude that goal is not achievable in any reasonable time frame, then the rating may be too high,"" Nerby said.
Fitch is the only major agency to refrain so far from any formal change in rating or outlook, though it downgraded Deutsche Bank last September. 
Christian Scarafia, Fitch's primary analyst on Deutsche, said in an interview that the September downgrade ""spoke to what we've then seen developing in the fourth quarter last year and first quarter of this year.""
Last month, he warned that the bank's turnaround ""has been slow and insufficient"" and that ""quick results will be crucial"".

The weak start to 2018 ""puts pressure on to implement the turnaround,"" Scarafia said. ""The sensitivities remain very clear."" ($1 = 0.8391 euros)

The pilots have announced they will strike on Monday and Wednesday after weeks of negotiations with the airline.
Brussels Airlines said it regretted the action, which would affect more than 60,000 passengers booked on 557 flights into and out of Brussels on the two days.
It listed 54 flights it would operate on Monday and 60 on Wednesday and said there were likely to be additions in the course of the day.
Pilots want a pay increase, a better work-life balance, improved career prospects and the possibility of earlier retirement. Some 80 percent of them voted to strike. Union leaders have said some of the concerns relate to uncertainty over the future of the airline within Lufthansa.
Neighboring France has also been hit by strikes by airline staff.
Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) last week raised its estimate of the impact to the company from a wave of strikes to around 400 million euros ($479 million).
Brussels Airlines says it has made a number of offers to address staff concerns and would be making a new offer in talks scheduled for Monday.
Lufthansa, which took control of the Belgian national flag carrier in 2016, earlier this year appointed a new chief executive officer and chief operating officer for the airline.
The German company plans to use Brussels Airlines, which started in 2007, to expand long-haul operations for its Eurowings budget brand out of Duesseldorf.

114,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 05:54AM ET</span>",ZTE employees in China cheer Trump tweet,"By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Employees of ZTE Corp (HK:0763), the Chinese telecom equipment maker, are cheering a tweet by U.S. President Donald Trump that suggested a resolution is in sight for a devastating ban on sales to the Chinese company.
In an unexpected reversal of a hardline U.S. stance on the issue, Trump said on Twitter on Sunday that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping were working together to give ZTE ""a way to get back into business, fast"", citing the loss of many jobs in China.
ZTE was last month hit by a move by Washington to forbid U.S. firms supplying the Chinese company with components and technology after it was found to have violated U.S. export restrictions by illegally shipping goods to Iran. It has since said that it has suspended its main business operations.
Trump's tweet was reposted widely by ZTE employees on social media with comments expressing relief, taking it as a sign of a an impending settlement. 
""Wow! Breaking good news!"" a ZTE manager wrote on her WeChat account, pointing to Trump's remark that the U.S. ""Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done"".
""Almost there,"" wrote another ZTE employee.
According to a source close to the company, ZTE management welcomed the latest development and planned to negotiate with the U.S. side for a resolution under the guidance of the Chinese government.
The news boosted telecom and semiconductor related stocks in China, which were among the best performing on Monday.
Zhong Fu Tong Group, a communication network maintenance service provider and ZTE supplier, rose by the daily limit of 10 percent.
ZTE employees contacted by Reuters all expressed surprise and optimism at the turn of events, although some also voiced concern that it was still unclear how long it would take to lift the ban and at what cost. 
""In any case, there are probably going to be layoffs, if the company has to pay another big fine,"" said one employee, who declined to be named. He added that meetings were being held to discuss resumption of production. 
In response to a Reuters request for comment, ZTE's press department said it was preparing a statement. 
Edison Lee, an analyst with Jefferies, expressed caution about the news in a investors' note, saying that ""it does not mean the tech-focused trade conflict between China and the US is over"". 

Lee said Trump appeared to have made the move as a goodwill gesture at China's request in order for trade talks to continue and because he expected concessions from China.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) said on Monday it has applied to China's securities regulator to set up a securities business in which the U.S. bank would own a majority stake under recently relaxed ownership rules.
The unit, in which JPMorgan would own 51 percent, would allow the firm's corporate and investment banking divisions to seek more Chinese clients on the mainland in an effort to expand and grow their businesses, JPMorgan said in a statement.
The U.S. bank also said it is looking to double its research coverage of China-listed companies across all sectors, and that it has appointed banking veteran Mark Leung as chief executive of its China business.
The application is a step toward JPMorgan's return to the securities business in China, having sold its 33 percent holding in a similar venture to its local partner in 2016.
JPMorgan did not disclose who would own the remaining 49 percent of the new venture. However, it said it would raise its ownership to 100 percent if eventually permitted.
China in April said it aims to raise foreign ownership limits in securities, fund management and futures firms to 51 percent. The announcement came as the United States and other trading partners complain of unfair limits on competition.
""These developments are important for China, the U.S. and global commerce, and an encouraging sign for the world's two largest economies,"" JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in the statement.
In the past, Western banks could only own up to 49 percent of Chinese securities joint ventures. The lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration.
JPMorgan joins other foreign banks including Nomura Holdings Inc (T:8604) and UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) who have taken steps in China to set up majority-owned securities businesses, which typically provide broking and underwriting services.
So far, only  HSBC Holdings  PLC (L:HSBA) has received permission to set up a majority-owned securities joint venture in China, taking advantage of rules that favor Hong Kong-established banks over foreign peers.

JPMorgan also said its asset and wealth management unit is also working on increasing its current Chinese joint venture stake to a majority interest, subject to agreement with its joint venture partner and the relevant authorities.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian police on Monday charged the former head of  Punjab National Bank  (PNB) (NS:PNBK) and 10 other officials at the state-run lender in the country's largest-ever bank fraud case, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
India's Central Bureau of investigation (CBI) accused former PNB boss Usha Ananthasubramanian, currently the chief executive of  Allahabad Bank  (NS:ALBK), in the first batch of formal charges to be filed in the case, the two CBI sources said.
It also named PNB executive directors K.V. Brahmaji Rao and Sanjiv Sharan, among others, in a charge sheet filed in a Mumbai court, the sources said, adding the officials were accused of breaching central bank guidelines.
Diamond jeweler Nirav Modi was also among those named in the list, two other sources said.
PNB, India's second-largest state-run bank, disclosed in February that two jewelery groups had defrauded it by raising credit from overseas branches of other Indian banks using illegal guarantees issued by rogue PNB staff over several years.
PNB has been conducting a separate internal probe into the fraud and has already suspended over 20 officials.
The two PNB executives and Ananthasubramanian did not respond to multiple calls and messages seeking comment, while Allahabad Bank was not reachable for comment. Modi's lawyer declined to comment saying he was yet to see the charge sheet. 
Separately, India's banking secretary Rajiv Kumar told media in New Delhi that a government nominee on the board of state-run Allahabad Bank would soon call a meeting to seek the removal of Ananthasubramanian.
The federal government owns controlling stakes in state-run lenders including Allahabad Bank and PNB.
PNB told Reuters on Monday it had relieved Rao and Sharan of their duties.
Indian authorities have arrested at least 20 people in the case and a court has issued non-bailable warrants against accused jewelers Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi. The duo have denied the allegations against them, and authorities have said they both left the country before the fraud was uncovered.

Shares in Allahabad Bank closed 3.4 percent lower on Monday, while those in PNB ended slightly higher on the day.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Investors sorted Malaysia's political haves from the have-nots on the first trading day after a shock election result, dumping shares in firms associated with supporters of ousted prime minister Najib Razak and projects backed by his government.
Veteran politician Mahathir Mohamad came out of retirement to lead the opposition Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) to a stunning victory over a ruling party he had once led, defeating Najib, a former protege he had accused of corruption.
As Malaysian markets reopened for trading after being shut for two days after the election last week, one of the biggest losers in the equity market was AirAsia Group Bhd (KL:AIRA), whose chief executive Tony Fernandes endorsed the incumbent Najib during the campaign. Shares of CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (KL:CIMB), whose group chairman Nazir Razak is Najib's younger brother, also plunged.
Among Monday's biggest winners was the Robert Kuok-controlled  PPB Group Bhd  (KL:PEPT), which rose over four percent following the appointment of Kuok, one of Asia's richest tycoons, as an adviser to the new administration.
More broadly, construction companies were the biggest underperformers after Mahathir's pledge to review large-scale infrastructure projects sponsored by the Najib administration, particularly those that would expand China's economic interests in Malaysia.
Shares of YTL Corp. (KL:YTLS), the conglomerate which was awarded part of the contract to build the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed railway line, fell more than 8 percent. Those of Opcom Holdings (KL:OPCM), a small fiber optics firm led by Mahathir's son Mokhzani Mahathir, jumped 49.6 percent to 0.905 ringgit (less than quarter of a U.S. cent).
""Near-term performance may be constrained by a potential flux in capex plays and government-linked stocks, both prominently represented in institutional portfolios, in our view, as policy risks are repriced,"" said Hoy Kit Mak, head of Malaysia equity research at JP Morgan.
Mak said his stance was to stay in consumer and defensive sectors, including healthcare and telecommunications.
The main stock index (KLSE), one of Asia's top three performers this year in dollar terms, recovered quickly from an early drop, even as the utilities sector remained a drag. The construction sector (KLCT) fell nearly 13 percent.
""The opposition party’s victory has also put into question the future of Chinese investment in the infrastructure sector, which could affect construction stocks,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note to clients.
SONS OF THE SOIL
Malaysia was second only to Russia on a ""crony capitalism"" index published two years ago by the Economist magazine, showing how closely business fortunes have relied on political connections in the Southeast Asian economy.
Successive Malaysian administrations have persisted with statist policies, embodied in five-year plans, that have seen mega-contracts awarded to government-friendly businessmen.
Thus, the end of six decades of rule by the UMNO bloc saw shares of My E.G. Services, a company whose incomes come mainly from government contracts, fall 30 percent.
Shares in AirAsia (KL:AIRA) fell as much as 10 percent after its chief Tony Fernandes apologized for endorsing former Najib in the election.
Meanwhile, 10-year bond yields spiked to 4.25 percent, their highest levels since early 2017, as investors worried that foreign investors who hold nearly half the outstanding government bonds, will sell down. 
Investors had anticipated the bearish reaction to the 92-year-old Mahathir becoming prime minister once more - he had retired in 2003 after 22 years in power. 
Mahathir's poll promises to roll back a goods and services tax, scrap toll fees, reinstate fuel subsidies and raise minimum wages also raise the specter of Malaysia's fiscal deficit widening again.
The ringgit  hit a four-month low of 3.9850 per dollar, but stabilized off those lows fairly early. 
""Banks are significantly vulnerable and could come under pressure given their high foreign ownership and sharp rally in the sector over the past few months,"" Credit Suisse said.

121,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 03:14AM ET</span>",Xerox abandons planned deal with Fujifilm in victory for Icahn and Deason,"By Alwyn Scott and Makiko Yamazaki
NEW YORK/TOKYO (Reuters) -  Xerox Corp  (N:XRX) has scrapped a planned $6.1 billion deal with Fujifilm Holdings Corp (T:4901) in a settlement with activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason that also hands control of the U.S. photocopier giant to new management.
The victory for the billionaire investors puts the Japanese company further on the back foot in any new negotiations with Xerox, although it is by no means out of contention as Xerox is now expected to go up for sale in an auction at a higher price.
Xerox said that it had over several weeks repeatedly asked Fujifilm to immediately start talks about improved terms for a proposed transaction.
""Despite our insistence, Fujifilm provided no assurance that it will do so within an acceptable timeframe,"" the U.S. firm said in a statement on its decision to drop the deal.
Fujifilm was quick to take a combative stance, saying it disputes Xerox's right to terminate the deal and would look at all options including legal action seeking damages.
The two companies agreed in January to a complex deal that would have merged Xerox into their Asia joint venture Fuji Xerox and given Fujifilm control. That prompted Icahn and Deason, who own 15 percent of Xerox and argued the U.S. firm was being undervalued, to launch a proxy fight.
The activist investors have also said they are unhappy with the current structure of the joint venture, and settlement creates uncertainty concerning potential changes to a business that accounts for nearly half of Fujifilm's revenue.
Icahn and Deason have said they believe other investors are ""waiting in the wings"" for Xerox while people familiar with the matter have previously said that buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO) has expressed interest in a bid for Xerox.
INSEPARABLE?
But analysts believe the two firms are inextricably intertwined and that Fujifilm is not without bargaining power, while also doubting that talk of other buyers is that substantial.
""It wouldn't be good if it goes elsewhere. But are there really other potential buyers? Icahn and Deason say there are, because they want a higher price, but you don't really know whether that's for real,"" said Ichiyoshi Asset Management senior executive officer Mitsushige Akino.
Fuji Xerox, 75 percent owned by Fujifilm, handles contracts that supply global clients with Xerox services in the United States and Europe, and Fuji Xerox services in Asia. Moreover, Xerox no longer builds its own office copiers, instead relying mostly on Fuji Xerox.
Xerox said its new board would meet immediately and ""begin a process to evaluate all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.""
Icahn and Deason have said they would consider an all-cash bid of at least $40 per share. In contrast to the investors' argument that Fujifilm is only offering $28 per share, analysts have said the Japanese firm's offer is not too far off that per share valuation, albeit not in cash.
The settlement will see Chief Executive Officer Jeff Jacobson - the main architect of the deal with Fujifilm - as well as five other directors step down. John Visentin is expected to take the helm. 
Visentin had previously been hired by Icahn to assist in fighting Xerox. He had also been a candidate under consideration by the old board to replace Jacobson as recently as last year, according to court documents.
It is Xerox's second settlement with the activist investors in just two weeks. The first settlement agreement was allowed to expire as Xerox came to believe it had flexibility to renegotiate a deal with Fujifilm and also took into account a stock dive that followed the agreement.
""We are extremely pleased that Xerox finally terminated the ill-advised scheme to cede control of the company to Fujifilm,"" Icahn said in a statement.
Xerox also said it was ending the deal partly because Fujifilm had failed to provide audited financial information for Fuji Xerox by an April 15 deadline and that there were ""material deviations"" between audited Fuji Xerox financial statements and unaudited statements provided previously.

Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that he is working with Chinese President Xi to give ZTE Corp (HK:0763) “a way to get back into business, fast.”
“Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done,” said Trump.
The tweet came weeks after the decision to cut off the Chinese firm from its U.S. suppliers and accused the company of violating export restrictions by illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran. ZTE suspended its main operations earlier in the month, while trading in the company’s shares has been suspended since the ban.
""This suggests that Trump might see the chance for real progress on trade talks, and is softening the U.S. position on an issue important to China,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said in a note.
""Trump also needs China to remain on side ahead of his meeting with North Korea's Kim and this also suggests that until the 12 June meeting the signaling from the U.S. on trade will be more positive.""
Malaysian equities were another focus on Monday as the stock market reopened after a two-day holiday following a surprising victory of Mahathir Mohamad in the country's general elections last week. The FTSE Malaysia KLCI recovered in afternoon trade after recording early losses of more than 2%.

Some investors have previously expected the central bank to loosen its policies to support the economy amid growing fears of a trade war with the U.S.
Separately, U.S. officials are set to have talks in Washington with China's top trade official Liu He to resolve an intensifying trade dispute between the two nations, according to reports.
Meanwhile, South Korea’s KOSPI slipped 0.1%. The U.S. is ready to allow investments in North Korea once it has more confirmable evidence of its denuclearization, according to reports who cited two U.S. top national security officials.
The remarks came ahead of a historic summit between Trump and Kim in Singapore on June 12.
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 climbed 0.2%, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 also added 0.3%.
Looking ahead, investors’ attention would likely turn to the retail sales and industrial production data due from the U.S. and China later this week.

123,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 12:00AM ET</span>",GM Korea cancels news briefing as temporary workers storm venue,"BUPYEONG, South Korea (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (N:GM) South Korean unit canceled a news conference on Monday after a dozen temporary workers forced their way into the event venue minutes beforehand, chanting slogans that called on the automaker to hire them full time.
The news conference was to be the first since GM Korea averted bankruptcy last month after winning major concessions from its union of regular workers as well as government funding, and was to be attended by the heads of both GM Korea and GM International.
But the cancellation illustrated how the status of temporary workers, seeking job security at a time of uncertainty at the automaker, remains a challenge for GM Korea in a country where auto unions are known to be strong and militant.
About 15 minutes before the news conference was scheduled to begin at 10 am local time, temporary workers entered the venue holding signs and chanting slogans such as, ""Abolish non-regular positions"" and ""Let's fight until the end and return to the factory"".
Hwang Ho-in, head of the union of temporary workers at GM Korea's main factory compound in Bupyeong, said upon entering the venue that he and his colleagues would not interfere with the event and that they were present just to watch proceedings.
""Management thinks we are a terrorist group, a violent group or something like that,"" Hwang told reporters, after the event was canceled.
President of GM International Barry Engle and GM Korea Chief Executive Kaher Kazem did not make their planned appearances.
""We are placing top priority on the safety of our employees,"" said GM Korea spokesman Park Hae-ho.
Last month, full-time workers entered Kazem's office and destroyed furniture after the automaker said it was unable to make planned bonus payments because of a shortage of cash.
GM subsequently asked employees overseas to refrain from visiting its South Korean sites until further notice due to security concerns.
A South Korean court on Feb. 13 said GM Korea should recognize temporary workers as full-time employees, in a ruling the automaker has since appealed. On the same day, GM announced the planned closure of one of its four South Korean factories.

GM Korea has some 2,000 temporary workers. They fear more restructuring and job cuts even after the rescue deal as plants struggle with low utilization rates, Hwang said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Uncertainty around Commonwealth Bank of Australia's (AX:CBA) senior leadership deepened on Monday as the chief financial officer resigned unexpectedly, the fifth executive to depart in one of the worst governance crises in the bank's history.
Australia's biggest bank is struggling to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals revealed flaws in its leadership culture, exposing it to closer regulatory scrutiny, higher compliance costs and potential fines.
Chief Executive Matt Comyn, who replaced Ian Narev in April with a promise to fix the bank's problems, said he would need weeks to make headway in building his new team, raising concerns over upheaval in the leadership group. 
""We are making good progress with the renewal of the bank’s executive team and I expect to provide an update on appointments to my leadership team in the coming weeks,"" Comyn said in a statement to the bourse. 
Australia's banks are in damage-control mode as an ongoing independent inquiry into the financial sector exposes widespread misconduct, prompting calls for tighter regulation and stiffer penalties.
CBA is also facing potentially massive fines and higher capital requirements over breaches of anti-money laundering and terror financing laws, the result of ""complacency"" at the highest levels of management, according to a report released earlier this month by the banking watchdog.
In addition, CBA said last week it would settle with the Australian corporate regulator over allegations it manipulated the bank bill swap rate.
NEW CFO
Chief Financial Officer Rob Jesudason would depart ""with immediate effect"" to take an external role in Hong Kong, the bank said, just a over a year since he took up the role.
Alan Docherty, the previous CFO of the Institutional Banking and Markets unit, was appointed as acting CFO.
The change comes less than two months since the bank announced the departure of the three executives in charge of human resources, IT and institutional banking. 
Brian Johnson, a banking analyst at CLSA, said the departure of Jesudason surprised the market so soon after the executive shake-up in March. 
""While I'm positive on CBA, here's the problem: we now have got a CFO, head of retail and banking services, head of institutional banking, head of human resources, head of enterprise services and head of marketing and strategy - that is, 6 out of 12 executive positions where they are conducting a search at the moment,"" he said. 
In December, CBA appointed Vittoria Shortt head of ASB Bank, its New Zealand unit, leaving her former position as Group Executive, Marketing and Strategy vacant. 
CBA shares were 0.2 percent higher in afternoon trading, in line with the broader market.

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump pledged on Sunday to help ZTE Corp (HK:0763) ""get back into business, fast"" after a U.S. ban crippled the Chinese technology company, offering a job-saving concession to Beijing ahead of high-stakes trade talks this week.
Trump's unexpected announcement was a stunning reversal, given Washington's tough stance on Chinese trade practices that have put the world's two largest economies on course for a possible trade war.
Sources briefed on the matter said Beijing had demanded the ZTE issue be resolved as a prerequisite for broader trade negotiations.
""Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!"" Trump wrote on Twitter, saying he and Chinese President Xi Jinping were working together on a solution for ZTE.
The U.S. Commerce Department last month banned American companies from selling to the firm for seven years as punishment for ZTE breaking a 2017 agreement after it was caught illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran and North Korea, an investigation dating to the Obama administration.
The penalty cut off ZTE's access to key components such as semiconductors, prompting China's second-largest maker of telecommunications equipment to say last week that it had suspended its main operations. 
During trade talks in Beijing earlier this month, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He told U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that China would not continue talks on broader bilateral trade disputes unless Washington agreed to ease the crushing sanctions on ZTE, two people briefed on those meetings said.
""The message was, 'we have to deal with ZTE before we continue talks',"" one of the people said.
Both sources, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter, said China was willing in principle to import more U.S. agriculture products in return for Washington smoothing out penalties against ZTE, but they did not offer details.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regularly scheduled news briefing on Monday that China ""greatly appreciates the positive U.S. position on the ZTE issue"".
He said that Liu would travel to Washington from Tuesday to Saturday to continue trade talks.
LINKED TO THE TRADE DISPUTE 
Within the Commerce Department, and in U.S. business circles, the U.S. penalty against ZTE was widely seen as based on clear evidence of a company knowingly flouting U.S. regulations - separate from the highly politicized trade row, the sources said.
But Trump's reversal surprised and frustrated many U.S. officials, who had viewed the penalty on ZTE as final and not open to appeal, the sources said. 
""Everyone has been explicitly saying this is not part of the trade conflict. And now the President has overtly linked it to the trade dispute for better or worse, and that is not good if you're trying to maintain credibility,"" the second source told Reuters.
ZTE, whose shares remain suspended, did not have immediate comment. 
The U.S. Commerce Department and China's Ministry of Commerce did not have immediate comment.
White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters confirmed that U.S. officials were in contact with Beijing about ZTE. She said Trump's tweet underscored the importance of ""free, fair, balanced and mutually beneficial"" relations between the United States and China on issues involving the economy, trade and investment.
Trump expects Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross ""to exercise his independent judgment, consistent with applicable laws and regulations, to resolve the regulatory action involving ZTE based on its facts,"" Walters said.
Washington and Beijing have proposed tens of billions of dollars in tariffs in recent weeks, fanning worries of a full-blown trade war that could hurt global supply chains and dent business investment plans. 
In a second tweet on Sunday, Trump said past U.S. trade talks with China posed a hurdle that he predicted the two countries would overcome. 
""China and the United States are working well together on trade, but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China, for so many years, that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
""But be cool, it will all work out!"" he added.
Shortly after Trump's tweet, a Democratic lawmaker, Representative Adam Schiff, on Twitter questioned the move to help the Chinese company, given numerous warnings about ZTE's alleged threat to U.S. national security.
""Our intelligence agencies have warned that ZTE technology and phones pose a major cyber security threat,"" Schiff said. ""You should care more about our national security than Chinese jobs.""
SHOCKING BLOW
It was not clear China would accept Trump's assertion that Beijing needs to work toward a mutually beneficial outcome.
""The U.S. should be aware that it must become more cooperative and constructive in the trade talks with China,"" the China Daily, China's official English-language newspaper, said in a Monday editorial. The editorial did not mention ZTE.
Trump's comments on ZTE could have a significant impact on shares of American optical components makers such as Acacia Communications Inc and Oclaro Inc, which fell when U.S. companies were banned from exporting goods to ZTE. 
ZTE paid over $2.3 billion to 211 U.S. exporters in 2017, a senior ZTE official said on Friday.
The U.S. government launched an investigation into ZTE after Reuters reported in 2012 the company had signed contracts to ship hardware and software worth millions of dollars to Iran from some of the best-known U.S. technology companies. (Reuters report that exposed the practice: https://reut.rs/2GbpCmO)
ZTE relies on U.S. companies such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc,  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google. American companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of components in ZTE's equipment, which includes smartphones and gear to build telecommunications networks. 
Claire Reade, a Washington-based trade lawyer and former assistant U.S. Trade Representative for China affairs, said the ZTE ban may have caused more alarm in Beijing than Trump's threats to impose tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods. 

""Imagine how the United States would feel if China had the power to crush one of our major corporations and make it go out of business,"" Reade said.

126,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2018 03:55AM ET</span>","Japan Airlines to set up low-cost carrier, targeting Asian demand","By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) -  Japan Airlines Co Ltd  (JAL) (T:9201) is launching a low-cost carrier offering medium to long-haul flights, aiming to tap growing Asian demand for budget air travel.
The new airline will be based at Narita International Airport and will offer flights to Asia, Europe and the Americas, JAL said in a statement on Monday. 
The as-yet unnamed airline plans to start flying in the summer of 2020 with two wide-body Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787-8 aircraft. 
JAL will invest 10 billion yen to 20 billion yen ($91.44 million to $182.88 million) in the business, with the aim of reaching profitability within three years from the launch, the company said.
Budget flights have been slow to take off in Japan, which is dominated by full-service carriers JAL and ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202) and has a sophisticated high-speed rail network, but with growing numbers of Asia travelers taking to the air the two Japanese airlines are looking to expand their low-cost offerings.
""Full-service airlines typically have high costs, but in Japan this is especially so,"" said Will Horton, senior analyst at research consultancy CAPA Center for Aviation. ""Japan needs new platforms to capture foreign visitors. They are not like the Japanese who are sticky in wanting to fly a costly Japanese full-service airline.""
ANA has said it will launch medium-length international flights, potentially flying as far afield as India, as it integrates its low-cost carrier units under the Peach brand name.
JAL, by contrast, holds only a minority stake in Jetstar Japan, a joint venture with Qantas Airways Ltd's (AX:QAN) low-cost brand Jetstar which flies narrow-body aircraft. JAL said it would continue to invest in Jetstar Japan. 
The new long-distance carrier is a totally different proposition from Jetstar Japan, which ""is purely short-distance"", JAL's new President Yuji Akasaka told reporters. Jetstar Japan has given its approval for the move, the president said.
Jetstar Japan said in a statement that the new airline would be complementary because it would bring more international visitors to Japan who would then travel on its domestic network.
""We are in discussions with JAL about opportunities for Jetstar Japan and the new low-cost carrier to work closely together,"" Jetstar Japan said.
JAL said it plans to have outside investors in its new low-cost carrier which will be a consolidated subsidiary. 
Other players are also looking to take advantage of Japan's growing status as a tourist destination, with AirAsia Japan having relaunched and airlines such as Hong Kong Express and Singapore's Scoot adding flights to Japan.

127,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2018 10:30PM ET</span>",Malaysia's Markets Show No Post-Election Panic,"(Bloomberg) -- Malaysia’s markets showed few signs of investor panic as trading reopened after Mahathir Mohamad swept to power in a surprise election outcome.
Stocks in Kuala Lumpur recovered from an early slump to fluctuate between gains and losses. While the ringgit weakened, its move was smaller than what was implied from forwards in the aftermath of last week’s result. Bonds fell.
“We have turned mildly positive over the short term,” said Danny Wong, chief executive officer at Areca Capital Sdn. “Most of the local funds have turned slightly positive with more clarity from Mahathir,"" he said, citing the appointment of key ministers and the formation of a council of five elders. “Confidence is returning.”
Mahathir has sought to reassure the markets by appointing a finance minister seen as a safe pair of hands, while saying he would lead a business-friendly administration. CIMB Group Chairman Nazir Razak, brother of ousted prime minister Najib Razak, expressed optimism last week that financial markets can weather the political transition. Still, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings have warned of risks to the budget if a consumption tax is abolished and not offset by other revenue-raising measures.
Here’s a recap on market moves:
On Saturday, the central bank reaffirmed the strength of the economy and said it’ll continue to ensure orderly conditions prevail in onshore financial markets. The ringgit will reflect Malaysia’s fundamentals over the longer term, with the economy backed by a current-account surplus, healthy reserves and low external debt, Governor Muhammad Ibrahim said.
“The appointment of Lim Guan Eng as the minister of finance, as well as the formation of the Council of Elders comprising eminent Malaysians to provide advice to the new government was well received in Malaysia,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. “While there will be near-term uncertainty over the fiscal impact of the new government’s policies, especially abolishing GST and reintroducing targeted fuel subsidies, higher oil prices will provide a boost to government revenues.”
Affin Hwang Asset Management Bhd. said before markets reopened that it was expecting a decline of as much as 8 percent in the first few days of trading post-election, while CGS-CIMB Securities lowered its end-2018 target for the benchmark index.
The Pakatan Harapan coalition had campaigned on a promise to scrap a consumption tax within its first 100 days in power, reintroduce gasoline subsidies and review toll road concessions. In a Thursday press conference, Mahathir emphasized his focus on expanding the economy and reducing debt.
Malaysian stocks had risen to a record close in April as global funds invested more than $600 million into local equities this year. The ringgit has benefited from a recovery in crude prices and was the Asia’s best performer over the past year before trading was suspended for the election.

China's ABS market has exploded over the past few years as the government's crackdown on shadow banking pushed borrowers to alternative sources of finance. Issuance of ABS jumped to 1.5 trillion yuan ($236.84 billion) last year, from almost zero in 2013, according to consultancy China Securities Analytics.
The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges said at the weekend that regulators supported the development of the market, but also scrutinized its potential risks.
The exchanges stipulate ""timely and effective disclosure"" on ABS products, on which better-informed investment decisions can be made.
The exchanges also published rules to mitigate default risks, requiring ABS issuers to submit risk-management reports to the stock exchanges every six months.
ABS have been a preferred alternative source of finance for companies struggling to cope with China's official deleveraging campaign, which has made conventional debt finance harder to get.
Securitization allows the cash flow from a wide range of assets such as loans, real estate, toll ways and scenic parks to be used as collateral for bond-like securities that are sold to investors.

129,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2018 10:01PM ET</span>",AirAsia shares fall after chief apologizes for backing Malaysia's Najib,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Shares in AirAsia Group Bhd (KL:AIRA) fell as much as 10 percent on Monday in the first trading session since Malaysia's election and after its chief Tony Fernandes apologized for endorsing former prime minister Najib Razak in the election.
Najib was ousted by former leader Mahathir Mohamad in a shock election result last week. Najib's Barisan Nasional coalition, which had governed Malaysia since independence in 1957, was booted out of power for the first time.
AirAsia has several airlines in various Asian countries but Malaysia, its home market, is its largest contributor to earnings. In a highly regulated industry where its main rival is state-owned Malaysia Airlines, it relies on government approvals to support its growth plans.
Two days before Wednesday's poll, Fernandes released a video praising Najib and the government's support of the low-cost airline he co-founded. Later that day, Najib posted photos of him and Fernandes standing in front of an AirAsia plane painted with a campaign slogan for Najib's coalition.
""I am sorry for what has gone on. I buckled at the crucial moment in our history,"" Fernandes said in a video released on Sunday. ""It wasn't right and I will forever regret it.""
AirAsia shares fell as much as 10 percent on Monday but later recovered slightly, compared with a 0.9 percent fall in the broader Malaysian index (KLSE).
Fernandes said the video and campaign-themed livery was an effort to appease Najib's government after he came under ""intense"" pressure in the lead-up to elections for adding extra flights on polling day and refusing to fire a subsidiary's chairman who had expressed support for Mahathir.
AirAsia had announced extra flights and reduced fares to help voters return home to cast ballots.
Fernandes refused to fire Rafidah Aziz, a former minister who was campaigning for Mahathir's coalition, as the chairman of AirAsia X (KL:AIRX), the long-haul arm of AirAsia.
""As Rafidah's impact and popularity grew, the pressure grew exponentially. It was getting harder and harder to resist the pressure from the prime minister's office,"" he said.
Najib's aides could not be reached for comment.
AirAsia's decision to add more flights on election day added to the pressure from Najib's government, Fernandes said.
The government's challengers criticized the decision to hold the election on a Wednesday, charging that it was an effort to dampen voter turnout and make it harder for Malaysians living away from home, many of whom support the opposition, to vote.
""Within 24 hours, we were summoned by the (regulator) Malaysian Aviation Commission and told to cancel all those flights. That put us again under tremendous pressure,"" Fernandes said, adding that his airline had added 120 flights.

The Malaysian Aviation Commission said in a statement on its website that it considered Fernandes' claims to be ""serious allegations"" and it had launched an immediate investigation.

On Wall Street, U.S. stocks closed slightly higher Friday and recorded their best week in two months amid growing optimism that inflation would remain contained.
The S&P 500 edged up 0.2%, the Dow added 0.4%, while the Nasdaq was barely changed.
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.4 and 0.6% respectively by 9:35PM ET (01:35 GMT). Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp (HK:0763) took center stage in Asia on Monday, as Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that he is working with Chinese President Xi to give ZTE “a way to get back into business, fast.”
“Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done,” Said Trump.
The tweet came weeks after the decision to cut off the Chinese firm from its U.S. suppliers and accused the company of violating export restrictions by illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran. ZTE suspended its main operations earlier in the month, while trading in the company’s shares has been halted since the ban.
""This suggests that Trump might see the chance for real progress on trade talks, and is softening the U.S. position on an issue important to China,"" JPMorgan said in a note.
""Trump also needs China to remain on side ahead of his meeting with North Korea's Kim and this also suggests that until the 12 June meeting the signaling from the U.S. on trade will be more positive.""
Separately, U.S. officials are set to have talks in Washington with China's top trade official Liu He to resolve an intensifying trade dispute between the two nations, according to reports.
South Korea’s KOSPI slipped 0.1%. The U.S. is ready to allow investments in North Korea once it has more confirmable evidence of its denuclearization, according to reports who cited two U.S. top national security officials.
The remarks came ahead of a summit between Trump and Kim in Singapore on June 12.
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 climbed 0.2%, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 also added 0.3%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prospects of a thaw in U.S.-China trade tensions supported global stocks on Monday, as U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to help ZTE Corp ""get back into business, fast"" after a U.S. ban crippled the Chinese technology company, while oil prices recovered some lost ground.
Trump's comments on Sunday came ahead of a second round of trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials this week to resolve an escalating trade dispute. China had said last week its stance in the negotiations would not change.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent, holding at its highest level in seven weeks and in positive territory for the year.
European stocks (STOXX) dipped 0.3 percent as financials weighed, while EMini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) rose 0.2 percent.
""There have been some very serious issues raised in terms of the trade relationship between the U.S. and China, and then they've had this quite sudden about-turn on this particular company, and it simply raises questions as to what the underlying policy is,"" said Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research. 
""This is perhaps a little reminder which is being relatively well-received by markets over the last 24 hours that (with) the U.S. administration there is a strong degree of unpredictability compared to prior regimes,"" George added.
The United States has said it will lift sanctions on Pyongyang if North Korea agrees to completely dismantle its nuclear weapons program. 
Stocks in Asia were also upbeat. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.5 percent, while Japan's Nikkei (N225) also tacked on 0.5 percent.
Chinese shares came off the day's highs but still ended in positive territory after Trump's comments on ZTE Corp (SZ:000063), (HK:0763), which JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said was ""a significant positive"".
Shanghai's SSE (LON:SSE) Composite index (SSEC) rose 0.3 percent while the blue-chip (CSI300) rallied 0.9 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (HSE) climbed 1.4 percent. 
Elsewhere in Asia, the Malaysian ringgit  recovered losses after sliding 1 percent to a four-month trough against the dollar in the first onshore trade since a shock election upset last week. Malaysian stocks sank as much as 2.7 percent at one point but ended 0.2 percent higher.
Veteran Mahathir Mohamad, 92, came out of political retirement to lead the opposition Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) to a stunning victory, defeating prime minister Najib Razak, a former protege whom he had accused of corruption.
Some investors were concerned that populist promises such as repealing an unpopular goods and services tax and restoring a petrol subsidy could undermine the country's finances.
But some analysts believe Mahathir's proposals could be positive for the economy.
""The repeal of GST, while only marginally negative for the fiscal deficit, will be a boon for consumers, who have been upset that they bear the burden of poor fiscal management and came out to vote against the establishment,"" said Trinh Nguyen, senior economist at Natixis.
OIL AND IRAN
While tensions in the Korean peninsula have eased, U.S. plans to reintroduce sanctions against Iran have stoked anxiety in the Middle East.
Iran pumps about 4 percent of the world's oil, and the latest development has sent oil prices to near multi-year highs.
Citi analyst Mark Schofield said rising oil prices risk causing 'stagflation', which could create a particularly ""hostile environment"" for risk assets.
On Monday, U.S. crude (CLc1) traded flat at $70.71 a barrel and Brent (LCOc1) was up at $77.23, clawing back previous losses after a relentless rise in U.S. drilling activity pointed to increased output. [O/R]
The United States threatened on Sunday to impose sanctions on European companies that do business with Iran, as the remaining participants in the Iran nuclear accord stiffened their resolve to keep that agreement operational.
In currencies, the dollar (DXY) dipped 0.2 percent to 92.33 against a basket of major currencies and was set for its fourth straight day of losses.
Against the Japanese yen , it ticked down to 109.49 per dollar, remaining largely in a holding pattern since late last month.
The euro (EUR=) rose 0.3 percent to $1.1983 following two consecutive sessions of gains as Italy's anti-establishment parties looked likely to form the next government.
Last week, the Bank of England held rates steady and New Zealand's central bank said the official cash rate will remain at historic lows of 1.75 percent for ""some time"".
That leaves the Fed as the only major central bank in the world committed to rate increases, although recent data showing a moderate inflation reading has cast doubt over the pace of any hikes.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) was slightly higher at 2.9841 percent.
Spot gold  dipped 0.1 percent at $1,319.4 an ounce, after eking out a small weekly gain last week.

132,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2018 07:30PM ET</span>",Kim Could Make North Korea Samsung's New Backyard,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It wouldn’t be hard for North Korea to become the next Vietnam, if only Kim Jong Un loosened up a bit.
North Korea today looks remarkably similar to the Southeast Asian nation in 1986, when its Communist neighbor undertook “Doi Moi” reforms to tiptoe toward capitalism. North Korea may have a head start, because it’s richer and more industrialized.
Vietnam is now a huge manufacturing hub, boasting an economy that’s six times larger than North Korea’s. Last year, it expanded 6.8 percent, the fastest pace in a decade, thanks in no small part to South Korean firms. Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. is Vietnam’s biggest foreign investor, accounting for around one quarter of its total export revenue. North Korea’s economy, by comparison, seems frozen in time.
South Korean companies would probably happily relocate, though. The wages they’d have to pay workers are significantly lower, based on salary data from North Korea’s Kaesong Industrial Complex, which was shut by the Park Geun-hye administration in 2016.
Crimped by sanctions, Kim is playing the diplomat, pledging an end to the Korean War and agreeing to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, marking, in Trump’s words, a “very special moment for world peace.”
It could certainly be a defining moment for North Korea. Investment accounts for about 26 percent of Vietnam’s GDP. If Pyongyang could raise offshore inflows, which are practically zero, to even 20 percent of GDP, then its economy could grow at 5 percent, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimates.
Investments from South Korea alone could fill that quota. At 20 percent of North Korea’s $31 billion of GDP in 2016 (the latest figures available), that’s about $6 billion. Samsung has plowed more than $17 billion into Vietnam over the years.
Vietnam still paints a prettier picture when it comes to demographics. Around 70 percent of the population is of working age, versus only 44 percent in North Korea. And North Korea’s working age population is expected to peak by 2020, compared with 2040 in Vietnam.
Combining the populations of the two Koreas would come to around 80 million. That’s big enough on its own to make the peninsula a self-sufficient production and consumption powerhouse.
Sell-side analysts often say that the reduced possibility of a war on the Korean peninsula could close the notorious Kospi discount. The risk premium attributed to South Korean assets is fading. Foreigners have purchased more than $17 billion of the nation’s bonds since January, betting an easing of tensions will usher in a less volatile won. Credit-default swaps insuring government debt against a default are near a five-year low.
But South Korean firms are still 30 percent cheaper than their peers in the region, even though chaebol have pulled up their corporate governance socks and improved their return on equity.
One can’t blame investors for being wary – Kim isn’t exactly a stabilizing influence. But, if he’s true to his word, fund managers could have a lot of catching up to do.

133,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Chinese insurers turn shadow lenders for higher returns,"By Shu Zhang and Engen Tham
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese insurers are channeling funds through shadow lenders to real estate and local government infrastructure projects in a bid to boost returns, six insurance and trust sources told Reuters.
The practice undermines Beijing's efforts to cut local debt risk and curb a property bubble, highlighting the difficulties regulators face in reining in shadow lending and applying regulations uniformly across China's $15 trillion asset management sector - a key task for the country's newly merged banking and insurance regulators.
The amount insurers have allocated to alternative assets - trusts, asset management plans and bank wealth management products - has surged rapidly since authorities relaxed investment rules in 2012.
Analysts warn that the complex and opaque structure of such products makes it difficult for insurers to see the ultimate borrowers and to then gauge their real exposure - a risk magnified by the long investment periods involved.
China's banking and insurance regulator did not respond to a request for comment.
""Our first concern is insurers don't fully understand the risks involved in what they are investing in because those products are not transparent,"" said Qian Zhu, a senior credit officer focusing on insurance at Moody's. ""Those products are also causing liquidity problems for insurers.""
Insurers are allowed to allocate up to 55 percent of total invested assets in alternative investments. Those investments accounted for 40 percent of invested assets in 2017, but the number has risen sharply in recent years. In 2012, the proportion was 9 percent.
Of the 40 percent recorded in 2017, the largest proportion was in debt investments, where the funds mostly end up as loans to infrastructure and real estate projects, Reuters analysis of insurance asset management product data shows.
In the three years to the end of 2017, insurers' investment in loans for infrastructure nearly tripled and nearly doubled for real estate. 
LONG LIFE, HIGHER RETURNS
Higher yields are the main attraction for insurers. Trust products posted average returns of 9.42 percent as of the end of 2017, while those on top-rated Chinese corporate bonds were around 5 percent, market data show.
""Companies have to fight for high-quality non-standard investment projects,"" Zhu of Moody's said of insurers. For less established ones, ""it's mostly about chasing yield.""
Insurers' interest is showing few signs of abating even as Beijing acts to cool an overheated real estate market in major cities and to reduce system-wide local government leverage, insurers and trust sources told Reuters.
In fact, insurers are finding they can demand higher rates for their loans because of the government crackdown as banks - traditional financiers for trust and asset management schemes - are placed under close regulatory scrutiny and have to dial back, sources said.
The products also have a long maturity - often between five and 10 years - which helps insurers match the duration of their assets to their long-term liabilities, sources and analysts said. Insurers typically have liabilities extending 15 years or more.
China Life, the country's largest life insurer, more than doubled its debt investment products, including trust and asset management plans, to 301.8 billion yuan ($47.45 billion) last year from 2016, leading to a sharp rise in overall investment yield to 4.55 percent from 2.43 percent, its annual results show.
China Life's new investments last year included a 7 billion yuan trust plan funding the development of Guangzhou's development zone, a 8 billion yuan trust plan funding Tianjin's Binhai new economic development zone, and a 10 billion yuan trust plan funding state-owned Aluminium Corp, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
China Life did not respond to a request seeking comment.
Ping An Insurance Group Co, the country's largest insurer by market value, is leaning toward working more closely with trust firms as a general policy direction, said a senior employee in its compliance department.
The insurer's investment in debt, trust plans and bank wealth management products reached 335.9 billion yuan in 2017, accounting for 14 percent of total investment, according to a Reuters calculation based on its annual report.
Ping An said in an email to Reuters that its insurance investment decisions were made based on market value and asset-liability matching.
Michelle Hu, partner at Boston Consulting Group, said that in places without mature and sophisticated fixed income markets, insurance companies facing earnings pressure ""pretty much don't have much other choice"".

The company confirmed the move earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal, which said Schwall joined Waymo's safety team led by former National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Deputy Administrator Ron Medford.
The former Tesla executive began at Waymo last Monday and will work on a variety of self-driving car safety issues in his new role, the Journal reported.
Schwall, who was director of field performance engineering at Tesla, exited the company at a time when the National Transportation Safety Board has been investigating multiple crashes involving the electric vehicles.
On Wednesday, the NTSB said it would investigate a Tesla accident in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, that killed two teenagers and injured another - the agency's fourth active probe into crashes of the company's electric vehicles.

Tesla did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Sunday.

The agreement, approved by the boards of both banks, will create an entity with $16 billion in assets and about 100 branches in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas, the banks said in a press release.
Investors expect a wave of mergers among mid-sized banks as U.S. lawmakers work to rewrite banking rules enacted after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. These changes would likely raise the limit on what is considered a systemically important financial institution, which had hampered some banks from merging.
Lawmakers also are tinkering with older bank rules, emboldened by President Donald Trump's vow to loosen banking restrictions. 
State Bank shareholders will receive 1.160 shares of Cadence class A common stock for each State Bank share, Cadence said in a statement. Cadence shares closed at $30.23 on Friday, while State Bank shares closed at $33.08.

Cadence and State Bank shareholders will collectively own about 65 percent and 35 percent of the combined company, respectively, after the deal is closed.

The Austrian carrier's flights would have connected Zurich's business capital with holiday destinations including Majorca, Ibiza, and the Canary Islands as well as in Greece, she said from Vienna. ""All customers ... will (be) ...informed about the cancellations and refunds,"" Laudamotion said in a statement. ""We regret the cancellations from Zurich and apologize to our customers for the inconvenience."" The Laudamotion spokeswoman said a third-party leasing company had failed to guarantee the Airbus jets needed to service the routes, as had been previously agreed. 
Other Laudamotion departures including from Basel, Switzerland, and from Germany and Austria are not impacted.
In March, as part of its expansion into German-speaking markets, Ryanair agreed to take an 24.9 percent stake in the Austrian carrier, founded by former Formula 1 champion Niki Lauda.
The Irish airline planned to raise that to 75 percent as soon as possible, subject to regulatory approval.
Ryanair declined to comment on Zurich cancellations.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's new government is girding for a volatile start to trading on Monday when local currency, debt and equity markets open for the first time since the stunning election defeat of the coalition that had ruled the country for six decades.
""We will watch the market and take necessary action whichever way the market goes,"" Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Saturday, after offshore investors expressed concern that his populist promises could undermine economic prospects.
Mahathir's alliance had pledged during the campaign to remove a goods and services tax, scrap toll fees, reinstate fuel subsidies and review Chinese investment deals.
The ringgit lost four percent in offshore trading, while an overseas Malaysian equity fund showed a 6 percent drop in share values after the results were announced early on Thursday.
The currency ""may need to play catch up"" on Monday, and fall in line with a four percent drop in three month non-deliverable forwards <MYR3MNDFOR=>, while government bonds are likely to be under selling pressure, Frances Cheung Head of Macro Strategy, Asia at Westpac bank said by e-mail.
Mahathir named Lim Guan Eng, a relative unknown, as finance minister over the weekend, but also appointed billionaire tycoon Robert Kuok and highly-regarded former central bank governor Zeti Akhthar Aziz as advisers on financial matters to allay investor worries.
Local economic analysts said Lim had built a good reputation as chief minister of Penang state and would be welcomed by Malaysian investors.
But tensions within the ruling alliance over cabinet picks that emerged at the weekend would weigh on sentiment, analysts said. Mahathir and his jailed ally, Anwar Ibrahim, both stepped in to ease the tensions on Sunday.
""This is a coalition of four different parties with different agendas. The easy part was being in opposition - now they have to form government, and that's creating uncertainty,"" Trinh Nguyen, senior economist at Natixis, told Reuters by phone from Hong Kong.
""This will have an impact on prices and they will have to correct to reflect this higher level of uncertainty...I think the markets have been wrong-footed,"" she said, though adding, that the economy, especially with oil prices rising, was well placed to absorb the shock.
Analysts also pointed to the possibility of reshuffles at the top of government-linked corporations and, if sentiment sours at the bourse, ratings agency Moody's sees the banking sector hardest hit.
""We will see increasing risks of capital outflows and a further weakening of the ringgit. That could in turn dampen private sector consumption and operating conditions for banks in Malaysia,"" said Moody's senior banks analyst Simon Chen.
The local share market (KLSE) is Asia's top performer so far this year after Vietnam, with more than 7 percent gains in dollar terms. Its open at 9 a.m. local time (0100 GMT) on Monday, provides some time for investors to absorb the surprise election results, analysts said.
""There will be some uncertainty in the near term but at least higher oil prices will provide additional revenue for the new administration,"" Khoon Goh, Head of Asia Research at ANZ Bank in Singapore told Reuters by e-mail.

Ratcliffe maintains a relatively low profile in Britain as the chief executive of the country's largest private company which generates sales of around $60 billion by manufacturing petrochemicals, speciality chemicals and oil products.
The Sunday Times said Ratcliffe had shot up the list of Britain's most wealthy due to the success of Ineos and after it got access to more detail on the company which is 60 percent owned by its founder.
Compiling the list for the 30th time, the Sunday Times said the wealth of the 1,000 richest people had jumped by 10 percent this year, and said that they were more diverse than before, with more women and entrepreneurs in the list. 
""Britain is changing,"" said Robert Watts, the compiler of the list. ""Gone are the days when old money and a small band of industries dominated the Sunday Times Rich List.
""Aristocrats and inherited wealth has been elbowed out of the list and replaced by an army of self-made entrepreneurs.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) can keep fees from the state of Ohio despite a donation one of its top executives made to Governor John Kasich's U.S. presidential campaign, according to a preliminary ruling late on Friday by a securities regulator.
Mark Wiedman, a senior managing director for the world's largest asset manager, donated $2,700 to Kasich's unsuccessful campaign when the politician was seeking the Republican Party nomination in 2016, according to public records. The money was later returned.
A federal securities rule prohibits companies' executive officers from making donations to government officials who could influence the hiring of a fund manager and then providing asset management services to those governments for a fee. The ban is in effect for two years after the contribution is made. 
Ohio uses BlackRock-managed funds, and its relationship with the asset manager predated the donation, BlackRock said when it asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to let it accept fees from the state, noting that exceptions to the rule have been granted before.
The SEC's ruling prevents BlackRock from facing a loss of approximately $37 million, according to the New York-based company's filing.
Wiedman is global head of iShares and index investments, a booming business within BlackRock that includes its exchange-traded funds. The iShares brand brought in nearly $35 billion of new cash into BlackRock in the first quarter. BlackRock manages $6.3 trillion overall.
BlackRock declined to comment. Last year they said in a statement that Wiedman made the contribution solely in support of the campaign, and that both BlackRock and Wiedman promptly worked to address the error after the company discovered the contribution.
The company also said Wiedman asked for and received a refund of his campaign contribution to Kasich and that its application to be exempted from the rule was ""fair and reasonable.""

A spokesman for the SEC was not immediately available.

The $1.5 billion savings targeted within three years are a ""pro forma"" synergy goal, which excluded the impact of divestments, Johannes Dietsch told the newspaper. 
""The basis for revenue synergies is now lower. We will give an update on the topic of synergies,"" Dietsch told the paper.
Last month Bayer (DE:BAYGN) said it had agreed to sell crop science businesses to German rival BASF to help win regulatory approval for the takeover of Monsanto.
Dietsch also said Bayer still plans to go ahead with a capital increase, declining to speculate about the size. The capital hike will happen around the time of the closing of the Monsanto deal, and will not come before May 25, he told Boersen-Zeitung.
Bayer will be preoccupied with reducing its debt levels in the immediate aftermath of a successful Monsanto acquisition, Dietsch told the paper. 
When asked whether Bayer faces a ""patent cliff"" in its pharmaceuticals business once licenses for blockbuster drugs Xarelto and Eylea expire, Dietsch said, ""The question is how do you strengthen the pharma pipeline. Do you need a large acquisition or are there other opportunities like cooperations, partnerships licensing deals and perhaps smaller acquisitions?""

""Nobody should expect that when two of our successful products become generic, that we can just replace them in the year after. In the medium term Pharma will be a growing business,"" the paper quoted him as saying.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) said on Saturday in a filing with a U.S. regulator that it may take India's Flipkart public in as early as four years, detailing for the first time a potential listing timeline for Walmart's largest-ever acquisition.
Minority investors holding 60 percent of Flipkart's shares ""acting together, may require Flipkart to effect an initial public offering"" (IPO) four years after the close of the Walmart-Flipkart transaction, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said in a May 11 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The IPO should be done at no less a valuation than that at which Walmart invested in the Indian e-commerce firm, the filing said. Walmart announced earlier this week that it will pay $16 billion for a roughly 77 percent stake in Flipkart in what is the U.S. retail giant's largest-ever deal and a move to take on arch rival Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) in a key growth market. The investment implies a valuation of nearly $21 billion for Bengaluru-headquartered Flipkart.
Minority shareholders after the deal include co-founder Binny Bansal, China's Tencent Holdings (HK:0700), U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global Management and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT).
The deal now awaits clearance from India's anti-trust regulator and is expected to close later this year.
As part of the deal, Walmart will initially appoint five directors to Flipkart's board, two directors will be named by minority shareholders while Bansal will take one board seat, according to the filing.
Walmart said it may, in future, appoint a sixth board member with the approval of the majority of the Flipkart directors.
It also said it could appoint or replace Flipkart's chief executive and other key executives of group companies in consultation with Bansal and the board.
Walmart or its units could ask Flipkart to issue new ordinary shares of up to $3 billion before the close of the ""transactions and on or before the first anniversary of the closing"", it said.
Reuters previously reported that Google-parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) was in talks to invest about $3 billion for a roughly 15 percent stake in Flipkart.
That deal could be sealed before the close of the Walmart-Flipkart transaction or immediately after, a source told Reuters, declining to be named as the talks are private.
Walmart also said no party would be liable to pay a termination fee if a share issuance or purchase agreement with Flipkart were terminated.
The Economic Times newspaper reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources, that Japan's SoftBank Group, which owns a roughly 20 percent stake in Flipkart, was rethinking its exit due to tax liabilities and because it saw further value in Flipkart.
SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has said that their investment in Flipkart had grown to almost $4 billion. That growth came just 9 months after SoftBank used its Vision Fund to invest about $2.5 billion in Flipkart.
A spokeswoman for SoftBank in India declined comment.
Former Amazon employees Sachin and Binny Bansal founded Flipkart in 2007 and, just like Amazon, began by selling books.

149,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 10:22PM ET</span>","China's ZTE paid over $2.3 billion to U.S. exporters last year, ZTE source says","(Reuters) - Chinese technology company ZTE Corp <0000063.SZ> (HK:0763), which this month suspended its main operations after a U.S. Commerce Department ban on American supplies to its business, paid over $2.3 billion to 211 U.S. exporters in 2017, a senior ZTE official said on Friday.
ZTE paid over $100 million each to  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM), Broadcom Inc (O:AVGO),  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and Texas Instruments (O:TXN), the official said.
As one of the world's largest telecom equipment makers, ZTE relied on U.S. companies such as Qualcomm and Intel for components.
The extent of the impact of the Commerce Department ban on U.S. suppliers was noted by the ZTE official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, as Chinese and U.S. government officials discuss a Washington visit next week by China's top economic official.
In March last year ZTE paid nearly $900 million in penalties for exporting U.S. technology to Iran and North Korea in violation of sanctions. 
In April this year, the Commerce Department found ZTE had violated the terms of last year's settlement and banned U.S. companies from providing exports to ZTE for seven years. As a result, ZTE suspended its main operating activities earlier this month. 
The Commerce Department ban on U.S. suppliers exporting goods to the Chinese network equipment and handset maker was discussed when a delegation led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met with Chinese officials in Beijing last week.
China requested that President Donald Trump back off his threat of tariffs on Chinese imports, treat Chinese investments equally under U.S. security reviews, and reassess the ban on ZTE. 
A May 1 formal request by ZTE to the U.S. Commerce Department for an immediate stay of the April 15 ban went unheeded, according to a person familiar with the matter. The order was causing ""irreparable harm"" to the company and partners, as well as millions of consumers, including those who own its phones and major network operators, the person said.
American companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of the components used in ZTE's equipment, which includes smartphones and gear to build telecommunications networks, analysts noted. 
The U.S. ban prevents ZTE from using some Qualcomm processors and Android devices with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Mobile Services software, according to analysts.
ZTE paid over $100 million each to other U.S. suppliers in 2017 including chip makers  Xilinx Inc  (O:XLNX) and optical component company Acacia Communications (O:ACIA) and memory chip maker Sandisk, the ZTE official said.
Intel, Broadcom and Qualcomm declined to comment.
Qualcomm last month said it expected lost sales to ZTE to lower its earnings by 3 cents per share in the current quarter. 
ZTE is not among Qualcomm's publicly disclosed largest customers, which include Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) and Chinese smartphone makers Oppo and Vivo.
None of the other companies could immediately be reached for comment.
The ban also hurts ZTE's ability to provide services, such as repairs to infrastructure, to customers in other countries and regions in which it operates. ZTE provides services for 100 million users in India, 300 million users in Indonesia, and 29 million users in Italy, the official said.
ZTE's failure to comply with the 2017 Commerce Department settlement included not reprimanding or cutting bonuses to 35 employees tied to the wrongdoing, and making false statements, the Commerce Department previously found. 
ZTE self-reported the discipline issue and corrected the mistakes, the ZTE official said, adding that the failure was not part of the same misconduct that led to last year's guilty plea. 
The official said the recent ban was a grossly disproportionate penalty that ignored the strides ZTE had made towards complying with U.S. laws.
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is expected to resume trade talks with the Trump administration this week, after discussions in Beijing last week yielded no agreement on a long list of U.S. trade demands.

LISBON (Reuters) - China's state-owned utility China Three Gorges on Friday launched a bid to take control of Portugal's biggest company EDP, offering a premium of just below 5 percent on the power firm's closing stock price. 
The total value of the proposed deal is 9.07 billion euros ($10.83 billion), excluding a 23 percent stake already owned by CTG [CYTGP.UL], the Chinese firm and largest EDP (LS:EDP) shareholder said in a statement issued late on Friday in Lisbon.
Reports that EDP may be an acquisition target of European foreign companies have been circulating for over a year, during which CTG continued to raise its stake, culminating in the 3.26 euros ($3.89) a share offer.
CTG said in its preliminary offer announcement that it seeks to reach at least a 50 percent voting stake plus one share in the company. It also offered 7.33 euros a share for EDP's wind power unit,  EDP Renovaveis  (LS:EDPR), below its closing price of 7.84 euros. 
EDP had no immediate comment. The online edition of the Expresso newspaper said earlier that EDP was likely to consider the offer hostile.
If the deal succeeds, it would be the latest in a series of acquisitions by Chinese companies in Portugal. They have been actively buying assets, from infrastructure to insurance and banking, since Portugal's 2010-13 debt crisis.
EDP is an integrated generator, supplier and distributor of electricity, the largest company by assets in Portugal with businesses in Brazil (SA:ENBR3), Spain, and the United States.
CTG said it was ""fully committed to preserving EDP's Portuguese identity and autonomy as well as its current Portuguese public listing"".
Prime Minister Antonio Costa told reporters earlier that the Portuguese government had no objections to the bid.
""The government has nothing against it, no reservations,"" Costa said, adding though that the government does not have to be consulted. ""The Chinese have been good investors, be it in REN, EDP or in other sectors ... The important thing is that shareholders can ponder on the project. Let the market work.""
The proposed offer may test the European Union's readiness to give control of major infrastructure firms in member states to China, however. It could also run into problems with U.S. authorities since EDP Renovaveis (EDP Renewables) is a major player in its wind energy market.
Another Chinese state company, CNIC, holds a nearly 5 percent stake in EDP, while other leading shareholders include U.S. financial services company Capital Group, with 12 percent, and U.S. private equity firm Blackrock (NYSE:BLK).
EDP's market capitalization was nearly 11.4 billion euros as of Friday. It has a net debt of 13.8 billion euros.

The company serves almost 10 million power market clients and 1.6 million natural gas customers and runs over 330,000 kilometers (205,000 miles) of power transmission lines.

156,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 09:05PM ET</span>",Ford could reopen two U.S. truck plants next Friday: source,"(Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) could resume production of its best-selling F-150 pickups as early as Friday, May 18 in Dearborn and Kansas City, according to a source familiar with the automaker's plans.
Ford shut truck plants in Michigan, Missouri and Kentucky earlier this week because of parts shortages caused by a supplier fire in Michigan.
Also on Friday, Mercedes-Benz (DE:DAIGn) said SUV production at its Alabama plant stopped on Thursday because of parts shortages caused by the same May 2 fire at a Meridian Magnesium Products plant in Eaton Rapids, Michigan. 
Mercedes said it had exhausted its supply of cockpit cross-members on May 9 and did not have enough parts to resume full production. It said the Alabama plant will reopen next week on a ""modified production schedule"" while the automaker works with Meridian to restore parts production.
Production of F-series Super Duty pickup trucks at Ford's Louisville plant remains suspended, but production of the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator large sports utility vehicles, also made there, has not been affected.
Ford executives earlier this week said the company's quarterly earnings could be affected by shutdowns at the three truck plants, but affirmed its full-year earnings estimate.
Ford said it was working with Chinese-owned Meridian to shift production of the affected parts to other suppliers until the fire-damaged plant can be repaired and production resumed.
Ford shares were down slightly in after-hours trade, at $11.19.

(This story has been refiled to correct paragraph five to show that F-series production at Louisville plant remains suspended but production of Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs continues there.)

The U.S. shale oil producer said last week it would expand the board size to seven from five, to allow investors to pick two nominees from Icahn's five-person slate.
Icahn, who holds a 13.51 percent stake in SandRidge, got the company to back out of its planned buyout of rival  Bonanza Creek Energy Inc  (N:BCEI) and forced the removal of the company's chief executive and chief finance officer.

The billionaire investor on Friday nominated Jonathan Christodoro, a former managing director of Icahn Capital LP, and Nancy Dunlap, the private counsel and head of the private family office of former U.S. Senator Jon Corzine.

163,By Investing.com,"<span>May 11, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com – Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week
1. Dow Jones: ‘7’ Is the Magic Number 
Energy stocks led the Dow Jones to its seven-straight daily win on Friday, helping the index turn positive for the year, following President Trump’s decision to dump the Iran nuclear deal.
The last big wave of notable earnings that rolled through this week also kept equities in focus. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS) and Dropbox Inc (NASDAQ:DBX) were some of names that garnered investor attention.
Nvidia’s earnings report topped Wall Street estimates but that failed to impress investors as they zoned in on the firm’s data centre revenues, which fell short of estimates. Disney also posted an earnings beat for the quarter.
Investor expectations were high in run up to Dropbox's first-quarter earnings on Thursday – less than two months after its stellar debut on the U.S. stock market.
The cloud company revealed first-quarter results that beat consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines and showed progress on its plan to convert individual paid users to business paid users.
Dow Jones rose for the seventh-straight day on Friday and posted its biggest weekly gain since March.
2. Crude Oil Prices: All About Trump
Crude oil prices notched another weekly win on Friday as positive sentiment on oil prices continued after U.S. President Donald Trump ditched the 2015 Iran nuclear pact, paving the way for new sanctions on Iran.
U.S. sanctions against Iranian crude oil customers are expected to commence on Nov. 5, crippling Tehran’s domestic production, leading to a drop in global crude supplies.
Data showing U.S. oil supplies fell for the first time in three weeks also supported an uptick in oil prices.
Crude futures settled nearly 1% lower on Friday as signs of a ramp up in U.S. output, encouraged traders to take profits.
3. Dollar Rally Runs Out of Steam
The dollar ended the week, nursing three-straight days of losses that resulted in a weekly loss for the first time in four weeks.
The subdued end to the week for the greenback emerged amid a wave of selling as weaker inflation data cut back traders’ bullish expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes, pressuring the dollar to ease from its highest level this year of 93.26.
Some of the factors that sparked the greenback to highs were said to be nearing a peak, leaving traders pondering the scope for further upside.
The divergence between US growth and interest rates compared to the rest of the world – one of the reasons for the recent dollar rally – was nearing its peak, ING warned earlier this week.
A slump in USD/CAD – following a rise in oil prices – also kept a lid on dollar optimism.
The dollar struggled to rise above breakeven against a basket of major currencies on Friday.
4. Gold Rides Dollar Misery to Weekly Gain
Gold prices eked a weekly gain on Friday as dollar weakness sparked demand for gold.
Traders had had little reason to pile into gold adter a relentless rise in the dollar on expectations subdued inflation had turned a corner and a faster pace of rate hikes would ensue.
But, a duo of reports of weaker inflation this week has scaled back those expectations, justifying the Fed’s gradual pace of rate hikes.
Rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, meanwhile, have failed so far, to trigger safe-haven demand.
5. Bitcoin: 'R' Is for Regulation
The return of regulatory action rattled traders as they abandon their bullish bets on bitcoin, sending the popular crypto sharply below $9,000.
Selling pressure emerged across cryptos after South Korean officials raided the country’s largest crypto exchange, Upbit, on Thursday and Friday, citing fraudulent activity, media reports suggested.
This was not the first time crypto exchanges had come under attack from regulators.
Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), which approves licenses to digital currency exchanges, said in late-April it would be taking a closer look at crypto exchanges favoured by criminals and hackers.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, meanwhile, announced a few months ago that it would scrutinise crypto-trading platforms offering “exchange-like” services.
Yet, as regulation on exchanges heats up, credible entities continue to enter the space in the hope of profiting from the transition-rich world of cryptos.
Parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was reported to be preparing a launch of an online bitcoin trading platform, the New York Times said earlier this week.
That would open the doors to large investors, which many believe is an essential step to legitimise bitcoin as an asset class.
But, the entrance of institutional investors, may not be the panacea, many believe, according to a letter published from the San Francisco Federal Reserve earlier this week.
“Similarly, the advent of blockchain introduced a new financial instrument, Bitcoin, which optimistic investors bid up, until the launch of Bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the Bitcoin price dynamics,” wrote the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
Over the past seven days, Bitcoin fell 10.98% on the Bitfinex exchange, Ethereum fell 12.07%, while Ripple XRP fell 21.73% on the Poloniex exchange."

165,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 04:56PM ET</span>",Sober in Sin City: Hedge funds focus on work at Las Vegas event,"By Lawrence Delevingne and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - A hedge fund industry gathering in Las Vegas this week was far less decadent than those of the past, as big money investors focused less on gambling and champagne-soaked ""Sin City"" celebrations and more on the grind of vetting fund managers.
After years of underperformance that have humbled hedge fund managers, investors welcomed the more sober approach at the Context Leadership Summit, said Michelle McCloskey, who helps construct portfolios of hedge funds as Man Group's President of the Americas.
""It’s not such a party atmosphere anymore"" she said in an interview, ""which is far better aligned with the preferences of most institutional clients.""
Instead of Anthony Scaramucci's splashy SkyBridge Alternatives Conference -- which featured celebrities, rock concerts and pool parties -- investors attended a new, subdued gathering. It was organized by Context Summits, best known for ""speed date"" events where investment executives who choose hedge funds for wealthy families and funds of funds quickly grill managers about their track records, investment strategies and risk-management practices. In spare, curtained booths in an Aria Resort and Casino ballroom, investors could meet with private debt specialist Direct Lending Investments, non-performing loan-focused Legacy Capital Group, corporate event-focused Paulson & Co and cryptocurrency expert Pantera Capital, among others. 
The industry’s performance has turned a corner lately, with the average hedge fund rising 0.4 percent this year, beating the slumping Standard & Poor's 500 Index for the first time in years, according to Hedge Fund Research.
""Now people are seeing hedge funds as a diversifier and not as a substitute to what they already have in the portfolio,"" said Lionel Erdely, chief investment officer for alternatives at $22 billion Investcorp Group.
With market volatility and stock price dispersion expected to pick up, analysts and investors said hedge funds are starting to look more attractive, particularly smaller managers with niche strategies. 
Erdely said he likes funds that invest in non-performing loans, particularly from Italy. Jeff Assaf, chief investment officer of $4 billion ICG Advisors, recommends private credit strategies, which typically pursue borrowers banks avoid.
SALT-LITE
Las Vegas was for years the $3.2 trillion hedge fund industry's party venue of choice. The epitome was Scaramucci's ""SALT"" event with billionaire managers like Steven A. Cohen, Paul Singer and Kenneth Griffin. 
That event was canceled this year for the first time since 2009 after Scaramucci briefly joined the Trump administration and tried, unsuccessfully, to sell SkyBridge. 
The Context event, created to fill the void, was lower key by design. 
""We don't want to ever be viewed as a boondoggle,"" Context's Ron Biscardi said in an interview. ""We’re about a serious business event for our industry."" It retained some glitzier elements, including a moderately attended late-night party at Lavo Lounge and a few high-level panels of paid speakers, including former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Defense Secretary and CIA Director Leon Panetta, and former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer. 
At one networking event, Reuters found clusters of managers wearing color-coded badges, khaki pants and blazers, discussing niche real estate funds and bank lending over beers and sliders. 
Context drew an estimated 750 attendees to its Vegas event, less than the 2,000 who flock to its flagship Miami event each January, or the approximately 2,000 who attended SALT. 
In an interview this week, Scaramucci said his event will return in May 2019. He will move back to SkyBridge as co-managing partner after the sale to a division of Chinese conglomerate HNA Group fell through in April, although a distribution partnership is planned. 
SALT will likely be in Las Vegas again but potentially slimmed down by several hundred people, Scaramucci said. SkyBridge is also considering new concepts for programing, though he expects it to remain a must-attend event for the hedge fund industry. 

""The brand is big enough,” he said, “and people want it.""

176,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 06:09PM ET</span>","Trump assails high drug prices, avoids direct hit on industry","By Yasmeen Abutaleb
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted drugmakers and healthcare ""middlemen"" for making prescription medicines unaffordable for Americans, but healthcare stocks rose as his administration avoided aggressive direct measures to cut prices.
Trump made the remarks at the White House Rose Garden in a speech to introduce what he called ""the most sweeping action in history"" to lower drug prices. The effort comes as a growing number of Americans struggle with the cost of their medications, and cite healthcare concerns as a top priority for Washington ahead of congressional elections in November. 
Trump said his administration would take aim at the ""middlemen"" in the drug industry who became ""very, very rich,"" an apparent reference to health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). He also said the pharmaceutical industry is making an ""absolute fortune"" at the expense of American taxpayers.
""Everyone involved in the broken system - the drugmakers, insurance companies, distributors, pharmacy benefit managers, and many others - contribute to the problem,"" Trump said.
Trump campaigned on lowering prescription drug prices ahead of the 2016 presidential election, even accusing drugmakers of ""getting away with murder."" Healthcare investors had braced for months for more direct attempts to regulate U.S. prices that would cut into industry profits. 
But Trump has since abandoned ideas to lower drug costs he supported during the campaign, including allowing the government's Medicare plan for older Americans to negotiate prices directly with drugmakers, and enabling U.S. consumers to import lower-cost medicines from other countries. 
On Friday, Trump's senior health officials outlined more modest policy proposals to introduce more competition among drugmakers and pass on savings to consumers.
Critics said the policies pointed to the influence the pharmaceutical industry wields with the administration.
""I think very expensive champagne will be popping in drug company boardrooms across the country tonight,"" said Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings.
Senator Ron Wyden, also a Democrat, said the proposals ""amount to asking drug companies nicely to lower their prices with zero accountability."" 
Shares of major drugmakers, insurers and PBMs rose after the speech. The S&P 500 healthcare index (SPXHC), a broad gauge of large healthcare stocks, closed up 1.5 percent, its biggest single-day percentage gain in a month. 
""The plan was a lot less aggressive than investors expected,"" wrote Alex Arfaei, analyst at BMO Capital Markets.
'AMERICAN PATIENTS FIRST'
Trump also placed blame on foreign governments, saying they ""extort unreasonably low prices"" from U.S. drugmakers, forcing companies to charge more in this country.
""America will not be cheated any longer, and especially will not be cheated by foreign countries,"" he said, adding that he has instructed the U.S. Trade Representative to make the issue a top priority with trading partners. 
As the speech was underway, the Department of Health and Human Services released what it called a blueprint titled ""American Patients First"" with details of its plan. 
It said near-term actions would include giving commercial plans that administer Medicare Part D prescription drug benefits for seniors more power to negotiate prices with drugmakers. Federal health plans would also test ways to pay for drugs based on their effectiveness. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration would evaluate requiring drugmakers to include the list prices they set on medicines in their advertising. Drugmakers argue that list prices do not reflect actual cost after discounts and rebates.
Some of the administration's longer-term priorities include restricting use of rebates, creating incentives for drugmakers to lower list prices, and investigating tools to address foreign government practices that it said could be harming innovation and driving up U.S. prices.
""There's not a big proposal here that is going to make a huge difference. There are a bunch of smaller technical changes,"" said Sam Richardson, Associate Professor of Economics at Boston College.
Regarding forcing other countries to pay more for drugs, Richardson said: ""We don't really have the policy levers to get that to happen.""
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, a former pharmaceutical company executive, said many of the actions the government was considering would not require approval by Congress and could take place through executive action within months. He said it would take years to restructure the U.S. drug system.
Trump also blasted the pharmaceutical and insurance industries for spending hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying to ""protect the status quo."" 
His remarks follow a renewed focus on the influence of the drugmaker lobby, which spends the most of any lobbying group in Washington.

Earlier this week, Swiss drugmaker  Novartis  (S:NOVN) admitted it paid $1.2 million to a consulting firm created by Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.

177,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",Trading in Portugal's EDP suspended after reports of likely Chinese bid,"LISBON (Reuters) - Trading in the shares of utility company EDP-Energias de Portugal (LS:EDP) was suspended on Friday, as media reported that a Chinese group was set to make a takeover bid for the firm.
A spokeswoman for Portugal's market regulator CMVM said the shares were suspended pending an announcement about the company but would not provide more details or comment on media reports.
The online edition of the Expresso newspaper said earlier that a Chinese consortium that includes EDP's largest shareholder, China Three Gorges (CTG), was preparing a takeover bid for Portugal's leading company by assets. The Financial Times later quoted its sources as saying CTG was set to launch an all-cash offer for EDP.
Expresso said the Portuguese government was unlikely to create obstacles to the potential takeover, but EDP would probably consider the offer hostile. 
EDP had no immediate comment. The company has a stock market capitalization of around 11.4 billion euros ($13.6 billion).
China Three Gorges holds a 23 percent stake and Chinese state company CNIC holds nearly 5 percent, meaning that the Chinese state owns just over 28 percent in EDP. A compulsory takeover offer is required if the stake exceeds 33 percent.
The suspension of EDP shares, which also encompassed EDP's wind power unit EDPR (LS:EDPR), was announced after the market close on Friday.
EDP shares had closed 0.7 percent higher at 3.11 euros.
Reports and rumors about EDP being an acquisition target of foreign companies have been circulating for months. 
Last month, following a news report that French utility Engie (PA:ENGIE) was examining a possible bid, EDP denied the existence of any contact with Engie. There were reports last year that Spain's Gas Natural (MC:GAS) was seeking a merger with EDP, but the company denied there were any talks at the time.
China Three Gorges has continued to raise its stake in EDP since reports of Gas Natural's interest.

The air bags have also been linked to 15 deaths, according to the statement from the Senator.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ordered the first recall in 2015, but Nelson said as of March 30 some 16.4 million unrepaired inflators remain in vehicles on the highways.
The defective inflators, which can explode with excessive force and unleash metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks, resulted in the auto industry's biggest recall and pushed the Japanese company to file for bankruptcy protection in June 2017. 

Florida had the highest number of injuries in the United States related to the inflators, according to the statement from Nelson, who heads the Senate committee that oversees the automakers.

NEW YORK (LPC) - US credit managers are raising new interval funds which give retail investors access to alternative assets that can offer better returns than more traditional mutual fund holdings.
Managers including OppenheimerFunds in partnership with  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG), and Flat Rock Global have registered to raise interval funds in the last year, according to regulatory filings.
“There’s a trend towards interval funds as a new solution of bringing retail investors access to alternative strategies,” said Dustin Norris, head of distribution and chief product strategist at Highland Capital Management. “The interval fund wrapper allows for a much larger pool of illiquid investments with less concern about daily liquidity.”
The funds make a range of investments in Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs), Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) and more traditional credit assets including leveraged loans and high-yield bonds.
Interval funds are having a renaissance as managers try to generate higher returns after years of low interest rates and target retail investors to broaden their buyer base. The funds also sidestep new onerous Securities and Exchange Commission rules aimed at improving the liquidity of mutual funds popular in retirement accounts.
Interval funds make periodic repurchase offers to shareholders, generally every three, six or 12 months and differ from open-end mutual funds as they are less liquid. Open-end mutual funds have daily redemptions and target retail investors that trade with personal accounts and are thus attracted to their daily liquidity.
Firms launching interval funds are betting that retail investors will be interested in products that can generate meatier returns by buying less liquid assets, including leveraged loans and structured credit. The downside is that investors cannot get their money back at short notice, unlike open-end funds.
“Alternative managers are looking to access the growing retail marketplace and firms can put more illiquid assets in an interval fund than a mutual fund because you don’t have to meet redemptions each day,” according to Kimberly Flynn, a managing director at XA Investments.
Interval funds are becoming more popular. Other asset classes, including commercial real estate, began raising interval funds a few years ago, according to Brian Moriarty, analyst of fixed-income strategies at Morningstar, but loans and structured credit are now having their day.
The new interval funds can give retail investors access to alternative investment products that were previously only available to institutional investors, according to Robert Grunewald, chief executive officer at Flat Rock.
INVESTMENTS BOOMING
The funds are coming to the market just as the underlying investments are surging in issuance. More than US$43bn of US CLOs has been raised this year through May 8, up almost 43% from the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters LPC Collateral data. US CMBS issuance is up more than 54% this year through May 4 from the same timeframe in 2017, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) data.
US CLO equity, the most junior part of the funds, returned 16.4% in 2017, compared to 4.1% for US leveraged loans and 6.3% for US high-yield bonds, according to  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) data.
Firms “have to solve the puzzle of how you give investors the right amount of liquidity so the investor isn’t locked up in a [private-equity]-style 10-year plus investment, while still delivering on the investor promise and thesis of underlying assets that are illiquid,” said Nathan Greene, head of law firm Shearman & Sterling’s registered funds and investment adviser regulatory group.
OppenheimerFunds and Carlyle partnered for the OFI Carlyle Private Credit Fund, which will invest in direct lending first- and second-lien loans, unitranche loans, mezzanine debt and CLOs, while Flat Rock is seeking to raise the Flat Rock Opportunity Fund to invest in CLO equity and junior debt tranches, according to regulatory filings.
Spokespeople for OppenheimerFunds and Carlyle both declined to comment.
Late last year Angel Oak Capital launched its Angel Oak Strategic Credit Fund that invests in CLOs, CMBS and residential mortgage-backed securities, according to regulatory filings.
Interval funds create “a favorable liquidity structure for both investors and asset managers,” said Colin McBurnette, a portfolio manager at Angel Oak.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve board will hold a public vote on whether to lift growth restrictions on scandal-hit  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) following pressure from Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts lawmaker said on Friday.
The Fed's policy shift could make it tougher for Wells Fargo to shake off the unprecedented sanctions that the bank said on Thursday are expected to crimp earnings by around $100 million.
In February, the Fed ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion until it had improved its governance and risk controls following a wave of sales practices scandals. The regulator previously said Fed staff would assess the adequacy of the bank's remediation plan, which would also be reviewed by an independent third party.
During a congressional hearing in March and in a follow-up letter, however, Senator Warren pressed Fed Chair Jerome Powell to submit the bank's remediation plan to a board vote and to consider publishing the third-party review.
On May 10th, Powell wrote to Warren that he accepted the request for a board vote.
""After further consideration, the decision about terminating the asset growth restriction will be made by a vote of the Board of Governors,"" Powell wrote in the letter published by Warren's office on Friday. 
He added that when the third-party review is ready, ""we will review that report to determine whether and to what extent the report can be publicly disclosed.""
The Fed declined to comment on Friday beyond Powell's letter. A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo declined to comment on the Fed's decision.
On Thursday, Wells Fargo told investors the cap would hurt earnings less than it thought this year. 
The bank previously expected the asset cap to hit after-tax net income by up to $400 million, but lower deposit and loan growth gave it room under the limit and caused it to cut that figure to less than $100 million, Treasurer Neal Blinde said.
The bank said in financial filings that it had received detailed feedback from the Fed regarding its remediation plan. In order to have enough time to incorporate this feedback, Chief Executive Tim Sloan said the bank was planning to operate under the cap for the first part of 2019.

""I'm glad the Fed's Board of Governors changed course,"" Warren said in a statement. ""The Fed must strictly enforce its order to show Wells Fargo that it means business.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - WeWork Companies’ $702 million junk-bond debut last month included a feature investors in the space had seldom seen in recent years: a sweetened yield.
To persuade investors to buy the deal, the office-sharing firm ultimately jacked up the interest rate it would pay by about a full percentage point to 7.875 percent.
That deal and a handful of others in the $1.5 trillion high-yield market show that bond buyers are clawing back some of the leverage they ceded during nearly 10 years of indiscriminate buying in a sometimes-frantic hunt for yield.
In the past two months investors have pushed back on loose terms and low coupons on bonds rated BB or lower by Standard & Poor's or Ba and below by Moody's Investors Service, given safer alternatives are finally offering appreciable yields after years of rock-bottom interest rates. 
Yields on 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) recently spiked above 3 percent for the first time in more than four years, fueled by higher U.S. debt supply and Federal Reserve rate hikes.
McDermott International (N:MDR) and American Greetings Corp have also had to sweeten offerings with juicier yields and stiffer covenants laying out the rules that issuers must follow.
""We absolutely, positively push back. We look at every set of covenants in every deal and negotiate really hard on all of them,"" said Krishna Memani, chief investment officer at OppenheimerFunds, which manages $243 billion in assets.
Bond managers worried about buying just anything this deep into a bull market and economic expansion are also getting choosier.
""There are some cracks in the primary market that have been signaling to investors that they shouldn't be buying everything,"" said Kathleen Gaffney, director of diversified fixed income at Eaton Vance, with $434 billion in assets under management. 
The risk that assets will underperform in a downturn is one that ""you’re just not paid for right now. I want bigger discounts and higher yields before I step in,"" she said.
COVENANTS IMPROVE, A BIT
Covenants cover everything from restrictions on payments like dividends to limits on how much debt a company can accumulate. When the market gets frothy, ""high-yield-lite"" deals spring up offering thin investor protections in the event of a downturn.To be sure, the quality of covenants remains low by historical standards, according to Evan Friedman, who produces Moody's Covenant Quality Index. And in general the premium investors are paid for holding junk debt is still near a post-recession low. 
The spread of junk bond yields over Treasuries slid to 3.24 percentage points in April, just 0.01 percentage point above its narrowest since July 2007, according to the ICE Bank of America/Merrill Lynch high-yield bond index <.MERH0A0>.
That spread recently widened to 3.43 percentage points, however, and Moody’s covenant index showed investor protections improved in April for a fourth straight month after weakening for a year.
In an unprecedented move last year, two companies had been able to sell bonds skirting the requirement that issuers use proceeds from any asset sales to repay debt or invest in the business.
But this year, three others tried and failed to follow suit, said Ross Hallock, analyst at independent credit research firm Covenant Review. American Greetings, Pisces Midco and Titan Acquisition all were unable to find buyers until they dropped that effort.
Pisces sold $645 million of bonds to fund private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice's buyout of home remodeling products makers Ply Gem Industries and Atrium Windows & Doors, but initially alienated some long-time investors in both companies by offering a skimpy yield and weak covenants.
""We've been investors in both Atrium and Ply Gem for years,"" said one deal participant, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak for the firm. But under the initial terms ""it wasn't worth it.""
After Pisces improved the coupon to 8 percent and relented on the soft covenants, the investor took ""a small position, where we would have taken none if things hadn't tightened up.""Greeting card maker American Greetings downsized its deal twice, finally pricing it at 87 cents on the dollar, and oil construction firm McDermott International was obliged to discount prices and add a new protection preventing the transfer of valuable intellectual property to unrestricted subsidiaries.
In the case of WeWork, the limited appetite for its bond was due in part to an unusual measure of profitability, which it called ""community EBITDA."" That metric excluded expenses related to interest, depreciation, amortization, marketing costs and more. 
Negligible assets for investors to claim in the event of a default, because the company leases rather than owns the majority of its properties, also soured interest.
Although WeWork raised the deal size by $202 million to $702 million, it had to increase the coupon to sway investors.
Initially it was ""high sixes, then it was low sevens, then price talk came out at 7.75 to eight,"" a source familiar with the deal said. It finally priced at 7.875 percent.
WeWork’s bonds have plunged since the sale, last trading at 94.125 cents to the dollar, and their yield has climbed to 9.029 percent.

203,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",CLO risk retention now just a memory as final appeal deadline passes,"By Kristen Haunss
NEW YORK (LPC) - After three and a half years of litigation, US Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) managers are now completely free of Dodd-Frank ‘skin in the game’ rules.
The deadline for regulators to ask the Supreme Court to consider their case in a 2014 lawsuit by the US loan trade association passed Thursday, removing the final risk-retention hurdle hanging over the market.
“We are very pleased that this three and half year journey is over and that the risk-retention rule will no longer apply to CLO managers,” said Elliot Ganz, general counsel at the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA), the trade group that filed the suit.
“While the judicial process was bumpy, we are delighted that it ultimately worked and our members can get back to focusing on what they do so well, providing capital to American companies.”
The LSTA sued the Federal Reserve (Fed) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) arguing that risk-retention rules that require CLO managers to hold 5% of their deal were “arbitrary, capricious” and “an abuse of discretion,” and could limit funding to the neediest borrowers. CLOs are the largest buyers of leveraged loans, which companies including retailer Party City and American Airlines rely on for financing.
In February the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of the trade association, finding that CLOs no longer need to comply with the rule that is designed to align manager and investor interests. 
After an initial 45-day window passed without regulators asking for a review back to the Appeals Court, on April 5 the District Court for the District of Columbia vacated an earlier ruling in favor of regulators, and managers were allowed to start issuing CLOs without holding retention.
Spokespeople for the Fed and SEC declined to comment.
But the threat of a Supreme Court review remained. Regulators had 90 days from the Appeals Court’s February 9 ruling to ask for the review, which they chose not to do.
The market “has been operating on the assumption that this was going to be the state of play, but this has freed people up to make decisions based on what makes sense for marketing and a deal structure perspective, and not be locked into the risk-retention mandate they were before,” said Paul St. Lawrence, a partner at law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton.

Even with risk retention, US CLO volume is up almost 43% this year through May 8 compared to the same period in 2017, with more than US$43bn of deals raised, according to Thomson Reuters LPC Collateral data.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) is forecasting a record US$140bn of US CLO issuance this year.

208,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",France sets limit for bank exposure to corporate debt,"PARIS (Reuters) - France's six biggest banks must limit their exposure to highly indebted French companies under a new rule effective from July, the country's financial stability council said on Friday.
The High Council for Financial Stability, headed by the finance minister and which also includes the central bank governor, has been concerned about surging corporate debt levels.
In December, it announced banks would have to cap their exposure to the most indebted companies at five percent of their capital, once details had been hammered out.
On Friday, the council said  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), Credit Mutuel, BPCE [BPCE.UL] and La Banque Postale [LAPSTE.UL] would be subject to the new limit from July for two years, which could then be renewed.
It added that other EU countries were expected to impose the limit on French companies, a move aimed at preventing firms from simply turning to other European banks for credit.
French corporate debt has hit record levels as big firms with easy access to bond markets have binged on cheap credit to finance investments and foreign takeovers.
Central bank governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau has repeatedly warned that if borrowing did not slow the council would consider additional credit curbs at its next meeting in June.
The central bank said on Friday its latest data showed growth in corporate borrowing picked up in March to 5.2 percent over one year from 5.0 percent in February.

Bond issuance in particular surged 7.3 percent as pharmaceuticals group Sanofi (PA:SASY) and insurer AXA tapped markets to finance acquisitions.

212,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 11:41AM ET</span>","Despite hurricanes and Trump, Cuba retains charm for foreign tourism firms","By Marc Frank
HAVANA (Reuters) - New U.S. travel restrictions and a destructive hurricane season last year sucked some air from Cuba's tourism boom but foreign businesses from Spain's Melia Hotels (MC:MEL) to China's Jin Jiang are pursuing new investments in what remains a promising frontier.
According to sources with knowledge of industry figures, tourist arrivals in the first three months of the year fell to roughly 1.4 million compared with 1.5 million in the same period of 2017.
Of that figure, 177,000 people arrived by sea and spent relatively little money onshore, an increase of 38,000 from the previous year, as foreign cruise lines stepped up their visits.
The downward trend continued in April, the sources said, the tail end of the November-to-May high season in Cuba.
Yet hospitality companies including Spain's Melia Hotels International and Iberostar Hotels & Resorts, Singapore’s  Banyan Tree Holdings Ltd . (SI:BANY) and Apollo Global Management LLC’s (N:APO) Diamond Resorts International Inc. have all announced new projects. 
Representatives of the companies often complain about the impossibility of owning their properties outright and the local bureaucracy, but acknowledge they make a profit.
""Cuba was, is and will be a key tourism area so it is just a matter of timing,"" said Eric Peyre, who represents Louvre Hotels SAS, a French subsidiary of China’s state-owned Jin Jiang International Hotels Development Co (SS:600754), one of the world’s largest.
Peyre, who has worked in the Cuban tourism industry for 25 years, said the company just took over one hotel but plans to have 10 within a few years.
""Every hospitality company will come to Cuba one day or another and we have decided to enter now,"" he said.
Over the last two years more than a dozen cruise lines have also arrived, including U.S. leaders  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd . (N:NCLH), Carnival Corporation (N:CCL) and  Royal Caribbean  Cruises Ltd. (RCL), which have steadily increased their Cuba stake.
""United States cruise lines continue to add sailings and increase the size of vessels on the routes,"" said John Kavulich, president of the New York based U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, who follows the sector. He said the main restraint on growth was port capacity in Cuba.
The dip in tourism revenue this year is painful for Cuba's Communist-run government, which is struggling with declining export revenues and dwindling support from crisis-hit ally Venezuela. 
The Trump administration has made it more difficult for people to travel to Cuba, banned Americans from patronizing military-owned establishments and issued a travel warning that it may be unsafe to visit Cuba. 
HAVANA HARD HIT 
Havana was particularly hard hit as the number of American tourists dramatically declined, leaving once overflowing hotels and restaurants with plenty of room to spare.
The U.S. trade embargo restricts Americans to cultural, religious and educational tourism or family visits, thus making Havana, and not beach resorts, a top draw for U.S. visitors. 
U.S. visitors, not including those of Cuban origin, fell to 98,000 in the first three months of the year versus 160,000 a year earlier. Of those, 25,000 came on cruise ships, twice the number during the same period in 2017, the sources said.
Nevertheless, there are five new five-star hotels under construction in Havana, three of which broke ground recently. 
The hotels are all owned by the military-run Gaviota hospitality corporation and will be managed by foreign firms. The Trump administration has forbidden U.S. citizens from patronizing Gaviota. 
Other hotels in the Cuban capital are undergoing renovations. Most are owned by non-military tourism companies, such as the famous sea-front Hotel Habana Riviera built by U.S. mobster Meyer Lansky on the eve of the 1958 Communist revolution.
""Everybody is planning long term. That is why the Cuban government is building in Havana and all foreign companies are asking how to be part of this development,"" Peyre said.
Foreign businessmen and local experts say 2017, with a booming 26 percent growth in arrivals before Hurricane Irma hit in September, was a fluke and so this year’s downturn is not the end of the world. Despite the hurricane's impact, arrivals for last year as a whole rose 16 percent. 
""We are very pleased that we can show the world that for us Cuba is indeed the next big frontier market and a great place to invest,"" said Sebastiaan Berger, CEO of Ceiba Investments, a Guernsey-incorporated company with close to 20 years experience in Cuba and a $175 million portfolio.
Ceiba announced this month a $150 million project to upgrade four joint-venture hotels and build a fifth with Cuban partner Cubanacan and Melia Hotels International. The Melia Habana Hotel will add 168 rooms.
Berger, like Peyre, was unperturbed by the Trump administration.

""We are a company dedicated to investments in Cuba and have been investing in real estate under Presidents Bush Sr., Bush Jr., Bill Clinton, Barrack Obama and now Trump,"" he said.

213,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 11:36AM ET</span>","U.S. trade panel: Tool chests from China, Vietnam harm U.S. makers","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission said on Friday it had made a final finding in a dumping investigation that imports of tool chests and cabinets from China and Vietnam were harming U.S. producers.
The decision paves the way for the U.S. Commerce Department to slap duties of up to 327 percent on the goods for a five-year initial period.
Last month, the Commerce Department found that tool chests imported from China and Vietnam were being dumped in the U.S. market, and announced prospective duties on the imports.
In a related case, the ITC found in January that U.S. manufacturers were being harmed by imports of tool chests from China that the Commerce Department had found were subsidized, locking in place countervailing duties.
In its announcement on April 5, the Commerce Department said tool chests manufactured by the Tongrun Single Entity (SZ:002150) in China would face antidumping duties of 97 percent, while imports from other Chinese producers would face duties of 244 percent.
Imports from Vietnam would face a duty of 327 percent, it said.
The case was brought by Waterloo Industries Inc of Sedalia, Missouri, a subsidiary of Fortune Brands Home & Security Inc (N:FBHS), which says it accounts for more than half the domestic production of tool chests and cabinets.
In 2016, the value of imports of tool chests and cabinets from China totaled $230 million, while imports from Vietnam were valued at $77 million, Commerce data shows.

(Reuters) - General Motors Co's (N:GM) South Korean unit reiterated on Friday that it should return to profitability by 2019 and that it will invest $2.8 billion in a new, small SUV as well as a crossover vehicle for the local market and for export.
This followed a more subdued outlook for the troubled unit from the state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB), which said on Friday the unit should swing to a profit from 2022 on the back of cuts in labor costs.
GM had said last month it could return to profitability in 2019 with $400 million to $500 million in annual cost reductions through plant closures, labor and other efficiencies.
GM and South Korea have agreed on a rescue package worth $7.15 billion, including $2 billion of capital spending by GM and a $2.8 billion debt-for-equity swap for existing loans GM Korea owes to its parent.
As part of its plan, GM Korea said it would design, engineer and manufacture an all-new small SUV, and an all-new crossover vehicle for Korean consumers and for export to other markets.
It also plans to engineer and manufacture a small, fuel-efficient three-cylinder gasoline engine in Korea.
""GM Korea now has the right fundamentals to grow a successful business in Korea for the long term,"" the company's Chief Executive Kaher Kazem said in a statement.

216,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Top container shipping lines reviewing Iran operations,"By Jonathan Saul
LONDON (Reuters) - The world's top two container shipping groups Maersk Line (CO:MAERSKb) and MSC are reviewing their Iran operations after the United States withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Tehran.
The 2015 agreement, worked out by the United States, five other world powers and Iran, lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for limits to its nuclear programme. 
U.S. President Donald Trump also instructed his administration to re-impose U.S. sanctions after a winding down period.
""MSC is reviewing its services, operations and business relationships to understand if any are impacted and will comply with the timetable set out by the U.S. government,"" the private Swiss-headquartered group said in a statement on Friday. 
MSC suspended services between 2012 and 2014 and when they were resumed the line used small, regional third-party feeder ships to carry cargo between Iran and MSC's transshipment hub at Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates. 
A shipping source said MSC had already stopped taking bookings for certain cargoes that would be impacted by the sanctions programme. 
The U.S. Treasury said this week Washington was imposing sanctions on the direct or indirect sale, supply, or transfer to or from Iran of graphite, raw, or semi-finished metals such as aluminum and steel, coal, and software for integrating industrial processes.
Denmark's Maersk Line said separately it had ceased acceptance of the specific cargoes listed by the U.S. Treasury this week. 
""Our presence in Iran is limited. We will monitor the developments to assess any impact on our activities,"" Maersk Line added. 
The group also used feeder services to Iran from Jebel Ali. 
Iran relies on seaborne trade for both imports as well as for sales of its goods apart from oil and the country had struggled with logistical difficulties before international sanctions were lifted in 2016. 
Iran's port operators and shipping sectors, including top cargo operator the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) and oil tanker group NITC, will once again be blacklisted on Nov. 4 by Washington.
The U.S. will separately re-impose sanctions on the provision of insurance and reinsurance, which had been another challenge for Iran in the past.
Every ship requires various insurance cover to allow for journeys at sea.
""The decision is expected to have significant implications for maritime trade with Iran and the insurance of such trade,” said Nigel Carden, deputy chairman for Thomas Miller, the manager of ship insurer UK P&I Club.
Carden said a full assessment would only be possible once there was more clarity, and urged caution before entering into any new Iran related cargo bookings. 
Lloyd's of London said it was ""currently reviewing the ""implications for the Lloyd’s (insurance) market"".

Europe's heavyweight economies took steps on Friday to safeguard their commercial and political interests in Iran.

(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (N:T) on Friday ousted its top lobbyist, and the No. 2 wireless carrier's chief executive officer said in a memo it was ""big mistake"" to hire Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, for advice on working with the Trump administration.
AT&T paid Essential Consultants LLC, a firm set up by Cohen, a total of $600,000 over 2017 for advice on working with the Trump administration. AT&T said Cohen and others were hired to help navigate ""a wide range of issues,"" including its proposed $85 billion merger with  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX), AT&T said in the memo seen by Reuters.
The disclosure of AT&T's relationship with Cohen has turned into a major embarrassment for the telecommunications company as it awaits a U.S. judge's decision, due June 12, on whether it can go through with the purchase of Time Warner, a deal that has been denounced by Trump.
AT&T said in the memo it did not hire Cohen to lobby on its behalf. The one-year contract at $50,000 per month, ran from January through December 2017 and was limited to consulting and advisory services.
AT&T never asked Cohen to set up meetings with anyone in the Trump administration, and he did not offer to do so, it said in the memo.
""To be clear, everything we did was done according to the law and entirely legitimate,"" AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson wrote in the memo. ""But the fact is our past association with Cohen was a serious misjudgment."" 
Stephenson said in the memo he took responsibility for the Washington team's failure to vet Cohen.
AT&T's head lobbyist, Bob Quinn, who oversaw the hiring of Cohen, is retiring, according to the memo. But two sources familiar with the situation said Quinn was forced to retire. 
The sources wished to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media. Quinn did not respond to a request for comment.
AT&T's board of directors does not hold Stephenson responsible for the lack of vetting, according to one source.
The AT&T payments were first revealed by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who also said a company owned by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg and other corporations paid Essential Consultants for certain services. Avenatti would not say how he obtained the information.
Drugmaker  Novartis  (S:NOVN) said on Wednesday it had a $1.2 million contract with Cohen's firm, but soon realized the agreement was a mistake.
Essential Consultants paid $130,000 to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, days before the 2016 presidential election as part of a nondisclosure agreement that barred her from discussing an alleged sexual encounter with Trump. He denies any encounter took place.

Shares of AT&T were up 1.2 percent to $32.25.

Air France KLM shares were up 6.3 percent at 7.52 euros (6.6 pounds) in late-session trading, although the stock remains down by around 45 percent since the start of 2018.
Earlier on Friday, the airline had said traffic had fallen 2.6 percent in April, blaming a wave of strikes over pay conditions at the French brand that last week forced the chief-executive of the Franco-Dutch group to resign.
Nevertheless, the company added that its load factor - a measure of how full are the planes flown by an airline - had progressed by 0.4 percentage points.
""The load factor has still managed to increase. It shows that the company is able to re-adjust its offer to the changing demands,"" said a Geneva-based fund manager.

Jean-Marc Janaillac said last Friday that he was resigning as Air France KLM CEO following the rejection by staff of a pay deal that he had put to a vote, after talks with the unions reached a deadlock.

224,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Crypto concerns push Nvidia shares lower,"(Reuters) - Shares of  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) fell 2 percent on Friday as investors worried that a short-term surge in demand for graphics chips from cryptocurrency miners may be undermining its core business with computer gamers.
Most analysts continued to hold a positive opinion about the stock with at least nine brokerages raising their price targets for Nvidia shares.
Analysts at SunTrust Robinson were most bullish with a price target of $316. The median price target was $274 compared to Thursday's close of $260.19. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Ross Seymore, who has a ""hold"" rating for the stock, said while the company had beaten expectations, he had reservations about the details.
""While growth remains strong across virtually every segment, the quality of the first quarter beat was somewhat lower,"" he said. ""Crypto delivered the majority of the upside, while datacenter was slightly below our estimate.""
Gamers use GPUs to play high-quality video games, but Nvidia's graphic cards are also used by cryptocurrency miners to build machines to solve the complex math puzzles that earn digital currencies such as Ethereum and bitcoin.
That has pushed up prices of GPUs and also led to a shortage of cards for game enthusiasts who want to install extra processing power.
""Cryptocurrency mining continues to inject noise into an overall very strong growth story, but it should be cleaned up in the next couple of quarters while numbers keep going up,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Joseph Moore said.
Nvidia said it made $289 million in sales, or about 9 percent of its overall $3.2 billion in revenue, from chips for mining cryptocurrencies.
The company said its introduction of a crypto-specific GPU called CMP should resolve the tension.
""Channel prices for our GPUs are beginning to normalize, allowing gamers who had been priced out of the market last quarter to get their hands on the new GeForce at a reasonable price,"" Nvidia's Chief Financial Officer Colette M. Kress said.
""Cryptocurrency demand was again stronger than expected, but we were able to fulfill most of it with crypto-specific GPUs."" 
Nvidia's fast-growing data center business rose 71 percent to $701 million in the quarter, but missed analysts' estimate of $703 million.
Of the 35 analysts covering the stock, 22 have a ""buy"" or higher rating; 11 on ""hold"" and only two on ""sell"" or lower.

The stock has gained nearly a third of its more than $150 billion market value this year alone.

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) each rose over 1 percent while Merck (NYSE:MRK) & Co jumped 2.8 percent after Trump in a speech said foreign governments ""extort"" unreasonably low prices from U.S. drugmakers. His healthcare deputies released a series of proposals to address high drug costs.
""They've walked the tightrope between cost savings for the American people and maximizing profits for publicly traded healthcare stocks,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
The S&P healthcare index ended 1.47 percent higher, while the Nasdaq Biotechnology index rallied 2.68 percent.
The tech sector slipped 0.32 percent, with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) dropping 0.38 percent after a nine-day winning streak that saw the iPhone maker edge closer to $1 trillion in market capitalization.
Also weighing on tech was Nvidia, which fell 2.15 percent on worries that a short-term surge in demand for graphics chips from cryptocurrency miners may be undermining the company's core business with computer gamers.
""Tech is giving back some of its gains. Market participants are not making aggressive bets after the week we’ve had, heading into the weekend,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. ""We’re in a holding pattern today, digesting the strong gains of the week.”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.37 percent to end at 24,831.17 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.17 percent to 2,727.72, its highest close since mid-March. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.03 percent to 7,402.88.
For the week, the Dow rose 2.3 percent, the S&P 500 added 2.4 percent, and the Nasdaq climbed 2.7 percent.
During Friday's session, the Dow edged above 100-day moving average for the first time since April 18, following the S&P 500's similar move a day earlier. Some traders believe such developments mean the market is likely to move higher. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.8 billion shares, light compared with the 6.6 billion-share average over the last 20 trading days.
With March-quarter reports mostly wrapped up, S&P 500 companies appear to have grown their earnings per share by 26 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Due to increased expectations for corporate profits and a dip in stock prices since January, the S&P 500 is now trading at 16 times expected earnings, its lowest multiple in two years, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. 
""We have very strong fundamentals from an earnings perspective and valuations are looking a bit more reasonable than they were late last year,"" said Bill Northey, senior vice president at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
Boosting the Dow was Verizon, which rose 3 percent after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) upgraded the wireless carrier to ""overweight,"" saying 5G opportunity will start to crystallize in the next few months.
Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) slumped 33 percent after the Norton Antivirus maker said it was investigating concerns raised by a former employee.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.24-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.23-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 30 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 137 new highs and 51 new lows.

(Reuters) -  Symantec Corp  (O:SYMC) shares lost a third of their value on Friday after the cyber-security firm disclosed its board's audit committee was investigating ""concerns"" raised by a former employee and that it might have to restate results.
The stock, down $9.56 at $19.62 on Nasdaq, shed roughly $6 billion in market value, its steepest decline since 2001. At least nine analysts downgraded the stock.
Symantec disclosed the whistleblower probe late on Thursday, saying it might miss a deadline for filing its annual 10-K report, may need to restate some financial results and might revise guidance. 
""This may be far from over,"" MoffettNathanson LLC analyst Adam Holt said in a note to investors, cutting his recommendation on the stock to ""sell.""
Symantec Vice President Cynthia Hiponia told analysts on a call on Thursday that the probe began “in connection with concerns raised by a former employee.” She did not say whether that person had approached Symantec or raised the issue with securities regulators.
She added that the company had voluntarily advised the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it was investigating the matter. 
A spokeswoman for the SEC declined to comment. 
Sean X. McKessy, a former chief of an SEC program that rewards whistleblowers for turning in firms that violate U.S. securities laws, said the warning of a delay in filing the 10-K suggests that the issue is related to accounting practices. 
He said the SEC has likely begun an informal review of the matter, but would likely wait to see results of the company's probe before deciding how to proceed. 
""While this may all amount to nothing, this is undoubtedly a serious matter, and it could be a while before transparency and investor confidence improves,"" analysts at Cowen & Co said in a note to investors.
Cowen also noted it was ""shocking"" that Symantec had scrapped the question-and-answer portion of its conference call with analysts following its quarterly earnings report on Thursday.
Symantec Chief Executive Officer Greg Clark and the bulk of his senior management team have been with the 36-year-old company for about two years, joining from Blue Coat Inc, which Symantec acquired in August 2016.

Symantec on Thursday also issued an annual outlook that was below Wall Street's expectations.

Africa's second-largest crude producer has been battered by a fall in the price of oil over the past four years and President João Lourenço, who took office in September, has pledged to reduce state interference in the economy, which remains centrally controlled after years of civil war and Soviet influenced state building following independence from Portugal in 1975.
""Generally, the government intends to sell its entire interest in these companies, the majority of which operate in the industrial sector,"" the prospectus, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, said.
The prospectus does not list the companies or say how much the privatizations could raise, but a government source told Reuters that Angola's ports, national carrier TAAG, BCI bank, and insurer Ensa were all being considered for full or partial privatization.
""The government's long-term policy is that companies which, in the government's view, are not required to remain under public ownership as a matter of policy should eventually be privatized,"" the prospectus added.
Lourenço aims to revive growth by opening the economy to foreign investors and diversifying away from oil, which currently accounts for 95 percent of exports.
Angola is in the process of raising $3 billion through two Eurobond issues, launching $1.75 billion in 10-year notes at 8.25 percent and a $1.25 billion 30-year tranche at 9.375 percent.

In the prospectus, Angola also said it saw its total debt – excluding that held by state oil firm Sonangol – reaching $77.3 billion, or 70.8 percent of GDP, by the end of 2018.

232,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",Homebuilders poised for gains but face interest-rate fears,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors are betting on shares of homebuilders to outperform U.S. stocks at large, but with interest rates expected to rise they may have to wait several months before those bets pay off.
The U.S. economy looks ideal for homebuilding stocks to benefit. The unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level in more than 17 years and consumer confidence is near the highest levels in 17 years, according to the Conference Board.
And demand for housing in an already tight market is being supported by the many millennials seeking to purchase their first home, several investors said.
The U.S. Commerce Department's data on April housing starts will be released on Wednesday, followed by data on new-home sales on May 23.
But other factors could raise costs for home buyers, potentially hampering home sales. A sharp rise this year in U.S. Treasury yields reflects increasing worries about inflation and fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates more aggressively than has been expected. 
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is used as the benchmark for mortgage interest rates; higher rates increase mortgage costs for home buyers.
""The continued rally in yields is a potential red flag,"" said Jared Woodard, an investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York.
The 10-year Treasury yield  has briefly exceeded the 3 percent mark, the highest level since January 2014 and more than 50 basis points higher than where it started the year.
The S&P Composite 1500 Homebuilding index <.SPCOMHOME> has lagged the broader market, falling 16.9 percent from its Jan. 22 peak, which is more than three times the percentage decline of the S&P 500 (SPX) from its high that month. In 2017, the homebuilding index soared 74.8 percent from the previous year.
Other factors also cast a cloud on the housing market. Last year's federal tax overhaul put a cap on deductions for state and local and property taxes and lowered the amount of mortgage interest that is deductible, all of which results in higher costs for many homeowners.
Homebuilders have also pointed to rising costs for materials and labor in their earnings calls, though so far they have had little impact on their margins.
""The factors indicate that there may be some headwinds going forward,"" said Michael Cuggino, president and portfolio manager of Permanent Portfolio Funds in San Francisco, which owns shares of  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN), the largest U.S. homebuilder by market capitalization.
Shares of the five largest U.S. homebuilders by market capitalization jumped on April 4, when Lennar reported robust quarterly sales and raised its forecast for the year. Lennar's shares climbed 10 percent that day, and PulteGroup Inc (N:PHM), D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI),  Toll Brothers  Inc (N:TOL) and  NVR Inc  (N:NVR) rose between 4.1 percent and 6.4 percent.
The stocks have given up much of those gains since then, even though homebuilders have continued to deliver upbeat results. Lennar shares have tumbled 13.7 percent. D.R. Horton, NVR and Toll Brothers are down 3.9 percent, 3.3 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Only PulteGroup has added to its April 4 gains, rising 1.8 percent.
Homebuilders that sell units at multiple price points, from starter homes to luxury properties, and are active throughout the United States are best positioned to withstand investors' skittishness over interest rates, Cuggino said.
Next up to report is Toll Brothers, which focuses on the luxury market and is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings on May 22.
Still, some investors say this year's industry underperformance looks like a normal response to the 2017 run-up.
Though housing starts have risen, hitting 1.319 million units in March, demand among home buyers has outpaced the limited housing supply in part because of the many millennials are entering the market.
""This is just a pause,"" said Brian Macauley, co-portfolio manager of the Hennessy Focus Fund in Arlington, Virginia, which owns shares of NVR. ""As fundamentals come through, the stocks will behave better.""
Signs of worries about affordability among home buyers, such as a move toward smaller homes or an uptick in adjustable-rate mortgages, have not yet emerged, said Jack Micenko, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group in New York.
Low earnings multiples could also draw investors' attention. The 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 Homebuilding index <.SPLRCHOME>, which comprises just Lennar, PulteGroup and D.R. Horton, has fallen to 9.5 from 13.7 at the end of 2017. The price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is 16, down from 18.5 at the end of 2017.
""If (homebuilders) have solid orders and growth and hold their margins, they could work from here,"" said Jonathan Woloshin, head of Americas equities and real estate at the chief investment office of UBS Global Wealth Management in New York. ""There are some very attractive valuations out there.""

233,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 02:12PM ET</span>","Thomson Reuters expects higher 2018 costs, shares drop","By Jessica Toonkel
(Reuters) -  Thomson Reuters  Corp (N:TRI) (TO:TRI) forecast its corporate costs would more than double for the year but revenue would only increase modestly. The prediction sent shares of the news and information company down 4 percent as investors fretted about earnings growth after it completes a plan to sell a majority stake in its largest unit. 
The company expects $500 million to $600 million in corporate costs this year for tech investments and ""right-sizing some areas of the organization,"" Chief Financial Officer Stephane Bello told analysts on a conference call after reporting first-quarter earnings.
The estimate does not include the company's Financial & Risk unit, which sells data and news primarily to financial customers. Thomson Reuters agreed to sell a majority stake in that unit in January to private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (N:BX). The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year.
The comparable corporate cost figure for 2017, also excluding the Financial & Risk unit, was $244 million. 
The sharp growth in expected corporate costs surprised some on Wall Street. 
""I thought the transitional costs were going to be in the $50 million-and-under range,"" said Doug Arthur, an analyst at Huber Research Partners LLC. ""They are talking a very big number ... there is a little shock value to that.""
Nevertheless, he remains positive on Thomson Reuters' prospects after the Financial & Risk unit transaction. ""I am very bullish on the deal but the bridge to get to the promised land is a little messy and the stock is reacting to that,"" he said. 
Costs and investments over the next two years could constrain profitability, said analyst Brittany Weissman of Edward Jones. 
""There's uncertainty around ... what earnings growth will look like, especially over the next couple of years as TRI repositions the business,"" she added. ""However, we were encouraged by the growth in the two largest remaining segments. Sales in the legal division were above expectations."" 
For the first quarter, Thomson Reuters reported sales of $1.38 billion, up slightly from $1.33 billion a year ago. Adjusted for special items, first-quarter earnings were 28 cents a share. 
Analysts had expected revenue of $1.36 billion and earnings of 27 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for 2018 to range between $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in the remaining business.
That is down from $1.6 billion in 2017, reflecting the projected higher corporate costs.
Shares were down about 4 percent at C$47.99 in afternoon trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Earlier in the day they hit their lowest level since early 2015. 
'COMPLICATED' DEAL 
Thomson Reuters' legal business reported revenue of $872 million in the first quarter, up 2 percent excluding currency. The Tax & Accounting unit reported revenue of $437 million, up 5 percent when factoring out currency. 
The Reuters News division reported $72 million in revenue, down 7 percent from a year earlier in constant currency. 
Thomson Reuters, the parent of Reuters, competes for financial customers with Bloomberg LP as well as News Corp's (O:NWSA) Dow Jones unit. 
In the quarter, the Financial & Risk business - now counted as a discontinued operation - grew revenues 3 percent in constant currency to $1.58 billion. 
Under the agreement with Blackstone, the new Financial & Risk company will make minimum annual payments of $325 million to Reuters over 30 years to access its news service, equating to almost $10 billion. The payments will be adjusted for inflation.
Thomson Reuters expects to use $1 billion to $3 billion from the proceeds of the Blackstone deal to make acquisitions in legal and accounting, but has no plans to go into new businesses, Chief Executive Jim Smith said in an interview. 
Asked about the stock's 12 percent decline since the day before the Blackstone deal was announced, Smith said: ""Investors are still getting their hands on the details of the deal as it is very complicated ... How do you forecast EPS when you don’t know how many 'S' there are?” 
EPS refers to ""earnings per share.""
Smith said he expects to stay on with the remaining Thomson Reuters business after the deal closes later this year.
He also said the company was not currently planning a paywall for news. Competitor Bloomberg announced earlier this month it would begin a metered pay wall to charge users for access to its content. 

Thomson Reuters also announced a new $500-million share repurchase program.

238,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 07:36AM ET</span>",Barclays CEO fined $1.5 million for trying to unmask whistleblower,"By Lawrence White and Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - British regulators and  Barclays  (L:BARC) have fined the bank's Chief Executive Jes Staley a combined 1.1 million pounds ($1.5 million) after he tried to identify a whistleblower who sent letters criticizing an employee of the bank.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England's  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority said on Friday they had together fined Staley 642,000 pounds. That included a 30 percent discount for him agreeing at an early stage to settle.
Barclays imposed a 500,000 pound cut to his 2016 pay.
The regulatory fine is the first ever such penalty for the sitting CEO of a major bank in Britain, and cast a pall over Staley's efforts to show the bank has improved its culture since the freewheeling days of before the 2007-8 financial crisis.
""Mr Staley’s actions fell short of the standard of due skill, care and diligence expected of a CEO in a regulated firm,"" the FCA said.
Regulators said the fine was only 10 percent of his overall pay package. Staley, a 61-year old American and former JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) banker who took the helm at Barclays in December 2015, at one stage appeared at risk of losing his job over the probe.
""I have consistently acknowledged that my personal involvement in this matter was inappropriate, and I have apologized for mistakes which I made,"" Staley said in the bank's statement on Friday.
The regulatory findings will also be closely read by lawmakers keen to ensure top banking officials are held accountable for their actions at a time when there are growing calls to better protect whistleblowers.
The regulators stopped short of saying Staley was unfit to continue in his role, after he twice attempted to find out who wrote letters raising ""concerns of a personal nature"" about an unidentified senior employee.
""Mr Staley acted unreasonably in proceeding in this way and, in doing so, risked undermining confidence in Barclays’ whistleblowing policy and the protections it afforded to whistleblowers,"" the FCA said.
VIDEO FOOTAGE
Tracking down the whistleblower became a transatlantic effort, the regulators' report showed.
A copy of the envelope of the first letter was sent by Staley's office via group security to a Barclays employee in the United States ""who engaged with their contacts in the U.S. to try and identify the author"".
These ""contacts"" provided the date, time, location and cost of buying postage for the first letter.
Group security then made a fruitless attempt to obtain ""video footage"" of the person who bought postage for the first letter, the report said.
It was the regulators' first case brought under Britain's new senior managers regime (SMR), a post financial crisis reform aimed at making top staff directly accountable for their actions.
Barclays is subject to the first ever requirements to tell regulators annually about any whistleblowing cases made against senior managers, and any cases where Barclays has sought to identify anonymous whistleblowers.
The bank's ""whistleblowers' champions"", who come under the SMR, will also have to attest personally each year on the soundness of Barclays' whistleblowing systems.
Barclays said in April last year it had reprimanded Staley and would cut his bonus as the two financial watchdogs launched a year-long investigation into his actions.
Authorities in the United States are still investigating the case.

240,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 05:52PM ET</span>","Trump urges automakers to build more vehicles in U.S., blasts NAFTA","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday pressed automakers to build more vehicles in the United States and launched a fresh attack on the North American Free Trade Agreement that has benefited them, while the companies urged him to work with California to keep nationwide U.S. vehicle emissions standards.
CEOs or senior executives from 10 U.S. and foreign automakers met with Trump for about an hour at the White House as the Transportation Department considers loosening federal fuel efficiency and pollution standards implemented under Democratic former President Barack Obama.
Afterward, two major auto industry trade groups said in a joint statement that Trump expressed an ""openness to a discussion with California on an expedited basis."" California and 16 other states covering about 40 percent of the U.S. population sued last week to block the Trump administration's efforts to weaken the fuel efficiency requirements.
A U.S. Transportation Department draft proposal would freeze these requirements at 2020 levels through 2026, rather than allowing them to increase as previously planned. The Trump administration is expected to formally unveil the proposal later this month or in June.
The chief executives of General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler, along with senior U.S. executives from Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), Hyundai Motor Co, Nissan Motor Co, Honda Motor Co, BMW AG and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) met with Trump, as did the heads of the two trade groups.
""We're really talking about environmental (controls), CAFE standards, and manufacturing of millions of more cars within the United States,"" Trump, known for his ""America First"" policies, said at the top of the meeting, referring to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for cars and light trucks in the United States.
""We're importing a lot of cars, and we want a lot of those cars to be made in the United States,"" Trump added, specifically mentioning Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and North Carolina.
Automakers want the White House and California to reach an agreement on maintaining national standards, fearing a prolonged legal battle could leave the companies facing two different sets of rules - and the state level and nationally - and extended uncertainty.
Much of the hour-long meeting focused on NAFTA and other trade issues, with Trump blasting the pact with Canada and Mexico.
""We're renegotiating it now. We'll see what happens,"" Trump said, adding that Mexico and Canada ""don't like to lose the golden goose.""
""But NAFTA has been a horrible, horrible disaster for this country, and we'll see if we can make it reasonable,"" the Republican president added.
Automakers have called NAFTA a success, allowing them to integrate production throughout North America and make production competitive with Asia and Europe. They have noted the increase in auto production over the past two decades with NAFTA in place, and have warned that changing it too much could prompt some companies to move production out of the United States.
Major automakers reiterated this week they do not support freezing fuel efficiency requirements but said they want new flexibility and rule changes to address lower gasoline prices and the shift in U.S. consumer preferences to bigger, less fuel-efficient vehicles.
'FULLY SUPPORTIVE'
Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, whose company is shifting production of Ram heavy-duty pickup trucks from Mexico to Michigan in 2020, told Reuters before the meeting his company is ""fully supportive"" of Trump's efforts to revise the mileage rules and hoped for ""an agreed way forward.""
NAFTA changes proposed by Trump's administration would not require Fiat Chrysler to end production in Mexico but rather to ""redirect"" exports of Mexican-built vehicles to other global markets, Marchionne added. 
Marchionne said he still hopes the administration will reach a deal with California to maintain nationwide standards and said Trump is an ideal negotiator to get an agreement.
Noting that automakers want a deal with California, Democratic U.S. Senator Tom Carper said, ""Our businessman and self-proclaimed 'dealmaker' president should be able to take yes for an answer and help us secure a win-win solution that is well within reach.""
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow and Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt also attended the meeting. Trump directed Chao and Pruitt to continue administration talks with California to see if a deal can be reached quickly, an auto industry source said.
Democrats and environmental advocates plan to challenge the administration's plans to weaken vehicle rules touted by the Obama administration as one of its biggest actions to combat climate change by reducing planet-warming emissions.
The Trump administration plans to argue that freezing the rules would lead to cheaper vehicles, boost sales and employment and improve safety by prodding faster turnover of older vehicles.

The Obama-era rules adopted in 2012 sought to double average fleet-wide vehicle fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025, but included an evaluation due by April 2018 to determine if the rules were appropriate.

242,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 11, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>",Apple Leaves Overseas Cash Out of Its Latest Quarterly Report,"(Bloomberg) -- A key figure disappeared from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s latest quarterly report. It’s also gone from the regulatory filings of Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., Google’s Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL).
Cash held overseas.
There’s nothing rule-breaking about leaving it out -- some tax experts say it makes perfect sense -- but the move could make it more difficult to gauge whether one of the federal tax changes enacted last year is stoking corporate investment in the U.S., as the Trump administration said it would.
Cupertino, California-based Apple, which at one time had $252 billion stockpiled abroad, said it plans to repatriate money, but hasn’t reported foreign cash holdings since September. Microsoft stopped at the end of last year. Google, Oracle and Netflix discontinued the disclosure this year.
The tax regime signed into law in December by President Donald Trump requires American-based companies to pay tax on money they’ve stashed outside the U.S. The new rules set a one-time rate of 15.5 percent on cash and 8 percent on non-cash or illiquid assets. Payments can be made over eight years. Previously, companies had to pay 35 percent, but only if they brought the money back to the U.S.
“The primary reason for the disclosure in the first place was that cash located in a foreign subsidiary was not the same as cash already in the U.S.,” said J. Richard Harvey, a professor at the Villanova University law school and graduate tax program in Pennsylvania. “It makes sense that U.S. multinational corporations would stop disclosing the amount of cash held overseas.”
But the lack of disclosure makes it more difficult to calculate whether the new tax is ending what the Treasury Department called a “perverse incentive to keep foreign profits offshore.”
Apple and Redwood City, California-based Oracle declined to comment. Google, Los Gatos, California-based Netflix and Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Mountain View, California-based Google, for example, said in its latest quarterly statement that for March 31, 2018, it recorded a “tax liability for the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings of $10.2 billion.” Google last reported offshore cash holdings of $62.8 billion.
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., which continues to disclose its overseas cash holdings, reported a record $20.1 billion last quarter. That’s $4 billion more than what it held at the end of last year.
Ending the disclosure seems to be more exception than rule. Tech giants like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO). have continued to put out a number. So have Coca-Cola Co. and rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc., as have companies such as  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT). and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. Of those companies, Coca-Cola, Caterpillar and GE have reduced their offshore holdings.
“Repatriations will be, in the grand scheme of things, relatively modest and opportunistic,” said Robert Willens, a tax and accounting adviser in New York. “I’m not sure that companies, certainly at this stage of the business cycle, are going to aggressively expand their plant and equipment balances in anticipation of even greater demand for their products.”"

245,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 06:06AM ET</span>",Iran says Airbus to announce its decision on selling planes to Tehran soon: Fars,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran said on Friday that Airbus (PA:AIR) would announce in the next few days whether it would sell planes to Tehran after the United States withdrew from an international nuclear deal and said it would reinstated sanctions on the Islamic Republic.
The U.S. administration has already said it would revoke the export licenses needed by planemakers to sell commercial planes to Iran. Although Airbus is a European firm, its aircraft use U.S. components and technology.
Iran has so far imported at least 11 aircraft, three of them from Airbus and eight from Franco-Italian turboprop maker ATR (MI:LDOF).
""Airbus will announce its decision in the coming days,"" senior advisor to Iran's Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan told the semi-official Fars news agency.
""No down payment has been made by Iran to the planemakers for future deliveries,"" he said.
U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran on Tuesday, a move that raises the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upset European allies and casts uncertainty over global oil supplies.
The U.S. withdrawal also signals the collapse of $38 billion in plane deals between Tehran and Western companies, leaving Airbus facing greater risks than its U.S. rival Boeing, according to people involved in the deals.
""During the talks with Airbus and Boeing we did not consider any possibility of such exit from the deal and it was not mentioned in the contracts,"" said Fakhriyeh-Kashan, a former deputy minister who negotiated the contracts.
IranAir, the national flag carrier, had ordered 200 passenger aircraft, with 100 from Airbus, 80 from Boeing (N:BA) and 20 from ATR.
All the deals are dependent on U.S. licenses because of the heavy use of American parts in the planes.
Other Iranian airlines had also made plane orders.
Under the nuclear deal, Iran curbed its nuclear program in return for lifting most international non-nuclear sanctions imposed on the country that crippled its economy for years. Most sanctions were lifted in 2016.

Saint-Gobain, whose shares rose 2.8 percent, is to take a large stake in Sika, but not majority control.

(Reuters) - Silver Lake is buying Zoopla and PrimeLocation owner ZPG (L:ZPG) for 2.2 billion pounds ($3 billion), delivering a windfall for its largest shareholder the  Daily Mail  publishing group.
Along with  Rightmove  (L:RMV), ZPG dominates online searches for property sale and rentals in Britain, with Zoopla's sites carrying listings for nearly 15,000 estate agent branches.
Each ZPG shareholder will get 490 pence in cash, a premium of 31 percent over Thursday close, in an agreed deal, U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake said on Friday.
Silver Lake, with around $39 billion in assets under management, said ZPG, whose websites and apps attract more than 50 million visits a month, was a great growth technology story.
Shares in ZPG, which also owns utility price comparison website uSwitch, were up about 30 percent to 486.4 pence after ZPG directors said in a joint statement they considered the terms of the deal ""fair and reasonable"".
ZPG's largest shareholder with a near 30 percent stake is Daily Mail and General Trust (L:DMGOa), publisher of Britain's Daily Mail newspaper, which also backed the deal.
The directors of ZPG, who own 1.16 pct of the firm, also backed the takeover, which Ian Whittaker at Liberum, who has a ""buy"" rating on ZPG, said showed that buyers were prepared to pay ""punchy multiples"" for high quality assets.

SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors' (N:GM) South Korean unit is expected to swing to a profit from 2022, state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB) said on Friday, offering a more subdued outlook for the troubled unit compared with the U.S. automaker which sees a profit from 2019.
KDB chairman Lee Dong-gull told reporters the view was based on due diligence done on the loss-making unit by Samil, the Korean affiliate of auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. The return to profit will be driven by labor cost cuts, he said.
GM said last month the unit will be able to return to profit next year, with $400 million to $500 million in annual cost reductions through plant closure, labor and other efficiencies.
The differing viewpoints of the two biggest shareholders of the unit, called GM Korea, underscore the severity of the challenges facing its restructuring. Analysts and customers, as well as the South Korean government, have had doubts on how long the unit will remain in business.
GM Korea averted a bankruptcy filing with wage concessions from its labor union last month. The U.S. automaker in February announced its plan to shut down one of its four plants in South Korea and cut headcount by nearly 3,000. 
GM Korea's annual net loss widened to $1.1 billion last year, its fourth straight year in the red after GM’s decision to pull its Chevy brand from Europe led to reduced exports to the key export market.
KDB is the second biggest shareholder of GM Korea with a 17 percent stake. The U.S. automaker owns 77 percent, while China's SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104) controls the remaining 6 percent.
Samil conducted due diligence on the unit to assess its viability, as South Korea mulled whether to inject money into the unit.
GM and South Korea have agreed on a rescue package worth $7.15 billion, including $750 million from KDB.
Under the terms of a binding deal to be signed on Friday, GM cannot exit its investment for 10 years.

“No one can guarantee the future of GM Korea after 10 years, but the deal paved the way for a turning point for GM Korea,"" Lee said. ""I hope this will create an opportunity for GM Korea to recover competitiveness.""

255,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 01:25AM ET</span>",U.S. activist fund Elliott to vote against Hyundai restructuring plan,"By Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. activist fund Elliott Management said it will vote against  Hyundai Motor  Group's restructuring plan and urged other shareholders to reject the proposal to reform South Korea's second-largest conglomerate. 
A Hyundai Motor Group executive responded that the proposed arrangements to simplify the automaker's complex ownership structure would not change and promised higher returns for shareholders.
""Elliott is one of many people who express their opinions,"" Cheong Jin-haeng, president of Hyundai Motor Group, told reporters on the sidelines of an industry event.
Measures to boost investor returns would be laid out after a meeting on May 29 where shareholders will vote on the restructuring, he added.
Elliott said in a statement late on Thursday that the restructuring plan was ""based on flawed assumptions"" and the conglomerate's ""token measures"" to buy back and cancel shares were not enough to achieve fair value for investors. 
""More significant measures are needed to address the long-unresolved issues at the group that have led to significant valuation discounts and underperformance at  Hyundai Mobis , (KS:012330) Hyundai Motor (KS:005380) and Kia (KS:000270),"" Elliott said. 
Under the plan, auto-parts maker Hyundai Mobis will spin off its domestic module and after-service parts businesses and merge them with  Hyundai Glovis , (KS:086280) a logistics firm. 
Elliott says it holds over 1.5 percent of common shares in Hyundai Mobis. Hyundai Motor Group Chairman Chung Mong-koo and the group's affiliates own a total 30 percent stake in Mobis, which will put the spin-off plan to a shareholder vote. The state-run National Pension Service holds a nearly 10 percent stake in Hyundai Mobis.
Elliott, which disclosed in April that it holds more than $1 billion worth of shares in three key affiliates of Hyundai Motor Group, previously called on the company to adopt a holding company strategy and appoint more independent board members. 
It is Elliott's latest challenge to South Korea's powerful family-run conglomerates after it forced  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) to increase shareholder returns in 2017, and comes amid a government campaign to boost investors' power in a country where shareholder activism is rare.
In 2015, Elliott narrowly lost a battle to block the merger of two Samsung Group affiliates. The deal was later implicated in a corruption scandal which led to the jailing of the country's former president and bribery charges against Samsung Group heir Jay Y. Lee, who denies any wrongdoing. 
Elliott is seeking compensation from the government of no less than $670 million as part of an ongoing legal dispute over the 2015 merger, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Hyundai Motor said in late April it would cancel $890 million worth of treasury shares, its first stock cancellation in 14 years. Hyundai Mobis said earlier this month it would cancel about 600 billion won ($562 million) in treasury shares from next year, and pay dividends in more installments.
Shares in Hyundai Motor were 0.3 percent higher, compared to the wider market's (KS11) 0.5 percent rise as of 0124 GMT. Hyundai Mobis were up 1.3 percent, while Kia Motors was up 0.5 percent. 

""Elliott's stakes in Hyundai Motor Group companies are known to be small. The move was expected,"" said Esther Yim, analyst at Samsung Securities.

256,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 08:55AM ET</span>",Nestle falls behind as millennials warm up to frozen meals,"By Richa Naidu and Melissa Fares
Solon, OHIO (Reuters) - At Nestle's $50 million research center outside Cleveland, food technicians and packaging experts set out three years ago to remake its frozen food lineup and appeal more to busy, health-conscious adults in their 20s and 30s.
Nestle may have gotten the menu right, but its timing was off. When young consumers came back to the frozen food aisle last year, the company's supply chain wasn't ready. The result: It lost market share to rivals.
Jeff Hamilton, who heads Nestle's U.S. food business, said in an interview the company did not have the manufacturing capacity ready to meet extra demand for its Stouffer's Fit Kitchen and Lean Cuisine meals. He described it as ""sudden, significant and beyond our expectations.""
To catch up, Nestle recently increased capacity at several of its U.S. factories, including making adjustments to its plants and adding a new line in its factory in Jonesboro, Arkansas, Hamilton said. 
""That doesn't mean we're not close to the edge, but I think we're one step ahead from where we were,"" he said.
Investors have long pressed Nestle to improve the performance of its frozen food business, leading the company to bring consultants, focus groups and international chefs to its Ohio research facility to help overhaul its menu. Today, the lineup includes items such Coconut Chickpea Curry and Sweet Earth Veggie Lover's pizza, advertised as organic or high in vitamin C.
Much of its effort revolved around a pitch to millennials, the young adult demographic that executives believed would purchase frozen meals if they were offered healthier, more modern choices at the right price point. 
So when demand began rising a year ago, it should have offered Nestle a chance to quickly quiet critics. Instead, it marked a missed opportunity.
After several flat years, frozen food sales in the United States rose 1.4 percent in the last year, according to Nielsen, the market research firm. Young adults helped drive the surge. In 2017, millennial homes spent 9 percent more than average households per trip on frozen foods. 
Yet since September, retailers have sold fewer Nestle frozen entrees than during the same period the prior year, hitting a low point in January when Nestle volumes were about 5 percent down from last year, according to Bernstein analysts who reviewed data from Nielsen.
Competitors filled the gap. Frozen entree sales rose for both Conagra Brands Inc and Pinnacle Foods Inc, two key rivals, according to the data. Conagra’s volumes were up about 10 percent in March, compared with a year ago.
Nestle's retail sales have started to pick up, but are still well below last year’s levels, Bernstein said.
INEXPENSIVE AND EASY 
Frozen food is a relatively small part of Nestle's sprawling portfolio, which also includes Nescafe instant coffee and Pure Life bottled water. It is one of the reasons some investors have called on it to sell the business, saying it would free the Swiss company to focus on more important or higher-growth businesses. 
""Nestle will never be able to convince me that management attention on a business like frozen is the same as what they're giving to high-growth businesses,"" said one Nestle investor, who declined to be named.
Frozen meals and pizza accounted for 14 percent of Nestle USA's $27 billion sales in 2016, or around 4 percent of the company's global sales of about $89.35 billion. More recent figures were not available.
Instead of divesting the business, Nestle joined other food makers in revamping its product line to win over a new generation of consumers. Frozen food aisles, once dominated by frozen pepperoni pizzas and meat lasagna, now feature meals with trendy ingredients such as cauliflower and quinoa.
The newer entrees cater to a wider variety of cultures and dietary requirements, including people who eat gluten-free, organic or want antibiotic-free meat. They also offer a relatively inexpensive meal choice for younger, cash-strapped shoppers.
""Something as simple as buying frozen food is really just symptomatic of the trends we're seeing at large,"" said Allie Aguilera, Policy and Government Affairs Manager at Young Invincibles, a Washington D.C.-based advocacy group.
""When you're seeing $400 dollars come out of each paycheck to pay a student loan, that's certainly going to impact your ability to go grocery shopping in a way that people more traditionally used to.""
Rachel McCarthy, a 26-year-old translator based in Austin, Texas, is among those sought-after millennials turning to frozen meals. Over the past year, she has started buying more Nestle Lean Cuisine entrees, in part because of tight finances.
""They're inexpensive and require no prep,"" McCarthy wrote in a Twitter message. ""I make $30,000 a year and have lots of student debt that I'm trying to pay off while also trying to afford to live in Austin where rent prices are rising.""
To ensure it can also cater to wealthier millennials, willing to pay more for higher-end ingredients, Nestle plans to roll out its frozen bowl brand Wildscape to 3,000 stores around the country in the coming weeks. The bowls have taken over a year to develop using millennial focus groups. 
Thomas Russo, whose firm Gardner Russo & Gardner has a stake worth more than $1 billion, said he was confident that the company would deliver on the frozen food business, despite the recent supply chain issues.

But, he added: ""It's conceivable that they've taken their eye off the ball temporarily.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) could see A$35 billion in investor outflows due to the hit to its reputation from board-level misconduct, analysts at Macquarie Group Ltd (AX:MQA) said on Friday, sending shares in the Australian wealth manager to a seven-year low.
Macquarie analysts forecast the net outflows from wealth management over the next four years, equivalent to about 27 percent of assets under management, after an independent inquiry found the firm had engaged in deceptive conduct. 
The broker downgraded the stock rating to ""neutral"" from ""outperform"" and lowered its price target to A$4.30 from A$5.65.
AMP shares were down 6.8 percent in morning trading to A$3.69 ($2.78), their lowest level since 2011, while the broader market (AXJO) was trading slightly higher.
""We were previously forecasting ongoing margin compression, given AMP’s higher than peer starting point on fees,"" Macquarie analysts wrote in a report to clients. ""However, we’ve accelerated our margin erosion in earlier years, as fee pressure will likely intensify."" 
An AMP spokeswoman did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. 
The Sydney-based fund manager faced an investor revolt at its annual meeting on Thursday, amid allegations it charged fees for no service, doctored an independent report and lied to regulators.
Interim Executive Chairman Mike Wilkins, appointed after predecessor Craig Meller resigned in April in response to the scandal, told the meeting some customers were closing their accounts and there had been an increase in ""withdrawal requests"". 
AMP earlier reported A$200 million in outflows at its core wealth management business during the three months to the end of March, but said assets under management at its funds management and banking units had increased. 
S&P Global warned last week that AMP's credit worthiness could be downgraded if the scandal impacted its core wealth management business or raised the risk of fines and legal action.

The company said on Friday that Masamichi Kogai will step down and be replaced by current vice president Akira Marumoto, 60, who now oversees operations in the Americas. The changes are effective June 26 after Mazda's annual shareholders' meeting. 
Kogai, who became Mazda's president and CEO in 2013, will be following the footsteps of his two immediate predecessors who also held the top job for five years each. He will still be with the automaker and become its chairman, the company said.
Mazda has had a six-year run of rising vehicle sales. With global annual sales of around 1.6 million vehicles, it is seeking to expand, particularly in North America, its biggest market which accounts for nearly 30 percent of total sales.
Earlier this year, it announced that it would invest in a new, $1.6 billion plant in the U.S. state of Alabama as a joint venture with Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203). 
But as one of Japan's smaller automakers, it faces growing costs to stay competitive in an industry which is being disrupted by new technologies, including self-driving cars and electric vehicles.
Mazda and Toyota are jointly developing affordable electric vehicles, pooling resources to better compete in the race for new car technologies. As part of this partnership announced last year, Toyota has taken a 5 percent stake in its smaller rival.

Last month, Mazda forecast a 28 percent drop in full-year operating profit, hurt by a stronger yen as well as higher spending.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares rallied on Friday as investors' appetite for riskier assets got a boost from soft U.S. inflation, which helped alleviate worries of faster rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
Markets were also cheered by a further easing in tensions on the Korean Peninsula, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12 for talks on its nuclear weapons program.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.7 percent to near three-week highs with broad-based gains across all sectors. Japan's Nikkei climbed 1.2 percent. 
But spreadbetters indicated the upbeat mood was unlikely to last, with FTSE futures down a bit and E-Minis for the S&P500 a touch softer.
Most emerging Asian currencies were buoyant as the dollar eased after Thursday's slower-than-expected April consumer price gain. 
The soft figures followed payrolls numbers last week which pointed to sluggish wage growth.
The two data sets meant ""inflation may be rising but not so rapidly that the Fed would have to take aggressive actions to keep the economy from overheating,"" said James McGlew, analyst at Perth-based stock broker Argonaut. 
A recent shakeout in global markets, partly stoked by Sino-U.S. trade tensions, has also eased, while money managers expect the relatively low global rates that have fueled a 'Goldilocks' boom in stock markets will remain in place for some time.
""While inflation is continuing to trend up, it's only happening slowly. So Goldilocks continues,"" Shane Oliver, chief investment manager at AMP, said in a note.
Indeed, a key measure of expected market swings, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, has fallen very close to levels last seen in early January when stock markets were buoyant. 
GEOPOLITICS
While North Korea has come off the boil for now, geopolitical concerns still remain as the U.S. and China continue skirmishing over trade and tensions rise in the Middle East.
""Trump still needs President Xi (Jinping) and China's support in dealing with North Korea and this will be his priority in the short term,"" economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) wrote in a note to clients. 
""Once the meeting is finished, trade may return to the fore."" 
The United States and China have locked horns over import tariffs after Trump announced hefty duties on Chinese goods, provoking a tit-for-tat response from Beijing. 
""It is notable that in line with this view, the U.S. has extended hearings over China tariffs, drawing out the process,"" they added.
U.S. and Chinese officials will meet in Washington for a second round of trade talks next week, after apparently making little progress in discussions in Beijing earlier this month. 
Currency markets were largely muted during Asian trading. 
The dollar index was up 0.2 percent after falling the most since late March on Thursday.
Investors trimmed their expectations for four Fed rate hikes after inflation data showed U.S. price pressures remained weak. The Fed has already raised rates once this year and is widely expected to go two more times in 2018.
The British pound inched above a four-month low of $1.3457 touched on Thursday after the BoE held key borrowing costs. It was last at $1.3505. 
The recent slowing in price growth in major economies has boosted expectations that most central banks except the Fed will continue their massive bond-buying programs to keep policy stimulatory.
The euro was a tad lower at $1.1893. The Japanese yen gained mildly to be last at 109.29 per dollar.
Malaysian markets were closed Friday but its newly appointed Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad emerged with key election pledges including repealing an unpopular goods and services tax and restoring a petrol subsidy. 
Ratings agency Moody's said some campaign promises would be ""credit negative"" for Malaysia. 
Such concerns pushed up the cost of insuring against a Malaysia default, with the country's 5-year credit default swap price at its highest since early June 2017 at 95.090 basis points.
In commodities markets, spot gold slipped 0.1 percent to $1,319.33 an ounce.
Oil prices eased but stayed near multi-year peaks amid supply concerns after Trump withdrew from an Iranian nuclear deal and reinstated sanctions.

262,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2018 05:46AM ET</span>",China's multi-story hog hotels elevate industrial farms to new levels,"By Dominique Patton
YAJI MOUNTAIN, China (Reuters) - On Yaji Mountain in southern China, they are checking in the sows a thousand head per floor in high-rise ""hog hotels"". 
Privately owned agricultural company Guangxi Yangxiang Co Ltd is running two seven-floor sow breeding operations, and is putting up four more, including one with as many as 13 floors that will be the world's tallest building of its kind. 
Hog farms of two or three floors have been tried in Europe. Some are still operating, others have been abandoned, but few new ones have been built in recent years, because of management difficulties and public resistance to large, intensive farms. 
Now, as China pushes ahead with industrialization of the world's largest hog herd, part of a 30-year effort to modernize its farm sector and create wealth in rural areas, companies are experimenting with high-rise housing for pigs despite the costs. The ""hotels"" show how far some breeders are willing to go as China overhauls its farming model. 
""There are big advantages to a high-rise building,"" said Xu Jiajing, manager of Yangxiang's mountain-top farm. 
""It saves energy and resources. The land area is not that much but you can raise a lot of pigs."" 
Companies like Yangxiang are pumping more money into the buildings - about 30 percent more than on single-story modern farms - even as hog prices in China hold at an eight-year low. 
For some, the investments are too risky. Besides low prices that have smaller operations culling sows or re-thinking expansion plans, there is worry about diseases spreading through such intensive operations. 
But success for high-rise pig farms in China could have implications across densely populated, land-scarce Asia, as well as for equipment suppliers. 
""We see an increasing demand for two- or three-level buildings,"" said Peter van Issum, managing director of Microfan, a Dutch supplier that designed Yangxiang's ventilation system. 
Microfan also supplied a three-storey breeding operation, Daedeok JongDon GGP Farm, in South Korea. 
""The higher ones are still an exception, but the future might change rapidly,"" van Issum said. 
HIGH-RISE HOGS
Yaji Mountain seems an unlikely location for a huge breeding farm. Up a narrow road, away from villages, massive concrete pig buildings overlook a valley of dense forest that Yangxiang plans to develop as a tourist attraction. 
The site, however, is relatively close to Guigang, a city with a river port and waterway connections to the Pearl River Delta, one of the world's most densely populated regions. 
While Beijing is encouraging more livestock production in China's grain basket in the northeast, many worry that farms there will struggle to get fresh pork safely to big cities thousands of miles away. 
That has helped push some farm investments to southern provinces like Guangxi and Fujian, where land is hilly but much closer to many of China's biggest cities. 
Yangxiang will house 30,000 sows on its 11-hectare site by year-end, producing as many as 840,000 piglets annually. That will likely make it the biggest, most-intensive breeding farm globally. A more typical large breeding farm in northern China would have 8,000 sows on around 13 hectares. 
In Fujian province, Shenzhen Jinxinnong Technology Co Ltd also plans to invest 150 million yuan ($24 million) in two five-story sow farms in Nanping. Two other companies are building high-rise hog farms in Fujian as well, according to an equipment firm involved in the projects. 
Thai livestock-to-retail conglomerate CP Foods is also building four six-story pig units with local firm Zhejiang Huatong Meat Products Co in Yiwu, a Chinese city near the large populations around Shanghai. 
HIGH-TECH COMPLEXITY
Yangxiang spent 16,000 yuan per sow on its new farm, about 500 million yuan total, not including the cost of the pigs. 
Building upwards means higher costs and greater complexity, such as for piping feed into buildings, said Xue Shiwei, vice chief operations officer at Pipestone Livestock Technology Consultancy, a Chinese unit of a U.S. farm management company. 
""It would save on land but increase the complexity of the structure, and costs for concrete or steel would be higher,"" he said. 
Health concerns also raise costs, because the risk of rampant disease - an ever-present problem in China's livestock sector - is higher with more animals under one roof. 
Even two-story farms in Europe have sparked worries that pigs will receive less care, said Irene Camerlink, an animal welfare expert at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna who has worked with Chinese farms. 
Any outbreak of disease could lead to extensive culling, she said. 
Farm manager Xu said Yangxiang reduces the risk of disease by managing each floor separately, with staff working on the same floor every day. New sows are introduced to a building on the top floor, and are then moved by elevator to an assigned level, where they remain. 
The ventilation system is designed to prevent air from circulating between floors or to other buildings. Air enters through ground channels and passes through ventilation ducts on each level. The ducts are connected to a central exhaust on the roof, with powerful extraction fans pulling the air through filters and pushing it out of 15-meter high chimneys. 
A waste treatment plant is still under construction on Yaji Mountain to handle the site's manure. After treatment, the liquid will be sprayed on the surrounding forest, and solids sold to nearby farms as organic fertilizer. 
The project's additional equipment - much of it imported - to reduce disease, environmental impact and labor costs, significantly increased Yangxiang's spending, the company said. 
But after testing other models, Yangxiang concluded the multi-story building was best. Others are less convinced. 
""We need time to see if this model is do-able,"" said Xue of the farm management firm, adding that he would not encourage clients to opt for ""hog hotels"". 
""There will be many new, competing ideas (about how to raise pigs in China),"" Xue said, including high-rise farms. 

Eventually, ""a suitable model will emerge.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors are wavering on one of their favorite bets of the last year, walloping emerging-market stocks and hunkering down in short-term bonds.
Funds offered in the United States but invested in shares in emerging markets recorded $870 million in withdrawals, the most since November 2016, during the week ended May 9, research service Lipper said on Thursday.
The risk-averse move in emerging markets was paired with a rush into short-term debt as U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies.
""People decided to park some of that money,"" said Tom Roseen, head of research services for Thomson Reuters Lipper.
Emerging markets have been on their hottest run since their relief rally in 2009 after the apex of the global financial crisis. Over the last 16 months, the funds have pulled in nearly $67 billion, according to Lipper.
Rising oil prices should be helping the developing markets, which include some of the biggest crude producers, yet May is on pace to deliver their first month of withdrawals of 2018.
Recent days brought news including Argentina's move to seek financing from the International Monetary Fund to calm volatile markets. That adds to pressures including the trade conflict between the United States and China.
U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday said interest rate hikes the Fed has planned may not pose as big a risk for emerging-market economies as many have thought.
Rising rates make bonds more attractive to foreign buyers, who sell assets in other currencies to buy dollar-denominated Treasuries.
That helps lift the greenback, making it harder for emerging market countries to repay debts or import goods priced in dollars. The trade-weighted U.S. currency is up more than 3 percent over the last month.
Rising rates have helped short-dated debt buyers. The notes now offer plumper yields and in general lack the interest-rate sensitivity of longer-dated bonds. Investors can also use the bonds to hide from greater volatility in stocks.
Corporate bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on the short-term segment of the market pulled in $1.1 billion during the week, the most new cash for the category since September 2017, Lipper data showed.
Investors are also rewarding smaller U.S.-listed companies seen as sheltered from trade disputes and benefiting from corporate tax cuts. Small-cap funds tracked by Lipper pulled in $1.2 billion during the week, a fifth straight week of inflows.

266,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 05:30PM ET</span>",U.S. senator offers bill targeting Chinese industry,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio announced legislation on Thursday that would bar the sale of ""sensitive"" technology to China and hike some duties and taxes, in the latest move by U.S. lawmakers to clamp down on what they regard as Beijing's efforts to steal U.S. intellectual property.
Rubio, a Republican member of the Foreign Relations Committee, unveiled the ""Fair Trade with China Enforcement Act,"" which among other things would bar the sale of national security sensitive technology and intellectual property, and increase taxes on multinational corporations' income from China.
It would also prepare duties on, and cap Chinese investor shareholding in U.S. companies producing goods targeted by China's ""Made in China 2025"" initiative to catch up with rivals like the United States and Germany in industries such as robotics, aerospace and clean-energy cars.
""How America responds to the growing threats posed by China is the single most important geopolitical issue of our time, and will define the 21st century,"" Rubio said in a statement introducing the bill.
The legislation would bar the U.S. government or contractors from purchasing telecommunications equipment or services Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] and ZTE Corp (SZ:000063), Chinese companies that are among the world's major telecommunications equipment manufacturers.
Members of the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump's administration have pressured U.S. companies to not sell Huawei or ZTE products, saying they could be used to spy on Americans.

The two companies have denied such allegations.

268,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 05:20PM ET</span>","U.S., UAE crack down on network for smuggling funds to elite Iran group","By Lesley Wroughton
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States imposed sanctions on Thursday against six individuals and three companies it said were funneling millions of dollars to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force, just days after President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
The Treasury Department, acting with the United Arab Emirates where front companies were located, said it had disrupted the large network's operations, and accused Iran's central bank of helping the group access U.S. dollars held in foreign banks to sidestep Western sanctions.
""The Iranian regime and its central bank have abused access to entities in the UAE to acquire U.S. dollars to fund the IRGC-QF's malign activities, including to fund and arm its regional proxy groups, by concealing the purpose for which the U.S. dollars were acquired,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
The IRGC is by far Iran's most powerful security entity and has control over large stakes in Iran's economy and huge influence in its political system. The Quds Force is an elite unit in charge of the IRGC's overseas operations.
The six individuals and three entities, including front companies for the IRGC-QF and currency traders, were sanctioned under U.S. regulations targeting specially designated global terrorist suspects and Iranian financial activity, the Treasury said.
The UAE said later it had placed the same companies and people on its list of terrorist and terrorist organizations doing business with the IRGC-QF. 
The crackdown comes as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pushes allies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East to pressure Iran to return to negotiations over its nuclear and missile programs.
Trump's decision has given grace periods of 90 days to six months for companies to wind down their trade with Iran. 
The Treasury Department said one of the companies sanctioned was also involved in retrieving oil revenue from foreign bank accounts held by the Iranian central bank for IRGC-QF activities.
In February 2015, Reuters reported that at least $1 billion in cash had been smuggled into Iran despite sanctions. Before it reached Iran, the cash was passed through money changers and front companies in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, sources told Reuters. 

Before the 2015 nuclear deal was reached, front companies had mushroomed in Dubai to facilitate payments to Iran. The use of multiple front companies, which bought dollars from currency traders in Dubai and Iraq, was preferred as it concealed the overall size of the dollar-purchasing operation.

272,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 05:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Hedge fund Third Point seeks to launch 'blank-check' company - sources,"By Joshua Franklin and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Daniel Loeb's activist hedge fund Third Point LLC is in talks with investment banks about launching a ""blank check"" company that would raise money in an initial public offering to pursue an acquisition, according to people familiar with the matter.
The new investment vehicle, referred to on Wall Street as a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), would be the first of its kind to be raised by an activist hedge fund such as Third Point, which acquires stakes in public companies to pressure them to pursue changes or seek board representation.
A SPAC uses proceeds from its IPO, together with borrowed funds, to acquire companies that are usually privately held. Investors in the IPO do not know in advance which company a SPAC will buy, although many outline in advance the sectors they want to be active in. It is not clear what kind of companies Third Point's SPAC would target.
Third Point is in talks with investment banks about arranging the SPAC's IPO later this year, which could raise hundreds of millions of dollars, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. 
New York-based Third Point declined to comment.
The SPAC is an attempt by Third Point to diversify its revenue stream, as returns from its flagship hedge fund, which has returned 15.6 percent on average over its lifespan, have flattened this year amid jitters in the stock market.
Founded by Loeb in 1995, Third Point has close to $18 billion in assets under management. Its investments have included Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Nestle SA (SIX:NESN), Sony Corp (T:6758) and Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Inc.
Before sponsoring its own SPAC, Third Point invested in Nomad Foods Limited, a SPAC launched by consumer industry veterans Martin Franklin and Noam Gottesman in 2014. William Ackman's activist hedge fund Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management LP also invested in Nomad Foods. 
Typically, SPACs allow investors to redeem their common stock at the IPO price if they disagree with a proposed acquisition. This has traditionally put off long-term institutional investors but made them popular with hedge funds, willing to take a bet on what a SPAC's deal could be.

To address this, some SPACs now seek to launch with the backing of cornerstone investors who have committed not to redeem their money if they disapprove of a proposed acquisition, giving the SPAC more financing certainty to be able to go after the companies it wants.

273,By Investing.com,"<span>May 10, 2018 04:59PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets Friday, May 11.
1. Nvidia to hit new highs (again)? 
Shares of Nvidia fell in afterhours trade on Thursday despite the chipmaker’s first-quarter report beating on both the top and bottom lines, supported by strong growth in its datacentre and gaming divisions.
Nvidia reported earnings of $1.98 per share on a GAAP basis on revenue of $3.21 billion, beating analysts' consensus estimates for earnings of $1.46 per share on revenue of $2.89 billion.
The company guided second-quarter sales of about $3.1 billion, which was above a consensus estimate of $2.95 billion.
Nvidia's gaming revenue rose 68% year over year to $1.72 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.65 billion consensus.
Datacenter revenue rose 71% to $701 million, missing consensus estimates of $703 million.
Shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 2.23% to $254.33 after-hours on Thursday after the chipmaker hit an all-time high of $260.50
2. Consumer Sentiment Data Eyed 
Consumer sentiment data and a speech by St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard will round off the week of mostly negative economic data, which included a duo of weaker wholesale and consumer inflation reports.
James Bullard, a non FOMC voter, is expected to deliver a speech at 08:30 am ET on Friday, a little over week after the Federal Reserve left its benchmark rate unchanged and delivered an upbeat assessment on the U.S. economy and inflation.
The subdued inflation reports seen this week, however, had little impact on expectations for a June rate hike, which remained at 100%, according to investing.com’s fed rate monitor tool.
Michigan’s preliminary consumer expectations due 10:00 am, is expected to show a reading of 88.0 for May, while consumer sentiment is forecast to show a reading of 98.5, down slightly from 98.8 seen in the previous month.
The dollar fell sharply against its rivals on Thursday as GBP/USD pared some of its losses after the Bank of England slashed its growth forecasts after revealing an unchanged rate decision.
3. Geopolitical tensions to continue to overshadow US rig count data?
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand.
Data last week showed the number of U.S. oil rigs rose for the fifth week in a row last week, pointing to a possible expansion in domestic output.
Yet, geopolitical tensions and the prospect of lower global crude supplies - as countries prepare to shun Iran exports ahead of pending US sanctions - have overshadowed rising US rig counts.
Rising geopolitical tensions could continue to underpin the price of oil as Iran and Israel skirmishes in Syria intensified over recent days.
Crude futures settled higher on Thursday, shrugging off signs of higher U.S. supplies."

278,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 06:39PM ET</span>",News Corp revenue beats as digital push pays off,"(Reuters) - News Corp (O:NWSA), controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, topped analysts' estimates for quarterly revenue on Thursday as the company benefited from a rise in online subscriptions and strong performance in its digitial real estate business. 
The company's shares recovered from a near 2 percent drop to be flat in extended trading after executives on a call pointed to improving advertising trends in the third quarter, despite challenging print.
On the call, company executives also highlighted gains from the recent deal with Australian telecommunication and media company Telstra Corp Ltd (AX:TLS). 
News Corp and Telstra in March agreed to combine Foxtel and FOX SPORTS Australia, with the U.S. company holding a 65 percent stake in the combined entity.
""The Foxtel-Fox Sports Australia consolidation is also expected to make circulation and subscription revenues the biggest revenue stream for News Corp for the first time,"" Chief Executive Officer Robert Thomson said on the call.
""This should give us more protection against the vicissitudes of our volatile advertising market."" 
Revenue at the company's digital real estate unit, which houses real estate websites such as realtor.com and doorsteps.com, surged 27 percent to $279 million in the third quarter. 
Average growth in digital subscriptions was more than 20 percent for Wall Street Journal, The Times and Sunday Times and The Australian in the first three months of 2018.
Total revenue rose 5.8 percent to $2.09 billion, topping estimates of $1.99 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Net loss available to stockholders widened to $1.13 billion, or $1.94 per share, due to charges of $1.2 billion, largely related to write-downs following the deal with Telstra.

Excluding items, the company earned 6 cents per share, in line with analysts' estimates.

(Reuters) - File sharing and storage company Dropbox Inc (O:DBX) beat Wall Street expectations for quarterly results and topped estimates for paying subscribers in its first financial report as a publicly traded company.
However, the company's shares, which had gained 10 percent this week ahead of the earnings, slipped 4 percent in extended trading on Thursday. 
The San Francisco-based company said the number of paying subscribers surged 23.7 percent to 11.5 million at the end of March, topping analysts' average estimate of 11.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
The company, which started as a free service to share and store photos, music and other large files, has worked to build up its enterprise software offering.
Dropbox reported average revenue per user (ARPU) of $114.3 in the first quarter, beating analysts' estimate of $110. 
""(ARPU growth) does suggest Dropbox is having success converting individual paid users to business paid users,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Rishi Jaluria said.
The company, which competes with Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google,  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) as well as Box Inc (N:BOX), forecast current-quarter revenue in the range of $328 million and $331 million.
Analysts were expecting revenue of $324.9 million.
""Today's earnings also bode well for existing investors that are still in their lock up period,"" said Minal Hasan, investor at K2 Global, a Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm that invests in startup companies.
Dropbox's quarterly loss widened to $465.5 million, as the company accounted for IPO-related expenses.
The company had a blockbuster debut on March 23 as investors bought into the biggest technology initial public offering in more than a year, with shares closing up more than 35 percent in their first day of trading.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned 8 cents per share, beating estimates of 5 cents.
Total revenue rose 28 percent to $316.3 million, above estimates of $309.2 million.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are bracing for widespread volatility in healthcare stocks on Friday, when U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to give a highly anticipated speech about controlling prescription drug prices.
The S&P 500 healthcare sector has declined about 1 percent in 2018, underperforming the broader S&P 500 by more than two percentage points. Investors say concerns about drug pricing regulations have contributed to pressure on group. 
Trump's speech, delayed from earlier in the year, has injected added anxiety. He has addressed the issue of lowering prices in the past, saying as president-elect in January 2017, for example, that drugmakers were ""getting away with murder"" in what they charge the government for medicines.
“Investors don’t like uncertainty and this speech has created a fair amount of uncertainty,” said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Capital Management. “We don’t really know what is necessarily priced in, what level of detriment to all these industries is priced in.”
Healthcare policy speeches by senior government officials in recent weeks also may have changed the thinking of investors.
“The sense is that the proposals could go a little further than what we have seen in the budget and other places,"" said Ipsita Smolinski, managing director at healthcare research and consulting firm Capitol Street.
The speech could affect a broad group of stocks in the healthcare sector, which makes up 13.6 percent of the S&P 500.
""The president never shies away from fiery rhetoric, and we expect that in his speech he will finger manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), insurers, hospitals, and foreign countries as responsible for high drug costs,"" Height Capital Markets analyst Andrea Harris said in a note.
Harris said she expects ""material headline risk"" to the stocks but that the administration ""will not implement the most material policies that Trump will suggest in the speech in the next two years, if ever.""
The healthcare sector was rallying on Thursday, up 1 percent in afternoon trading against a 0.7 percent gain by the S&P 500. Shares of companies potentially in the cross-hairs of Trump's speech were higher, including pharmaceutical wholesaler  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and drug-benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co.
Some analysts said on Thursday that investors could be becoming less worried about the speech while others said it was hard to predict what Trump might say.
Overall, shares of large pharmaceutical and biotech companies have struggled this year. While companies have endured product or other disappointments, analysts have pointed to concerns about pressures on drug-pricing as a cloud over the stocks.
By contrast, healthcare sectors seen as immune to such pricing concerns - makers of medical devices and research tools - have outperformed. 
Friday's speech may provide some clarity for investors, but the prospect of healthcare and drug pricing being a hot topic heading into the mid-term U.S. congressional elections in November may lead worries about the sector to persist.

""Even if we didn’t have a speech, people would be thinking about November and what may or may not happen and wouldn’t be investing with the same gusto that they otherwise would,” Funtleyder said.

297,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 06:38PM ET</span>",Embraer breakup complications are delaying its deal with Boeing: sources,"By Tatiana Bautzer and Brad Haynes
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The tricky work of divvying up the three business segments of Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) has been delaying an agreement to combine operations with  Boeing Co  (N:BA), three people with knowledge of the matter said this week.
The two planemakers announced last month that they were in talks to set up a new company focused on commercial aviation, excluding Embraer's defense division and possibly its business jet unit.
The companies have won the support of Brazil's government for such a deal, but the maneuver has created other headaches, according to the sources, who spoke to Reuters anonymously due to the sensitivity of talks.
Negotiators are picking through the details of long-term service contracts between the companies and working on how to distribute Embraer's thousands of engineers, many of whom have migrated between military and civilian projects during their careers.
Asked for comment, Boeing referred to remarks by Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg on Wednesday, when he said talks were making progress, but the Embraer deal was not a ""must do.""
Embraer representatives did not respond to a request for comment.
Embraer shares in Sao Paulo erased gains after the Reuters report, closing 2.6 percent lower on Thursday.
The decision to leave Embraer's defense operations separated has helped to overcome concerns about sovereign control of Embraer's military programs by the Brazilian government, which holds a strategic veto over the deal, but it has not produced a final agreement as quickly as some expected.
""I'm quite optimistic,"" said Defense Minister Joaquim Silva e Luna, who is responsible for the task force overseeing the deal, when asked about the negotiation. ""It is in advanced stages and should be resolved this year.""
Boeing's original proposal, a straightforward acquisition, could have been wrapped up by now, but it has proven more challenging to design an offer that leaves Embraer standing as a financially robust company focused on defense, the sources said.
Embraer's 70- to 130-seat E-Jets, which compete with the C-Series program designed by  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and run by Airbus SE (PA:AIR), account for about 60 percent of the Brazilian firm's revenue and nearly all of its operating profit.
The company's defense division has barely turned a profit in recent years, since Brazil's government slashed military spending in an effort to close a gaping budget deficit.
Embraer has also been losing money on a fresh line-up of business jets, as the executive aviation market stagnates. 

The companies have still not reached a final decision on whether to include the unit with the commercial jet division in the new company, in which Boeing would own a roughly 80 percent stake, according to two of the sources.

298,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 02:33PM ET</span>","Bank of America affirms gun pledge, hints at Remington loan exit","By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said on Thursday it was standing by its pledge to stop financing civilian assault weapons and suggested it may be preparing to exit a loan for gun maker Remington Outdoor Corp that sparked criticism of the lender.
The statement by Vice Chairman Anne Finucane follows a Reuters report on Sunday that the lender was participating in a $193 million credit facility that will help stabilize Remington's business when it emerges from bankruptcy this month.
After the report, activists including student gun control activist David Hogg were critical of the bank and took to Twitter using the #BoycottBankofAmerica hashtag. Hogg was a student at the high school in Parkland, Florida, where a February shooting helped touch off a renewed push for stricter U.S. gun control.
""Let me be clear - we are not changing our policy to end financing of the manufacture of these military style firearms,"" said Finucane, who emphasized the policy change was on a go-forward basis. 
She said the Remington financing was in the works for months before the firearms policy was announced on April 10. 
A bank spokesman confirmed the statement, which took the form of a letter that Bank of America distributed in response to inquiries about its gun policy. 
Bank of America is providing $43.2 million of the credit facility, with the rest coming from six other banks. 
The banks have committed to providing the credit, and when Remington exits bankruptcy the credit facility will be established to replace an existing facility of the same size that Remington used to get through its Chapter 11.
The letter also indicated Bank of America may be preparing to exit the Remington credit facility soon after it is financed by selling its participation, as the agreement allows.
""Remington is aware of the policy that we subsequently announced, and that policy will dictate our future actions after the bankruptcy proceedings conclude,"" said Finucane's letter.
Bank of America could have faced potential legal action and damages if it had backed out of its commitment to provide the Remington financing, particularly if the company failed to emerge bankruptcy.
In addition, the bank was concerned about its reputation for standing by lending commitments if it reneged on its Remington financing, according to a source familiar with the bank's thinking.

Remington makes the Bushmaster rifle that was used in the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in which 20 children were killed.

299,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",Tax cut helping turn U.S. small caps into unlikely source of safety,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Republican-led corporate tax cut is helping turn the shares of smaller publicly-traded companies in the United States into an unexpected source of stability as the broader stock market wobbles. 
Typically, the shares of small and mid cap companies in the Russell 2000 index (RUT) are more volatile than the large cap S&P 500 (SPX), in part due to their concentration on the U.S. economy and smaller financial cushions. 
Yet since concerns about rising inflation and an escalating trade war stopped the broad U.S. stock market in its tracks after the S&P 500 hit record highs in January, the Russell 2000 has held on to more of its gains. It dropped 0.4 percent from its high of the year, compared with a 5.5 percent decline in the S&P 500. 
""When you look at the remainder of 2018 and especially going into 2019, the forward expectations are that the small cap universe is going to see accelerating earnings growth, whereas the large caps in general are still going to be growing but they won't see a benefit as magnified,"" said Martin Jarzebowski, a portfolio manager at the Federated Clover Small Cap Value fund (O:VSFAX).
Fund managers and analysts say that small companies are benefiting in part from December's tax cut, which slashed the average tax rate among small cap companies from 35 percent to 21 percent.
Large cap companies, which earn a greater percentage of their revenues abroad, saw their effective tax rates fall from roughly 27.5 percent to 22.5 percent, according to estimates from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). 
So far, companies in the Russell 2000 have paid $9.2 billion less in taxes this quarter compared with the last quarter of 2017, before the tax bill passed, according to estimates from Sandy Villere, a fund manager at New Orleans-based Villere Funds. 
Jarzebowski said he has been focusing more of his portfolio on small cap financial companies seeing the greatest benefit from lower taxes and low unemployment, such as First Midwest Bancorp Inc (O:FMBI) and  Chemical Financial  Corp (O:CHFC), both of which are up approximately 3 percent for the year to date. 
Small companies are also improving their margins by an average of 0.5 percent as they spend less on buybacks and more on reinvesting, said Venu Krishna, a strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC). That, in turn, should provide a cushion for small caps even if wider volatility continues, he said.
""You are going to see more respectable earnings throughout the year, even after the benefits of the tax cut are factored away,"" he said. 
The volatility has shrunk trailing price-to-earnings valuations by 6 percent since the Russell 2000 hit a record high in January, Krishna added, leaving small caps both cheaper and less risky at a time when companies are growing their pre-tax earnings by an average of 14 percent year-on-year. 
Eric Marshall, a fund manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital, is moving more of his portfolio into small cap retail companies that are trading at depressed multiples. The retail sector is expected to see a significant benefit from the tax cut because the majority of revenues are domestic. 
""For the most part the tax cuts are already factored in by the market and if you see a company beat estimates by just a penny or two they're not getting rewarded for that,"" he said. ""We're looking for areas where there's top-line growth and increased consumption in places you haven't seen that for a while.""
Portfolio holding  American Eagle Outfitters  Inc (N:AEO), for instance, recently hit a five-year high, thanks in large part to the growth of its Aerie lingerie brand that is taking market share away from L Brands' (N:LB) Victoria's Secret. 

""You had the market pretty much leaving retail for dead, and that's one place where we are seeing a lot of value,"" Marshall said.

301,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 10, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>","Mahathir Reassures Business, Aims to Boost Malaysia Stock Market","(Bloomberg) -- Mahathir Mohamad said he’d lead a business-friendly administration and seek ways to boost Malaysia’s stock market in his first remarks after being sworn in as prime minister.
In a late-night briefing on Thursday, the 92-year-old politician said he’d focus on growing the economy and reducing debt, adding that some terms may need to be renegotiated. He said Malaysia would seek friendly ties with other countries as a trading nation.
“Our concern over the economy is the main thing,” Mahathir told reporters. “We would like to tell the business people to push up the value of the stock market. And on the currency, there is no cause to devalue the ringgit. We should ensure this.”
Mahathir’s comments appeared designed to counter worries among investors who had bet that former leader Najib Razak would stay in power. The iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF based on the nation’s stocks, which fell as much as 9.5 percent after the vote, rose 4.3 percent after Mahathir’s remarks on Thursday. Malaysia’s financial markets are closed until Monday.
“I’m fully confident that in the long term this transition will be good for financial markets in Malaysia,” CIMB Group Chairman Nazir Razak, Najib’s brother, told Bloomberg TV interview on Thursday. “Malaysia is going to prove that we can do a political transition smoothly and maybe financial markets and corporate Malaysia will become more detached from the political sphere.”
Mahathir, who ran Malaysia for 22 years, became prime minister again a day after his disparate coalition ended the ruling coalition’s 61-year grip on power. Najib congratulated Mahathir late on Thursday and said he’s willing to help with a smooth transition of power.
The conciliatory words came after a bitter campaign in which the two leaders traded personal insults. Mahathir effectively came out of retirement to challenge Najib, who endured public anger over a goods-and-services tax and a money laundering scandal involving hundreds of millions of dollars siphoned from state investment firm 1MDB.
While Najib denied wrongdoing, Mahathir lambasted him as a “thief” on the campaign trail. On Thursday, Mahathir said he thought he could recover most funds from 1MDB, and if Najib did anything wrong “he will have to face the consequences.”
Mahathir’s coalition had expected him to serve as interim prime minister until long-time opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim is released from prison in June. To be eligible to take power, Anwar would have to secure a royal pardon and then win a by-election for a parliamentary seat.
Mahathir said Thursday he would push for a full pardon for Anwar, but declined to give a timeframe for handing over power to his former deputy. Mahathir said the government would need to leverage his experience for as long as needed.
“There is a lot of work to be done,” he said. “We need to attend to this mess as soon as possible.”
Mahathir’s coalition has pledged to scrap the GST within his first 100 days in office, and reintroduce fuel subsidies. If implemented with no other changes, those moves could narrow the government’s revenue base and be credit negative for Malaysia’s sovereign, according to Anushka Shah, a senior analyst at Moody’s Investors Service.
The vote showed that Mahathir still knows how to win elections. The victory was dominant: He swept traditional government strongholds like Johor, Kedah and Negeri Sembilan and neutralized Najib’s advantage in the Borneo states of Sabah and Sarawak.
“This has been a Malaysian tsunami, across the board and the country,” said Bridget Welsh, a political scientist at John Cabot University in Rome who specializes in Southeast Asia. “Mahathir was a game changer. But it also took Najib. They wanted Najib gone.”
What comes next is unclear. Mahathir helms an unwieldy four-party coalition that includes Malaysia’s largest ethnic Chinese party. He said the bloc would meet on Friday to discuss forming a cabinet.
“I have to manage four presidents of four different parties,” Mahathir said of his coalition. “It’s going to be a headache.”

302,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 10, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Shorting China Stocks From New York Could Get Easier After MSCI,"(Bloomberg) -- Short selling could get a little bit easier in China after the country’s domestic stocks join MSCI Inc.’s big index club.
MSCI’s inclusion of onshore-listed Chinese shares next month will be a step toward increasing the pool of stock that’s available to borrow. Share lending in the country is virtually non-existent, compared to the U.S. or Europe where the practice often makes up about 20 percent of daily turnover. In just a few weeks, some $1.9 trillion of index-tracking money linked to MSCI is about to own equities in China for the first time.
Formidable obstacles currently face international investors wanting to hedge or short yuan-denominated shares. They can use a stock link with Hong Kong, though only certain members of the city’s exchange can borrow and lend shares through that program. Custodian banks, the firms that most institutional funds will use to clear their assets, are not typically on that list. All short orders need to be flagged and there’s a 1 percent daily limit on any stock.
The result: overseas investors haven’t sold a single Shanghai or Shenzhen stock short via the link with Hong Kong in the past month, exchange data show.
“The biggest issue with short selling in China is the availability of stock to borrow,” said Seth Fischer, chief investment officer of Oasis Management Co., a Hong Kong-based hedge fund. “MSCI inclusion will likely help improve availability.”
While the demand to borrow A shares -- a tool that’s essential for hedge funds wanting to protect their positions or speculate on price declines -- is likely to rise as the country gradually opens up its financial markets to international investors, the scarcity of stocks on loan has so far limited the practice through official channels like the stock connect.
Short selling gained a bad reputation in China after it was partly blamed for the market’s spectacular crash in 2015, with many leveraged punters betting against the whole market via index futures. Curbs that were put in place at the time largely shut out bearish speculators, similar to what was done in France, Italy, Spain and Belgium to reduce volatility at the height of the European sovereign-debt crisis in 2011.
China’s restrictions on derivatives and short selling mean prospective international investors may find it tricky to hedge. While mom-and-pop investors account for about 80 percent of trading in the country’s $7.6 trillion onshore equity market, MSCI has said that the initial inclusion plan will bring more than $17 billion of foreign institutional money to the Chinese market, increasing to as much as $35 billion once MSCI increases the stock universe.
The government is accelerating capital-market reforms on most fronts. Just in the past few months, it started a debate on dual-class shares, announced plans to introduce CDRs, raised limits for investors buying stocks through Hong Kong, said it will add another stock trading tie-up with London and opened up its local securities joint ventures to Wall Street ownership. That’s a bullish sign for those seeking engagement on securities lending.
“We’ve seen a significant shift in tone in Beijing from September to now,” said Lyndon Chao, head of equities at Asia Securities Industry & Financial Markets Association, a trade group based in Hong Kong. “There’s clearly a willingness from China to open up its capital markets, attract overseas investment and make China compete with the rest of the world. The door appears to be wide open.”
Champions of stock lending say short sellers make markets more efficient and help keep checks on corporate governance -- take Hong Kong as an example -- while also providing another source of income to the asset-management industry. Managers of tracker funds often lend up to a third of their holdings in return for a fee and collateral. Those payments from borrowers contribute to the fund’s returns, giving them extra yield. Asian equities lending generated $1.1 billion in revenues last year, according to IHS Markit Ltd. data.
New York-based MSCI will announce the results of its global index review on May 14, with all A-share additions effective after the close on June 1.
“MSCI is likely to be a catalyst event,” said ASIFMA’s Chao. “Eventually, through the institutionalization of the market when more asset managers, insurers and pension funds start to own China A shares, the supply for securities lending will grow.”

The planned card would carry the Apple Pay brand and could launch early next year, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The iPhone maker will replace its longstanding rewards-card partnership with  Barclays  (L:BARC), the report added.
Goldman Sachs, Apple and Barclays all declined comment.
The news comes as Apple sharpens its focus on its services business that includes the App Store, mobile payments and music streaming. The unit's revenue grew 31 percent to more than $9 billion in the three months ended March 31.
Goldman has been looking to expand its consumer banking business to offset weakness at its trading unit. Last year, the Wall Street bank's executives laid out a goal to generate $5 billion in revenue from new sources, including consumer banking.

In February, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was in talks with Goldman to offer financing to shoppers buying Apple products, including iPhones.

In economic data out Thursday, headline inflation rose 2.5% on an annualized basis in April, up from the prior month’s 2.4% increase, but in line with forecasts.
Core inflation however unexpectedly held steady at 2.1%, surprising expectations for a 2.2% rise.
The Fed tends to focus more on the core data which removes volatile food and energy data. The softer reading helps to allay fears that the Fed will need to lift interest rates more quickly than expected.
Market participants are closely watching inflation data to gauge whether the Fed will become more aggressive on policy tightening. Fed fund futures continue to price the odds of a fourth hike this year in December below the 50% threshold.

341,By Business Insider,"<span>May 10, 2018 09:37AM ET</span>",RBS is swallowing a 'milestone' $4.9 billion fine for its role in the financial crisis — and shares are going up," LONDON — Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) has agreed a fine to settle charges of wrongdoing in the US that contributed to the financial crisis.
 RBS announced on Thursday it has reached a deal with the US Department of Justice to pay a civil penalty of $4.9 billion to settle allegations of misselling mortgage-backed securities in the US between 2005 and 2007. These complex debt products, which were underpinned by bundled of mortgages, were one of the key triggers of the crisis.
$3.4 billion will be covered by existing provisions set aside by the bank to cover the fine and the remaining $1.4 billion will be booked as a second-quarter charge.
 RBS shares jumped as much as 6% at the open in London.
While the share jump may seem counterintuitive, the fine brings resolution to an issue that has long hung over RBS and is also not as bad as some feared. Last year investors worried that the bank  could be hit with a fine as big as $10 billion for its actions in the run-up to the crisis.
RBS CEO Ross McEwan called the settlement ""a milestone moment for the bank.""
""Reaching this settlement in principle with the US Department of Justice will, when finalised, allow us to deal with this significant remaining legacy issue and is the price we have to pay for the global ambitions pursued by this bank before the crisis,"" he said. ""Removing the uncertainty over the scale of this settlement means that the investment case for this bank is much clearer.""
While the settlement has been agreed in principle, RBS said that a legally binding agreement has yet to be signed.

Last quarter, they were snapping up shares 13% more than they were selling.
But much can change in a quarter. In the three months since  Nvidia’s last earnings report, the price of cryptocurrencies has fallen dramatically. Nvidia had found an unexpected boost from would-be crypto miners gobbling up its hardware to mine the digital coins. Now that the craze seems to have died down,  many analysts are worried the demand could fade as well.
Shares have gained 20% since Nvidia's last earnings report in February, which could be behind the selling, Sahill Poddar, Robinhood’s data scientist, told Business Insider in an email.
Short interest — or a measure of bets that a stock will fall — has declined as Nvidia has climbed. It's down 20% since reaching its 52-week high in late January.
Analysts polled by Bloomberg expect Nvidia to report adjusted earnings $1.66 per share on revenue of $2.90 billion. Options contracts imply a 7% move following the earnings report, less than the average 12% 1-day move following earnings.

346,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 09:18AM ET</span>","Walmart Go Back! Some Indian trader, farmer groups decry Flipkart deal","By Aditi Shah and Manoj Kumar
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A day after U.S. retail giant Walmart (N:WMT) struck its largest deal with a big ticket investment in Indian online marketplace Flipkart, a right-wing Hindu group that fears small traders will suffer staged a protest in New Delhi calling for the deal to be scrapped.
Walmart said on Wednesday it would pay some $16 billion for a roughly 77 percent stake in the Indian e-commerce firm, stepping up competition with rival Amazon.com (O:AMZN) in a major growth market.
While Thursday's protest was small and unlikely to affect the deal, such sentiments pose a challenge for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as it prepares to fight an election next year.
For Modi, appeasing small traders and farmers, who are part of the BJP's core constituency, is as important as upholding India's image as a place that welcomes foreign investment. 
Officials have been advised not to comment on the Walmart-Flipkart deal, a senior government official said. The ruling party has previously opposed foreign direct investment in the multi-brand retail sector.
""Politically, the government may find it difficult to digest the deal,"" the official said. 
The Communist Party of India (Marxist) also taunted the Modi government, noting the BJP had decried such investments when it was in the opposition and accusing it of betraying promises. 
Officials in the Prime Minister's office did not respond to calls by Reuters for comment.
According to the deal, Walmart's investment is in Flipkart's online marketplace platform, where foreign investment is allowed. The U.S. company cannot open physical stores in India, according to rules governing the multi-brand retail sector. 
However, Walmart's CEO Doug McMillon told media in New Delhi on Thursday that it was open to the idea of setting up stores via a franchise model in the future. It already operates wholesale stores in the country. 
""We can be very flexible. I think as a company not just in India, but around the world, the concept of franchising isn't out of bounds,"" said McMillon, adding Walmart was not yet ready to make any such announcements.
That could fan fears of some trader and farmer groups, who contend the U.S. company is using the deal as a back-door entry into India's bricks and mortar retail market, and that it could squeeze out small corner shops that dominate Indian retail. 
FRINGE PROTESTS
Some 80 people gathered outside a Delhi hotel holding placards reading ""Walmart Go Back!"" and shouting slogans asking people to ditch imported products for Indian-made goods. Inside the hotel, McMillon was talking to a dozen journalists about the deal. 
""Whoever is protesting also has a story to tell. If you look at our history as a country, there was a history of colonialism. And there is always a fear that you start with trade and then it becomes control,"" said Devangshu Dutta, head of retail consultancy firm Third Eyesight. 
The protesters were from the Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), a nationalist group linked to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of Modi's party. The group has said the deal is against ""national interests"" and will hurt Modi's ""Make in India"" drive.
It has also written to Modi asking the government to intervene.
Separately, a traders' union, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said that it may consider taking legal action against the two companies or lodging a complaint with the country's competition watchdog, depending on how the deal was structured.
Traders say they are most concerned about predatory pricing and steep discounting by e-commerce firms with deep pockets thanks to foreign funding that could edge out smaller rivals.

""Already offline trade is deeply hurt by e-commerce as there is no policy or regulatory mechanism to govern those companies,"" said Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of CAIT. ""It is a free-for-all game and ultimately it is the offline trade which is feeling the pinch.""

347,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 08:16AM ET</span>",European flotations falter as investors hold line on price,"By Dasha Afanasieva and Arno Schuetze
LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - An increasing number of companies are failing to get over the start line in this year's race to the public markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa as investors take a harder line on the price they will pay.
German publisher Springer Nature (DE:SPGG) became the largest European firm to cancel its initial public offering (IPO) this year, and at least 13 others have pulled previously announced IPOs, although 52 still went ahead, an analysis of Thomson Reuters data shows.
Global IPO proceeds rose to $39 billion in the first quarter, the highest since 2014, with the proceeds from European listings more than tripling to $13 billion.
And IPOs in Europe Middle East and Africa have raised $16.5 billion, versus $11.2 billion in the same period last year.
But despite low market volatility (VIX) and a broadly positive economic outlook, this flood of new listings, combined with poor stock market trading performances of several of them, has given investors pause for thought. 
""The market is oversaturated and IPO investors scared off by poor after-market performance of IPOs,"" an equity capital markets banker familiar with the Springer IPO said.
IPOs are historically a stop-and-start market and it is not unusual for companies and their advisers to miss the boat in terms of timing, or to have over-inflated price expectations.
Equity markets have not risen much in 2018: for example the FTSE 100 (FTSE) is down 0.7 percent year to date and the STOXX Europe 600 (STOXX), which represents 90 percent of the freefloat market of the European stock market is up 0.6 percent.
So while many companies in Europe have produced strong results, pricing for buyers and sellers has got out of kilter.
""While stock market indices are flat, good company earnings mean that companies trade on average at 15 times price to earnings, compared to 16 times last year. So investors are asking for higher discounts to buy into IPOs, something sellers are not willing to offer,"" the banker said.
The aftermarket is also playing a role with Swiss-based Ceva Logistics (S:CEVAL), Deutsche Bank's asset management unit DWS (DE:DWSG), Dutch bank NIBC (AS:NIBC) and Spanish real estate company Metrovacesa (MC:MVC) trading down in the days after their debuts.
Others have fared better, but overall gains are limited.
""While overall valuations have come off recent highs due strong corporate earnings, stocks of European companies which floated this year are only up approximately 2 percent on average,"" Christoph Stanger, co-head of equity capital markets in Europe Middle East and Africa at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said.
Equity capital markets bankers, those who advise companies on the pricing, timing and investor appetite for their IPOs, say that the market is not shut to new issuers.
""Investors are subjecting IPOs to strict scrutiny, they are kicking the tires and looking under the bonnet, and they want to make sure that the valuations are attractive enough for a sustainable after-market,"" Craig Coben, vice chairman of global capital markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
ALTERNATIVE AVENUES
Flotations are not the biggest fee earners for equity capital markets bankers, but they drive secondary offerings and are often a bellwether for confidence in the market.
And listings are still being done, with software firm Avast (L:AVAS) trading lower on Thursday after pricing its IPO, the biggest by market capitalization in London since July, at the low end of its offer range.
Others are also in the pipeline, with Blackstone's Middle East-focused education firm GEMs expected in the coming weeks.
""The market has seen an increasing number of cancellations given higher investor scrutiny. Despite this pullback, the market is open for high quality issuers as the recent successful IPO of Siemens Healthineers, the largest year-to-date in Europe, has demonstrated,"" Goldman's Stanger said.
Healthcare unit Siemens Healthineers (DE:SHLG) is trading 18 percent above its March issue price.
Meanwhile companies such as online betting firm Sky Bet have opted for a trade sale, despite lengthy preparations for a listing, while plans for a Frankfurt listing of German home shopping TV network HSE24 have also taken a back seat in favor of a sale, sources told Reuters.
The IPO market wobble has extended beyond developed markets, with cancellations in countries including Russia and Turkey, driven largely by geo-political factors.
Fresh sanctions imposed by the United States on several businessmen, politicians and related companies scuppered the flotations of Russian meat producer Cherkizovo Group and information technology firm IBS Group.
Meanwhile in Turkey, two of the three retail IPOs recently announced have been pulled, weeks before an election which may delay the next opportunity to head to the market. 

Macroeconomic risks, such as the uncertainly caused by U.S.. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, have also weighed on IPO plans, with Turkey's lira to hitting a record low this week.

(Reuters) - Wall Street jumped on Thursday, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) inched closer to a $1 trillion stock market value, as tepid inflation data eased worries of faster U.S. interest rate hikes this year.
Fueled by a $100 billion buyback plan unveiled last week, Apple rose 1.43 percent to a record high close of $190.04, lifting the S&P 500 more than any other stock. The iPhone maker is about 7 percent away from becoming the first company ever to have a market capitalization of $1 trillion. 
The U.S. Labor Department's consumer price index increased 0.2 percent in April, less than economists' expectations, as rising costs for gasoline and rental accommodation were tempered by a moderation in healthcare prices.
Core CPI, which excludes food and energy components, edged up 0.1 percent in April, slower than the previous two months, and did little to alter traders' expectations of a June rate hike. [MMT/]
A higher inflation number could have increased fears of more aggressive interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
""The CPI came in at a level where it's not so alarming as far as what the Fed is thinking,"" said Mark Kepner, an equity trader at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. ""There's comfort that the Fed won't have to move too quickly."" 
The U.S. stock market rallied broadly, with all 11 major S&P sectors posting gains.
With investors setting aside concerns about a trade war with China, the S&P 500 has risen 3.55 percent in the past week, its strongest five-session showing since February. The S&P 500 reclaimed its 100-day moving average for the first time since April 19, suggesting to some traders that the market may move higher. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 0.8 percent to end at 24,739.53 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.94 percent to 2,723.07, its highest level since mid-March.
The Nasdaq Composite added 0.89 percent to 7,404.98.
 CenturyLink  (NYSE:CTL) gained 7.54 percent after its first-quarter report. That helped the telecoms sector jump 1.9 percent, more than any other sector.
AXA Equitable Holdings, the U.S. division of French insurer AXA, rose 1.7 percent in its market debut. Although its offering raised less than targeted, it was still the biggest U.S. IPO this year.
The top losers on the S&P 500 included Victoria's Secret owner L Brands (NYSE:LB), which fell 7.15 percent, and Booking Holdings, formerly called Priceline, which dropped 4.74 percent. Both companies gave disappointing outlooks.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.57-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.65-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 165 new highs and 36 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.7 billion shares, compared with the 6.6 billion-share average over the last 20 trading days.

350,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 05:41PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo trims expected hit from regulatory cap on assets,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co on Thursday said a cap on the bank's growth imposed by regulators after sales practices scandals would hurt earnings less than it thought this year, and forecast 2019 expenses below Wall Street expectations. 
Analysts were upbeat about the expense outlook, financial targets and lessened fallout from the regulatory restrictions, though Wells Fargo said that reflected slower loan and deposit growth. But some had hoped for more revenue details at the bank's annual investor day.
""While we expect the market to view this financial outlook favorably, (portfolio managers) keep on telling us they need to see the negative headlines abate ... and revenue growth to return,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Jason Goldberg wrote in a note. 
Wells Fargo is under Federal Reserve orders to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion until governance and controls improve. Chief Executive Tim Sloan said the bank, now the fourth-largest U.S. lender by assets, is making plans to operate under that limit for the first part of 2019. 
He acknowledged the bank previously had not executed so well on compliance and risk oversight, but pushed back on the idea that it has a lot more work to do and said some news headlines were getting ""tiresome.""
""I think we're through most of the historical review,"" Sloan said during a question-and-answer period at the daylong meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina, which was webcast. 
The bank previously expected the asset cap to hit after-tax net income by up to $400 million, but lower deposit and loan growth gave it room under the limit and caused it to cut that figure to less than $100 million, Treasurer Neal Blinde said. 
Well Fargo said net interest income, or the difference in what it pays for deposits and what it earns on loans, will be relatively flat in 2018 as lower earning assets and higher deposit costs offset higher interest rates.
The bank's shares closed at $54.65 on Thursday, up 1.7 percent. 
Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said the bank would not provide updated guidance on its efficiency ratio. Investors and analysts have watched for improvements in that key measure of costs per dollar of revenue since the sales scandal erupted in 2016. 
Shrewsberry said under one scenario for 2020 it is possible the bank would have expenses of $50 billion to $51 billion, and revenue consistent with 2017 results, but cautioned that was not a formal projection.
Under questioning from analysts he declined to offer more specific revenue forecasts, citing the many variables at play. 
Noninterest expenses for 2019 would total $52 billion to $53 billion excluding litigation and remediation items, the bank said, compared to analyst expectations of $53.2 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Barclays analyst Goldberg noted that two profitability targets Wells Fargo gave on Thursday roughly met his expectations: a two-year return on equity of 12 percent to 15 percent and two-year return on average tangible common equity of 14 percent to 17 percent. 
Perry Pelos, who leads Wells Fargo's wholesale business, said it remains the primary bank of about 11 percent of U.S. middle-market companies. While the bank's issues have prompted client questions, Pelos said, ""by and large they have hung with us.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing, held his last meeting with shareholders on Thursday and handed to his eldest son the keys to his $35.3 billion empire, bringing to a close a rags-to-riches story that made him an icon in the financial hub.
Li, who started out as a factory apprentice at 12, is stepping aside from a conglomerate that employs 323,000 employees and has assets in more than 50 countries spanning property, power, telecoms and oil.
At the AGMs for his flagship firm CK Hutchison Holdings (HK:0001) and property arm CK Asset Holdings (HK:1113), the 89-year-old Li engaged with shareholders in his usual idiosyncratic manner, before handing off formally to Victor Li.
""I will still go to the office tomorrow,"" Li told reporters after the AGMs that lasted several hours, explaining he would continue to work on his charitable foundation.
Li appeared in high spirits, smiling, cracking jokes and waving to reporters. He expressed confidence in his eldest son, who stood in silence behind him with a stoic expression.
""Victor has followed me for more than 30 years. He should be able to do a good job."" 
Li will continue to exert some influence as a senior adviser for the empire that includes Britain's largest container port in Felixstowe and Canada's Husky Oil [HYOLTD.UL].
Victor Li, who has been a group co-managing director for several years, is seen as a steady hand unlikely to change course - which, according to analysts, could weigh on the firm.
""Most of their businesses are in ports, energy, and retail, and these are all mature industries, even telecommunications,"" said CEO of GEO Securities Limited, Francis Lun. ""If they don't invest in new sectors, they will slowly decline.""
CK Hutchison shares have dipped around 6 percent since Li announced he would step down, versus a 2 percent drop in the overall Hang Seng Index (HSI), while CK Asset has shed 1.3 percent over the period. 
GIANT BOOTS TO FILL
Victor Li joined his family's corporate umbrella in 1985.
Educated at Stanford in civil engineering, he is notably less extroverted than his father and a stickler for numbers, say some who are familiar with both men.
Victor, a low-key family man with an interest in wind-surfing, has also had to surmount some traumatic episodes. 
In 1996, he was kidnapped by a notorious gangster before he was freed for a large ransom. He is now rarely seen about town without a security detail.
Analysts expect Victor to avoid big gambles as he takes the helm, buttressed by veteran executives including Canning Fok and Frank Sixt, though they too may be approaching retirement.
""Effectively Victor gets it all (the assets), and it's pretty big stuff. He'll have to have very good guys around him,"" said Simon Murray, a former right hand man of the elder Li.
""I'm not sure where his core competence lies ... well we'll see. He's very much a details guy, maybe too much of a details guy and his biggest challenge will be relationships with people.
""If you're looking for Victor's humility you may have to look quite hard, his father had an abundance of that.""
The adoration Li senior enjoys was evident in the turnout at the AGMs. Among the attendees was wheelchair-bound Yung.

Giving only her last name, the 86-year-old shareholder said she had attended just to hear what Li senior had to say since ""today is the last time"".

The blue-chip Dow futures slipped 2 points, or 0.01%, by 6:27AM ET (10:27GMT), the S&P 500 futures edged forward 3 points, or 0.09%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures rose 10 points, or 0.14%
The Commerce Department will publish April inflation figures at 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT) Thursday. Market analysts expect consumer prices to post a gain of 0.3%, snapping back from March's 0.1% decline, while core inflation is forecast to inch up 0.2%, the same as its rise a month earlier.
On a yearly base, core CPI is projected to climb 2.2%, a tad faster than the 2.1% gain recorded in the preceding month. Core prices are viewed by the Fed as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories.
Rising prices would be a catalyst to push the U.S. central bank toward raising interest rates at a faster pace than currently expected as policymakers seek to maintain inflation near the 2% target.
Markets are currently looking for the Fed’s next rate hike to arrive in June with a follow-up increase in September, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. Odds for a third hike, for a total of four in 2018, were last at around 44%.
In addition to the inflation data, investors will also keep an eye on weekly jobless claims to be released at the same time.
On the company front, earnings season continues to wind down. As of late Wednesday, 449 of the S&P 500 companies had already reported with 77% beating profit forecasts and 74% topping sales estimates.
Analysts at The Earnings Scout noted the strong first quarter earnings with profit growth so far of 24.7% along with a 9.3% increase in revenues. They predicted that they will improve even further in both the second and third quarter. “Most importantly, above trend growth is likely to persist well into 2019,” these experts commented.
Among companies on watch Thursday, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA)., Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC), Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), and  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP) will post earnings.
Meanwhile, oil prices continued higher on Thursday, notching another three-and-a-half-year peak as escalating geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran cast further uncertainty about supply disruptions from the region.
U.S. crude futures gained 0.58% to $71.55 by 6:28AM ET (10:28GMT), while Brent oil traded up 0.22% to $77.38.
Elsewhere, Europe's major bourses were mostly higher in early afternoon trade, with banks leading the charge up after Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) agreed to smaller-than-expected settlement with the U.S.
Also in the UK, investors looked ahead to the Bank of England’s rate decision at 7:00AM ET (11:00GMT), with market expectations now overwhelmingly in favor of interest rates being held at the current 0.5% rate.
Interest rate bets have swung around sharply from early-April when investors priced a 90% chance of the BoE raising rates by 25 basis points. But a spate of weak economic data is almost certain to stay the BoE’s hand, which might now struggle to convince investors that it will raise borrowing costs at all this year.
BoE Governor Mark Carney will hold a press conference a half an hour after the announcement, and investors will monitor his language for signals on what the appetite is for hikes further out in 2018.
Earlier, Asian stocks closed higher, buoyed by the strong overnight lead from Wall Street. That came after data that showed that China’s factory inflation gained pace in April, snapping a five-month streak of declines, while the consumer price index eased."

DUBAI (Reuters) - At least three commercial banks in Saudi Arabia are preparing U.S. dollar debt issues, banking sources said, in what would be the first hard-currency debt sales by Saudi banks in several years.
The banks want to diversify their sources of finance and boost capital levels, but are in no rush for the cash as they are still flush with liquidity due to sluggish credit growth and looser public spending.
The kingdom's increasing reliance on international bond issues has also freed up liquidity for local banks.
Riyad Bank (SE:1010), the kingdom's fourth-largest bank by assets, has mandated banks for a U.S. dollar bond sale, four bankers said.
The bank had announced its intention this year to establish a program to issue bonds in local currency and U.S. dollars to diversify sources of finance and boost the bank's capital base.
The largest lender, National Commercial Bank (SE:1180) (NCB), is preparing documents before a potential issue, two sources said
Samba Financial Group (SE:1090), the third largest, is working with  Citigroup  (N:C) on a potential U.S. dollar debt sale, four sources said.
The three Saudi banks did not respond to requests for comment. Citigroup declined to comment.
Saudi banks are often better capitalized than their international peers, but experts said they may want an extra buffer to prepare for new international rules on capital levels, known as Basel III, and to meet an expected rise in credit demand.
Saudi banks had been expected to issue U.S. dollar bonds after the Saudi government started borrowing on international markets two years, part of its effort to boost its finances that had been hit by a slump in oil prices.
""We expected banks to issue after the Saudi sovereign bond, as that's a typical trajectory in the development of debt markets: sovereign, banks and then corporates,"" said Usman Ahmed, head of investments at Emirates NBD Asset Management.
The kingdom has issued $50 billion in international bonds, with $9 billion of the total via Islamic bonds. This has established a sovereign yield curve, providing a benchmark for bank and corporate bond issues.
But bankers said the slowdown in credit demand, as sliding oil prices hurt the economy, meant Saudi banks were under no pressure to raise more funds. However, rising crude prices, now at their highest since 2014, are lifting economic prospects. 
Moody's estimates excess liquidity in the banking system was 5.1 percent of assets in March, against 6.2 percent in December, suggesting that this year's slide in government deposits held by commercial banks had dented available funds but not by much.
However, the ratings agency said it expected credit growth in Saudi Arabia to ""rebound materially"" in the second half of 2018, and banks' funding needs could increase amid rising domestic sovereign and quasi-sovereign debt sales.

Vanguard is becoming a member of the ABI's new investment platform grouping, the ABI said in a statement, joining British platform  Hargreaves  Lansdown (L:HRGV).
A relaxation in pension rules in Britain has encouraged pensions savers to use their pension pots to invest in funds, rather than buying an annuity - which pays a fixed income for life - from an insurer.
Vanguard's membership will ""strengthen our voice, so we can do the best possible job of representing the industry to government and regulators,"" Yvonne Braun, ABI director of policy, long-term savings and protection said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland's (L:RBS) shares rose as much as 6 percent on Thursday after the bank reached a $4.9 billion settlement with U.S. authorities, opening the way for its privatization and return of cash to taxpayers who bailed it out in the financial crisis.
The fine, much lower than expected, resolves a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the British bank's sale of mis-priced mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the crisis and clears one of its most debilitating hangovers from that era.
""It's very humbling to have to announce a settlement of this magnitude,"" the bank's finance director Ewen Stevenson told reporters.
The agreement clears the way for RBS to restore its dividend and for the government to start selling down its more than 70 percent stake.
RBS executives said that it would take a few weeks to finish the paperwork, but the total penalty was unlikely to increase. Analysts had estimated a DOJ fine of up to $12 billion. 
""The number is a firm number,"" Stevenson said.
RBS said it would be able to cover the bulk of the penalty out of existing provisions alongside a $1.44 billion charge it will take in the second quarter of this year. 
""This marks a watershed for RBS – for as long as this investigation cast a pall over earnings and forecasts there was nowhere for investors to really go,"" said Neil Wilson, chief analyst for Markets.com. 
CRISIS CASUALTY
The Department of Justice has previously settled with a whole list of banks including  Citigroup  (N:C),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), Goldman Sachs (N:GS), Bank of America (N:BAC) and  Barclays  (L:BARC) for a total of more than $60 billion.
Bank of America paid the highest sum of $16.7 billion as part of an accord that also resolved claims by other federal agencies and several states. Barclays, which settled in March, had the smallest figure at $2 billion.
Once the world's largest bank by assets, RBS was one of the biggest casualties of the crisis which crippled credit, stock and housing markets and upended the global economy. 
It narrowly avoided insolvency in 2008 after the government agreed a 45 billion pound ($61 billion) bailout, just six months after it had raised 12 billion pounds of cash from shareholders. 
Chief Executive Ross McEwan's predecessor, Stephen Hester, who joined the bank following the bailout, said he had texted McEwan this morning to congratulate him and the team. 
""That's the last really big milestone before the bank can be seen to be fully normalized,"" Hester, who is now CEO of RSA (L:RSA), said during a conference call on the insurer's results. 
The fine had been a big obstacle to the government's plan, laid out in November, to begin reprivatising RBS before the end of the 2018-19 fiscal year - a much needed boost for finance minister Philip Hammond's coffers. 
BACK TO DIVIDENDS
After ten years of restructuring, paying fines and shedding around 1.5 trillion pounds in assets, the DOJ settlement means RBS's last large legacy issue is out of the way. It had already paid just over $7 billion in other settlements with various U.S. authorities. 
McEwan also said the bank would now discuss with regulators paying RBS's first dividend in a decade, leaving open the possibility the bank could start returning years' worth of surplus capital to shareholders before its next annual results.
""The fact they can begin to think about how to return that to shareholders is a major and long-awaited change,"" said Olivia Treharne, a fund manager at Legal & General Investment Management, RBS's number 10 shareholder according to Thomson Reuters data. 
One of the bank's largest 20 investors said shareholders should be cautious about the prospects of getting their hands on the bank's excess capital just yet.
""This is hardly a Silicon Valley company. I'd like to see much of that plowed into the bank's IT systems,"" said the investor, who asked not to be named. 
McEwan had hoped for a settlement before the end of 2017, but changes at the DOJ following the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump saw negotiations slip back. 
RBS may have benefited from settling under Trump's administration, which has been softer on banks than that of his predecessor Barack Obama.
RBS executives said one reason for the settlement being below estimates was that RBS did not have to pay out billions of dollars in consumer relief, a staple of such settlements under the Obama administration.

Apple announced plans in February 2015 to build the facility in the rural western town of Athenry to take advantage of green energy sources nearby, but a series of planning appeals, chiefly from two individuals, delayed its approval.
Ireland's High Court ruled in October that the data center could proceed, dismissing the appellants who then took their case to the country's Supreme Court.
""Despite our best efforts, delays in the approval process have forced us to make other plans and we will not be able to move forward with the data centre,"" Apple said in a statement ahead of the Supreme Court heading on Thursday. 
""While disappointing, this setback will not dampen our enthusiasm for future projects in Ireland as our business continues to grow,"" the company said, citing plans to expand its European headquarters in County Cork where it employs over 6,000 people. 
Ireland relies on foreign multinational companies like Apple for the creation of one in every 10 jobs across the economy and sees major investments such as data centers as a means of securing their presence in the country.
The government is in the process of amending its planning laws to include data centers as strategic infrastructure, thus allowing them to get through the planning process much more quickly.
A similar Apple center announced at the same time in Denmark was due to begin operations last year and Apple announced in July that it would build its second EU data center there.
""There is no disputing that Apple's decision is very disappointing, particularly for Athenry and the West of Ireland,"" Ireland's Minister for Business and Enterprise Heather Humphreys said in a statement.
""The Government did everything it could to support this investment... These delays have, if nothing else, underlined our need to make the State’s planning and legal processes more efficient.""

363,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 03:32AM ET</span>","GM agrees to stake lock-in, make South Korea regional HQ in rescue deal for unit","By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors (N:GM) will stay in South Korea for at least 10 years and set up its Asia-Pacific headquarters in the country, government officials said on Thursday, revealing terms of a deal aimed at rescuing the U.S. automaker's struggling GM Korea unit.
The U.S. car maker's Korean unit averted a bankruptcy filing with a wage deal clinched last month, but analysts and customers, as well as the South Korean government, have had doubts about GM's commitment and about how long the loss-making company will remain in business.
The terms of the binding deal to be signed on May 11 seek to assuage some of those concerns. 
As per the agreement, GM can't sell any of its 77 percent stake in GM Korea over the next five years and can't let it fall below 35 percent thereafter until 2028, South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon told a press conference.
The restriction on the stake sale was one of tools that will prevent GM from leaving the South Korean market, Kim said.
He also said the deal package ""paved the way for GM to operate continuously beyond 10 years”, referring to concerns that GM may leave after 10 years.
The Detroit car maker and state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB) already have a preliminary deal on $7.15 billion of investments, including $2 billion of capital spending by GM and a $2.8 billion debt-for-equity swap for existing loans GM Korea owes to its parent, to rescue the unit. 
As a sign of its long-term commitment, GM plans to set up a new Asia-Pacific headquarters in South Korea, although that excludes China, the government said on Thursday. 
GM will also buy more parts from South Korean suppliers for its overseas operations, boosting procurement from about 2 trillion won ($1.85 billion) a year at present, it said.
In return, South Korea will provide funding to local suppliers of GM and other South Korean automakers for the development of parts for electric and self-driving cars, and other key automotive parts.
""It was a very difficult and a critical decision,” chairman of the financial watchdog Financial Service Commission Choi Jong-ku said at the briefing, adding the government had to consider the risk to 156,000 jobs at GM Korea and its suppliers, the eco-system of South Korea’s car industry, as well as exports and local economies.

Barry Engle, President of GM International, said on Thursday that the automaker's commitment to South Korea was long-term and sincere, adding that although there was still a lot of work to do, he sees a bright future in the country.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares steadied on Thursday as a flurry of company results rolled in with losses in BT following a disappointing update and weighed down further by a weakness among utilities stocks.
Gains in RBS (L:RBS) following a multi-billion deal to settle a U.S. investigation of the bank's bond sales, and a solid update from Italy's biggest bank UniCredit (MI:CRDI) buoyed the banking sector, helping the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) steady by 0748 GMT.
BT (L:BT) shares fell 7.1 percent after saying it was cutting 13,000 jobs, the latest attempt by Britain's biggest telecoms group to rebuild after an accounting scandal and a downturn in trading.
Traders said its latest update showed a disappointing guidance, while Jefferies analysts highlighted that the company missed on the opportunity of announcing a bolder mover of fiber roll out while job cuts were bigger then expected.
""No evidence of inflection in results or mindset,"" said Jefferies.
RBS rallied 5.5 percent after it agreed to pay a smaller-than-expected $4.9 billion to resolve a U.S. investigation into its sale of mortgage-backed securities.
Analysts, who had estimated the U.S. could impose a fine of up to $12 billion, said the bank could reinstate a dividend.
Gains in RBS helped the UK's FTSE (FTSE) edge ahead 0.2 percent, outperforming other European bourses ahead of a Bank of England policy meeting expected to keep interest rates on hold.
Still in banks, UniCredit rose 2.7 percent after it posted its best first-quarter result since 2007, topping forecasts with a 1.1 billion euro net profit thanks to lower-than-expected loan losses.
Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) fell as much as 0.7 percent, as bond yields jumped on an increased possibility that a government of anti-establishment parties will take power. The index however recovered ground and was up 0.2 percent.
Top movers on the STOXX also included precious metals miner Randgold (L:RRS), down 6.6 percent after its quarterly profit fell, while  Next  (L:NXT) rose 5.7 percent after a strong outlook and trading update.

Utilities were a weak spot, down 0.8 percent to lead sectoral losers in Europe, weighed by a disappointing update at Italy's Enel (L:RRS)

LONDON (Reuters) - BT (L:BT) will cut 13,000 managerial and back-office jobs and move to a smaller London base in the latest attempt by the boss of Britain's biggest telecoms group to rebuild from an accounting scandal and multiple pressures on its business.
Chief Executive Gavin Patterson said radical action was ""absolutely critical"" to ensure BT could deliver the next-generation fiber and mobile networks Britain needed.
""We need to make ourselves more efficient, we need to create oxygen within the business,"" he told reporters on Thursday.
Despite outlining measures to save 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) a year by 2020/21, the initial market reaction was negative.
A failure to hit a revenue target over the latest three months and a disappointing outlook for no profit growth for a couple of years sent BT shares down 9 percent to five-year lows. 
Losing long-standing fixed-line voice revenue, many legacy telecom firms have expanded into more profitable areas. 
AT&T (N:T) in the U.S. is trying to buy entertainment group  Time Warner  (N:TWX) while BT's own push into sports broadcasting was designed to defend its customer base. 
Since he took the top job in 2013, Patterson has spent billions of pounds on sports rights, network investment and customer service improvements, all while trying to keep regulators, pension fund trustees and investors on side.
On top of that, fraud was discovered in Italy while the group was also blindsided by a downturn in corporate and public sector markets, undermining confidence in his leadership.
Patterson, 50, tried to placate shareholders by maintaining the dividend on Thursday -- and pledging to keep it flat for the next two years -- and he also agreed a new pension funding plan to plug its 11.3 billion pound deficit.
Bernstein analysts called the update ""disappointing.""
""BT has now firmly gone from being a reasonably predictable growth story, an outlier in the incumbent landscape across Europe, to becoming a cost restructuring story,"" they said.
""Quite a remarkable shift in fortunes with an outlook that is well shy of our expectations.""
MOVING HOME
Traders said guidance for the current financial year was lower than expected, while fourth-quarter revenue fell short of targets, showing the challenges facing Patterson as he seeks to rebuild a group that employs more than 100,000 staff.
BT, which owns Britain's biggest mobile operator EE, said it would hire about 6,000 new engineers and front line customer service staff to support its roll out of fiber and 5G networks.
Around two-thirds of jobs cuts will fall in Britain. 
The company has been based at the BT Centre, near St Paul's Cathedral and the London Stock Exchange in the City of London since it was privatized in 1984 but will now move to smaller premises in the capital.
""If we compare how we manage the business with our peers, we're frankly too complex and overweight. This is a big deal,"" said Patterson.
The convergence of different technologies means BT has faced growing competition from nimble young rivals including Sky (L:SKYB) which has expanded from being a pay TV company to offer a range of broadband services. 
UNDER PRESSURE
One top-50 investor said there was no question Patterson was under pressure, but it was not clear how replacing the chief executive would change the dynamics.
""Any growth option they pursue is potentially going to have no return on it because the regulator just wants to regulate your returns away from you,"" the shareholder said.
""Pretty much the only thing you can do is to attack your cost base."" 
Under Patterson's leadership, BT has had a fractious relationship with the regulator Ofcom.
Patterson, who previously worked at consumer goods group P&G and cable TV company Telewest, said the hit from regulation would double from about 500 million pounds to 1 billion pounds a year as new controls on its faster wholesale broadband kick in.
""My biggest concern is more that they need to clear the air with the regulator,"" the investor said.
BT faces caps on how much it charges rivals to use its fast broadband service as Ofcom seeks to promote the development of new networks.
THROW OF THE DICE
The job cuts, the highest number by the former monopoly since 2008, will cost 800 million pounds to implement.
Some of the proceeds from the savings will go towards increasing capital expenditure on new fiber fixed-line connections and 4G and next generation 5G mobile networks to about 3.7 billion pounds over the next two years.
The new strategy is the latest throw of the dice from Patterson who won early plaudits from investors when he moved BT into sports TV and mobile. 
That goodwill evaporated when the group delivered a major profit warning in January 2017 due to problems at its multi-national Global Services division and the discovery of the Italian scandal. The shares are down 30 percent in a year. 
Patterson gained some breathing space on BT's pension, which had a deficit of 11.3 billion pounds at the end of June, on Thursday by agreeing a 13-year funding plan.
It will pay 2.1 billion pounds into the scheme by 2020 and a further 2 billion pounds will be funded by bonds.

BT said its outlook for the current financial year, to end-March, would see a 2 percent drop in underlying revenue, while adjusted core earnings would be in the range 7.3 billion-7.4 billion pounds, down from 7.5 billion pounds in the last year. ($1 = 0.7388 pounds)

371,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>","Chinese banks, pitching safety and returns (maybe), lure customers into deposits","By Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - At a Hua Xia Bank branch in Shanghai's financial district, Wang Shujuan, a 72-year-old retired doctor, is looking at moving her money out of a high-yielding wealth management product into a bank deposit bearing an indefinite rate of return.
For Wang and other Chinese retail investors opting for this new, aggressively-marketed ""Wisdom & Reward"" product the decision seems perfectly rational.
Under China's new rules for its asset management industry, banks' wealth management products (WMP) are no longer allowed to offer guarantees on the principal and returns. ""Wisdom & Reward"", a principal-protected structured deposit product, is seen by investors like Wang as a fine alternative.
""I'm thinking of moving my money into 'Wisdom & Reward' so that I can sleep sound at night,"" Wang said. ""I can live with lower returns.""
Risk-averse customers such as Wang are sought-after trophies in an escalating deposit war between banks, whose wealth management businesses face an existential threat from the tougher asset management rules, which were published last month.
According to the rules, designed to reduce risks in China's $15 trillion asset management sector, explicit or implicit guarantees, a common practice used by banks to woo customers seeking higher returns than deposits, are banned. 
Fearful of a client exodus, banks are aggressively marketing structured deposits - a combination of mundane savings and risky derivative trading - to retain customers. 
Compared to the guaranteed 5-percent-plus returns on wealth management products, these deposits simply guarantee the principal and an undefined yield of anywhere between 1.5 and 8 percent. But they are selling well.
Bank of Communications (BoComm) has launched a series of structured deposits that indicate annualized returns exceeding 4 percent - much higher than the benchmark one-year deposit rate of 1.5 percent.
""Many clients like this product, because it's principal-guaranteed,"" said Chen Chen, a BoComm customer manager, adding that several tranches of the products had been sold out soon after launching.
WHACK-A-MOLE
The structured deposit is further evidence of China's struggle to regulate its massive banking sector, where every regulatory attempt to reduce risk leads to innovative products to circumvent curbs.
Investors are attracted by these new bank deposits because they offer them a sense of safety as well as the possibility of high returns - actual yields are linked to the performance of the underlying assets the banks use derivatives to bet on.
Banks are embedding derivatives into regular savings deposits to generate higher yields for clients. China Merchants Bank has pegged its deposit rates to gold prices. Bank of China is marketing a deposit product that bets on the exchange rates of the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen.
Central bank data shows these products have caught on. Outstanding structured deposits at Chinese banks jumped 47 percent from a year earlier to 8.8 trillion yuan ($1.38 trillion) at the end of March. 
In contrast, bank WMPs, most of which are off their balance-sheets and hence the target of the government crackdown on shadow banking, grew less than 2 percent last year to 29.54 trillion yuan. WMPs are expected to shrink further this year, snapping a streak of breakneck growth averaging 50 percent during the 2011-2015 period.
As their role as intermediaries in wealth management products diminishes, banks are desperate to retain clients and deposits. The intense competition has however seen heavy inflows of retail cash into bond funds and money market funds this year.
PRICE TO PAY
While it's early days, the risk is that these new deposits push up bank funding costs and threaten their margins.
""Life would be especially tough at smaller lenders whose rapid growth was driven by aggressive expansion"" in WMPs, said Qiu Gaoqing, chief analyst at BoComm. ""They really need to tighten their belts."" 
Lenders such as Ping An Bank and China Merchants Bank have already seen shrinking margins during the first quarter, despite higher loan demand in a recovering economy.
Another concern is that banks will use these structured deposits as a new tool to circumvent regulations, particularly as there are no dedicated rules governing these products. 
Some of the products don't specify how much of a client's money will be diverted to derivatives trading, and how gains are distributed.
""Structured products could be quite tricky,"" said Zhou Liang, fund manager at Minority Asset Management, who holds shares in Chinese lenders.
""You don't know how much you've paid for those expensive derivative transactions. The prospects of high returns, could be quite elusive.""

372,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 03:26AM ET</span>",Exclusive: PGE picks Baltic wind over nuclear as Poland embraces green power,"By Agnieszka Barteczko and Pawel Goraj
WARSAW/GDYNIA (Reuters) - State-controlled PGE (WA:PGE) has abandoned its leading role in plans to build Poland's first nuclear power station as it focuses on new wind farms in the Baltic Sea, two sources said.
Two other sources said state-run refiner PKN Orlen (WA:PKN) could take on PGE's role. 
PGE, the largest Polish power group, announced a nearly $10 billion offshore wind project in March but has also been responsible for the nuclear project.
Both plans are part of a major change in Polish policy. Coal mining provides around 80 percent of its energy and thousands of jobs but makes it one of Europe's biggest polluters.
The government promised to defend coal from competition but has been forced to look for alternatives to fill an electricity shortfall and to meet European Union emissions targets. 
One source said PGE could not fund both projects and cheap technology had swung the decision in favor of wind. PGE could still play a smaller role in the nuclear project which has been delayed and still needs government approval. 
""PGE cannot afford both - offshore wind and nuclear. The decision was taken to go for offshore,"" the source said.
A government source also said that PGE would focus on offshore. A spokesmen for PGE declined to comment.
Asked whether it could take the project on, PKN Orlen's press office said in an emailed statement that the company ""continuously analyses a number of different projects that could be part of the long-term development plans of the group.""
Poland's ruling conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party promised before elections in 2015 to defend the coal industry and put in place laws to prevent new investment in both onshore and offshore windfarms. 
But in March it changed tack and proposed a law to make it easier to build wind turbines. That is currently being debated in parliament.
If the law is passed, as expected, several other wind farm projects could also proceed.
Polenergia (WA:PEPP), owned by the Kulczyk family, has said it would like to build a wind farm in the Baltic by 2022. PKN Orlen is also considering building one.
PGE said in March that it wants to build offshore windfarms with a capacity of 2.5 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. 
PGE did not say how this would be financed. The state owns 57.39 pct and there are over a hundred other small shareholders, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data. 
The group's cash amounted to 2.5 billion zlotys ($712.92 million) at the end of 2017. It could issue more bonds as part of its 2 billion euros and 5 billion zlotys bond programs. 
SUBSIDY QUESTION
Analysts and investors say that offshore wind farms are the easiest and fastest way for Poland to fill the expected capacity gap from coal and reduce CO2 emissions in line with EU's 2030 targets as Poland seeks improved ties with Brussels. 
They provide more electricity than onshore windfarms, which Poland already has, and can be built more quickly than a nuclear power plant.
The decision to open up the offshore power industry could also draw in investors.  Statoil  (OL:STL) said in April it would join Polenergia's offshore project which has drawn interest from other international wind companies. 
""We received phone calls from all over Europe after Statoil's decision was announced. If such a player has entered, we need to be in too, many investors say,"" said Maciej Stryjecki, the president of the board at SMDI Advisory Group. 
Some investors will also be waiting to see if Poland offers subsidies in cash or payments for getting connected to the grid. 
""Even if we take into account the very positive trend in the decline in offshore technology costs, offshore wind farms will not be built without support,"" said Michal Michalski, Polenergia management board member.
The government's official position on this is not clear. Officials in the energy ministry were not available to comment. 
The PiS minister responsible for Poland's power and gas infrastructure, who reports directly to the prime minister, said companies should not need such incentives. 
""We expect that offshore windfarms will be built without support, but the falling cost trend is very encouraging,"" Piotr Naimski told Reuters.
He has been a strong advocate of coal but said offshore would be a part of Poland's energy mix in 2025-30. 
EMOTIONAL 
Reducing the dependence on coal is an emotional issue in Poland. The coal industry still employs 83,000 people and some are worried the shift in strategy could lead to job cuts.
""I do not believe that offshore wind can be profitable,"" said Jaroslaw Grzesik, the head of one of the biggest trade unions in Polish coal industry.
""We are definitely against it."" 
But other industries could benefit from the development of offshore power.
The Polish Wind Energy Association (PWEA) estimates that offshore windfarms with a total capacity of 6 GW would help create around 77,000 new jobs and add around 60 billion zlotys to economic growth.
Local authorities in the windy Baltic resort and port of Leba, which is close to the future offshore sites, are hoping the industry could provide year-round employment as a balance to seasonal jobs. 
""If investors choose Leba, a base and functional and technical facilities for wind farms could be created here,"" the mayor of Leba, Andrzej Strzechminski, said. 
PWEA has identified around 70 potential Polish suppliers to the offshore industry including shipyards Crist SA and GSG Towers. Their workers' boat-building skills can be transferred to make windmill components. 
GSG Towers, a unit of Gdansk Shipyard Group, is looking forward to Poland's first offshore windmills and contracts with new clients. 
""We are not talking anymore about whether Poland needs to develop offshore wind projects...there are no more question marks and we only talk about when and how to do it right,"" said Liudmyla Buimister who was the CEO of GSG Towers, a unit of Gdansk Shipyard Group, until April 16.

It has approached PGE and Polenergia about building a device to send electricity generated at sea to the onshore grid.

376,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 10:17AM ET</span>",How Trump's steel tariffs kick the can business,"By Nick Carey
WOODLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Dan Vincent is in a bind. 
The president of Pacific Coast Producers (PCP) plans to use around 700 million tin-coated steel cans this year for tomatoes, peaches and pears from 168 growers here in California. 
His cooperative then sells the canned fruits and vegetables to grocers ranging from Walmart Inc (N:WMT) to Kroger Co (N:K), as well as food services companies such as  Sysco Corp  (N:SYY) and a host of restaurant chains.
Since President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum to help the domestic steel industry on March 20, PCP's steel costs have jumped 9 percent as the market prices in the tariffs before they even take effect.
Vincent now expects his steel bill for the year to rise $18 million to $20 million, forcing him to choose between taking a potential 75 percent cut to his company's profits, or pushing the added costs to his retail customers and eventually to consumers - many of whom are lower-income Americans ""who can least afford it,"" Vincent told Reuters. 
""Look, we all want to protect U.S. steelworkers,"" Vincent said while touring a tomato farm in Woodland, California. ""But we don't want to be an unintended consequence of this.""
Meant to protect U.S. jobs and even out trade imbalances, the Trump administration's tariffs on steel and aluminum are having a ripple effect throughout the U.S. economy, from cars to aircraft to oilfield pipes. Cans have a special significance in the debate over the pros and cons of the policy. 
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, during a March 2 appearance on CNBC, held up a  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) can and said it only contained 2.6 cents worth of steel in it, equating to less than a one cent added cost per can. 
""Who in the world is going to be too bothered by six tenths of a cent?"" Ross said. 
A Commerce Department spokesman said the figures Ross used were based on the cost of tin plate steel and calculated for a 10.75 ounce (0.3kg) can, adding steel is ""only one component of the cost.""
Canning industry executives, however, say the cost of America's most common 15 ounce (0.43kg) can is actually around 17 cents, and will rise 4 cents thanks to tariffs. 
Even a 10-ounce can costs food processors up to 14 cents, and should cost 3 cents more with tariffs.
Those pennies add up. If the cost of all 24 billion cans Americans use annually went up 3 cents, it would generate an additional $720 million in costs someone in the supply chain must eat, industry executives said.
""Our members have razor-thin margins,"" said Nickolas George, president of the Midwest Food Products Association, which represents Seneca Food Corp (O:SENEA) and  Del Monte Pacific Ltd  (SI:DMPL), which both can fruit and vegetables, among others. ""Lower profits for them mean less innovation, less investment, less expansion into new markets and less hiring.""
HIT TO THE POCKETBOOK
For consumers, a spike in prices in the grocery aisle puts poorer Americans at risk, U.S. government statistics show, because they spend more of their budget on food than those in higher income brackets. 
For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2I2OcYy
The canning industry has made economic fairness part of its public argument for canceling the tariffs. According to 2012 research commissioned by the Can Manufacturers Institute, Americans on food stamps and other food assistance programs consumed 7.1 cans of fruit and vegetables every week, compared with the national weekly average of 5.5 cans. 
Retailers and companies like PCP work to keep the cost of canned fruit and vegetables under 99 cents, which is what Vincent calls the ""magic number,"" a psychological threshold over which poorer U.S. consumers in particular have historically walked away.
""I'm afraid the tariffs are going to push us over that 99 cent threshold,"" Vincent said. 
A key question is whether Walmart will let producers pass on higher costs, as the retail giant is renowned for pushing back against price hikes, said Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman.
Walmart referred Reuters to the Retail Industry Leaders Association trade group. Hun Quach, the group's vice president for international trade, said with tariffs ""the bottom line is there is no other place for through costs to go than to consumers.""
Rivals for PCP in China and Europe, meanwhile, are seen getting a boost from steel tariffs. Canned fruit and vegetables imported into the United States will not be subject to tariffs because they are classified as finished goods, so foreign competitors are under no pressure to raise prices. 
PUTTING INVESTMENT ON HOLD
The farmers in PCP's cooperative grow fruits and vegetables in the rich, sandy-loam soil of California's Central Valley, east of San Francisco. 
One of those farmers is Frank Muller, chairman of the cooperative's board and a second-generation tomato farmer.
On the thousands of acres he farms, workers carefully drop young tomato plants into perfectly-formed holes, irrigated by underground strips to save water. New seeds and more precise planting techniques have helped Muller more than double the yield of his fields during the past three decades to 55 tons of tomatoes per acre. 
But at the same time, his costs have exploded. In just one example, he now pays $2,600 per 100,000 seeds up from $20 three decades ago.
Muller had planned a new steel equipment storage building on his farm, but that investment is on hold, he said, due to uncertainty about the cost.
""The tariffs hit me at both ends,"" Muller said. ""It means higher input costs and it will hurt our end markets.""
Richard Elliot is another of PCP's farmers worried by tariffs. A fifth-generation pear grower, he said a broader trade war would hurt his exports to Canada and South America. But Elliot is more concerned steel tariffs will harm PCP, which he relies on to buy and can a significant portion of his crop. 
""We can't be in business unless PCP is doing well,"" he said.
PCP has expanded over the years, investing in a fruit import business to can exotic fruit and a cherry-growing operation in Oregon. When a rival closed its Modesto, California, peach-canning plant earlier this year citing rising costs and ""import competition from China and Europe,"" PCP took over that business.
The 700 million cans PCP needs for this year's growing season will add close to $20 million in unplanned additional cost. The company had expected profit for this year of $24 million, but those extra steel costs could cut PCP's profits by up to $18 million, Vincent said. 
To cut costs, PCP will process the extra fruit without adding to its labor force.

""There's a lot of money we could have made that will go into steel,"" PCP's Vincent said.

377,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 12:00AM ET</span>",GM to locate new Asia-Pacific headquarters in South Korea: government,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors (N:GM) has agreed to set up its Asia-Pacific headquarters in South Korea, in a further commitment by the U.S. automaker to its loss-making local unit, the government said on Thursday.
Under a preliminary agreement, GM will also buy more parts from South Korean suppliers for its overseas operations, boosting procurement from about 2 trillion won ($1.85 billion) a year at present, the industry ministry said in a statement.
In return, South Korea will provide funding to local suppliers of GM and other South Korean automakers for the development of parts for electric and self-driving cars, and other key automotive parts. 
The statement did not give a figure for the level of support, but a ministry official said it would be worth a combined tens of millions of dollars.
GM agreed last month to keep its local arm afloat after coming close to seeking bankruptcy protection. The firm won major concessions from its labor union on wages and benefits and secured a planned $750 million in funding from state-run Korea Development Bank.
The new regional headquarters will oversee production, sales and technology development for Asia Pacific countries, which excludes China, but includes Australia, India and Thailand among others, a ministry official told Reuters.
GM had previously operated its regional headquarters for ""GM International"" in Singapore, which covered South Korea, Australia, Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East and Africa.
However, the automaker slashed headcount at the Singapore office last year as part of a restructuring to focus on fewer, more profitable markets like China and the United States.
GM has stopped manufacturing in Australia and Indonesia, and significantly restructured its Thai operations. The company has also restructured operations in India and South Africa.
South Korea was also hit by the revamp, with GM planning to shut down one of four local factories this month and reduce its local workforce by nearly 3,000 positions.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean regulators turned up the heat on Samsung Group (SAGR.UL) over its complex ownership structure, with the country's antitrust chief saying on Thursday the arrangement for control at the nation's top conglomerate was ""not sustainable"".
Samsung Group is controlled through a web of circular shareholdings between companies such as Samsung C&T, Samsung Life Insurance, and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930).
Critics have said the structure has enabled the family of Samsung heir Jay Y. Lee to retain control of the companies in the conglomerate, especially crown jewel Samsung Electronics, with minimum investments.
""The clear fact is, the current ownership and control structure of Samsung Group, which goes from Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee to Samsung C&T to Samsung Life Insurance to Samsung Electronics, is not sustainable,"" Kim Sang-jo, chairman of the Korea Fair Trade Commission, told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting with business leaders.
Circular shareholdings have been common among Korea's powerful family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebols, who have faced growing calls for reform from the government and investors.
Kim is popularly known as the ""chaebol sniper"" for his shareholder activist campaigns before joining the Commission. He has often criticized chaebols for their complicated cross-shareholding structures that he has said are aimed at cementing family control. 
In 2016, as part of an activist group, Kim had suggested Samsung Group could resolve its complex structure by first setting up a financial holding company centered around Samsung Life Insurance, and by then forming a holding company centered around Samsung Electronics.
Kim said on Thursday he is urging Jay Y. Lee to make a decision concerning the ownership structure, adding that Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Yoon Boo-keun, who attended the meeting, had told him it will be considered.
A Samsung Electronics spokesman did not have an immediate comment. 
Samsung Group has come for criticism earlier too, most notably from U.S. activist hedge fund Elliott Management, which proposed as a solution in 2016 that Samsung Electronics split itself into two.
Samsung Electronics rejected that proposal but accepted part of the fund's proposals by announcing plans to cancel its existing treasury shares worth over $35 billion by 2018.
Others have also questioned the group's ownership structure recently.
The country's top financial regulator said on Wednesday that Samsung Life Insurance must consider ways to lessen the risk of having too much of its assets concentrated in one place, including selling some or all of Samsung Life's stake in Samsung Electronics. 
""Lessening the risk of concentrated assets is key to securing financial stability, which is what we are interested in,"" said Choi Jong-ku, Chairman of the Financial Services Commission. 
""If there are any concerns about retaining management control (of Samsung Electronics), we are saying, look for ways to keep it while lessening the risk."" 

Samsung Life Insurance is at the heart of a cross-shareholding structure in which it owns about 8 percent of Samsung Electronics, which has a market value of about $340 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.

379,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 09, 2018 11:00PM ET</span>",China's ZTE Halts Major Operations After U.S. Choked Off Supply,"(Bloomberg) -- ZTE Corp. has suspended all major activities after the U.S. crippled its ability to buy crucial American technology, signaling the potential collapse of one of the world’s largest makers of phones and networking gear.
China’s No. 2 telecom equipment maker said it remains intent on resolving a seven-year blockade Washington imposed as punishment for violating the terms of a 2017 sanctions settlement, then lying about it. That however cut off access to the components it needs to build most of its products, from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc.’s semiconductors to optical chips from Lumentum Holdings Inc.
ZTE essentially ran out of inventory in the month since the ban’s imposition and then had no way to replenish it. As of Thursday, its website and flagship smartphone store on Alibaba’s Tmall online marketplace had suspended sales. Carriers, including Australia’s Telstra Corp., stopped offering its devices. And ZTE’s larger telecom gear-making operation probably ran afoul of the same component shortages, said Huang Leping, an analyst with CICC.
“There is nothing ZTE can do now,” Huang said. “Its manufacturing and sales are paralyzed, but R&D is still going on.”
The blow came just as ZTE was preparing to lead the country’s charge into the era of fifth-generation wireless technology, along with local rival Huawei Technologies Co. Major wireless carriers around the world are preparing to spend billions rolling out 5G networks, which enable new technologies from faster internet access to augmented reality. ZTE, which once harbored ambitions of vying with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). in phones, has called the punishment “unacceptable” and threatened to take legal action.
ZTE, whose shares have been suspended since the imposition of the ban, said in its statement it has sufficient cash and will adhere to its commercial obligations. Company representatives declined to elaborate further.
“As a result of the denial order, the major operating activities of the company have ceased,” ZTE said in a filing to the exchange. “The company and related parties are actively communicating with the relevant U.S. government departments in order to facilitate the modification or reversal of the denial order by the U.S. government and forge a positive outcome in the development of the matters.”
ZTE’s best hope may be for intervention from Beijing -- but that is a long shot given rising tensions between the U.S. and China. President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese imports for alleged violations of intellectual property rights, while Beijing has vowed to retaliate on everything from American soybeans to planes.
ZTE’s larger rival, Huawei, also faces heightened U.S. opposition. The justice department is said to be investigating its own compliance with American sanctions banning sales to Iran. The Pentagon has banned ZTE and Huawei phones for sale, and the Federal Communications Commission voted in April to ban federal funds from being used to buy gear from companies deemed a national security risk.

380,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 01:05AM ET</span>",China sentences Anbang's ex-boss to 18 years in jail,"(Reuters) - The former chairman of China's Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd has been found guilty of fraud and embezzlement and sentenced to 18 years in prison, three months after the state seized control of an insurer famed for buying New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel.
Wu Xiaohui will also surrender 10.5 billion yuan ($1.65 billion), and his bank accounts, properties, shares, companies and other assets have been frozen by the police, the Shanghai No.1 Intermediate People's Court said in a statement on its website on Thursday.
The court said Wu illegally raised 65.2 billion yuan through the sale of insurance products beyond regulatory limits, and embezzled 10 billion yuan from Anbang's insurance fund.
When contacted by Reuters, an Anbang spokesman said the insurer, which is under government supervision, is stable and has ""sufficient cash flow"" to fulfill commitments to all customers.
Reuters could not reach Wu or his representatives for comment.
The judgment comes six weeks after a one-day trial in which Wu initially contested the charges against him. In his closing statement, however, he said he understood and regretted the crimes and requested leniency.
In its statement, the court said Wu concealed the extent of his shareholding of Anbang Insurance and Anbang Property & Casualty Insurance Co Ltd. It said he also incited others to fake documents to mislead the regulator into approving the sale of some insurance products.
The downfall of Anbang, widely known for its splashy overseas acquisitions including the $1.95 billion purchase of the Waldorf Astoria, highlights the government's resolve in a sweeping campaign to reduce financial risk and discourage what it sees as profligate investing by large conglomerates.
Authorities officially seized control of Anbang and revealed the prosecution of Wu on Feb. 23. The state takeover would last for one year, during which Anbang will be managed by officials from financial regulators and government bodies.
In April, the banking and insurance regulator approved a 60.8 billion yuan capital injection for Anbang in a state-backed bailout aimed at smoothing the firm's transition following Wu's prosecution, and aiding government efforts to find private strategic investors.
Founded in 2004, Anbang became one of the most aggressive investors in a wave of major overseas acquisitions by Chinese firms in recent years that have attracted the attention of investors as well as global regulators.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks hit a three-week high on Thursday and turned positive for the year as rising oil prices gave energy firms a shot in the arm that countered the effects of increased political uncertainty. 
Brent crude rose to another 3-1/2 year high of $77.89 overnight amid fears of supply disruptions after President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and ordered sanctions be re-imposed. 
The dollar meanwhile eased slightly from 2018 highs ahead of U.S. April inflation numbers on Thursday and as currency markets eyed the Bank of England's policy meeting and inflation report. 
""It's difficult to know what the principal drivers are given there's a whole host of events, but it could well be that the effect of oil prices on resources companies is outweighing negatives elsewhere,"" said Investec economist Philip Shaw. 
""But I think the main thing the market is looking out for is whether growth in the global economy has peaked and is slowing down,"" he said, citing reduced growth data in the euro zone and Britain as examples. 
Energy shares led Asian stock indexes higher, pushing the 47-country MSCI world equity index to its highest level in three weeks. It is now positive on the year, up 0.3 percent from its starting level on Jan. 1. 
European shares largely took their cues from Asian and U.S. peers and rose, but the gains were tempered as British phone company BT reported disappointing results and Italian political worries weighed on sentiment. 
The pan European STOXX 600 Index started on the front foot but was 0.2 percent lower around midday, pulled down by Italian stocks, which fell 1.5 percent. 
Italian government debt also sold off sharply, with 10-year yields hitting a seven-week high as Italy's 5-Star Movement and the far-right League moved closer to forming a government of anti-establishment parties. 
A crucial obstacle was removed late on Wednesday when former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, the League's main ally, gave a green light to the talks, accepting a demand from 5-Star that his Forza Italia party take no part in the next government. 
In Malaysia, meanwhile, an alliance of opposition parties spearheaded by Mahathir Mohamad won the general election, putting the 92-year old strongman on course for a return to the prime minister's office he occupied for 22 years.
Over the past day the Malaysian ringgit has slid nearly 3 percent in the one-month non-deliverable forward market and the cost of insuring the country's debt against default has risen. 
BOE'S HOLDS RATES 
Britain's FTSE 100 index was flat on the day after the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold. It said weak growth during the snowy start to 2018 was likely to be only temporary, but that it wanted to see a pick-up in the next few months before raising borrowing costs.
The British central bank had until recently been expected by investors to hike rates this month. 
The BoE also cut growth and inflation forecasts for the coming years, pushing sterling lower. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve now remains the only major central bank that appears to be on course for rate hikes, with New Zealand's Reserve Bank saying it will keeping the Official Cash Rate (OCR) at 1.75 percent ""for some time to come"".
The New Zealand dollar retreated to a five-month low of $0.6915.
Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.6 percent, while Japan's Nikkei climbed 0.3 percent. South Korea's KOSPI rose 0.5 percent and Shanghai SSEC was 0.2 percent higher. 

Brent crude futures were up 0.8 percent to $77.66 a barrel, the highest since November 2014 and building on gains of about 3 percent on Wednesday. U.S. light crude futures were up 0.6 percent at $71.59. [O/R]

383,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 02:47AM ET</span>",Australia's AMP feels shareholder wrath over misconduct,"By Paulina Duran and Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Top Australian wealth manager AMP Ltd faced an investor revolt at its annual meeting on Thursday, with shareholders voting overwhelmingly against its executive pay plans in the wake of damaging revelations of board-level misconduct.
A director was also narrowly re-elected in the face of a sizeable protest vote as the company scrambles to restore trust amid allegations it charged fees for no service, doctored an independent report and lied to regulators.
The vote against the company's executive pay sets the 169-year-old company up for a possible board spill. If more than a quarter of shareholders vote against the pay proposal for two years running, they can call for the board to be removed.
""We've let you the shareholder down, we've let the company down and we've let the community down,"" Interim Executive Chairman Mike Wilkins told the two-and-a-half hour meeting in Melbourne.
AMP's share price has lost a sixth of its value, wiping A$2.1 billion ($1.6 billion) off the firm's market capitalization, since mid-April when an independent inquiry into Australia's financial sector exposed serious flaws in its governance, accountability and culture. The inquiry may recommend criminal charges.
Three directors quit this week including two facing re-election at Thursday's meeting, while the chairman, CEO and chief lawyer had already departed over the scandal.
The director re-elected on Thursday, Andrew Harmos, received 62 percent of the vote, well short of the near-unanimous support directors of large Australian companies usually get.
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager and AMP's second-largest shareholder, said in a statement that while Harmos ""bears some responsibility"" for the misconduct it supported his election to ensure the board could ""function appropriately"".
Investment manager Australian Ethical said it had offloaded its A$8 million stake in AMP, first instance of a divestment on ethical grounds from a financial firm cited in the inquiry. 
""AMP knowingly and deliberately misled regulators and there is sufficient evidence to show that these breaches are not isolated incidents,"" said Stuart Palmer, head of ethics research at Australian Ethical.
AMP shares closed down 2.9 percent, while the broader market finished up 0.2 percent.
LAWSUITS, COSTS 
The Royal Commission inquiry has exposed Australia's richest financial firms to unprecedented public scrutiny, raising costs and squeezing margins amid calls for tighter regulation and stiffer penalties.
AMP, whose name has been synonymous with financial planning in Australia for decades, said it would defend itself against two class-action lawsuits filed on behalf of shareholders seeking damages for the board's failure to disclose its governance issues sooner.
The lawsuits were filed by global law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Melbourne-based Phi Finney McDonald. 
Australian litigation financier IMF Bentham is also planning another class action against AMP.
Wilkins said costs likely would mount as the firm worked to resolve the issues identified by the inquiry.
AMP expected a review of the fees it paid financial planners would lead to further ""customer remediation costs and associated expenses"".
Some customers were closing their accounts, he added.
""Not surprisingly, we did see some increase in customer call-center enquiries and withdrawal requests, although this has eased back in recent days,"" he said.
One shareholder told Wilkins during the meeting that many investors would like to see the board roasted ""on a spit"".
""On a spit I don't think I'd be very tasty,"" responded Wilkins, a director who stepped into the CEO role after predecessor Craig Meller resigned in April.

384,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 02:55AM ET</span>",RBS reaches $4.9 billion deal to settle U.S. mortgage bond investigation,"By Nate Raymond, Eric Walsh and Sinead Cruise
WASHINGTON/BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) has agreed to pay a smaller-than-expected $4.9 billion to resolve a U.S. investigation into its sale of mortgage-backed securities, paving the way for a long-awaited return of cash to UK taxpayers who bankrolled its post-crisis survival.
RBS said that $3.46 billion of the proposed civil settlement would be covered by existing provisions and that the bank would take a $1.44 billion charge in the second quarter to cover the rest.
Analysts had estimated the U.S. Department of Justice could impose a fine of up to $12 billion on RBS for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
The agreement will draw a line under RBS's last outstanding major litigation issue, which had weighed on its share price, blocked dividend distributions to shareholders and complicated the UK government's plan to sell down its more than 70 percent stake.
Once the world's largest bank by assets, RBS was one of the biggest casualties of the financial crisis which crippled credit, stock and housing markets and upended the global economy.
It narrowly avoided insolvency in 2008 after the UK government agreed a 45 billion pound bailout, just six months after the bank tapped 12 billion pounds of emergency cash from shareholders. 
The government said in November it would begin the process of reprivatising the bailed-out lender by selling 3 billion pounds of shares before the end of the 2018-2019 fiscal year, in a much needed boost to finance minister Philip Hammond’s coffers.
Announcing the preliminary agreement on Wednesday, RBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan called the deal a ""milestone"".
""Removing the uncertainty over the scale of this settlement means that the investment case for this bank is much clearer,"" he said in a statement.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts, which led the investigation, confirmed it had reached an agreement in principle with RBS that would resolve potential civil claims related to mortgage-backed securities issued between 2005 and 2008.
""Further details remain to be negotiated, however, before a formal agreement can be reached,"" the office said.
The implosion of markets for residential mortgage-backed securities and related derivatives contributed to the global financial crisis and prompted a series of investigations by authorities including the U.S. Department of Justice.
The Department of Justice previously settled with banks including  Citigroup  (N:C),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM), Credit Suisse (N:CSGN),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), Goldman Sachs (N:GS), Bank of America (N:BAC) and  Barclays  (L:BARC).
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts had also been conducting a criminal investigation into RBS and former employees who were involved in structuring and selling the securities.
But the settlement that RBS and the office disclosed on Wednesday was only civil in nature, signaling no criminal charges were likely to result.
RBS in July 2017 agreed to pay $5.5 billion to resolve a lawsuit by the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency which claimed it misled the U.S. mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into buying mortgage-backed securities.
It resolved similar claims by the U.S. National Credit Union Administration related to mortgage-backed securities RBS sold to credit unions that later failed for $1.1 billion in 2016.

Recently, RBS also resolved investigations by the state attorneys general of California and New York for $125 million and $500 million, respectively.

385,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",Chinese firms slow to reduce share-backed loans despite regulator crackdown,"By Engen Tham and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese companies are only gradually reducing the amount of shares pledged for loans despite curbs by regulators as part of efforts to reduce the risk the deals pose to market stability.
More than 100 companies still have more than 50 percent of their shares pledged, according to Reuters analysis of official data, despite a cap fixed at that level which was introduced two months ago.
The practice of borrowing against big blocks of shares - also known as margin lending - jumped sharply last year in China as company founders and large shareholders used rising markets to fund loans for personal use or company business. The loans are advanced at a discount of as much as 50 percent to the market price of the collateral. 
Large pledges can risk destabilizing markets if borrowers cannot meet margin calls following price moves, leaving lenders free to dump the collateral - and to trigger a change of company ownership if the shareholding is large enough.
China's securities regulator introduced new rules in March that prevent any transaction from raising the proportion of pledged shares to above 50 percent of total shares.
But in spite of new restrictions, including on brokers' exposure as well as the 50-percent cap, a total of 131 companies with a combined market capitalization of 2.04 trillion yuan ($320.17 billion) still had more than 50 percent of their shares pledged as of the end of April.
Since the beginning of 2017, the number of listed Chinese firms with more than half their shares pledged has risen by 48 percent, according to analysis of China Depository Securities and Clearing data.
""A large number of listed firms changing ownership could cause instability in daily operations, which in turn could have a negative impact on share prices,"" said Meng Shen, director of Chanson & Co, a boutique investment bank.
Controlling shareholders of at least 24 listed firms had pledged at least 90 percent of their shares as of early May, according to Reuters analysis of market data, heightening the risk of a change of control if markets fall. 
Share-backed lending is common around the world, particularly in emerging markets where many companies are controlled by founding families.
Hong Kong regulators are also concerned about the scale of the borrowing. Julia Leung, deputy chief executive of the Securities and Futures Commission, said last week that there was HK$206 billion ($26.24 billion) worth of margin loans outstanding at the end of 2017, a nine-fold increase since 2006. 
""It is not only the amount, but also the quality of the collateral that is concerning us,"" she said. 
Leung added that the watchdog was particularly concerned about borrowers pledging shares from smaller, thinly-traded companies. That can leave markets vulnerable to sharp unexplained price moves and also gives lenders less security in the event of company difficulties.
In the mainland as in Hong Kong, the use of pledged shares has been most pronounced among smaller firms, who often have less access to bank credit.
A total of 54 companies listed on Shenzhen's tech-focused ChiNext board or its small and medium-sized enterprise board had more than 50 percent of their shares pledged - up 38 percent from 2016, when the practice waned following China's market crash in 2015.
Banks this year began tightening lending standards ahead of the rule changes, following a stock market tumble in early February that saw shares suffer their worst one-day fall in almost two years.
China Merchants Bank, the country's fifth-largest listed bank by market value, was one lender that did so, said two people with direct knowledge. 

""The discount of 30 to 50 percent remains the same, but it's tougher for an enterprise to qualify for this sort of loan,"" said one of the people, adding that some smaller companies were now unable to get them.

WASHINGTON/ZURICH (Reuters) - An attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels said he has additional evidence linking a Russian businessman to U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, as international and U.S. companies on Wednesday acknowledged large payments to Cohen's consulting firm.
Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG and U.S. telecommunications company AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) said they made payments to Cohen's firm, Essential Consultants, in efforts to gain intelligence into the Trump administration's thinking on issues affecting them. South Korea's Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd (KAI) said it hired the consultancy for services on accounting matters.
Novartis and AT&T said they were contacted by the office of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller about the situation in late 2017, and provided all the information requested. Both companies said they now consider the matter closed.
A senior official at Novartis told NBC News that Cohen reached out shortly after Trump's November 2016 election win ""promising access"" to the new administration. Boston-based Stat News also reported that then Novartis Chief Executive Officer Joe Jimenez instructed his team to strike a deal with Cohen.
A Democratic U.S. senator called for hearings about the company payments to the firm run by Cohen, a longtime attorney and self-described ""fixer"" for Trump. 
Payments to the companies ""may well have been used to influence the president of the United States, using Michael Cohen and his shell company as a conduit,"" Senator Richard Blumenthal said at a news conference.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, at a regular press briefing, referred questions about the reported payments to Trump's outside counsel. Asked whether Trump had taken any action to benefit Novartis, AT&T or KAI, Sanders said: ""Not that I'm aware of.""
The payments were first mentioned on Tuesday by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Daniels, who says she had a one-time sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 and was paid $130,000 by Cohen in October 2016 shortly before the elections in November to stay quiet about it. Trump denies having sex with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. She has sued both Trump and Cohen.
In television interviews with ABC News and MSNBC, Avenatti declined to say how he obtained information about the payments.
Cohen said a report published on Tuesday by Avenatti's law firm detailing the payments was inaccurate. In a court filing, Cohen's lawyer Stephen Ryan said Avenatti appears to have Cohen's actual bank records and questioned how he could have obtained them lawfully.
Bank records of the company payments to Cohen's firm and payments from Columbus Nova LLC, a New York-based investment firm linked to Russian businessman Viktor Vekselberg should be released, Avenatti said in the interviews.
Vekselberg, who has ties to the Kremlin, and his Renova Group conglomerate were sanctioned by the United States in April, freezing assets of up to $2 billion.
A lawyer for Columbus Nova has said Vekselberg had nothing to do with the transaction Avenatti said amounted to $500,000.
Novartis admitted it made a costly mistake in making payments totaling nearly $1.2 million to Cohen's firm. Trump took office in January 2017 and Novartis signed a one-year contract a month later. After meeting with Cohen in March 2017, Novartis determined the firm was not going to be able to provide the type of U.S. healthcare policy information it was seeking.
""In hindsight, this must be seen as a mistake,"" Novartis spokesman Michael Willi told Reuters, making sure to note that the arrangement was struck under former CEO Jimenez and in no way connected to new CEO Vas Narasimhan.
GAINING INSIGHTS
AT&T confirmed payments of $200,000 to Essential Consultants, although a source familiar with the matter told Reuters it likely paid more than that and could total as much as $600,000. South Korea's KAI said on Wednesday it paid $150,000 to Cohen's firm.
AT&T said it hoped to gain ""insights"" into the new administration at a time when it sought approval from antitrust regulators for an $85 billion purchase of  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX).
U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the top Democrats on antitrust subcommittees, wrote to the Department of Justice on Wednesday urging investigation of the payments, including whether there were efforts to influence the department.
""This is not the first time that questions have arisen regarding potential interference by this administration in antitrust law enforcement,"" the lawmakers said.
Washington’s influence industry is jammed with consultants hired by corporations and trade associations to provide government intelligence about elected officials. Often, they provide information about the inner-workings of an important government office, such as the White House and leadership in Congress.
By choosing not to communicate directly with elected officials on behalf of corporate clients, consultants are not required to register with the government and report lobbying. This form of consulting grew dramatically under former President Barack Obama, who imposed regulations barring lobbyists from taking government jobs or entering the White House.
The U.S. Treasury Department's inspector general's office said on Wednesday it opened an investigation into whether confidential banking records involving Cohen may have been leaked. The Washington Post first reported the investigation.
U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion by people associated with Trump, who denies any coordination between Moscow and his campaign. The Kremlin denies meddling in the election.
Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to once again decry news coverage about him. One post said that ""despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy & all things else, 91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake).""

(Reuters) - A former clerk at the Wall Street law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett was sentenced on Wednesday to 37 months in prison for his role in an insider trading ring that passed merger tips on napkins and Post-it notes in New York's Grand Central Terminal.
Steven Metro, 44, formerly of Katonah, New York, was resentenced three months after the federal appeals court in Philadelphia threw out his original 46-month term, finding a lack of proof he was responsible for all $5.6 million of alleged illegal profit from the five-year scheme.
Prosecutors said Metro leaked transactions involving Simpson Thacher clients to mortgage broker Frank Tamayo, who passed the tips to former  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) stockbroker Vladimir Eydelman at Grand Central's main clock.
Tamayo would then chew up the papers on which tips were written, prosecutors said.
U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp in Trenton, New Jersey, who imposed the sentence, also ordered Metro to serve three years of supervised release.
Metro has been incarcerated in a federal detention center in Philadelphia, and according to his lawyer, Lawrence Lustberg, is expected to move to a halfway house within a month.
""As he expressed to the court today, his imprisonment has given him the chance to re-order his priorities and he has learned - as he said, 'the hard way' - that family is much more important than money,"" Lustberg said in an email.
Metro pleaded guilty in November 2015. Eydelman and Tamayo also pleaded guilty and were sentenced to three years and one year in prison, respectively.

Shipp had also imposed the original 46-month prison term. Prosecutors agreed that a 37-month term was now appropriate.

389,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Happy Mother's Day - paying the 'motherhood penalty',"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO - If mom arrives at this year’s Mother’s Day gathering looking like she needs less stress and more relaxation, resist the urge to tell her to leave her job.
Study after study shows that women who leave the workforce, whether it is to care for children or to retire early with a spouse, take a hefty financial hit.
The price women pay for raising a family has been dubbed the “motherhood penalty,"" with numerous academic studies quantifying the impact in thousands of dollars.
Over a lifetime, mothers with one child earn 28 percent less than childless women, according to a recent study led by Matthew Rutledge for the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. For each additional child, women lose another 3 percent. 
The sacrifice in dollars is startling. Women without children are paid a median of $3,850 a month; mothers earn about $1,278 less each month, according to Rutledge. 
That can leave women vulnerable in divorce and widowhood. Simply having one child erodes a woman’s Social Security benefits by 16 percent, and another 2 percent goes away with each additional child, according to Rutledge. 
Since Social Security is a major source of retirement income for most widows, losing 16 percent is significant.
The motherhood penalty occurs when women leave jobs altogether or move to part-time work for a period while raising children. Then, as they re-enter the workforce, they find themselves behind on both pay and career level. 
The impact is the worst for professional women, especially lawyers and engineers, according to the U.S. Census.
The good news: If women work long enough, they start closing the gap as they hit their peak earnings years in their 50s and 60s, according to research by Nicole Maestas, associate professor of health policy at Harvard Medical School. 
The trouble is, however, that many married women do not give themselves a chance to make up for the income they sacrificed as mothers, Maestas said. They tend to retire at the same time as their spouses, even though they are often younger.
For about half of married women, retirement comes before age 62. That is the age when some Social Security benefits start at a level that is 26.7 percent below the full retirement age – currently 66 years and 4 months.
KEY WORKING YEARS
These women cut themselves off from the key working years that allow them to catch up on earnings along with future pension and Social Security checks. 
According to Maestas, women retiring at 62 give up almost $200,000 in pay, on average, that they could have earned on the job if they worked five more years and saved for retirement. In addition, retiring at age 62 cuts lifetime Social Security benefits.
The reality hits many women when it is too late to make a difference.
“I’ve seen horrific situations,” said Cindy Hounsell, president of the Women’s Institute for a Secure Retirement. 
Case in point: a couple Hounsell knows who thought they would be OK when they retired. They did not save for retirement, but rather thought they would depend on flipping houses – a plan that backfired with sharp losses during the financial crisis.
The husband, 75, now has Parkinson’s while his wife has lung problems. They live on $48,000 in Social Security payments, based on his years running a small business along with the spousal benefits the wife receives. 
With no extra money for help, the wife must lift her husband in and out of the back seat of their car when they must go to medical visits. 
“They are living hand to mouth,” Hounsell said. 
Her message to younger women is: save for retirement starting in your 20s, even if finances are tight and you have no 401(k) or retirement savings plan through a job.
“If you stay home to raise children, make sure your husband funds a Roth IRA fully for you each year,"" Hounsell said.
Spouses with jobs or businesses can put as much as $5,500 into an IRA or Roth IRA each year for a non-working spouse. Roth IRAs during retirement are attractive because withdrawals are not taxed. 

And before retiring, maximize Social Security benefits. Said Hounsell: “When people first retire, they feel like everything will be OK, but then health problems happen, things you didn’t expect happen, and you need all the money you can get.""

Mahathir, Malaysia’s longest-serving premier who defected to the opposition to take on Najib, will return to power at the age of 92. His four-party Pakatan Harapan alliance won at least 112 of 222 parliamentary seats in Wednesday’s vote, official figures from the election commission showed.
“We are not seeking revenge,” Mahathir said. “What we want to do is to restore the rule of law.”
Khairy Jamaluddin, a member of Najib’s cabinet, said the prime minister plans to hold a press conference on Thursday.
“We’re going to accept the will of the people,” he said. “Whatever it is, we need to respect the will of the people.”
The result represents a monumental shift in a nation long defined by racial politics that hasn’t seen a transfer of power since independence in 1957. It’s also a win for democracy in Southeast Asia, where generals and authoritarian leaders often lock up opponents and stifle free speech.
“It’s a new beginning for Malaysia,"" said Ahmad Martadha Mohamed, an associate professor at Universiti Utara Malaysia College of Law.
Markets Hit
The outcome may be bad news for investors who had bet on a Najib victory, sending the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index near a record high on the eve of the election. As results signaled a win for Mahathir, iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF based on the nation’s stocks dropped as much as 2.6 percent to the lowest since February.
Markets are expected to be closed Thursday and Friday after the government declared public holidays. Malaysia’s police advised political parties to not hold rallies that could jeopardize public order.
Mahathir on Wednesday implored government officials to “do what is right according to the constitution and the laws of this country.” He had previously run the country from 1981 to 2003, and wielded power even after he stepped down.
The vote showed that Mahathir still knows how to win elections. The victory was dominant: He swept traditional government strongholds like Johor, Kedah and Negeri Sembilan and neutralized Najib’s advantage in the Borneo states of Sabah and Sarawak.
What’s more, Mahathir appeared to decisively win over ethnic Malay voters that had long underpinned the ruling party’s success. The mostly ethnic Chinese Democratic Action Party, previously the largest opposition party, was on pace to win fewer seats than in 2013.
For Mahathir, the fight against his former protege was particularly ugly. The two fell out over a myriad policy issues, including Najib’s decision to abolish the Internal Security Act, his performance in the 2013 general election and a money laundering scandal involving state investment firm 1MDB. Najib has denied wrongdoing.
Ahead of Wednesday’s vote, Mahathir had called Najib a “thief” who “lives in fear even of my photos.” Najib countered by saying Mahathir is “obsessive about control, calling the shots.”
On the campaign trail, the opposition mainly focused on bread-and-butter issues. Najib faced rising discontent over a goods-and-services tax that helped inflation accelerate last year at nearly the fastest pace in a decade.
‘Headache’
What comes next is unclear. Mahathir helms an unwieldy four-party coalition that includes Malaysia’s largest ethnic Chinese party, and he plans to step aside once de facto opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim gets out of jail on a sodomy charge. Mahathir said he would seek a pardon for Anwar.
“I have to manage four presidents of four different parties,” Mahathir said. “It’s going to be a headache.”
Mahathir has pledged to set term limits for prime minister and reduce its power, while promising to scrap the GST within 100 days in power.
It’s uncertain whether the outcome will fundamentally reshape race relations in Malaysia. Najib’s party had long staked its legitimacy on providing preferential treatment for the bumiputera, or “sons of the soil,” which include ethnic Malays and indigenous groups.
Mak Hon Hoe, a 46-year-old ethnic Chinese voter, on Wednesday deplored the fact that Malaysians were separated in different racial categories.
“I want to see a fairer system,” he said while casting his ballot. “Race is still an issue. We want a Malaysian identity.”"

(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's (O:FOXA), the media and entertainment company controlled by Rupert Murdoch, reported quarterly revenue that beat analysts' estimate on Wednesday, as higher fees from cable and satellite distributors drove cable business earnings to a record high.
Fox, which agreed to sell the bulk of its film and TV assets to Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) last year in a $52.4 billion deal, expects to ask for shareholder approval of the transaction this summer, Lachlan Murdoch, executive chair, said on an analyst call. 
Murdoch declined to comment on reports that Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) is preparing an all-cash rival offer for the assets, which Reuters first reported Monday 
Fox expects to receive UK regulatory approval on its bid to buy the remaining stake it does not already own of European pay-TV provider (L:SKYB) in the next couple of months, James Murdoch, chief executive officer of Twenty-First Century Fox, said on the call. Comcast this week notified regulators of its plans to bid for Sky.
""Given Comcast's bid for Sky, we are considering our options,"" James Murdoch said, adding that the company would make an announcement in ""due course."" 
Revenue from Fox's cable division, which houses the Fox News and FX channels among others, rose 9.8 percent to $4.42 billion, accounting for more than half of total revenue in the fiscal third quarter ended March 31.
That beat analysts' average estimate of $4.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Despite the departure of former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly amid sexual misconduct allegations last spring, prime-time ratings of Fox News have held up when looking at April compared to the year-ago period, Lachlan Murdoch said. 
""That's a real testament to the strength of the brand and obviously the strength of the talent on air,"" he said.
The company reported revenue of $3.51 billion in affiliate fees, a rise of 11 percent from a year earlier.
Revenue at its television unit, which houses Fox Broadcasting, was $1.15 billion, down 32 percent from the year-ago quarter, which included the Super Bowl, and missed analysts' estimate of $1.28 billion.
Total revenue fell 2 percent to $7.42 billion, but beat estimates of $7.4 billion.
Net income attributable to shareholders increased to $858 million, or 46 cents per share, from $799 million, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding items, Fox earned 49 cents per share, missing analysts' estimate of 53 cents per share.

Fox shares were flat in after-hours trading.

397,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",Ford chairman says 'fairly large' changes in store for automaker,"By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) shareholders should expect ""fairly large"" changes in the coming year, Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. told Reuters, building on the automaker's moves to discontinue some North American models and boost electric vehicle investment.
The automaker has promised to cut costs overall but still faces questions about lagging performance in certain regions and calls for more details on its restructuring. Its shares http://tmsnrt.rs/1Nxqa9k have barely budged since Chief Executive Jim Hackett took the helm last year. 
""It could be regions, it could be functions, it could be areas of emphasis,"" Ford said in an interview. ""We’ve done some big things, and we still have some big things to do."" 
The automaker lost $4 billion in South America from 2013 through the first quarter of this year, and its chief of global operations said in January it was ""exploring every option you can imagine.""
Analysts have also urged an overhaul of European passenger car operations to help Ford reach its 8 percent pre-tax profit margin goal.
Bill Ford said the automaker will be able to use cost savings to return cash to shareholders, invest in new technology and businesses and fund restructuring.
""We believe we can take care of all three,"" he said. 
Hackett since January has outlined plans to cut costs by a cumulative $25.5 billion by 2022 and prune Ford's list of North American sedans and compact cars, while boosting investments in electric vehicles and its product lineup in China. 
The company plans to invest $11 billion in new electric vehicles by 2022, but cut overall capital spending by $5 billion over 2019 to 2022, a nearly 15 percent reduction from the prior plan.
Savings from discontinuing unprofitable passenger car models in North America will help pay for a fresher lineup of models, new electric vehicles and technology-driven ventures, Bill Ford said.
""We are adding lots and lots of new models, to the point where we are going to have in 18 months to two years one of the freshest showrooms in the industry,"" Ford said. 
Ford, like rivals, is investing in building more electric vehicles and automated driving systems. It is also investing in a network that can be used as the platform for transportation services. 
The company last month indicated it is spending about $160 million a quarter on mobility services efforts and autonomous vehicles.
Responding to criticism from environmental groups over a shift in the company's lineup to sport utility vehicles, Bill Ford said the new models will be more efficient than those they replace.
""Already some of the SUVs are more efficient than their counterparts on the car side,"" he said.
LEARNING CURVE
Some analysts earlier this year expressed frustration with Hackett for not sharing more details of his restructuring plans.
Hackett had a learning curve in a new industry where decisions involve factors including regulation, currency risks, trade concerns and complex supply chains, Ford said. 
""I'm really pleased how quickly that learning curve has flattened out,"" he said. 
Shareholders will have an opportunity to ask questions via teleconference when Ford leads an annual meeting on Thursday, a year after he introduced former  Steelcase Inc  (N:SCS) CEO Hackett to lead the company, replacing Mark Fields.
Ford shares have not recovered from a hit in January after Hackett and other executives forecast 2018 results that disappointed analysts and investors, and are down 10 percent year to date. 
And despite overall profitability, Ford's market capitalization of $44 billion trails unprofitable Silicon Valley electric car maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), which has a market capitalization of $51.3 billion, a reflection of investor doubts that Ford can re-ignite growth.
Ford shares fell nearly 2 percent on Wednesday after the company said production of its highly profitable Super Duty and F-150 pickup trucks would be temporarily shut down because of a fire at a key parts maker's plant.

398,By Investing.com,"<span>May 09, 2018 04:04PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. Consumer Inflation, Jobless Claims on Tap
The fallout from the United States’ decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal did little to sway sentiment on risker assets as a risk-on rally emerged across U.S. stocks, supported by a sharp rise in the oil majors.
Consumer inflation data will be in focus on Thursday after a PPI report on Wednesday fell short of economists' estimates.
Economists expect the core consumer price index (CPI) due 08:30am ET, to remain unchanged at 0.2%, while core year-on-year CPI is expected show a rise of 2.2% from 2.1% in March.
The subdued PPI data on Wednesday scaled back investor expectations for a strong CPI print as consumer prices were likely weighed by falling input costs.
The Labor Department, meanwhile, releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance due 08:30 am ET for the week ended May 4, expected to show jobless claims rose to 219,000 from 211,000 the prior week.
The dollar was flat against its rivals on Wednesday as a sharp uptick in the Canadian dollar, stifled the greenback’s upside momentum.
GBP/USD will likely play a role in dollar direction on Thursday as the Bank of England is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates following a recent spate of softer U.K economic data.
2. Natural Gas Inventories, Ongoing Crude Rally in Focus
Natural gas prices traded roughly unchanged on Wednesday ahead of data expected to show an increase in natural gas storage for the second week in a row.
The Energy Information Agency’s weekly natural gas storage report is expected show gas storage rose by 91 billion cubic feet last week.
Natural gas prices are expected to remain flat for at least the next few weeks, according to National Alliance.
“Natural gas will likely remain below $3.00 in 2018 on a continued robust supply ramp despite very low storage,” National Alliance said.
The ongoing fallout from the United States’ decision to abandon the Iranian nuclear deal will likely continue to dominate direction in oil prices. The impact to global crude supplies of U.S. sanctions on Iran remained uncertain as Saudi Arabia reportedly pledged to plug the potential gap in supplies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday major oil price hikes were unlikely because some countries were willing to increase output to offset potential losses.
Crude futures settled 3% higher as crude supplies fell for the first time in three weeks.
3. The New Kid on the Block: Dropbox Earnings Eyed
Dropbox is slated to report its maiden first-quarter earnings following its debut on the stock market less than two months ago in late-March. 
Analysts expect the cloud company to report earnings of 4 cents a share and GAAP losses of $2.16 a share on revenue of $309.2 million.
Average revenue per user (ARPU) – an important metric that indicates margin growth – will likely garner the bulk of investor attention.
Analysts expect Dropbox to report first-quarter ARPU growth of 2% to $113.20, while the cloud company is expected to report 140,000 new user additions for the quarter, which would take its total paying user count to 11.12 million.
Dropbox Inc (NASDAQ:DBX) closed at $31.40, up 3.87% on Wednesday."
399,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 08:29PM ET</span>","CalSTRS opts to engage assault weapon retailers, not immediate divestment","By Robin Respaut
(Reuters) - The California State Teachers' Retirement System decided on Wednesday to publicly engage retailers of military-style assault weapons in the wake of public outcry over mass shootings, as opposed to immediately reducing investments in these companies.
The decision by the nation’s second largest pension fund came after California State Treasurer John Chiang urged CalSTRS to use ""the power of its purse strings"" and ""deny weapons of mass carnage to another killer stalking our innocent loved ones.""
The pension fund has already divested from firearms manufacturers, but the board said that with retailers, it preferred to take a high-profile engagement strategy. 
The plan calls for the fund to hire two new positions devoted to actively engaging retailers. It allows the board to reconsider divestment if it ""fails to achieve an acceptable outcome,"" but did not specify what would be considered unsuccessful engagement. 
The plan would prioritize ""a public communication plan to highlight areas of firearm concern and applaud responsive companies."" 
“Unlike other CalSTRS engagements, where our staff practices quiet diplomacy, this plan advances a more public approach, to leverage the public pressure that has been mounting in this country in response to recent tragic gun violence,” said Harry Keiley, CalSTRS' Investment Committee Chair. “We encourage other institutional investors to consider conducting similar activities.”
CalSTRS' decision follows a vote by the California Public Employees' Retirement System board in March to not divest in assault rifle retailers and wholesalers, saying the move would do little to reduce gun violence.
Both proposals were pushed by Chiang, who is running for governor of California. 
CalSTRS', in documents discussed on Wednesday, noted exposure to retailers and wholesalers of assault-style rifles exceeds $420 million, the majority of it passively held in an investment in Walmart Inc (N:WMT).
However, two weeks after February's mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, Walmart amended its firearms sales policy by raising the minimum age for purchasing firearms and ammunition to 21 years. Walmart ended sales of modern sporting rifles, including the AR-15, in 2015, the company said in a February statement. It doesn't sell handguns, except in Alaska.
The CalSTRS board on Wednesday listened to statements from about a dozen members of the public, including teachers, parents, and family members of victims of mass shootings, who called on the board ""to be an agent of change"" by supporting divestment.
In 2013, CalSTRS divested from publicly traded companies that manufactured firearms after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
Following the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, weapon manufacturers, too, have been under increasing scrutiny to acknowledge a growing public discourse over weapon sales to the public. 
Sturm Ruger & Co (N:RGR) executives said on Wednesday a majority of investors backed a shareholder resolution calling for the company to produce a safety report, a rare rebuke to management and the first time in memory such as resolution passed at a publicly traded gunmaker.

The pension fund's total portfolio reached $222.5 billion as of March 31.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are threatening to break above a declining trendline that has contained the bonds for more than 30 years. That may mark the beginning of a long-term bear market, though confirming such a trend could take years.
Expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at least two more times this year and surging Treasury issuance as the U.S. government finances worsening trade and budget deficits has roiled bonds and sent 10-year yields to their highest levels in more than four years.
Those yields broke back above 3 percent on Wednesday and are likely to increase further to at least the 3.50 percent level. If the Fed adopts a more aggressive view of the economy, yields would rise even further.
“It’s a fairly consensus view now that yields are heading higher,” said Jason Hunter, chief technical strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Whether the move is the beginning of a structural bear market is less certain. There is no official mark that would define when a bear market has begun, and whether we are headed into one may depend on the next economic downturn - and how the Fed responds to it.
“We won’t know until the full extent of the next Fed easing cycle,” Hunter said. “It’s not going to be clear cut that we don’t come back and revisit the low yields that we saw with this particular cycle.”
There are signs, however, that bode badly for bonds.
Five- and 10-year note yields both ended last month with a bullish outside month, denoting when the month's range is first lower and then higher than the prior month and subsequently closes the month above the prior month's highs.
That signals that further yield increases are likely.
“It is a very strong signal that we’re going to continue to see these yields push higher in the months ahead,” said Tom Fitzpatrick, chief technical strategist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
Fitzpatrick notes the bull market in bonds endured for 35 years, from 1981, when 10-year yields were over 15 percent, to the low of 1.31 percent in 2016. 
That is consistent with the time of the previous bear market, from 1946 to 1981, when yields increased from less than 2 percent to over 15 percent in the same time frame, suggesting bonds move in the same long-term cycle.
Ten-year yields also appear to have made a double bottom, dropping to 1.38 percent in 2012 and 1.31 percent in 2016, and have ceased forming the lower highs and lower lows that marked the declining yield trend.
“Everything suggests a loss in momentum in the downtrend,” Fitzpatrick said. “While I think that’s a work in progress, I think there is more than enough dynamic here to at least suggest that it could be a more structural bear market in fixed income developing.”
Moves in the yield curve will be watched for indications on when the U.S. economy is likely heading for a recession, and a new cycle of Fed easing.
JPMorgan’s Hunter sees a possibility that the two-year, 10-year yield curve will invert by early next year. That typically precedes an equity downturn by around nine months to 1-1/2 years, which then leads to an economic downturn and Fed easing.
“Only at that point can you really get an understanding that yields are now starting to make higher yield highs, higher yield lows on a longer-term basis, and starting a new secular trend,” Hunter said.
Citi’s Fitzpatrick, meanwhile, expects the housing and stock markets, which are typically the cause of major economic downturns, to continue to do well for several more years, with the yield curve flattening further - at least in the near term.
If 10-year yields rise over 4 percent, which is the top of the trading range since the 2008 lows, then “you’re beginning to think this is something much more important,” Fitzpatrick said.
The best indicator for a major downturn would be the inversion of the two-year and five-year yield curve, which has preceded each major downturn in recent history, Fitzpatrick said.

These have included the savings and loan housing crisis of the 1980s, the stock market implosion in 2000 and the financial crisis of 2007-2009, when in each instance the two-year, five-year yield curve inverted by approximately 20 basis points.

405,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 09, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",China Food Giant Is Said to Expand in Brazil Amid U.S. Tensions,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s food giant Cofco International is positioning itself to increase soybean purchases from Brazil as trade tensions escalate between the U.S. and the Asian nation, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
Cofco has strengthened its team that buys, stores and sells farmer crops, known as origination, in the South American country, recently hiring as many as 12 people to work directly with farmers in Mato Grosso, Goias, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul states, said the person, who asked not to be named because the information isn’t public. Brazil is the world’s largest soybean exporter.
While China has yet to implement its planned tariffs on imports of U.S. soybeans, the country’s traders are already canceling American shipments, according to U.S. government figures. The data reinforced comments from the chief executive officer of grain-trading behemoth Bunge Ltd., who said last week that China has essentially stopped buying U.S. supplies.
China is the world’s biggest buyer of soybeans, used in everything from cooking oil to animal feed. The nation announced the planned tariffs against U.S. shipments last month, and since then speculation has mounted that the Asian country will be become even more reliant on Brazilian crops.
Most of Cofco’s new hires are experienced, having worked for rivals such as Bunge and Louis Dreyfus Co., the person said. Cofco already has a team of about 350 people within its commercial department in Brazil, including at warehouses in the countryside.
A Cofco spokesman declined to comment on the company’s business development. On its website, Cofco says increasing its origination capabilities is key to its business strategy.
Cofco Emerges as Leading Exporter of Brazil Soy
While century-old traders like Bunge and Louis Dreyfus took decades to build a leading position in Brazil’s oilseed market, Cofco has been able to attain a similar status within just the last couple of years. Shipping line-up data signal that the Chinese company in 2017 exported more than Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Cargill Inc. and Louis Dreyfus, -- the A, the C and the D in the so-called ABCD quartet that dominates global agricultural trade. It’s become the No. 3 exporter, trailing only Bunge , the B, and Tokyo-based Marubeni Corp.
As Cofco increases its abilities to source directly from farmers, it’s also seeking to improve logistics for shipping from Brazil. The company is consolidating port operations at two neighboring terminals it currently uses in Santos Port, the largest in Latin America, the person said. Cofco is seeking the renewal of its port concessions that are expected to expire in coming years, allowing for investment to increase export capacity, the person said.
Cofco’s expansion stands in contrast to Japanese trader Mitsui & Co., which this week said it plans to cease all operations for its grain business in Brazil by the end of December 2018 amid poor performance in the origination business."

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's quarterly earnings will be affected by shutdowns at three U.S. truck plants caused by a fire at a key parts supplier, the U.S. automaker said on Wednesday, while affirming its full-year earnings estimate.
""We're confident that any impacts will be short term,"" said Joe Hinrichs, president of Ford global operations, in a media call late Wednesday.
Hinrichs and purchasing director Hau Thai Tang said Ford was working with the supplier, Chinese-owned Meridian Magnesium Products, to shift production of the affected parts to other suppliers until the fire-damaged plant in Eaton Rapids, Michigan, can be repaired and production resumed.
A Meridian plant in Strathroy, Ontario, is among those sites that will temporarily make lightweight parts for the Ford F-150 and Super Duty pickups, as well as the Expedition, Navigator, Explorer, Flex and MKT utility vehicles.
Meridian could not be reached for comment.
Ford has closed truck plants in Kansas City, Missouri, and Louisville, Kentucky, and will shutter a third, in Dearborn, Michigan, on Wednesday evening. Expedition and Navigator remain in production in Louisville, Ford said.
Ford shares closed down 1.9 percent at $11.06. 
The May 2 fire, whose cause is being investigated by local authorities, triggered smaller production disruptions to other vehicle manufacturers, including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW AG, the companies said on Wednesday.
But the most significant impact was felt by Ford, whose F-150 full-size pickup is the best-selling vehicle in the United States. The vehicle generated $41 billion in revenue last year, about 28 percent of total sales and the lion's share of its profits.
Meridian supplies several lightweight structural parts for the Ford trucks and utility vehicles, including an engine compartment reinforcement piece for the full-size F-series pickups.
Hinrichs said it would be at least several days and perhaps longer before alternate sites will produce the affected parts.
A two-week production halt for the F-series could slice as much as $310 million from Ford's second-quarter profits, Buck Research analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote in a note Wednesday. 
Hinrichs said Ford has an 84-day supply of F-series pickups at U.S. dealers so ""we don't anticipate losing any sales."" He said Ford should be able to make up the lost production later in the year by running overtime.
Fiat Chrysler said on Wednesday the fire affected production of the Chrysler Pacifica minivan in Windsor, Ontario, adding it was ""adjusting production schedules as needed to minimize plant downtime (and) will make up any lost production.""
GM said on Wednesday it had temporarily halted production of Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana full-size vans at its Wentzville, Missouri, plant because of parts shortages caused by the fire.
Daimler and BMW acknowledged that they also had parts shortages from Meridian, resulting in minor production disruptions at their U.S. plants in Alabama and South Carolina.

Meridian, owned by Chinese supplier Wanfeng Auto Holding Group [WFAHG.UL], also provides parts to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc among others, according to the websites of Meridian and Wanfeng.

Kirby joined the group in 2016 from British high-speed rail project HS2 to take up a newly created post and was tasked with a ""group-wide transformation agenda"".
""As we update our organization and move to more empowered business units with a much leaner center, it has become clear that we no longer need the Group Chief Operating Officer role for which Simon Kirby was recruited in autumn 2016"", Chief Executive Warren East said in the memo.
East has been trying to reshape Rolls during his three years in charge after declines in some of its older aero-engine programs and plunging demand for oil equipment.

""I want to thank Simon for his huge contribution to reducing central costs as part of the transformation program, despite in doing so, working himself out of his own role"", East said.

410,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 01:35AM ET</span>","Xerox board seeks better terms from Fujifilm, will resume talks","By Sonam Rai and Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Xerox (NYSE:XRX) Corp's board said on Wednesday it intended to resume merger discussions with Fujifilm Holdings, seeking a superior deal to terms announced at the end of January that have spurred a proxy fight over the company.
Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, who own 15 percent of Xerox, have been trying to unravel the deal and unlock more value out the company. Asserting the Fujifilm deal values Xerox at just $28 per share, they said this week they would consider an all-cash bid of at least $40 per share.
Analysts say the prolonged fight for Xerox could ultimately push higher any offer price from Fujifilm or other interested parties. Buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC considered a bid for Xerox last week, sources have said.
Fujifilm said on Thursday it has not yet received a new proposal from Xerox and believes the current deal provides the best value for the shareholders of both firms.
""If we receive a new proposal, we will need to study whether it offers value to the shareholders of Fujifilm,"" it said in a statement.
The two companies in January agreed to a complex $6.1 billion deal that would merge Xerox into their Asia joint venture Fuji Xerox, which Fujifilm would control with a 50.1 percent stake. Xerox shareholders were also due to receive a $2.5 billion special cash dividend.
The firms have not, however, disclosed a per share valuation for Xerox for the deal.
UBS analysts estimated in February that the deal valued Xerox at $40 a share - $9.80 in cash for every Xerox share held and calculated the stake in the proposed new Fuji Xerox to be worth $30. That value mostly matches the current demands of the activist shareholders, except they want it all in cash.
Shannon Cross from Cross Research said an incremental five dollars plus benefit from synergies from the Fuji-Xerox deal should result over time in a value for Xerox stock that would be above the $40 per share.
""At the end of the day, Carl Icahn has always wanted more money for this deal, I am not sure that running the business is what he looks to do,"" said Cross.
While some Tokyo-based analysts say Fujifilm would be better off putting its money into its non-copier and printer businesses, others argue that the Japanese firm, which relies on the joint venture for nearly half of its revenue, should cede to the activist shareholders' demands.
Xerox had at one stage reopened talks on the deal with Fujifilm but those discussions were suspended after Deason won a temporary court order blocking the deal. The judge said, however, that Xerox was not prohibited from exploring other transactions with Fujifilm.
Xerox said on Wednesday that it will pursue an appeal of the lower court's ruling in the Deason lawsuit, which it believes ""was wrongly decided and will be reversed"".
Fujifilm is also pursuing an appeal.
Shares of Xerox closed 1.6 percent higher at $28.96 on Wednesday. Fujfilm's shares were flat in Thursday afternoon trade.

Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg downplayed the loss of jetliner sales to Iranian air carriers caused by President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.
Muilenburg said Wednesday that his company had not committed production slots for the Iranian orders of Boeing’s 777 widebody and 737 MAX jetliners and would continue to “follow the U.S. government’s lead” when it comes to Iran.
Shares rose as Muilenburg spoke during a luncheon event put on by the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. They were at $345.29, up 2.1 percent in New York trading at 1:28 p.m.
The Trump administration moved Tuesday to reimpose sanctions on the Islamic Republic that had been lifted as part of a multinational nuclear pact negotiated during the Obama administration.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Tuesday the measures would include cancelling export licenses issued to Boeing and rival Airbus SE to sell about $40 billion worth of jetliners to Iranian carriers.
Muilenburg said it was “very important” that the cancellations applied to both companies, preserving ""a level playing field."""

LONDON/ZURICH/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Nestle's (S:NESN) $7 billion licensing deal for Starbucks' (O:SBUX) retail business gives it a much-needed boost in its battle against JAB, the privately owned investment firm stirring up the coffee industry with a string of deals. JAB, the family office of Europe's billionaire Reimann clan, has built up the world's second-largest coffee business over the past five years.
It controls packaged brands such as Kenco and Douwe Egberts; retail chains like Peet's and Espresso House; and Keurig, the leading at-home single-serve brewer system in the United States. 
JAB is unlikely to make another major move right away, analysts say, as it is still busy with a giant deal to buy soft-drink maker Dr Pepper Snapple, turning its coffee fortress into a wider drinks empire.
This may help blunt the blow of Nestle's incursion onto its home U.S. turf. But JAB is expected to keep growing, especially now that Starbucks will get super-charged by Nestle. 
""There is no other brand like Starbucks so we would expect JAB to respond by continuing to innovate and acquire businesses to increase the breadth of their offering and their resources for innovation,"" said Christopher Rossbach, chief investment officer at London-based private investment office J. Stern, a long-term Nestle shareholder.
Coffee is one of the few bright spots in a drab packaged food landscape. Because it is still fragmented, analysts and bankers expect more deals to come in a category fueled by young consumers. How Nestle and JAB position themselves against growing competition will determine their future success. 
""It's two players in an arms race, each looking for ways to reinforce their positions,"" said Will Hayllar, partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants. 
Nestle, the world leader by far, has risen to the challenges as its flagship instant Nescafe has been overtaken by fancier brews, with new products such as barista-style Nescafe Azera coffee and its mass-market Nescafe Dolce Gusto brewer system. 
It has also launched Nespresso Vertuoline, catering to American tastes for big servings, and relaunched the Nescafe brand globally. 
But the licensing deal with Starbucks is its boldest step yet.
It bolsters Nestle in the United States where it was weak, and gives it a presence in ""roast and ground"" coffee, big in grocery stores and food-service outlets. 
""Both of these areas are JAB territory so it carries the competitive fight there,"" said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox.
A spokesman for JAB in New York played down the impact. 
""Starbucks has always had a well-run consumer goods business, and we are sure after this deal under Nestle it will continue to be a well-run business,"" the spokesman said. ""It has no impact on JAB.""
EVOLVING STRATEGY
With more than 10 acquisitions, JAB has sought a presence anywhere coffee is drunk - at home, in restaurants or on the go. It has taken big gulps, like the Dutch coffee business spun off from Sara Lee, and small sips, like high-end U.S. roaster Intelligentsia. 
Thanks to Dr Pepper's distribution network, it will be able to flood grocery stores, convenience stores and restaurants with its coffee. This could help boost margins at the U.S.-focused Dr Pepper business, as many Americans cut back on sugary sodas. 
""JAB is now moving into a broader drinks business. It's interesting because the strategies are diverging a bit,"" said Stanislas Duquesnoy, senior credit officer at Moody's and lead analyst for JAB, comparing JAB to Nestle. He doubts JAB will do another sizeable deal in the near term, given the Dr Pepper one. He estimated JAB's net debt to be about 20 percent of the overall market value of its portfolio, ""a pretty healthy level ... in line with a pretty high rating"". Moody's rates JAB Baa1 with a stable outlook, while S&P gives it a BBB+ with a ""watch positive"" outlook. The Reimann fortune comes from Germany's Benckiser chemicals company that merged with Britain's Reckitt & Colman in 1999 to form  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB). Reckitt's former CEO Bart Becht is one of the three principals running JAB's investments on behalf of the family. The other two are Olivier Goudet, chairman of  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (ABI) (BR:ABI) and former finance chief of Mars, and Peter Harf, previously chairman of ABI and deputy chairman of Reckitt. JAB is also the biggest shareholder of beauty company Coty (N:COTY), controlling more than a third of its shares, and the second-largest shareholder of Reckitt. It has been offloading luxury brands as it scales up in drinks. BATTLE BREWING AT HOME 
One uncertainty resulting from Nestle's Starbucks deal is in the area of Starbucks single-serve coffee pods used for JAB's Keurig at-home brewers. 
The agreement between Nestle and Starbucks calls for Keurig to continue manufacturing Starbucks coffee K-cups in the United States, where the bulk of Keurig sales are, and for Nestle to market and distribute them. Starbucks and Nestle will jointly determine any future K-cup products. 
Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo likened the arrangement to a potential Trojan horse, but said JAB was unlikely to retaliate with harmful measures, since both parties would get bruised. 
JAB said Starbucks was ""an important brand and valued partner"" with a multi-year agreement. 

""We view this as business as usual for us and look forward to Starbucks continuing to be available in the Keurig system,"" the spokesman said.

413,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",Kraft Heinz seeks buzz for big brands as rivals' valuations come down,"By Jonathan Stempel and Trevor Hunnicutt
OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Ketchup, bologna and Jell-O don't excite Wall Street. But a big deal might whet its appetite for Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC).
Many analysts believe Kraft Heinz, controlled by Brazil's 3G Capital and Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), needs a blockbuster acquisition to foster growth.
And its energetic chief executive, Bernardo Hees, is under pressure to manage Street expectations.
While he says he is in no rush to do deals, does not need a big acquisition now, and is not talking much with investment bankers, opportunities may be coming.
""Our M&A framework has not changed,"" Hees, 48, said in an interview at Berkshire's recent annual shareholder weekend in Omaha, Nebraska. ""We continue to like big brands. We continue to like businesses that can travel. We continue to like businesses that we can find synergies that we can reinvest behind growth.
""The relative and absolute valuations are more attractive today than they were six months ago, or a year ago,"" Hees added. ""If more consolidation would happen in the food and beverage industry, we want to be a force.""
Hees (pronounced ""Hess"") is a partner at 3G, which is known for engineering big mergers, such as the creation of Restaurant Brands International Inc (TO:QSR) by combining Burger King with Canada's Tim Hortons, and then imposing draconian cost cuts.
That reputation helped prompt Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream maker Unilever Plc (AS:UNc) to rebuff 3G's $143 billion Buffett-backed takeover approach last year.
Kraft Heinz decided to walk away, and Hees is not dwelling on the rejection.
INVESTORS HAVE DOUBTS
For now, his challenge is to create buzz for familiar brands such as Oscar Mayer and Velveeta, and not just for products capable of riding the newest food trends.
The company eliminated $1.7 billion of costs, including six factories and about 4,900 jobs, following the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz. The combined company is co-headquartered in Chicago and Pittsburgh.
""Big brands have scale, they have profitability, they allow you to grow when you have the right product offerings, and it's relevant,"" said Hees, who previously led Heinz and Burger King.
So as Kraft Heinz takes celebrity chef David Chang's Momofuku Ssam Sauce national, and partners with Food Network on ""globally inspired"" salad dressings, cooking sauces and meal kits, so too it must inspire consumers to fill their pantries with Planters Signature nuts and Philadelphia cheesecake cups.
At Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett praised 3G's and Hees' ability to cut unnecessary costs.
""The people at 3G are great, great managers, and they are wonderful partners,"" Buffett said.
Investors aren't as convinced they will succeed at Kraft Heinz.
Since peaking on Feb. 17, 2017, Kraft Heinz's share price had fallen 40 percent through Tuesday. The S&P 500 (SPX) rose 14 percent in the same period.
""We believe the stock market will take care of itself if we deliver upon our commitments,"" Hees said. ""The stock price today is not in the way of anything we want to achieve in the mid- or long-term.""
Rivals' stock prices have also taken hits.
Through Tuesday, the S&P 500 Packaged Foods & Meats index <.SPLRCFOOD> had fallen 9.9 percent in the last six months.  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ) dropped 7.3 percent, while  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) and  General Mills  Inc (N:GIS) lost a respective 12.4 percent and 19 percent.
'MAYOCHUP'
Last week, Kraft Heinz reported better-than-expected first quarter profit, even though organic sales fell 1.5 percent.
""We maintain our concern that the management team lacks the marketing acumen necessary to adapt to the dynamic changes in the market and grow its collection of 'retro' brands in highly commoditized categories,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Robert Moskow wrote.
Kraft Heinz is trying.
Two months ago, Kraft Heinz launched Springboard, a brand incubator to develop natural and organic, specialty and craft, healthy and what it called ""experiential"" foods.
And in April, Kraft Heinz created a viral frenzy when it took to Twitter to gauge whether consumers would buy ""Mayochup,"" a hybrid of mayonnaise and ketchup.
Some called it similar to ""fry sauce."" Others noted that many people mix the two already.
""We truly believe that our brands need to be relevant, to the product offering, to the position, and to communicate it to consumers, wherever they are,"" Hees said.
""Pop culture is a great way to do that. Mayochup is a great example. We started, we have these two sauces, can you put them together, is that disgusting, is that good?""
With the Kraft Heinz integration ""behind us,"" Hees said he is investing more into its businesses, armed with knowledge it has gained since the merger.

""Things move fast today, that's a good thing, but we're a young organization,"" he said. ""So there are many things we need to learn. Learn from your mistakes. Don't repeat them. New mistakes are welcome.""

Dennis Muilenburg, who spoke at a luncheon for the Economic Club in Washington, also said the company continued to make progress in talks with Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3), adding the deal is not something Boeing ""must do."" 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday that licenses for  Boeing Co  and Airbus (PA:AIR) to sell passenger jets to Iran would be revoked as part of sanctions imposed following President Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement.
IranAir had ordered 200 passenger aircraft: 100 from Airbus SE (PA:AIR), 80 from Boeing and 20 from Franco-Italian turboprop maker ATR. All the deals are dependent on U.S. licenses because of the heavy use of American parts in commercial planes.

Regarding the Brazilian deal, Boeing and Embraer were discussing a tie-up to create a new company in which the U.S. planemaker would have an 80.01 percent stake and the Brazilian firm 19.99 percent.

415,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",Victims of bank fraud criticize Britain's financial watchdog,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog faced sharp criticism on Wednesday from former small business owners who say they have been mistreated by big banks.
Responding to questions from the influential Treasury Committee, the ex-business owners said the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was ill-suited to handle serious complaints against the lenders it regulates.
The questioning centered on how small firms could be protected in future and came ahead of a parliamentary debate on Thursday on redress for victims of banking misconduct.
Asked what would have been the best course of action following the regulator's investigation into malpractice at the Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS), Nikki Turner said: ""Sack the FCA and start again.""
Turner helped uncover one of the largest financial frauds in Britain at the Reading branch of HBOS, a unit of Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY), after it destroyed her family firm, and she now heads small business group the SME Alliance.
She said the FCA's objective to protect market integrity could prevent it from properly fulfilling its other remit - to protect consumers. 
Turner's comments added to criticism of the FCA over the way it dealt with allegations that RBS pushed thousands of struggling firms into bankruptcy. 
The committee went head to head with the watchdog last year over its reluctance to publish a confidential report it had commissioned into the RBS scandal.
Lawmaker Martin Whitfield, who will lead Thursday's debate in parliament, said in a statement that the government must force the FCA to pass the next phase of the investigation into RBS on to an independent body. 
""I do not believe the FCA can allow an investigation of this magnitude to be taken in-house,"" he said. 
A spokesman for the FCA said it aims to make markets work well for individuals, businesses large and small and for the economy as a whole, and that it supports the committee's inquiry into the issues facing small firms. 

""Over the past few years we have secured billions of pounds in redress for SMEs and consumers and where we see breaches we have, and will, take tough action.""

HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill. (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp shares jumped 16 percent on Wednesday after the company announced a tire service partnership with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), part of Chief Executive Officer Edward Lampert's strategy to make the troubled retailer profitable again.
Under the deal, Sears will install tires sold by Amazon at its U.S. auto centers. Lampert, who announced the deal at Sears' annual shareholders meeting, said he was trying to reach a new customer base through Amazon.
Sears has seen years of declining sales as competition intensifies from the likes of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Amazon and other e-commerce platforms. 
Lampert has closed unprofitable stores, sold assets, cut costs and tried to forge partnerships for Sears products and boost membership of its Shop Your Way rewards program. The recovery has yet to arrive.
""Let me be the first one to acknowledge we are on the right path but we haven't gotten over the hump. We need to convert our vision into reality,"" Lampert said at the annual shareholders' meeting at Sears' headquarters in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates.
Sears shares, which were worth $119 a decade ago, rose as high as $3.46 on Wednesday, but were still about 70 percent below their 52-week high hit on May 10, 2017. The shares closed up 15.9 percent at $3.20.
Lampert is the biggest shareholder in Sears, with a more than 30 percent stake.
After warning about Sears' ability to continue as a going concern last year, Lampert infused the company with cash, and last month said his hedge fund, ESL Investments, would be interested in acquiring Sears' real estate, including its $1.2 billion in debt, Kenmore appliances brand and parts of its home services business.
""We needed liquidity; I've provided it, but we can't operate if we don't have the necessary liquidity,"" he said, adding that the company is ""far from where I hoped we would be at this point."" 
Under the new partnership with Amazon, Sears will expand its DieHard products available on Amazon to include DieHard tires. Sears also already sells its Kenmore home appliances on Amazon.
The tire service will roll out to Sears Auto Centers in the United States over the next couple of weeks.
""The partnership with Amazon, while a positive for Sears Auto Centers, is unlikely to impact the overall deteriorating revenue and profit picture at Sears stores in a meaningful way,"" said Ken Perkins, founder of Retail Metrics. He said previous Sears stock rallies have been short-lived given the company's debt levels, operating losses and store closures. 
As of February, Sears operated 1,002 stores, down from 2,019 stores in 2012.
Separately on Wednesday, Amazon said it had partnered with homebuilder  Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN) to convert some of the home construction company's model homes into showrooms for its digital voice assistant Alexa.

Over the past year, Amazon has entered into partnerships with physical chains such as department store operator Kohl's Corp to sell Amazon-branded items as well as use its retail locations for picking up online orders.. In April, it tapped electronics chain Best Buy to sell smart televisions with the capabilities of Alexa baked in. In return, Best Buy would become the exclusive merchant of these TVs on Amazon.com.

417,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 09, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>","As Japan Stocks Stage Comeback, Investors Doubt Rally Will Last","(Bloomberg) -- Japanese stocks have roared back to life after a two-month selloff, but some investors and analysts aren’t convinced the good times will last for Asia’s best-performing equity market since late March.
“We’re not as bullish as we should be,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, a senior strategist at Asymmetric Advisors in Singapore. “We aren’t convinced that this is a recovery scenario.”
Anvarzadeh says he’s worried that the Bank of Japan will reduce its monetary stimulus earlier than expected. That, he says, will throttle the rally in the country’s stocks. Added to that are geopolitical concerns about Iran and North Korea, according to Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities Co.
The Nikkei 225 Stock Average has jumped almost 9 percent since March 23 for one of the strongest returns of 94 primary equity indexes tracked by Bloomberg. It was a remarkable turnaround after a plunge starting late January that sent the country’s stocks into a correction. The rebound was fueled by the yen’s retreat from a 16-month high against the dollar as the two Koreas vowed to make peace and U.S. President Donald Trump said he’d meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Foreigners have been a major driving force behind Japanese stocks’ revival, turning net buyers in April after three months of net selling. Overseas investors purchased a net 207 billion yen ($1.9 billion) in cash equities last month, while also becoming net buyers of Topix index and Nikkei 225 futures.
To Anvarzadeh, continued rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve and inflationary pressures pose one of the biggest risks for Japanese equities. Rising market interest rates and higher input costs for companies, triggered by a jump in commodity prices, are bound to push the BOJ to cut back on its massive stimulus program, he said.
Some of the BOJ’s nine board members said it’s important to communicate thoroughly that the bank is still a long way from achieving the inflation target and isn’t at the stage of considering an exit, according to a record of comments from the March 8-9 policy meeting published this week. But one member said that while “normalization” could be considered at some point, the BOJ needs to explain to market participants that normalization would still be part of the process of monetary accommodation, and therefore different from tightening.
It’s interesting that BOJ board members “are already talking about that in the minutes,"" Anvarzadeh said. ""The exit strategy of the BOJ will be much tougher than other central banks,"" he said. ""The impact could be much bigger.""
For Norihiro Fujito, a senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo, geopolitical developments relating to Iran are a more immediate concern.
Geopolitical Risks
Japanese stocks fell Wednesday after Trump said the U.S. will withdraw from the landmark 2015 accord to curb Iran’s nuclear program and reinstate financial sanctions on the Islamic Republic, opening an uncertain new chapter for the Middle East. His decision was intended to force Iran to renegotiate an agreement the country’s leaders have said they will not revisit. Trump’s political opponents warned he could lead the U.S. into another Middle-East war.
""There’s a possibility for things to get pretty tense,"" Fujito said. ""This is something that warrants caution. Higher tension will push up the yen and stocks will be hit.""
The timing of Trump’s move isn’t great for Japanese stocks as aggressive short covering by hedge funds will probably have run its course, Fujito said, leaving the market devoid of buying catalysts. Corporate earnings aren’t looking as stellar as they did last year, either, he said.
Some Optimism
Still, not everyone is buying the gloom.
“Japanese equities from a valuation perspective are cheap compared with markets like the U.S.,” said Mitsuo Shimizu, an equity strategist at Japan Asia Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Foreigners have been buying big since April. If corporate earnings are strong, of course they will keep buying.”
While it’s still early days in the quarterly reporting season, companies have so far mostly fallen short of analyst expectations. Of 246 stocks that have reported results this reporting season and for which Bloomberg has analyst estimates, 54 percent missed projections for profit.
And despite Shimizu’s optimism, Anvarzadeh and Fujito remain far from convinced.
""The rebound momentum in equities has weakened quite a bit,"" Fujito said. ""If the U.S.-North Korea summit is devoid of details, the market response could be harsh."""

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] on Wednesday re-opened a contest to select the first international city to launch its proposed flying taxi project, following apparent delays in getting the service off the ground in Dubai, a previously proposed market. 
UberAIR, as the service will be known, aims to launch demonstrator flights starting in 2020 and begin paid, intra-city operations in 2023, the company said.
Last year, Uber named Dallas and Los Angeles as its first launch cities and is now looking for a third, international metropolis to take part, Chief Product Officer Jeff Holden announced at its annual Elevate Summit in Los Angeles.
The company said it will consider cities with a metropolitan population of greater than 2 million people, with dispersed population hubs, an airport at least an hour away from the city centre and which is willing to back pooled ridesharing services.
Uber previously named Dubai as its third launch city but said on Tuesday it had reopened its selection process to include other cities which fit more of its criteria for showcasing how flying taxis can help to relieve urban congestion.
""Dubai has previously expressed an interest in (Uber's) vision but we are broadening the pool given interest from other cities which is why we have launched this criteria and process,"" a spokeswoman said, adding that discussions with Dubai continue.
Uber aims to speed development of a new industry of electric, on-demand, urban air taxis, which customers might order up via smartphone much the way it has popularised ground-based taxi alternatives since it first launched in 2011.
It envisions a fleet of electric jet-powered vehicles - part helicopter, part drone and part fixed-wing aircraft - running multiple small rotors capable of both vertical take off and landing and rapid horizontal flight.
The San Francisco-based company is working with aviation regulators around the world to win up-front approvals, marking a break from past practices that put it at odds with authorities.

Cities interested in taking part can apply here (https://uber.com/air). Uber said it was not looking for tax breaks or local incentives, but was keen to work with cities which can work to bring the project to market as quickly as possible.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels said on Wednesday he has more evidence of ties between a Russian oligarch sanctioned by the United States and a payment to U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and questioned other companies' dealings with Cohen's firm. 
In television interviews, attorney Michael Avenatti also called for the release of bank records detailing hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to Cohen's Essential Consultants LLC made by AT&T (NYSE:T), Novartis AG, Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd and Columbus Nova LLC, a New York-based investment firm linked to businessman Viktor Vekselberg, who has ties to the Kremlin.
Avenatti's comments followed a statement he made on Tuesday about payments to Cohen's firm in 2017 and 2018, after Trump won the November 2016 presidential election. The companies later confirmed the payments. 
New questions being raised about Cohen's role and work for Trump could further pressure Cohen after the FBI raided his home and office last month as part of a criminal investigation of his business dealings and a payment to Daniels. The porn star said she had sex with Trump once in 2006 and kept in touch with him for a while, which Trump has denied.
The White House referred questions to Trump's outside lawyers. Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said the outside legal team had no comment on Avenatti's allegations.
The revelation also drew attention to another potential line of inquiry in U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and potential collusion by Trump's campaign. Moscow has denied U.S. intelligence agency conclusions of tampering and Trump denies any coordination with Russian officials and his campaign.
Cohen on Wednesday told reporters Avenatti's report was inaccurate. 
It was not immediately clear how Avenatti knew about the payments, and he declined to say how in TV interviews with ABC and MSNBC.
His client Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said Cohen paid her $130,000 a month before the election to stay quiet about the sexual encounter. Daniels has filed two related lawsuits against Trump and Cohen.
BANK RECORD INVESTIGATION
The U.S. Treasury Department's inspector general's office said it had opened an investigation into whether confidential banking records involving Cohen may have been leaked.
Spokesman Rich Delmar said the office was looking into whether so-called bank suspicious activity reports, or SARs, or Bank Secrecy Act information had been ""improperly disseminated."" The Washington Post first reported the investigation.
Avenatti has repeatedly called for SARs relating to Cohen to be released.
Avenatti declined to comment on the probe, and Stephen Ryan, an attorney for Cohen, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
AT&T on Tuesday said it sought insights into the new administration from Essential Consultants, but did not engage in lobbying. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that AT&T paid more than $200,000 to Cohen's company.
On Wednesday, Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) said it paid for accounting-related services, while Novartis cited healthcare consulting.
""Michael Cohen appears to be selling access to the president of the United States,"" Avenatti told MSNBC.
A lawyer for Columbus Nova has said Russian businessman Vekselberg had nothing to do with the transaction, which Avenatti said amounted to $500,000.
""We have significant evidence to the contrary,"" Avenatti told ABC, without giving any details. ""We haven't released all the evidence that we have."" 

Vekselberg, who according to the New York Times has been questioned by Mueller's team, could not be reached for comment. Peter Carr, the special counsel's spokesman, declined to comment.

426,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2018 05:45PM ET</span>",Majority of Sturm Ruger investors vote for gun-safety report,"By Ross Kerber
(Reuters) - (This May 9 story has been refiled to correct name of organization to ""Catholic Health Initiatives"" from ""Catholic Health Services"" in thirteenth paragraph.)
A majority of Sturm Ruger & Co investors on Wednesday voted to support a call for the gun maker to produce a report on the safety of its products, in what shareholder activists called the first victory for such a proposal.
The resolution passed in the wake of marches and demonstrations in support of gun control during the three months since 17 people were shot dead at a Florida high school.
It calls on Sturm Ruger to report by next year on how it monitors the use of its products in violent crimes, on research to produce safer firearms and on risks gun violence could pose to its reputation and finances.
Sturm Ruger and rival publicly traded gun makers such as American Outdoor Brands Corp have been under pressure from fund firms, banks and retailers since the Parkland, Florida, massacre.
Religious investor activists sponsored the resolution. Southport, Connecticut-based Sturm Ruger did not disclose the margin by which it passed at its Wednesday annual meeting in Prescott, Arizona.
Chief Executive Officer Christopher Killoy said the maker of handguns and assault-style rifles would prepare the report but would not be forced into changing its business.
""What it does not do, and cannot do, is force us to adopt misguided principles created by groups who do not own guns, know nothing about our business, and frankly would rather see us out of business,"" Killoy said of the resolution.
He rejected calls to meet with shareholders.
A majority of the company's shares were owned by six institutional investors as of recent filings, indicating the measure could not have passed without support from at least one of them.
Top investors include BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard Group, which together own about 25 percent of the company. A BlackRock representative did not immediately comment. A Vanguard representative declined to comment.
Major proxy advisers had recommended investors vote for the safety report. 
The religious activists' proposal discussed the possibility of developing ""smart guns,"" with electronic limits on their ability to fire.
""If new product development, as you said Mr. Killoy, is the lifeblood of Sturm Ruger, safer guns need to be on that development agenda,"" one proposal supporter, Colleen Scanlon of Catholic Health Initiatives, told the meeting.

A representative for the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility said similar proposals at Sturm Ruger got less than 6 percent support when they were last voted on, in 2001 and 2002.

441,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 02:06PM ET</span>",AT&T payments to Trump lawyer more than reported: source,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) paid Essential Consultants, a company set up by President Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen, more than the $200,000 that came to light late on Tuesday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
AT&T confirmed the $200,000 payment late on Tuesday, saying it hoped to gain ""insights"" into the new administration at a time when the telecommunications company sought approval for a major merger, among other issues.
Payments by AT&T, which could total as much as $600,000, were revealed by porn actress Stormy Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, who also said a company owned by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg and other corporations had paid Essential Consultants for certain services.
It is not clear how Avenatti knew about the payments. His client Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said Cohen paid her $130,000 in October 2016, a month before the election, to buy her silence about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump. Trump has denied the affair. 
Avenatti's document said that AT&T paid Essential Consultants $50,000 in October, November and December of 2017, and another $50,000 in January of 2018 for a total of $200,000. 
However, the contract was for a year, the source told Reuters, meaning AT&T likely paid more than $200,000 to Cohen's company. A full year contract for $50,000 per month would total $600,000. The source declined to give a total for the payments made by AT&T to Cohen's company. 
Shares of AT&T were down slightly at $31.50 at 1:30 p.m. EDT on Wednesday.
While most major American corporations have a range of issues on which they lobby, AT&T has more than most. At the time of the first payment to Cohen, it had a major merger, the purchase of Time Warner for $85 billion, under review by the Justice Department. The department sued in November to stop that deal.
AT&T is also fighting the Federal Trade Commission in court over allegations that the company throttled data for online consumers who used over a certain amount, even after the company's data plan was advertised as ""unlimited."" 
Additionally, AT&T had fought net neutrality and supported tax reform. 
AT&T hired Cohen when it was looking for a way to understand the new administration after seeing him on television doing interviews to advocate for Trump, the source said. 
Cohen served as a long-time legal adviser to Trump in his real estate business, The Trump Corporation. During the presidential campaign, Cohen functioned as a spokesman and point-person on inquiries that related to the company in particular.
In previous interviews, Cohen described his role as a ""fixer"" for Trump who handled personal legal matters.
Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said at a press conference that the Judiciary Committee should review the payments AT&T and other companies made to Cohen.

Blumenthal said those payments ""may well have been used to influence the president of the United States, using Michael Cohen and his shell company as a conduit.""

448,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 09, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>",Iran Was a Hard Sell for Bankers Before Trump,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Western corporations had what one European CEO recently called a ""moment of enthusiasm"" for Iran after the lifting of sanctions in 2016 — but it had begun to cool down long before President Donald Trump said he would re-impose them. 
Uncertainty about the direction of U.S. policy toward the region lingered long in the minds of executives, particularly those in the banking industry hit by record fines for sanctions violations. Those companies that did have high hopes for Iran found they were never really matched in reality amid the practical difficulties of investing in a frontier market.
While Trump's move is a set-back for firms like Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. and oil giant  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) that announced big investments in the country, it's hard to argue that global business had more than dipped its toe in the market.
According to the United Nations, foreign direct investment flows into Iran in 2016 totaled $3.4 billion, well up on 2015 — but still below the levels seen in 2011 and 2012. As a proportion of gross fixed capital formation in Iran, inward FDI was a relatively low 3.9 percent, below Pakistan and Turkey at about 5 percent, and below the global level of 9 percent.
After the initial flurry of interest in 2016 came the reality of doing business in the Islamic Republic, a country still listed as a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. State Department and as a threat to the international financial system by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering.
European companies found their banks largely unwilling to support their projects and take on Iran credit risk — largely due to huge fines laid down by the Obama administration for sanctions-busting. Getting money in and out of the country remains a big issue requiring complex workarounds and higher costs.
Nor should we forget the more mundane problems of doing business in a frontier market. Iran's economy has a lot of positives — a large domestic market, low external debt, and rich commodity reserves — but also a lot of negatives. The U.K.’s own overview of doing business in Iran highlights the barriers posed by complex regulations, ineffective government enforcement, and the dominance of vested political and economic interests.
A lack of corporate transparency has made due diligence in Iran challenging, according to Matthew Townsend, a partner at Allen & Overy. All this has meant that companies have found that reaping profits from the country will take longer than they had expected.
Stefano Cao, CEO of Saipem SpA, an Italian oil services company active in Iran, said last month that ""there has been a cool-down"" after the initial enthusiasm about Iran. It's not hard to see why companies' investments never matched their initial interest.
Whatever follows the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal — be it exemptions or carve-outs for non-U.S. investors, or a protracted renegotiation to get Trump back on board — CEOs now have even less reason to allocate capital to Iran.

449,By Business Insider,"<span>May 09, 2018 10:28AM ET</span>",'I continue to hold Tesla accountable': Analyst interrupted by Elon Musk fires back," Tesla CEO Elon Musk was both praised and criticized last week after he interrupted analysts and opted instead to take questions from retail investors via YouTube  in an unusual conference call.
One of those analysts interrupted by Musk defended his line of questioning in an open letter on Wednesday.
""I continue to hold Telsa (and every company I cover) accountable for implementing a strategic vision that aligns with an ability to execute at scale,"" RBC Capital Markets' Joseph Spak wrote.
""As an analyst, my responsibility is to be well informed when I discuss Tesla’s stock with current and potential investors,"" he said. ""A financial results call is an opportunity for Wall Street to re-calibrate our expectations based on the information you provide, so we can thoughtfully reflect on the financial outlook for your company. Our questions collectively represent the concerns and interests of your current and potential shareholders.""
He added: ""Some of these questions can seem dry, boring or short-term focused, but hopefully you can appreciate that anyone looking to invest in Tesla’s future must first be comfortable with its present.""
On Tesla's  first-quarter earnings call last week, Musk interrupted Spak's question about Model 3 reservations and what percentage of those potential buyers had declined to actually configure and take delivery of their car. The $1,000 deposit is fully refundable, the company's website says.
""We're going to go to YouTube,"" Musk responded. ""Sorry. These questions are so dry. They're killing me.""
Instead of answering the ""dry"" question, Musk opted instead to take a question from self-proclaimed Tesla and bitcoin enthusiast, Galileo Russell, who asked for an update on Tesla's car-sharing network that rivals competitors like Waymo or Lyft.
In Wednesday's letter, Spak offered more questions for Musk, including clarification on  labor issues, future  capital expenditure plans, and the ""production hell"" plaguing Tesla's Fremont factory that have weighed on Tesla's stock price in recent months. 
A Tesla spokesperson did not immedeately respond to a request for comment. 
Despite the unusual call, RBC maintained its ""sector perform"" rating, with a price target of $280 — roughly 7% below Tuesday's closing price. The firm also invited Musk to host a webinar with clients to ""dispel any investor misconceptions"" he may perceive.
""We as analysts need to ask probing questions about balance sheets and production and other such topics to give our clients confidence that we aren’t simply gazing into a crystal ball,"" Spak said.
""Don’t get me wrong. I love talking and thinking about the big picture and what Tesla can become. That’s what makes Tesla such a fascinating company to cover!"""
450,By Business Insider,"<span>May 09, 2018 10:26AM ET</span>","Healthcare giant Novartis says current CEO had no involvement in $400,000 payment to Trump lawyer company that bought off porn star","Multinational pharmaceutical giant Novartis was among the corporations that made payments to Essential Consulting, a firm linked to Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's lawyer.
Michael Avenatti, the lawyer representing the adult-film star Stormy Daniels,  alleged that a Novartis unit had paid Essential nearly $400,000 in late 2017 and early 2018. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, said she was paid $130,000 by Cohen to stay quiet about her alleged affair with Trump.
Novartis told Business Insider in a statement that the agreement between the pharmaceutical company and Essential, which began in February 2017, ""focused on US healthcare policy matters"" and that the agreement expired in February 2018.
""If you take this at face value, these are extraordinarily serious allegations that are being made,"" Mitchell Epner, a former assistant US attorney for the District of New Jersey and now a lawyer at Rottenberg Lipman Rich,  told Business Insider's Sonam Sheth and Allan Smith.
Current Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan stepped into the role on February 1, and the contracts took place under former CEO Joe Jimenez. Narasimhan  was among the European executives Trump had dinner with in January at Davos.
""The engagement of Essential Consultants predated Vas Narasimhan becoming Novartis CEO. Dr. Narasimhan had no involvement whatsoever with this arrangement,"" a Novartis spokeswoman said in a statement.
Novartis said it had been contacted by lawyers who were part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the 2016 presidential election and ""considers this matter closed.""
Novartis, whose headquarters are in Switzerland, has a  big presence in the US. The company spent  $8.7 million in 2017 lobbying the US government.

451,By Investing.com,"<span>May 09, 2018 09:43AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Registers Gains Amid Risk-On Sentiment; Oil Jumps 2%,"Investing.com - Wall Street opened slightly higher on Wednesday as investors priced in company news and signs of inflation easing, while oil jumped in reaction to President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal and impose sanctions on the country.
At 9:38AM ET (13:38GMT), the Dow Jones gained 74 points, or 0.31%, the S&P 500 rose 9 points, or 0.35%, while the Nasdaq Composite traded up 15 points, or 0.21%.
In a televised speech Tuesday, Trump said the United States would withdraw from a 2015 international agreement designed to deny Tehran the ability to build nuclear weapons, and also reimpose “the highest level of economic sanctions” against Iran.
Stocks saw tepid close a day earlier in reaction to the news, but risk appetite appeared to be back on the table Wednesday.
Oil prices soared more than 2% on Wednesday on bets that the return of sanctions would further tighten global supplies as they make it more difficult for Iran to export oil.
U.S. crude futures jumped 2.45% to $70.75 by 9:39AM ET (13:39GMT), while Brent oil soared 2.54% to $76.75.
The rally came ahead of fresh weekly data on U.S. commercial crude inventories to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer and how fast output levels will continue to rise.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended May 4 at 10:30AM ET (1430GMT), amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of 719,000 barrels.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories fell by nearly 1.9 million barrels last week.
In company news, shares in Walmart (NYSE:WMT) slumped nearly 3% after the retail giant announced that it would pay $16 billion to take a majority stake in India’s Flipkart.
Also among Dow components,  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) reported a 21% jump in revenue thanks primarily to its release of Black Panther and higher returns from its theme parks.
However, investors appeared to focus on 6% drop in profit for its media networks unit as ESPN continued to lose subscribers. Shares were off around 1%.
In better earnings news, TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) saw shares soar around 20% Wednesday after the travel and restaurant website smashed consensus estimates.
Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) jumped more than 10% after the provider of online coupons reported a surprise adjusted profit.
Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP) was also seeing stellar gains of nearly 13% despite in line earnings as the retailer lifted its 2018 outlook.
On the economic front, annual readings of the producer price index and the core PPI both eased more than expected in April to 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively.
The Federal Reserve keeps its eye on this data because when producers pay more for goods, they are more likely to pass price increases on to the consumer, so PPI could be considered a leading indicator of inflation.

452,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 09, 2018 09:31AM ET</span>",Tesla Urged to `Raise Its Game' as Activist Seeking Shake-Up,"(Bloomberg) -- An activist firm representing Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. shareholders has excoriated the electric-car maker, claiming that it’s veered off the path to profit and urging a major overhaul of the Elon Musk-led board.
CtW Investment Group, working with union pension funds that are Tesla investors managing more than $250 billion, opposes the re-election of three board members who are up for votes during Tesla’s June 5 annual meeting. The firm calls for shareholders to cast ballots against Antonio Gracias, a private-equity investor and Tesla’s lead independent director; Kimbal Musk, Elon’s brother; and James Murdoch, CEO of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.
“Tesla has failed to hit critical production milestones and has consequently seen its past progress toward profitability sharply reverse,” Dieter Waizenegger, CtW’s executive director, wrote in a letter filed Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “But instead of recognizing the need for independent and effective board leadership, Tesla has re-nominated three directors who exemplify the company’s failure to evolve.”
The letter escalates long-held criticisms of a board that CtW and several investors have faulted for being beholden to Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer. The company has burned through almost $4 billion during the past year while scaling up operations for the Model 3, intended to be its first mass-manufactured car. The sedan has missed several production targets and stoked concerns about whether the company has enough cash.
A Tesla spokesman didn’t immediately comment. The shares rose 0.3 percent to $303 as of 8:40 a.m. in New York, before the start of regular trading.
Wide-Ranging Concerns
While praising Tesla as a “successful innovator with an environmental mission,” CtW’s Waizenegger writes that the company’s prospects for continued success are “more tenuous than ever” and that the board needs to “raise its game.”
The wide-ranging letter raises concerns with matters including Musk’s combative earnings call with analysts last week, safety issues at Tesla’s California assembly plant, fatal crashes involving the driver-assistance system Autopilot and litigation related to the company’s controversial acquisition of SolarCity Corp.
“In response to these considerable financial and operational challenges, the Tesla board has been unduly deferential toward Chairman and CEO Elon Musk,” Waizenegger writes. “Mr. Musk’s peripatetic focus -- he is also CEO of SpaceX, a proponent of the hyperloop, and apparently about to start a candy company -- is exacerbated, rather than contained, by a board most of whose members have family or non-Tesla ties to him, lack industry experience, and have no track record of effective independent board service at a public company.”
Gracias, a Tesla director since 2007, has both personal and professional ties to Musk, 46. The founder of Valor Equity Management invested in Paypal Inc., which Musk co-founded, and participated along with Valor in funding rounds and a debt raise that Tesla conducted before its 2010 initial public offering. Musk gave Gracias the second Roadster sports car that the company built. He’s also on the board of Space Exploration Technologies Corp.
“The lead independent director should be leading a process of renewing and modernizing the board by recruiting well-qualified, diverse, and independent directors with a combination of industry and governance experience,” Waizenegger writes. “Given his longstanding conflicts, we see no likelihood that Mr. Gracias will change course and initiate this long overdue process.”
‘Inexplicable’ Nomination
CtW also knocks Tesla for re-nominating Kimbal Musk, 45, who lacks relevant industry experience or “a track record of effective public company board service,” according to Waizenegger. He became director of  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG). in 2013, and shareholders rejected the company’s executive compensation plan the next year. The stock slumped during a prolonged food-safety crisis.
“We would find it inexplicable if Tesla were anything like a well-run public company,” Waizenegger said of Kimbal Musk’s re-nomination.
CtW was among the group of influential investors that pressed Tesla in April 2017 to add new directors who didn’t have ties to Elon Musk, citing concerns about the lack of independence on the board. The carmaker named longtime media executives James Murdoch, the son of News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA). Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch; and Linda Johnson Rice, chairman of Johnson Publishing Co.
Waizenegger listed scandals involving companies James Murdoch managed, including News Corp.’s phone-hacking episode and Twenty-First Century Fox’s sexual harassment lawsuits. Murdoch doesn’t appear to have any experience in manufacturing or engineering, Waizenegger writes.
“Given that the simultaneous appointment of Linda Johnson Rice added significant media experience to the board,” Waizenegger writes, “it is not clear why Tesla would need two directors with media but not automotive backgrounds.”
Track Record
CtW has organized campaigns to vote against directors previously over a lack of independence and diversity, including at Urban Outfitters Inc (NASDAQ:URBN). and Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF). last year. At Urban Outfitters’ meeting last May, as many as two-thirds of outside shareholders voted against a director the firm opposed, and investors including Norges Bank and CalSTRS joined CtW in opposition. The shareholder response at Tiffany’s was more muted, but the company has since named a new CEO and new chairman.
Waizenegger describes Tesla’s board as “a holdover” from the company’s earliest days, when the carmaker was a private company under Musk’s control.
“Now that Tesla’s IPO is eight years in the past, a modernization of the Tesla board is long overdue,” he writes.
(Updates to reflect that letter has been filed with the SEC in the third paragraph.)

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. asset manager MFS Investment Management said it will seek permission to create a European Union hub in Luxembourg as it positions itself for Britain's exit from the bloc.
MFS, which is owned by Canadian insurer  Sun Life Financial  (TO:SLF) and traces its roots to the launch of the first U.S. investment trust in 1924, has yet to make a final decision on the scale of any move, Madeline Forrester, managing director, UK Institutional Business, told Reuters.
The plan, which requires approval from Luxembourg regulators, would see MFS build up its existing Luxembourg office, currently staffed by 7 people, through internal company moves or local hires.
MFS has taken no decision yet on the type of roles to move to Luxembourg or how many.
The company employs 1,900 staff globally, of which around 140 are in Britain, and runs a number of actively managed funds for retail and institutional clients. It said London would remain MFS's main office in Europe after Brexit.
At present, MFS has a Luxembourg fund range with 36 equity, multi-asset and fixed-income sub-funds that are sold primarily into Europe, Britain and Latin America.
Britain's vast financial services looks set to be one of the most divisive areas in the Brexit negotiations, with Britain demanding a generous deal while the EU refuses to shift from its insistence that Britain's red lines -- such as ending the free movement of workers from the EU -- make that impossible. 
While a transitional deal between Britain and the EU could create more time for asset managers to determine final plans, most say they are already beginning to take permanent action to open or bulk up operations elsewhere.
""We have to plan for next March [when Britain is set to officially leave the bloc]. That means preparing for the worst, that's the frustrating bit, and we're not the only industry that feels this way, I'm sure,"" Forrester said.
""We're all investing time and money planning for the most unfavourable outcome. We view this as making a long-term investment in our Luxembourg office, but whatever the result of the final deal, we have to look after our clients and that means preparing for a 'hard' Brexit.""
Luxembourg has been among the chief beneficiaries from the uncertainty caused by Brexit, with a number of insurers and asset managers choosing it for their EU base, including Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Carlyle.

MFS staff roles and numbers in Luxembourg will in large part depend on the Luxembourg regulator and how many employees with investment or risk management responsibility it requires to be based there - a sensitive subject that has already seen the country pitched against rivals such as Dublin.

(Reuters) - Wall Street surged on Wednesday as surging oil prices boosted energy stocks following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision the previous day to quit a nuclear agreement with Iran.
Gains were broad and volume was high, with all but the utilities and telecom sectors advancing as investors who had moved to the sidelines in recent days ahead of Trump's decision returned to the market.
""It's classic 'buy on the terrible news',"" said Ian Winer, director of trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, referring to the wider market's rally. ""People had gotten way too nervous about this."" 
Trump's decision for the United States pull out of the international agreement aimed at preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon was good news for investors betting on a rise in oil prices. Crude hit its highest level in 3-1/2 years as investors bet the U.S. withdrawal would increase risks of conflict in the Middle East and curtail global oil supplies.
The S&P energy index (SPNY) jumped 2.03 percent, bringing its gain this quarter to 12.6 percent, more than any other sector.
""The rise in oil is helping energy sector, which is expected to be a pretty big growth sector. A lot of analysts are expecting strong earnings as oil rebounds, and that hasn't really played out so much early this year,"" said Shawn Cruz, senior trading specialist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.75 percent to end at 24,542.54 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.97 percent to 2,697.79.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 1 percent to finish the session at 7,339.91.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility for the S&P 500, closed down 1.29 points at 13.42, its lowest close since Jan. 26.
Worries lingered that rising oil prices would perk up inflation. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) rose to a two-week high and above the key 3 percent level on expectations of higher interest rates. [US/]
With March-quarter reports mostly wrapped up, S&P 500 earnings per share appear to have surged by 25.9 percent, helped by deep corporate tax cuts introduced this year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
In stock trading, Google-owner Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) rose 2.87 percent, providing more lift than any other stock to the S&P 500. It was followed by  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), which rose 2.09 percent.
Walmart Inc (N:WMT) fell 3.13 percent after the retailer took a majority stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart for about $16 billion.
Walt  Disney  (N:DIS) dipped 1.79 percent despite reporting a quarterly profit above Wall Street estimates.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.71-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.65-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 52 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.1 billion shares, compared with the 6.6 billion-share average over the last 20 trading days.

472,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Red light: Ford facing hold-ups at China ports amid trade friction - sources,"By Norihiko Shirouzu and Michael Martina
BEIJING (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's imported vehicles are being held up at Chinese ports, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, underscoring how U.S. goods are facing increased customs scrutiny in China amid a tense trade stand-off.
The three people said Ford (N:F) cars and those of its premium Lincoln brand were facing unusual delays at customs, with officials asking for extra technical checks. Two of the people said U.S.-made models of some German carmakers, mainly SUVs, being brought into China, were also affected.
Ford was being asked to do extra checks on emission components, said a China-based Ford executive familiar with the matter, asking not be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.
China's customs agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The hold-ups add to a growing list of American products facing issues at China's borders, as officials try to avert a full-blown trade war. Some trade experts said they believe Beijing is sending a defiant warning to Washington in response to sweeping U.S. trade demands made on China last week.
Reuters reported Tuesday that China had ramped up inspections of pork shipped from the United States, after the country's customs agency said it would step up quarantine checks on American apples and logs.
The second person, a China-based industry official with knowledge of the matter, said the delays for Ford - as well as some U.S.-made cars from BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz - had been going on for the last two weeks.
""Customs pretends there are technical non-conformities of some nature that won't allow them to clear these U.S.-made cars through customs, but the U.S.-China trade frictions must be the background to this,"" he said. ""Although no one will officially admit it.""
Responding to a request for comment from Reuters, a BMW spokesman said that ""U.S.-made BMW cars have not been delayed at the ports as of last week and before."" 
A Daimler spokeswoman said it was ""monitoring the situation closely"" regarding ongoing trade talks between China and the United States, but that she could not speculate further on other matters.
The third person said the Ford issue, which had been noted by the United States government, and other hold-ups facing American goods, were clearly related to the trade dispute.
A Ford spokeswoman in Shanghai when asked about the matter said: ""We are closely monitoring our situation at the port."" She declined to comment further. Imported Ford cars normally enter China via the eastern ports of Shanghai and Tianjin, she said.
Japanese and German carmakers that Reuters spoke with said they were not facing similar delays at China customs with imported vehicles made outside the United States.
It wasn't immediately clear if General Motors (NYSE:GM) cars imported to China from the United States were being impacted by the delays. GM plans to import only a total of about 150 vehicles to China from North America this year. 
""Virtually all products we sell in China are built in China,"" said a Shanghai-based GM spokesperson.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese goods. The United States alleges that Beijing misappropriates U.S. technology through joint-venture requirements, unfair licensing practices, outright theft and state-backed acquisitions of American technology firms.
Beijing denies those accusations.
China's top economic official, Liu He, will visit Washington next week to resume trade talks, the White House said Monday, after a U.S. delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin came away from a visit to Beijing last week with no agreement over a long list of U.S. trade demands.
China is the world's largest auto market but has been the focus of criticism from Trump over a 25 percent import tariff and foreign ownership caps on local auto ventures. China has pledged to remove the ownership limits and lower import levies.
Ford has much to lose if the war of words over trade between China and Trump escalates into a full-blown tariff war. Last year, it shipped about 80,000 vehicles to China from North America, more than half of them Lincolns – including the Lincoln Continental sedan and the Lincoln MKX crossover SUV.
All Lincoln vehicles that Ford now sells in China are brought in from North America. Last year the brand sold 54,124 vehicles in China, the world's largest auto market, up 66 percent from 2016.
James Chao, Shanghai-based Asia-Pacific head of the IHS Markit consultancy, said delays of a few weeks would not likely cause sales disruptions since automakers keep on average 60 days of inventory. Longer delays, though, could have a bigger impact.
Julia Coym, a Shanghai-based senior analyst at the consultancy Control Risks, said the move was as much about sending a message to the White House as directly hurting Ford. 
""China has started using these types of tools pressuring companies over political or trade disputes a lot more in the last couple of years,"" Coym said. She called the increased customs checks China's ""intense quarantine method"".
She pointed to a political stand-off last year between China and South Korea. South Korean firms who relied on Chinese consumers in sectors from retail to tourism were hit by increased inspections and a ban on tour group travel.

""This is part of China's play-book now,"" said Coym. ""We would definitely expect to see more of this as the trade dispute intensifies further,"" she added, referring to the U.S.-China standoff.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) said on Wednesday it plans to transfer its stakes in ride-sharing firms to the SoftBank Vision Fund, a move which if approved would make the fund one of the world's biggest investors in the fast-changing industry.
SoftBank plans to transfer, subject to approval, its combined $12.9 billion stake in Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Didi Chuxing. It also aims to transfer its stakes in Grab and Ola, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son told a news conference.
The move would provide the fund's investors - which include Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) (TW:2317) and the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi - significant exposure to the ride-sharing industry, which is being shaken up by consolidation in which SoftBank is playing a role.
In March, Uber said it would sell its Southeast Asian business to bigger regional rival Grab, with the U.S. ride-sharing firm focusing on a battle with Ola in India.
Son's reputation as a visionary investor has attracted enough money to create the world's largest private equity fund which, as of last May, stood at over $93 billion.
When combined with SoftBank's smaller Delta Fund, SoftBank's private equity arm had at the end of March invested $29.7 billion in 25 technology firms, with investments this year including dog-walking app Wag and construction startup Katerra.
Steered by founder and CEO Son, SoftBank has become a major global technology investor as it looks to create a group of leading tech companies powered by interconnected devices and artificial intelligence.
The company's growing technology investments saw it post record operating profit for the year ended March, rising 27 percent to 1.3 trillion yen ($11.86 billion).
Son recently decided to let go of one of SoftBank's biggest overseas bets, U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp (N:S), which will merge with T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) after struggling to compete with bigger rivals.
Faced with investor confusion over how mutually supportive SoftBank's array of investments are, Sprint's outgoing CEO Marcelo Claure will become SoftBank's chief operating officer, pledging to enhance cooperation between the portfolio companies.
Also at the news conference on Wednesday, Son let slip that U.S. retail giant Walmart Inc (N:WMT) would acquire Indian e-commerce player Flipkart, ahead of an expected announcement by Walmart-Flipkart later on Wednesday.
Vision Fund invested in Flipkart last year, with its $2.5 billion stake now worth $4 billion, Son said.
SoftBank will consider relisting British chip designer ARM Holdings (LON:ARM) in five to seven years, Son also said. The $32 billion 2016 acquisition was Japan's largest-ever outbound deal, though it looks set to be dwarfed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd's (T:4502) $62 billion purchase of Britain's  Shire  PLC (L:SHP).
SoftBank shares closed up about 1 percent in a wider market (N225) that was down half a percent. However, SoftBank shares are down 4 percent so far this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc (L:GSK), Britain's biggest drugmaker, faces more top management change with Chief Financial Officer Simon Dingemans set to retire next year.
The former Goldman Sachs (N:GS) investment banker, who joined in 2011, will step down from the board in May 2019, the company said on Wednesday. As his departure is voluntary he will not receive any severance payment.
GSK said it planned to look both internally and externally to identify a successor.
Dingemans' departure provides a further opportunity for Chief Executive Emma Walmsley to stamp her imprint on the group as she tries to boost sales and improve productivity in the core pharmaceuticals division.
Walmsley, who took over in April 2017, has already appointed a new head of pharmaceuticals in Luke Miels and a new head of drug research in Hal Barron, as well as making Karenann Terrell head of digital operations, an area within Dingemans's orbit.
In his time at GSK, Dingemans has helped oversee two transformational deals with  Novartis  (S:NOVN) - the first, in 2015, involving a major swap of assets and the second, in March, in which GSK bought Novartis out of their consumer healthcare joint venture for $13 billion.
Prior to joining the drugmaker, Dingemans also helped as a Goldman adviser in establishing GSK's ViiV Healthcare joint venture in HIV medicine with  Pfizer  (N:PFE).
Dingemans said he believed he was leaving GSK at a time when it had established ""strong foundations"" to deliver improved financial performance.
The company has faced a difficult few years, marred by a lack of new blockbuster drugs emerging from its research labs, dwindling sales of its ageing lung drug Advair and a corruption scandal in China.
But Walmsley said earlier in 2018 she was increasingly confident the company would be able to drive sales and profit growth over the next few years, helped by newer products such as its successful new shingles vaccine Shingrix.
Still, even with a renewed sense of urgency about R&D productivity, GSK's transformation will take time, with its next batch of new medicines not ready to reach the market before 2020.

Meanwhile, big challenges loom in two key areas, with a new drug from Gilead Sciences (O:GILD) threatening the HIV business and U.S. generic competition to Advair possible by mid-2018.

PARIS (Reuters) - America's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord signals the collapse of $38 billion in plane deals between Tehran and Western companies and leaves Airbus facing greater risks than arch-rival Boeing, according to people involved in the deals.
President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday he was pulling his country out of the 2015 accord, and his administration said it would revoke export licenses needed by planemakers to sell commercial planes - which require U.S. components - to Iran.
Tehran has ordered 200 passenger aircraft for state carrier IranAir worth $38.3 billion at list prices, including 100 from Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR), 80 from U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) and 20 from smaller Franco-Italian turboprop maker ATR (MI:LDOF).
Airbus is more exposed on wide-body jets, for which sluggish global demand forced it last month to revise down part of its production plans. Iran has ordered 53 wide-body jets from Airbus and 30 from Boeing, which are yet to be built.
Losing the order deals a further blow to Airbus's newest wide-body jet, the A330neo, which faces weak demand months before it enters service, three industry sources said. IranAir is its second-largest airline buyer after AirAsia (KL:AIRA).
By contrast, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg signaled last month that his company was no longer as dependent on the Iran orders as it had been, following an aggressive effort to improve sales of its current-generation 777-300ER wide-body jets which were part of the Iran deal.
Airbus and Boeing said they would study the U.S. decision, but declined to comment on the risks they faced.
""We will do the right thing,"" Jeff Knittel, chairman of Airbus Americas, told Reuters.
Neither planemaker will be as concerned about the potential loss of a total of around 100 narrow-body plane orders from the Iranian deals, as demand for those jets is strong and they will have no problem in allocating production slots to other buyers.
Two European sources said Airbus was resigned to losing the historic Iran deals which had taken months of preparation, culminating in a Paris signing by President Hassan Rouhani in 2016. Rouhani said on Tuesday Iran was committed to the deal.
AIRBUS 'COMES OUT WORSE'
A collapse of aircraft deals struck under the nuclear pact would also hit Airbus's 2018 order book harder than Boeing's.
A cancellation of Airbus's Iranian orders - which it booked early to pip Boeing in the 2016 order race - could wipe out its entire tally of 86 net orders for this year. Investors keep an eye on new orders as a gauge of jet market confidence.
Boeing is ahead with 221 net orders for 2018, and had delayed booking the orders from its $16.5 billion Iran contract - Iran's biggest with America since the 1979 revolution.
""Airbus was very aggressive about booking orders and delivering planes and Boeing were very conservative; Airbus gets hit a bit worse,"" said Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia.
Still, Boeing's wide-body portfolio is not without risk.
""In terms of optimistic expectations, Airbus comes out worse. In terms of hoping for (wide-body) revenue that won't be there, neither feels good right now,"" Aboulafia added.
The situation looks mixed for small but profitable ATR.
Analysts say the turboprop maker has had a good Iran deal so far, managing to deliver more aircraft than its larger rivals with 8 already in service.
It looked on course to deliver the remaining aircraft later this year and may just be able to squeeze one or two more into Iran before the end of a 90-day wind-down period in August.
However, it faces potentially costly industrial decisions over the rest of the 20-plane deal. Analysts say the deadline for deliveries suggests ATR had started building some of the remaining planes, potentially leaving it with unsold aircraft.
ATR was not available for comment.
Trump's speech pulled the shutters down on the wider aircraft deals unexpectedly quickly and marked a sharp contrast with scenes over two years ago when plane sellers and leasing companies flocked to Tehran eager to drum up new business.
Although Airbus and Boeing are arch-foes in the $120 billion annual jet market, their deals with Iran had brought them into alignment because each depended on the same U.S. licenses.
But as opposition to the Iran accord mounted in the U.S. Congress, which holds the key to defense and other contracts, and as markets for its jets improved elsewhere, Boeing seemed to change its tone with the comments by Muilenburg last month.
""It's not just Trump but the anti-Iran mood in Congress,"" explained a person familiar with the U.S. transactions.

(Reuters) - Foreigners withdrew money from Asian equity markets for the third consecutive month in April as rising U.S. bond yields and trade tensions between the United States and China soured investors' appetite for riskier assets.
Overseas investors sold about $6.5 billion worth of Asian stocks last month, more than triple their sales of $2 billion in March, data from seven stock exchanges showed.
Regional markets have seen total outflows of $11.3 billion in the first four months of this year, compared with net inflows of $20 billion for all of 2017, the data showed.
Foreign investments in Asian equities - https://reut.rs/2K4bBJU
""The accumulation of political and geopolitical tensions doesn't bode well for riskier Asian assets, coupled with the dollar rebound that had been piling on the pressure as well,"" said Jingyi Pan, a Singapore-based market strategist at trading and investments provider IG.
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major peers, rose 2 percent in April, its biggest monthly gain in 17 months. The index is up another 1.5 percent so far in May.
Taiwan stocks, a favorite of foreign buyers in the last six years, witnessed outflows of 2.8 billion in April to take the year's tally to over $5 billion.
South Korea and Indian stocks saw outflows of $1.7 billion and $850 million, respectively.
Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last month that a mounting trade dispute between the United States and China was one of the most pressing worries for Southeast Asian nations.
The Trump administration is threatening to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese imports and Beijing has vowed to retaliate. ()
Creeping gains in U.S. Treasury yields are also fuelling fears that portfolio managers may move money into safer fixed-income securities at the expense of riskier assets like stocks and emerging markets.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield breached the psychological level of 3 percent in late April and with the Federal Reserve being the only major central bank set to raise interest rates in this quarter most analysts expect further upside in U.S. bond yields.
Another worry for regional markets was the United States pulling out of an international nuclear deal with Iran on Wednesday and the move is seen as disruptive for many Asian companies that have deals with Iran.
Iran is the third-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a major supplier, especially to refiners in Asia.
IG's Pan said the risk factors for Asian equities ""look to be here to stay as we tread into May, which could continue to keep the outflows ongoing.""

The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose as high as 3.014% to the strongest level in two weeks as a rally in oil prices boosted inflation expectations. It was last at 3.012%.
A rise above the high of 3.035% reached on April 25 would take the U.S. 10-year yield to its highest since early 2014. Bond yields move inversely to prices.
On Tuesday, President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the international nuclear deal with Iran, raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East and a knock-on effect for global oil supplies and the global economy.
Rising yields have come amid markets starting to price in four interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year, rather than the three signaled by policy makers.

The new regulations will give banking customers greater access to the data that their banks hold on them and the ability to direct that data to accredited service providers of their choice, Treasurer Scott Morrison said.
The new rules are due to come into force from July 2019. They may further squeeze the banks' margins which are already expected to come under pressure as banks review lending practices after a spate of scandals, slowing credit growth. 
Australia's ""Big Four"" banks are smarting after an enquiry into their business practices found a string of damaging incidents involving rate-rigging, money laundering and unethical conduct in wealth management and insurance.
Australia's major lenders include Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ), Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) and National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB).
The banks collectively dominate property, investment and business lending, giving Australians limited options when seeking credit. 
""Customers will be able to use their new data rights to find better deals on their credit cards, mortgages and other banking products,"" Morrison said.
""Comparison services will be better able to assess the value and suitability of all available products, taking into account the individual circumstances and needs of the customer. This will help to break down barriers that see customers staying with their banks even when there are better deals elsewhere."" 
The new rules by the Australian Liberal-National coalition government come amid widespread outcry against the sector after the enquiry, and ahead of an election expected next year.
All major banks will need to make data available on credit and debit card, deposit and transaction accounts by July 1, 2019, and mortgages by Feb. 1, 2020.
Remaining banks will be required to make the data available 12 months after the major banks.
The data arm of Australia's science body, the CSIRO, will act as a standards setting organization, in collaboration with industry, FinTechs, and consumer and privacy groups.

The data rights will then be applied to Australia's energy and telecommunications sectors to give consumers better choice in their energy, internet and telephone contracts, the Treasury said in a separate statement.

490,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 04:59PM ET</span>","Walmart to pay $16 billion for control of India's Flipkart, shares slide","By Nandita Bose and Sankalp Phartiyal
NEW YORK/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) said on Wednesday it will pay $16 billion for a roughly 77 percent stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart, the U.S. retailer's largest-ever deal as it competes with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) in an important growth market.
Shares of Walmart fell 3 percent. The company warned it expects the deal to reduce fiscal 2019 earnings by 25-30 cents per share if it closes in the second quarter. It also expects Indian investments to shave 60 cents per share from earnings in fiscal 2020.
Walmart's acquisition opens a new front in its battle with Amazon, which had expressed interest in making a competing offer. Amazon holds about 27 percent of India's burgeoning e-commerce market, according to Euromonitor, where Walmart only operates 21 cash-and-carry wholesale stores in the country that sell to businesses. 
The deal probably will not do much to change market share between Flipkart and Amazon in India, said Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at the Roosevelt Investment Group. In the fiscal year ended March 31, Flipkart reported sales of $4.6 billion.
Flipkart sells consumer goods ranging from soaps to smartphones and clothes, and gives Walmart access to an e-commerce market that could be worth $200 billion a year within a decade, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). 
Walmart expects the deal to help set it up ""for growth and profits in the future,"" Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said on a call with investors. McMillon has led Walmart's efforts to boost international business.
Walmart said Flipkart's logistics, payments and apparel businesses offer new areas of growth.
""It is not so much about succeeding in India for Walmart because that may or may not happen,"" said Neil Stern, senior partner at retail consultancy McMillan Doolittle. ""It is really about grabbing an opportunity after waiting on the sidelines in a growth market for over a decade,"" he said.
Walmart entered the Indian market in 2007 through a joint venture with a local company, years before Amazon debuted there. That joint venture was called off in 2013 and its presence in India has remained largely static, at least partly due to restrictions around foreign investment in physical retail.
FOCUS ON INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
Walmart has renewed its focus on catching up with rivals in key international markets. 
The company retreated from Britain, selling a controlling stake in its British arm ASDA to J  Sainsbury  Plc (L:SBRY). Walmart is also trying to offload a majority stake in its Brazilian operations to private equity firm Advent International.
International business contributed less than a quarter to the retailer's total revenue of $500 billion in fiscal 2018.
Walmart said it plans to fund the India deal through a combination of newly-issued debt and cash on hand. The investment will include $2 billion of new equity funding.
Walmart said it remains in talks with other potential investors to join the funding round. This could lower its stake although Walmart plans to retain majority control. Reuters has reported Google-parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) may buy a roughly 15 percent stake in Flipkart for $3 billion.
The remainder will be held by existing shareholders, including Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal, China's Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), Tiger Global Management and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), the company said.
The Walmart statement made no reference to the exit of Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal or SoftBank Group (T:9984), which was one of the largest investors in Flipkart through its Vision Fund. Reuters had reported that Bansal and SoftBank would sell their entire stakes.
Other investors like Naspers and eBay said they sold their holdings in Flipkart.
S&P Global Ratings revised its outlook for Walmart to ""negative"" from ""stable,"" citing risk as the retailer spends heavily to expand its online and global reach. Walmart’s long-term corporate credit rating was affirmed at “AA,” S&P said.

""Walmart has a very poor track record operating outside North America,"" said Steven Roorda, portfolio manager with Minnesota-based Stonebridge Capital Advisors, which invests in retailers. ""We will not know for five to 10 years whether this transaction is successful strategically or financially.""

492,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 08:47AM ET</span>","South Korea's KAI says paid firm of Trump's lawyer $150,000 for accounting advice","SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd (KAI) said on Wednesday it paid $150,000 for consulting services on accounting matters to a firm set up by U.S. President Donald Trump's private lawyer Michael Cohen.
The arrangement came as the company, backed by state-owned Export-Import Bank of Korea, competes to sell trainer jets to the U.S. Air Force in an auction that could be worth up to $16 billion. 
Payments by KAI and other companies including Novartis AG to Essential Consultants, a company that also paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 in October 2016 just before the U.S. presidential election, were described on Tuesday by her lawyer Michael Avenatti.
Avenatti also detailed payments by a company with ties to a Russian oligarch who has been sanctioned by the United States to punish Moscow for activities that included suspected meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.
Novartis on Wednesday said it was contacted by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office regarding the agreement with Essential.
A KAI spokesman said the company has not been contacted by Mueller's office, which is investigating Russia.
Neither Avenatti nor Cohen responded to requests from Reuters for comment.
Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said Cohen paid her to stay quiet about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he has denied.
A KAI spokesman said it signed a contract with Essential last year for ""legal consulting concerning accounting standards on production costs,"" and upon the expiration of the contract it made the payment in November.
The aircraft components and military jetmaker declined to give further details on the consulting services it received from Essential and said it had no individual dealings with Cohen.
In a tweet and a report, Avenatti said Cohen described Essential as a real estate consulting firm and claimed its typical clients are U.S.-based high net worth individuals.
Reuters could not immediately verify Avenatti's claim or how he knew of any payments made to Essential.
In two U.S. television interviews on Wednesday, Avenatti declined to say where he received the information about the payments. He told ABC News it was ""unclear"" what exactly they were paying for and what services Cohen provided.
AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) said it hired Essential to offer advice on working with the new administration in early 2017, around the time of Trump's inauguration.
The agreement illustrated efforts by the telecoms company to work with an influential adviser to the new president as the Trump administration took up major industry issues and considered AT&T's $85 billion proposal to buy  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX).

KAI builds the T-50 trainer jet which has been developed with U.S. fighter jet maker  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT). The two firms have partnered to compete in an auction for the U.S. Air Force's advanced pilot trainer jet procurement of about 350 new jets. The results of the auction are expected later this year.

493,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>",Senators ask billionaire Icahn for refinery waiver details,"By Jarrett Renshaw
(Reuters) - Six Democratic U.S. senators have asked billionaire investor Carl Icahn and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt to explain how an Icahn-owned refinery secured a valuable EPA exemption from the nation's biofuels law.
The request, made in letters sent late on Tuesday and reviewed by Reuters, adds pressure on the embattled EPA chief over his pro-business policies, as well as on Icahn, whose dual role last year as an investor and presidential adviser is being investigated by the Justice Department.
Reuters reported last week that EPA granted a small refinery hardship waiver from the nation's biofuel laws to an Oklahoma refinery operated by Icahn's  CVR Energy Inc  (N:CVI), allowing it to avoid tens of millions of dollars worth of costs related to the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard.
""We ... are troubled that a company that is owned by a billionaire former 'special adviser' to the President who is currently under investigation by federal prosecutors ... has now received an 'economic hardship waiver',"" the senators wrote in the letters to Icahn and Pruitt.
Icahn did not respond to a request for comment. His attorney, Jesse Lynn, declined to comment. 
The senators asked Icahn and Pruitt for details on the waiver, including records of discussions between both men in the months before it was granted. 
The letters were signed by Democrats Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. 
The RFS requires refiners to add biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into their gasoline and diesel, or to buy blending credits from rival companies that do - a policy intended to help farmers, cut petroleum imports, and reduce air pollution.
EPA has the authority to exempt small refineries of less than 75,000 barrels per day of capacity if they can prove they are struggling financially with these regulations.
The agency has said it has granted more than two dozen such waivers in recent months, but has refused to confirm the recipients, saying the information is business sensitive. The EPA has in the past tended to grant less than ten per year, according to a former official. 
Reuters has reported that Andeavor (N:ANDV), one of America’s biggest refining companies, was among the other companies that have received hardship waivers from Trump’s EPA for its small refineries. 
An early supporter of Trump’s 2016 presidential run and a key supporter on Wall Street, Icahn had met with Pruitt when Pruitt was being vetted in late 2016 for the EPA administrator job, and later served as a special regulatory adviser to the Republican president.
Icahn stepped down from his advisory role last August after lawmakers cited potential ethical problems. 

Currently, Icahn is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for his role in influencing biofuels policy while serving as Trump's adviser. Some U.S. lawmakers have expressed concern that Icahn may have used his presidential access to benefit his investments, a charge Icahn has rejected.

Other inflation measures are slightly higher. ""I think they will not mind seeing it get above 2%,"" says Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Futures. ""They don't want markets to fear a fourth hike this year just because inflation is above 2%.""The majority opinion on Wall Street is still three interest rate hikes in 2018.Going forward, however, there are two wild cards for the central bank.The first is the massive tax cut package and how long that takes to percolate through the economy.The second is oil prices, which are near a four-year high, and, analysts say, are capable of hitting $100 a barrel, under the right set of circumstances.Alone or together, they could force the Fed's hand."

Peugeot-manufacturer PSA (PA:PEUP), one of the big European businesses with operations in the country, said it hoped the European Union would adopt a common position on Iran.
""Like other economic players, we are following the evolution of the matter, and are also following the EU's official position on this topic,"" said a spokesman for PSA, adding that PSA hoped the EU would adopt its own independent position regarding Iran.
Siemens said it would also closely monitor the situation.
""We are assessing the implications of the Iran decision,"" Siemens Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas told reporters.
""Of course we will always comply with export control regulations, and we would look at how different governments set the rules. We have a firm grip on our position,"" added Thomas.
Airbus, which won a bumper order with IranAir along with Boeing (N:BA), said it needed time to study the impact of Trump's decision on Iran.
On May 8, President Trump pulled the United States out of the international nuclear deal with Iran, raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upsetting European allies and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies.
France, which has had close business ties with Iran since before the fall of the Shah in 1979, has sought to deepen trade ties since sanctions against Iran were lifted in 2016.
Major French companies operating in Iran include PSA, rival carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) and oil major  Total  (PA:TOTF).
Trump's decision could scupper Total's multibillion-dollar gas project in the country unless it can secure a waiver.

Shares in Renault, PSA and Airbus all fell on Wednesday, although Total's share price climbed higher, as oil prices rose in the wake of Trump's move to pull the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear agreement deal.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares were supported on Wednesday by strength in oil stocks after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of Iran's nuclear agreement, boosting crude prices.
While some well-received earnings updates also provided support, shares in companies with exposure to Iran fell, with plane maker Airbus (PA:AIR) and car makers  Renault  (PA:RENA) and PSA (PA:PEUP) all trading down more than 1 percent.
By 0823 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) had risen nearly 0.2 percent to fresh three-month highs, while higher crude prices helped the commodity-stocks-heavy FTSE index (FTSE) gain 0.4 percent.
The oil and gas index (SXEP) was the biggest sectoral gainer, up 1.5 percent at a three-year high as crude rallied after Trump's move on Iran raised the risk of conflict in the Middle East and cast uncertainty over global supplies.
""Whilst other signatories remain onboard, Trump’s decision potentially turns the geopolitical instability dial up a notch, especially in the Middle East,"" said Accendo Markets analysts in a note.
Shares in oil majors  Total  (PA:TOTF), Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and Eni (MI:ENI) were all trading up between 1.1 and 2.3 percent.
But higher oil prices weighed on travel stocks like airlines, whose sector index (SXTP) was also hit by a 1.8 drop in Europe's largest travel and tourism group TUI Group (L:TUIT), as its earnings update failed to inspire. 
Elsewhere,  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) rose 4.6 percent after the German industrial giant raised its full year profit guidance, offsetting worries over exposure to Iran.
Analysts at Jefferies reiterated their buy rating on the stock, saying the quarterly performance of Siemens was strong apart from the results of its power and gas (PG) business. 
""This was a very mixed picture from Siemens with PG taking the shine off what were actually very good results... with the core automation businesses doing especially well,"" they wrote.

Equities in Europe have recently outperformed Wall Street, supported by a weakening euro against a surging dollar, while the earnings season has also been supportive. 
According to Thomson Reuters data, earnings beats on the MSCI EMU index outnumbered missed by nearly 6 to 3 so far, with first quarter growth seen at 3.2 percent in local currency.

The planned transaction would be the first public bond issue by a Qatari bank since a political dispute erupted in June last year between Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt.
Qatari banks have sought to diversify their funding since the boycott started.
Commercial Bank said last month it had borrowed $250 million through a loan syndicated in the Asian market, and earlier this year it sold bonds in the Swiss franc market.
Its larger peer, Qatar National Bank , also resorted to various niche markets, issuing private placements, Australian dollar-denominated bonds and Formosa bonds in Taiwan.
But the Qatari government issued last month its first public bonds since the Gulf rift started, raising $12 billion, and opening the way for other Qatari entities to issue public international bonds.
The deal, which was largely oversubscribed, set a benchmark that investors can now use to price Qatari debt issues amid the ongoing regional diplomatic crisis.
Qatar's Commercial Bank has hired BofA Merrill Lynch, Al Khaliji,  Barclays  (LON:BARC), QNB Capital,  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) as joint lead managers for the planned debt sale, it said on Wednesday.
The five-year senior unsecured bond will be of benchmark size, which normally means upwards of $500 million, the bank said in a statement on Wednesday.
Commercial Bank representatives will meet investors in Asia and Europe starting from May 10.

500,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 10:22AM ET</span>",Novartis has ended contract with firm linked to Trump lawyer,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker  Novartis  (S:NOVN) has ended a contract with a firm linked to U.S. President Donald Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, saying it was now seen as a mistake.
Novartis, which has not been accused of any illegal activity, made payments totaling nearly $1.2 million to the U.S. firm. It was approached last year by the U.S. special counsel who wanted to know about the money while probing potential meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.
The company said it had ended the one-year contract with Cohen's firm struck in February 2017. An attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels named Novartis among companies that made payments to Cohen's Essential Consultants outfit until early this year.
The contract with Cohen, who is the subject of a criminal investigation, was struck before Novartis Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan was promoted on Feb. 1 from Novartis's chief drug developer to CEO. 
The Harvard-trained doctor has vowed to burnish Novartis's reputation as a maker of innovative drugs and leave allegations of wrongdoing behind.
""In hindsight, this must be seen as a mistake,"" senior Novartis spokesman Michael Willi told Reuters. He did not elaborate.
Narasimhan was among business leaders who dined with Trump in January at Switzerland's World Economic Forum annual meeting.
In February 2017, Novartis inked the one-year pact with Essential Consultants that the Swiss company said was focused on U.S. healthcare policy. ""The terms were consistent with the market. The agreement expired in February 2018.""
The consulting contract called for monthly payments of $100,000 each, though wire transfer fees reduced the amounts slightly, Novartis said.
Novartis said it engaged Essential Consultants at a time when the Swiss company was led by CEO Joe Jimenez, adding: ""Dr. Narasimhan had no involvement whatsoever.""
Jimenez did not return a message seeking comment.
Michael Avenatti, Daniels' attorney, speaking in U.S. television interviews with ABC and MSNBC on Tuesday, declined to say where he received the information about the payments. He also said AT&T (NYSE:T) and Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd made separate payments.
Novartis was contacted last year by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office regarding the Essential Consultants pact, it said. 
""Novartis cooperated fully with the Special Counsel's office and provided all the information requested. Novartis considers this matter closed.""
Avenatti raised questions about the companies' actions, including Novartis, telling MSNBC it was unclear what healthcare expertise Cohen could provide to a global drug firm.
In March, shareholders criticized Novartis executives at its annual meeting, urging them to exert greater ""moral influence"" amid allegations of corruption in Greece.
Since 2015, Novartis has paid hundreds of millions in settlements and fines after kickback allegations in South Korea, the United States and China.
Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, maintains Cohen paid her $130,000 to hush up a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump. He denies any affair with Daniels.

Russia denies election interference allegations, and Trump has denied any collusion.

""Credit growth, especially in the residential mortgage segment, is slowing and non-interest revenue is likely to remain stagnant or decrease,"" Fitch Ratings said.
The banks would have to raise lending margins to maintain profitability, though that remained a challenging prospect in the face of an inquiry into the financial sector, the rating agency said.
Australia's biggest banks are imposing stricter lending conditions on borrowers as damaging disclosures at the Royal Commission into financial-sector misconduct prompt fears the economy will be the victim of a new era of subdued credit growth.
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) said last week revenue growth would slow in the wake of inquiry, which has revealed sweeping irregularity in lending practices, as tighter regulation makes it harder for customers to borrow money.
In its 2018 budget, the Australian government flagged a possibility that household spending might be affected by any unanticipated tightening in financial conditions, possibly as a consequence of the Royal Commission.
Australia has an oligopoly banking system - with ANZ, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp and National Australia Bank making up the so-called ""Big Four"" - which collectively dominate property, investment and business lending, giving Australians limited options when seeking credit.
The banks withstood the financial crisis, and found ways to increase revenues and profits even during times when regulations were ratcheted up, such as a 2012-13 crackdown on investment and insurance product-selling practices.
But the first few months of the Royal Commission inquiry are creating more than just a reputational hazard, with the practices, structures and market dominance of the banks subjected to unprecedented scrutiny.

New regulatory controls are almost certain to be imposed, as examples of fraud and poor lending controls are revealed.

France, which has had close business ties with Iran since before the fall of the Shah in 1979, has sought to deepen trade ties since sanctions against Iran were lifted in 2016.

Major French companies operating in Iran include PSA, rival carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) and oil major  Total  (PA:TOTF), while Airbus (PA:AIR) has also won orders from IranAir.

506,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>",Vietnam stock valuations seen as pricey after IPO binge,"By Anshuman Daga and Mai Nguyen
SINGAPORE/HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam has just celebrated its two biggest IPOs and its first-ever ranking as Southeast Asia's hottest capital market. But its benchmark index has also just suffered its worst monthly fall in seven years, prompting fund managers and strategists to warn valuations may have peaked.
The small frontier market, whose main index has a market value of $128 billion, has in recent years become an investor darling, buoyed by a fast-growing economy and expectations that it could be reclassified as a mainstream emerging market when the index provider MSCI publishes its annual review in June.
Investor appetite has been whetted further by the government's ambitious privatization and market reform plans.
The Vietnam Index (VNI) is still up 7 percent this year, and 70 percent over the last two years, but some analysts say that risks are rising as blue chips become expensive.
Hasnain Malik, equity research head at the London-based Exotix Capital, said that interest in Vietnam was ""built on low political risk, export and consumption growth and low inflation"", but investors had priced in those positives already.
""The market is more sensitive to any whiff of disappointment, rather than further confirmation of the positive,"" Malik said.
In addition to a sell-off in emerging markets and concerns over new rules related to margin lending, worries that Vietnamese stocks are over-valued led to a 10 percent fall in the market last month, which compares with a rise of 1 percent in MSCI's Asia ex-Japan index (MIAPJ0000PUS).
Large Vietnamese companies - those valued at more than $1 billion - are on aggregate trading at 19 times estimated profits for the next 12 months, compared with 14.7 times for Indonesia and 15.1 for Philippines, Reuters data shows.
Some firms stand out: Vingroup trades at 37 times estimated earnings.
Alan Richardson, senior portfolio manager of ASEAN equities at Samsung (KS:005930) Asset Management said: ""The market is over-valued because investors have not priced in potential risk of rising capital markets volatility"" from external factors like the brewing trade war between China and the United States.
He also cited tighter liquidity stemming from rising U.S. bond yields and the appreciation of the dollar.
All that could make equity fund flows turn negative. 
Still, the sale of shares in Vinhomes, a residential property developer that is part of the country's biggest conglomerate,  Vingroup JSC  (HM:VIC), raised $2.2 billion over in the past month and attracted the likes of GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, and Mirae Asset Global Investments.
This eclipsed an equity offering from Techcombank, which raised about $920 million from investors including Fidelity, GIC and Dragon Capital, a local fund, last month.
Cornerstone investors took up roughly three-quarters of both issues, underlining strong interest in businesses benefiting from the booming economy and expanding middle class.
TOP PERFORMER
Despite the recent slump, Vietnam's equity market still ranks as Asia's best performer over the last two years.
The country has experienced a manufacturing boom that spurred its export-dependent economy to grow by 7.4 percent in the first quarter of this year - its fastest pace in a decade - after growing by 6.8 percent last year. 
The government also has ambitious privatization plans and is aiming for IPOs for 64 state companies in 2018, including the telecoms firm MobiFone, and 18 others in 2019 such as the coffee company Vinacafe. Vietnam also plan to sell down state holdings in a further 181 already-privatized companies this year.
Some fund managers see the party ending for large cap stocks.
Foreigners were net buyers of $71 million worth of Vietnamese shares in April but they turned net sellers this month and offloaded a combined $102 million in the first five sessions this month, exchange data shows.
""Looking ahead, we believe the multiple expansion phase in the blue chips is more or less over and from here the market is likely to perform in line with profit growth,"" said Mattias Martinsson, chief investment officer at Swedish fund manager Tundra Fonder.
""For the next 2-3 years we expect profit growth will average at least double digit.""
Even as they tout Vietnam's potential, some investors say the market decline may have been overdue.

""A number of the big companies have very attractive growth propositions but maybe, valuations have got a little bit overextended,"" said Lai Yeu Huan, senior portfolio manager at Nikko Asset Management Asia. ""It's a good thing that it's correcting and shaking out some of the excessive valuations.""

The heavyweight meeting, which had government representatives from countries including China, the Philippines, Thailand and Cambodia, aimed to provide an information exchange platform as rapidly evolving technology makes it harder to regulate illicit money flows.
China has battled to curb capital outflows for years. The country’s special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau have been key places where capital has seeped out from. The gambling hub of Macau last year introduced facial recognition technology at ATMs to target the illicit outflows from mainland China.
Anselmo Teng, former head of the Macau Monetary Authority and co-chair of the Alliance for Financial Stability with Information Technology, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday that “ATM cash withdrawals has dropped as a result of the KYC measures because it has effectively stopped this cross border illegal cash withdrawal activity.”
Teng, who retired from the Monetary Authority in August last year, added that the measures had been so effective that withdrawals had dropped to more than half of what they were previously. 
Industry estimates had put the monthly withdrawal volume at HK$10 billion ($1.27 billion) from ATMs in the former Portuguese colony prior to the introduction of the facial recognition technology.
Since Macau introduced the new measures, withdrawals in Hong Kong have surged, prompting scrutiny from monetary authorities, the banking industry and police amid media reports that mainland Chinese are withdrawing hundreds of thousands of dollars using up to 50 cards at a time.
The HKMA said monthly cash withdrawals using mainland bank cards ranged between HK$2 billion and HK$6 billion in 2017.
Clarie Lo, co-chair of the Alliance and former Deputy Secretary of the Hong Kong government’s Financial Services and Treasury Bureau, said Macau’s experience could help other countries around Asia.
“Things like the experience from Macau will be very useful and beneficial for other jurisdictions around Asia which does not have this technology or knowhow to do so,” 
Philippines special envoy to China William Lima said the group was looking at how to better regulate and form a safe way for remittances for the thousands of Philippine workers overseas back to the country.

509,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 02:19AM ET</span>",Toyota flags lower annual operating profit on higher yen,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) on Wednesday forecast a 4.2 percent slide in operating profit for the current financial year, as it expects a stronger yen to offset slightly higher global vehicle sales and cost reductions. 
Japan's biggest automaker expects operating profit to ease to 2.3 trillion yen ($21.02 billion) in the year to March 2019, slightly higher than a median forecast for 2.19 trillion yen from 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Toyota's forecast is based on the assumption that the yen will trade around 105 yen to the U.S. dollar in the current financial year, compared with 111 yen in the year just ended. 
A stronger local currency can dent profits repatriated from overseas and raise the cost of finished products and parts when they are shipped between countries.
A hit to earnings will make it harder for Toyota, the world's most profitable automaker to continue investing in new technologies and products at a time when global automakers are competing fiercely to develop self-driving cars, electric vehicles, and connected technologies. 
It posted an operating profit of 2.4 trillion yen in the year just ended, outpacing rivals Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) for the fifth straight year. This resulted in an operating margin of 8.2 percent, roughly level with Daimler's 8.15 percent and trailing Indian maker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd's 11.3 percent, the highest among major global automakers.
The automaker is targeting total group sales of 10.5 million vehicles globally in the year to March, slightly more than 10.44 million vehicles last year. 
In the year to December 2017, Toyota was the world's No. 3 maker of passenger cars, following the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance (T:7201) (PA:RENA) (T:7211) and Volkswagen. 
It expects sales in North America, its biggest market, to
ease slightly to 2.8 million units, while sales in Asia are seen rising to 1.67 million units from 1.54 million last year. 
In North America, Toyota and its domestic rivals are grappling with intense competition along with falling demand for sedans, a mainstay of Japanese automakers in the region, amid an overall slowdown in the world's second-biggest auto market.

510,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2018 12:10AM ET</span>",AIG shareholders set to vote on pay package for new CEO,"By Suzanne Barlyn
NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (N:AIG) faces an uphill climb to convince shareholders to approve a $43.1 million pay package for Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault during the company's annual meeting on Wednesday.
Two influential proxy advisory firms, International Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, have advised shareholders to reject the package in the non-binding vote, saying it did not align with AIG's performance.
AIG's stock has dropped 13 percent since Duperreault took charge of the company last May.
The company's pay arrangements include $24.2 million for former CEO Peter Hancock, who stepped down last year under pressure, with a $5 million cash award ""for his service through the transition"" to Duperreault, according to the company's annual proxy filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March.
It is unusual for both advisory firms to recommend voting against pay measures for the same company. ISS recommends votes against pay only about 12 percent of the time for companies listed on the broad-based Russell 3000 stock index, an ISS spokesman said.
That could sway shareholders, corporate governance experts said.
""It seems that investors do react to these recommendations,"" Jill Brown, a management professor at Waltham, Massachusetts-based Bentley University, said in an email. 
Brown pointed to a March non-binding vote by Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) shareholders, who rejected a $48.5 million executive compensation plan for Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger by a 52 percent majority. 
Both proxy advisory firms had advised against Iger's package.
GRADED 'F'
Glass Lewis gave AIG's package a letter grade of ""F.""
""Overall, the company paid significantly more than its peers, but performed significantly worse than its peers,"" the report said.
ISS said one-time awards to Duperreault when he joined the company, including a $12 million cash bonus, were not tied to performance.
AIG declined to comment on the proxy recommendations.
AIG's board compensation committee ""believes this award properly motivates Mr. Duperreault to create sustainable, profitable growth for AIG, aligning his interests with those of our shareholders,"" the proxy filing states.
Some investors have previously said they would approve of Duperreault's pay so long as he performs.
Duperreault has vowed to help the company expand and boost revenue. He has been working to improve underwriting practices, increase AIG’s focus on technology and install new executives across the insurer to jumpstart profits. 
AIG is also preparing to finalize its acquisition of reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd (N:VR).
But his steps have yet to boost the bottom line.
In March, AIG said it paid Duperreault $43.1 million last year, according to the proxy filing. Excluding one-time components, Duperreault earned $14.9 million.
That figure was similar to the $15.3 million paid to MetLife Inc (N:MET) CEO and Chairman Steven Kandarian in 2016, and less than the $27.1 million paid in 2017 to John Strangfeld, chairman and CEO of Prudential Financial Inc (N:PRU), according to proxy filings by those companies.
AIG shares have closed as high as $66.06 on Aug. 3, compared with $61.82 on the first trading day following his mid-May appointment.

The stock ended down 0.4 percent on Tuesday at $53.08.

(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (N:T) said on Tuesday it had hired Essential Consultants, a company linked to Donald Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, to advise it on working with the new administration in early 2017, around the time of Trump's inauguration.
The business arrangement illustrates efforts by the telecommunications company to work with an influential adviser to the new president as his administration took up major industry issues and considered its $85 billion proposal to buy  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX).
Payments by AT&T were described earlier on Tuesday by Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels, who released a report alleging that a company owned by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, AT&T and other corporations had made payments to Essential Consultants. 
Avenatti's report said AT&T had paid $200,000 in four equal payments to Essential Consultants between Oct, 3, 2017, and Jan. 3, 2018.
""Essential Consultants was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,"" AT&T said in a statement.
""They did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017,"" it said, without commenting further.
Reuters could not immediately verify Avenatti's claim and it was not clear how he would have knowledge of any payment from Vekselberg to Cohen. Cohen and Avenatti did not respond immediately to requests for comment from Reuters.
Daniels had previously said she was paid $130,000 by Cohen to stay quiet about a sexual encounter with Trump, an encounter which Trump has denied.
The Wall Street Journal released a 2016 Delaware certificate of formation for Essential Consultants that was signed by Michael Cohen.
A person familiar with the matter said AT&T engaged with Essential Consultants around the time of the inauguration to understand how the company would be affected by several issues from the new administration, including tax reform and net neutrality.

The payments from AT&T in late 2017 and early 2018 came as it was advocating for its proposed takeover of Time Warner, which the U.S. Justice Department is trying to stop. The deal, announced in October 2016, was quickly denounced by Trump, who as a candidate and later as president has been critical of Time Warner's CNN.

The Glassdoor deal marks the latest in a string of overseas investments by Recruit that, like several other Japanese firms, has been pushing to increase its offshore presence over the past few years to make up for weak prospects at home. It already gets 40 percent of it total revenue from foreign markets.
Buying Glassdoor will expand Recruit's reach in the United States, a market it tapped through its acquisition of Connecticut-based job search site Indeed in 2012.
Privately held Glassdoor was valued at about $1 billion at its last round of fundraising in 2016. It counts billionaire Chase Coleman's hedge fund Tiger Global Management, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Capital, and T. Rowe Price among its investors.
Glassdoor will continue to be led by its current chief executive and co-founder, Robert Hohman, Recruit said.
Recruit will fund the acquisition with cash on hand and expects to close the deal during the July-September quarter, subject to regulatory approvals.
Shares in the Japanese company rose almost 4 percent on Wednesday to a three-month high on news of the deal.
""In the mid-term, Recruit seeks to further expand in the U.S. and globally through both organic growth and M&A investments,"" the company said in a statement. 
For the Glassdoor deal, Recruit was advised by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) while Sullivan & Cromwell LLP provided legal counsel. Qatalyst Partners acted as financial adviser to Glassdoor, while Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher was its legal adviser. 
GLASSDOOR A 'POWERFUL PLATFORM'
Founded in 2007, Glassdoor features profiles of companies and allows users to rate and review employers and top managers as well as provide information on interviews and salaries.
It has reviews and insights for 770,000 companies located in more than 190 countries, Glassdoor said in a statement.
""Glassdoor presents a powerful platform that is changing how people find jobs everywhere,"" Recruit COO Hisayuki Idekoba said.
According to Recruit, Glassdoor had revenues of $170 million and a net loss of $22.2 million for the year ended March, and currently employs 750 people. 
Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Glassdoor was interviewing banks to advise on an IPO expected in the second half of the year, citing people familiar with the matter.
Recruit was established in 1960 as a job ad agency for a college newspaper, but has grown into a human resource services conglomerate, made up of staffing, job placement and marketing site operations. It reported an annual revenue of about 1.8 trillion yen ($16.44 billion) for the year ended March 2017.
Recruit shares were up about 3 percent by 0528 GMT, in a wider market (N225) that was down half a percent.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's finance minister said on Wednesday the country will limit General Motors' (N:GM) right to sell shares and assets in its South Korean unit so that the U.S. automaker is kept from leaving the nation for at least 10 years.
Last month, GM and South Korea reached a preliminary deal to inject $4.35 billion into the loss-making unit to keep it afloat. The U.S. automaker has announced plans to close one of its four South Korean plants and cut headcount by almost 3,000 workers. 
""We will limit GM's rights to sell a stake in GM Korea and regain the Korea Development Bank's veto rights,"" Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said in a radio interview.
The U.S. automaker owns 77 percent of GM Korea, while KDB holds 17 percent and China's SAIC Motor Corp (SS:600104) controls the remaining 6 percent.
Under the preliminary deal with GM, the state-run Korean bank will regain veto power that allows it to block the sale of more than 20 percent of the unit's assets, a KDB official has previously said. 
""At least 10 years (of GM staying in Korea) will be guaranteed,"" he said. ""We will make sure GM will contribute to the South Korean economy by running normal operations for the long term."" 
He said the two sides are making last-minute talks to reach a ""deal package"" which would include an injection of $750 million by KDB into the unit and loans from GM of as much as $3.6 billion won.
A GM Korea spokesman declined to comment, saying talks are ongoing. KDB declined to comment.
Kaher Kazem, CEO of GM Korea, said in an internal letter on Tuesday that it plans to reach a binding, final agreement with the government on Friday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Crude oil prices hit 3-1/2-year highs on Wednesday after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, while the dollar touched a new high for the year and world stocks held steady.
Trump's move sparked fears of increased tension in the Middle East and uncertainty over global oil supplies. [O/R]
Demand for safe-haven assets remained muted as the immediate market impact was seen as specific to oil supply, but investors remained mindful of the knock-on effects on inflation. 
Gold prices  retreated and bond yields rose. The U.S. 10-year Treasury (US10YT=RR) once again breached the psychologically significant 3-percent level and hit a two-week high of 3.0140 percent, supported by expectations of higher interest rates.
""In an environment where the Fed, particularly, is already at its inflation target and people are closely watching the pace of the monetary tightening, something like this which could possibly nudge inflation a little bit higher is going to be quite interesting for the market,"" UBS Wealth Management's UK chief investment office deputy head, Caroline Simmons, said.
""That's why you're seeing the yields go up a little bit on the bonds,"" she said.
The impact of Trump's decision was mostly limited to oil markets and energy-related stocks. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLc1) hit their highest level since November 2014 at $71.17 per barrel, last up 2.7 percent.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) jumped as much as 2.8 percent to a 3-1/2-year high of $77.20.
""There is still an interim period before sanctions kick in. And other signatories and Iran want to keep the deal going so there is a period where things could be hammered out,"" ING rates strategist Benjamin Schroeder said.
""But I would have expected a bit of a safe-haven bid this morning,"" he noted, referring to bonds.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat and continued to trade in a narrow range. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) meanwhile rose 0.2 percent as oil majors gained and earnings from  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and Imperial Brands (L:IMB) dominated trading.
In the U.S., stocks futures pointed to a positive start for Wall Street, with E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) up 0.5 percent.
""In the very short term, it looks as if the impact of heightened geopolitical worries was limited to oil markets. But that is not the end of the story,"" Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities senior investment strategist Norihiro Fujito said.
""U.S. sanctions could affect various industries. And tensions between Iran and Israel look set to intensify. Those will begin to cap share prices,"" he said.
The reaction in Asian markets was more pronounced as renewed U.S. sanctions on Tehran were seen as disruptive for many companies that have dealings with Iran. Trump's move is also seen as likely to worsen already-tense relations between Iran and U.S. allies in the region.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) was up 0.1 percent, while Japan's Nikkei (N225) fell 0.4 percent.
Iran, the third-biggest OPEC producer, produces about 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd), or about 4 percent of the world's oil supplies.
The U.S. Treasury said it will reimpose a wide array of Iran-related sanctions after the expiry of 90- and 180-day wind-down periods, including those aimed at Iran's oil sector and transactions with its central bank.
DOLLAR STEPS BACK FROM HIGH
The rise in Treasury yields helped fuel the dollar's rally, with the greenback hitting a new 2018 high before giving up gains.
The dollar index against a basket of major currencies (DXY) was at 93.026. It has risen about 1 percent this year.
Souring risk sentiment is hitting emerging markets, which have been depressed in recent weeks by concerns about capital outflows, as the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates lures investors back to U.S. bonds rather than riskier assets.
Countries with high perceived political risks, such as Brazil and Turkey, were among the worst hit.
The Brazilian real hit a near two-year low  and the Turkish lira  reached a record low. Since the start of this week, those currencies are both down about 1 percent.
The Indonesian rupiah hit a 2-1/2-year low , and has slid 1 percent this week.
Among major currencies, the risk-sensitive Australian dollar hit an 11-month low of $0.74130 and last stood at $0.74510 .
The euro recovered slightly after hitting a new 4-1/2-month low of $1.1821 and last stood at $1.1880 (EUR=), having fallen about 4 percent in the past three weeks.
The currency was hit by increasing prospects of another election in Italy as the political impasse there has continued since early March's vote.
The British pound  was slightly firmer at $1.3538 but remained close to a four-month low ahead of the Bank of England's meeting on Thursday.

The dollar rose 0.5 percent to 109.65 yen , edging near its three-month high of 110.02 yen touched last week.

515,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2018 08:48PM ET</span>",Exclusive: United Airlines in talks to buy wide-body jets - sources,"By Tim Hepher and Alana Wise
PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Airlines (N:UAL) is in talks with planemakers Airbus (PA:AIR) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) over the purchase of wide-body, long-haul passenger jets to replace a fleet of 50 Boeing 767 aircraft, people familiar with the discussions said on Tuesday.
Europe's Airbus is expected to offer its upgraded A330neo jet against Boeing's 787 Dreamliner in a deal potentially worth some $14 billion at list prices, the two sources said. All three companies declined to comment on the nature of the talks.
A win in the jet production contest would be especially important for Airbus, whose struggling A330neo program has lost a number of recent bids to U.S. rival Boeing for wide-body, long-haul aircraft.
Hawaiian Airlines in March chose Boeing to supply 10 new 787-9 aircraft, dropping an earlier order of the A330neo.
The European planemaker was again bested last month when American Airlines, the world's largest carrier, chose Boeing to supply 47 new 787 Dreamliner jets.
The fate of an order for 28 A330neos from IranAir is also in jeopardy, on concerns over a Tuesday decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to withdraw the United States from an international nuclear deal.
Airbus Americas Chairman Jeff Knittel said Airbus remained confident in the A330neo despite recent setbacks.
""This is a marathon, not a sprint,"" he told Reuters.
""We are talking to a number of people as potential customers. We think the airplane makes sense and we are optimistic.""
He declined to say whether United was among the airlines with which Airbus is involved in discussions.
The Chicago-based carrier's fleet already includes Boeing 787s, and the carrier has firm commitments for an additional 14 jets scheduled for delivery through 2027. 

It does not fly the A330 family, the latest version of which - the A330neo - is due to enter service this summer.

WILMINGTON, Del (Reuters) - An affiliate of Lantern Capital received approval from a U.S. bankruptcy judge on Tuesday to buy the assets of the Weinstein Co, but the price may leave little for those who alleged sexual harassment by founder Harvey Weinstein.
Lantern Entertainment was the only bidder for the company, which filed for bankruptcy after more than 70 women came forward accusing Weinstein of sexual misconduct, including rape.
Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. 
The Weinstein Co described Lantern's bid as $310 million in cash, with assumption of $127.2 million of secured debt.
An attorney for the official creditors committee said the actual purchase price, after adjustments, was going to be closer to $260 million. 
""That doesn’t leave enough money for all the creditors,"" Debra Grassgreen, a Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones attorney who represents the creditors committee, said at Tuesday's hearing. She said the best hope for money for harassment plaintiffs may come from litigation, rather than the sale.
Lawyers for the Weinstein Co will begin the process of determining how to divide the funds raised from the sale of the assets, which includes films such as ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and the ""Project Runway"" television franchise.
The judge also granted a request by Harvey Weinstein to get access to company emails tied to women involved in 14 legal cases against him, which his lawyer said could be used in his defense.
Secured creditors get paid before general unsecured creditors, which includes claims for harassment. The company said it had about $345 million in secured debt when it filed for bankruptcy, including the debt Lantern is assuming.
Gloria Allred, who represents harassment plaintiffs, told Reuters on Sunday she doubted the bankruptcy process would leave enough money to pay all harassment claims. 
She said she had supported a deal led by former Obama administration official Maria Contreras-Sweet, who planned to compensate victims even if their claims were outside the statute of limitations.
That deal collapsed in February after New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued the company, making the bankruptcy inevitable. Schneiderman, who announced a surprise resignation on Monday, had said he wanted to ensure harassment plaintiffs would be compensated and employees of the company protected.

Schneiderman's resignation followed allegations of physical abuse by four women reported in the New Yorker magazine. Schneiderman in a statement on Monday said he had not assaulted anyone and had never engaged in non-consensual sex.

528,By Investing.com,"<span>May 08, 2018 04:36PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. Wholesale Inflation in Focus
A report on wholesale inflation will likely warrant close attention as it is due a day ahead of the consumer inflation report slated for Thursday.
Inflation growth at the wholesale level as measured by the producer price index due 08:30am ET is expected to have cooled to 0.2% in April from 0.3% in the prior month.
Market participants are likely to scrutinise the report amid expectations that higher input prices for manufacturers would be passed onto consumers, triggering a boost in consumer inflation.
The Federal Reserve last week expressed confidence inflation would meet its 2% target, keeping the central bank on track to maintain its gradual pace of rate hikes.
The dollar rose to a 2018 high on Tuesday against a basket of major currencies supported by an ongoing slump in EUR/USD amid renewed geopolitical uncertainty in the Eurozone.
2. Oil Reaction to Trump’s Iran Deal Announcement; Weekly US Crude Supplies Data
The reaction in oil prices following U.S. president Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal will remain in focus on Wednesday.
Inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday will also garner investor attention amid expectations U.S. crude stockpiles will fall for the first time in three weeks.
Economists forecast crude inventories fell by about 0.719 million barrels in the week ended May 4.
Crude oil prices settled lower on Tuesday but pared some of their losses heading into settlement as traders digested Trump’s announcement to withdraw the US from the Iran nuclear deal, and institute the highest level of economic sanctions on Iran.
3. Boeing, Earnings in Focus
Shares of  Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA) came under pressure Tuesday amid fears the aircraft maker’s multibillion dollar deals with Iran could come under pressure after the United States pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal.
Boeing and Iran’s Aseman airline penned a $3 billion agreement for 30 737 Max jets, Bloomberg reported. The aircraft maker also struck a $16.6 billion deal with national carrier Iran Air for 80 aircraft, taking the total value of its agreement with Iran to roughly $20 billion.
Boeing said it would ""consult with the U.S. Government on next steps,"" following Trump’s announcement.
Meanwhile, on the corporate earnings front, a slew of quarterly earnings due Wednesday are expected from:
 Groupon Inc  (NASDAQ:GRPN),  Roku  Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) ,  Weibo Corp  (NASDAQ:WB), SINA Corp (NASDAQ:SINA),  Office Depot  Inc (NASDAQ:ODP), Anheuser Busch Inbev (BR:ABI) NV ADR (NYSE:BUD), Twenty-First Century  Fox Inc  (NASDAQ:FOX) and Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG)."

(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) quarterly profit topped Wall Street forecasts on Tuesday as higher returns from its theme parks and film studio offset ongoing pressure on the television business from digital competition.
Shares of the media conglomerate, which is in the process of buying film and TV assets from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA), slipped 0.5 percent to $101.23 in after-hours trading.
So far this year, Disney shares have dropped 5.3 percent, more than the 0.1 percent for the S&P 500 Index (SPX).
The owner of ESPN, the Disney Channels and ABC is trying to transform itself into a leader in digital entertainment as younger viewers abandon traditional television packages for streaming platforms such as Netflix Inc (O:NFLX). 
Net income in the media networks unit, Disney's largest division, fell 6 percent to $2.1 billion as ESPN continued to lose subscribers. The results also were hurt by investments in streaming technology company BAMTech, which was moved into the cable unit after Disney acquired a controlling stake to help its digital push. 
Disney reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.84 from January through March, compared with the $1.70 per share that analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The theme park unit reported net income of $954 million, up 27 percent as attendance and guest spending rose. Disney raised some single-day admission prices in February. 
Chief Executive Bob Iger, on a conference call with analysts, said the company would consider expanding its parks business in China and other markets. 
""It doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to build something anytime very soon, but we're going to look,"" he said.
At the movie studio, profit hit $847 million thanks largely to the success of superhero movie ""Black Panther."" The film from Disney's Marvel Studios has exceeded expectations with $1.3 billion in global ticket sales, making it the ninth-highest grossing film in movie history.
In the meantime, Disney is attempting to close a $52 billion bid for film, TV and international businesses from Fox. The deal is under regulatory review and has been complicated by U.S. cable operator Comcast Corp's (O:CMCSA) bigger offer for one of the businesses, Britain's Sky Plc (L:SKYB). 
Comcast also may make a play for all of the Fox assets that Disney wants, sources have told Reuters. The cable company has been speaking to investment banks about obtaining bridge financing for an all-cash bid of those businesses, three people familiar with the matter said on Monday. 
The Fox purchase is designed to bring in more programming to help attract streaming audiences.

In an interview on CNBC, Iger said he remained confident the Fox deal would go through.

563,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Iran faces banking turmoil after U.S. nuclear deal exit,"By Jonathan Saul and Parisa Hafezi
LONDON/ANKARA (Reuters) - Some Iranians had been cashing in their savings even before U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement he would pull out from the international nuclear deal with Iran, straining a banking system weighed down by bad loans and years of isolation.
An official with Iran's biggest state-owned Melli Bank told Reuters savings had declined by an unspecified amount, although he said this was a temporary phenomenon and that they would recover once the uncertainty over Trump's decision passed.
""When there is political uncertainty, its psychological impact on people causes a drop in savings. But it will pass after Trump's deadline,"" the official said before the announcement, declining to be named.
Trump said on Tuesday he would quit the deal and impose ""the highest level of economic sanctions"".
A senior Iranian central bank official said conditions within the banking system had deteriorated in the past year, and ""we have still not passed the danger zone"" but added that the central bank had ""all the measures ready to prevent any crisis"".
Officials with other leading lenders, Saman, Pasargad and Middle East Bank declined to comment.
The loss of confidence both reflects and contributes to wider problems threatening pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani in Iran's faction-ridden clerical establishment: investment has dried up as banks limit lending, growth is slowing and unemployment is at a record high, exposing Rouhani to growing criticism from hardliners.
""I am worried about a war,"" said Mina Abdelsalehi, 61, a retired teacher in Tehran. ""I have changed all my savings into gold coins that I can cash easily if anything happens.""
The rial currency lost close to half of its value in the six months to April in anticipation of a tougher U.S. approach, forcing Tehran to ban domestic foreign exchange transactions and limit foreign currency holdings to $12,000.
This failed to stop Iranians trying to buy hard currency on Tuesday, promoting a further slide in the rial, according to a foreign exchange website.
""Prices are going up almost every hour,"" said Ali Rasti, 45, owner of a real estate agency in Tehran. ""People are worried and prefer to keep their money at home.""
A separate Iranian banking official also said Iranians had taken out money. “Fearing a war and more sanctions, many Iranians have withdrawn their cash from banks,"" he said.
Mohammad Reza Pourebrahimi, head of parliament's economic committee, was quoted by the semi official ISNA news agency in March as saying capital outflows had been $30 billion in recent months. The International Monetary Fund said Iran's reserves were at nearly $112 billion in 2017/18. 
DASHED HOPES
Iran had struggled to reap the benefits from the accord, which lifted international sanctions on the central bank and lenders in 2016 in return for curbs on its nuclear program, but left U.S. restrictions in place to assuage fears it would benefit hardliners like the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC).
The IRGC, which reports directly to Iran’s Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, controls vast segments of the economy including some banking interests as well as everything from ports management to telecommunications.
Iranian banks re-established relationships with more than 200 international counterparts, but any business active in Iran has to ensure there are no ties with IRGC interests to avoid fines or bars on trading in the United States.
""Money is moving but not as freely as governments had hoped,"" said Justine Walker, head of sanctions policy with trade association UK Finance, saying complications had multiplied since Trump became president. Euro transactions were taking place, she said, but sterling payments ""remain challenging"".
Sources involved in transactions said they rarely exceeded 200 million euros ($240 million) due to difficulties with clearing payments.
Nigel Kushner, chief executive of British law firm W Legal, said his clients exporting consumer goods to Iran had reported a 50 percent drop in purchases over the past two months. ""There is a risk of further (bank) liquidity concerns,"" he said.
George Bennet, managing partner of financial services advisory firm OSACO Financial, which is active in Iran, said European lenders still in Iran were already nervous and limiting transactions to their largest and most valuable customers.
""The larger of the European banks currently doing business, which themselves are not large, with Iran will pull out of the market altogether,"" he said, when asked about the impact of the U.S. withdrawal.
OTHER CONSTRAINTS
Rouhani gambled on attracting foreign investment to help raise living standards but a raft of deals including plane purchases have been already been delayed.
FATF, a global group of government anti-money-laundering agencies, has kept Iran on its blacklist, adding to wariness by Western banks with dealing with Iran due to reputational risks.
Rouhani has struggled to reform the banking system, which, with 30 banks and other credit institutions, is more fragmented than those of other emerging markets and heavily burdened by bad loans.
Finance sources have estimated outstanding loans at around $283 billion and non-performing loans (NPLs) were estimated to have reached 12.5 percent in 2017 by US-based financial industry body the Institute of International Finance (IIF).
The latest official figure, 11.7 percent in 2016, equates to more than $30 billion. Some finance sources say NPLs could be even higher at close to 15 percent.
A textile factory owner in Mashhad said the government wanted to improve the economy but could not support business.
""How can I run my business when the dollar exchange rate is rising and I cannot get loans from the banks because of the high rates?"" he said on condition of anonymity, explaining he had laid off around half his 65 employees to try to stay afloat.
""I am not sure how long I can keep the factory open.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai met Tuesday with the chief executives of Sprint Corp (N:S) and rival T-Mobile US Inc (N:TMUS) who are seeking approval for a $26 billion merger, a spokesman for Pai said.
T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere and Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure met with Pai on Tuesday after meeting last week with FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, and Commissioner Mike O'Rielly, a Republican. The pair also met with Republican FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr on Tuesday, a person briefed on the matter said.
Company officials told the FCC last week they expected to file a formal application with the commission by the end of May. Claure said last week they had also had meetings with the Justice Department.
The FCC must determine if the merger is in the public interest, while the Justice Department must determine if the merger of the third- and fourth-largest U.S. carriers would harm competition. Consumer groups have complained the deal would lead to higher prices, hitting low-income people the hardest and leaving them fewer alternatives for communication.
Pai's predecessor, Tom Wheeler, said in 2014 it was ""good for consumers"" to have four carriers to choose from, while Pai declined to say in May 2017 if he thought four carriers was the right number of competitors.
Shareholders of Sprint, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), would get $6.62 for every share held. Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), T-Mobile’s majority owner, would own 42 percent and control the board of the combined company.
Claure said on an earnings call the companies had spent two days in Washington last week to ""present the merits of a merger."" Regulators ""said that they're going to analyze our case with open mind. There's no preconceived notions,"" he said.

The companies have touted tax reforms from the Trump administration, synergies at present value of $43 billion and plans to invest billions on developing a 5G network. They are also promising job growth and lower costs for wireless customers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Licenses for Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus to sell passenger jets to Iran will be revoked, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement.
Trump said he would reimpose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran, which were lifted under the agreement he had harshly criticized.
The pact, worked out by the United States, five other world powers and Iran, lifted sanctions in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program. It was designed to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. 
IranAir had ordered 200 passenger aircraft - 100 from Airbus SE, 80 from Boeing and 20 from Franco-Italian turboprop maker ATR. All the deals are dependent on U.S. licenses because of the heavy use of American parts in commercial planes.
Boeing agreed in December 2016 to sell 80 aircraft, worth $17 billion at list prices, to IranAir under an agreement between Tehran and major world powers to reopen trade in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities.
The U.S. Treasury Department, which controls licensing of exports, said the United States would no longer allow the export of commercial passenger aircraft, parts and services to Iran after a 90-day period.
""The Boeing and (Airbus) licenses will be revoked,"" Mnuchin told reporters at the Treasury. ""Under the original deal, there were waivers for commercial aircraft, parts and services and the existing licenses will be revoked."" 
European planemaker Airbus said on Tuesday before the Mnuchin news conference that it would study Trump's decision, adding that it would take some time. 
Following the 90-day period ending Aug. 6, the Treasury also said it would revoke a license that allowed U.S. companies to negotiate business deals with Iran. The Boeing license had been valid until September 2020, a person involved in the deal said. 
""As we have throughout this process, we’ll continue to follow the U.S. government’s lead,"" Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said before Mnuchin's comments.
Mnuchin said it may be possible for some companies over the next three months to seek waivers from the sanctions or new licenses to do business with Iran, but he did not identify which companies.
""That's something we'll consider on a case-by-case basis, but as an overview, I would say that the purpose is to broadly enforce the sanctions,"" he said, adding the administration's objective was to deny Iran access to the U.S. financial system.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said last month the airplane manufacturer had no Iranian deliveries scheduled this year. He said Boeing's 777 production plan ""is not dependent on the Iranian orders."" Muilenburg is set to address the Economic Club of Washington on Wednesday. 
The IranAir order included 15 Boeing 777-300ER long-range jets. Industry sources said Boeing had been tentatively due to send Iran three 777s this year but had reshuffled deliveries with other buyers.

Shares of Boeing closed down $2.06, or 0.6 percent, at $338.37 on the New York Stock Exchange after Trump's announcement.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (Reuters) - Google on Tuesday showed how its virtual assistant can now call restaurants and salons to book appointments, navigating complex conversations, as the Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) unit acknowledged that a technological onslaught was leaving users frazzled and needing a cure.
The demonstrations at Google I/O, an annual event for creators of Google-compatible products, showed how big technology companies are positioning themselves for a lucrative artificial intelligence revolution while grappling with heightened scrutiny about their societal influence.
Chief Executive Sundar Pichai and other officials said Google should find ways to reduce stress from technology and improve customers' ""digital well-being.""
""We can't just be wide-eyed about the innovations technology creates,"" he added.
Google showed how its email program can suggest sentences and how Google Assistant can call a salon or restaurant to make an appointment or reservation.
A new tool in its Android software, which runs most of the world's mobile phones, will notify users how much they are using apps and let them set limits for themselves and family members. 
Google,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and other technology leaders are vying to keep users in their apps to maintain booming businesses of selling ads, goods or online computing services.
Amazon's Echo has taken the lead on ""smart speakers"" using voice assistants. 
Offloading tasks to virtual assistants to manage photos, emails and schedules is part of the companies' remedy for decreasing screen time.
Shares of Alphabet closed at $1,058.59, down almost 0.1 percent.
Google and its rivals have faced unprecedented criticism from former employees and U.S. lawmakers over the last year.
Critics have urged the companies to halt the spread of misinformation and extremist propaganda, improve data privacy protections and play a greater role in combating app addiction. How artificial intelligence may replace human work or be infected with human prejudices is a growing concern.
Still, Google is infusing more services with artificial intelligence, which has become more powerful in recent years because of software breakthroughs and decreasing hardware costs. 
Google Maps will make more dining suggestions by learning user habits and be able to pinpoint users' locations by using smartphone cameras to analyze their surroundings, the company added.

 LG Electronics Inc  (KS:066570), Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd  and other smartphone makers will begin integrating artificial intelligence into devices so that users can pull up reviews for a piece of clothing by holding their cameras up to it.

569,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Seventeen deaths reported in Congo as Ebola outbreak confirmed,"By Benoit Nyemba and Fiston Mahamba
KINSHASA (Reuters) - At least 17 people have died in an area of northwestern Democratic Republic of Congo where health officials have now confirmed an outbreak of Ebola, the health ministry said on Tuesday. 
It is the ninth time Ebola has been recorded in the central African nation, whose eastern Ebola river gave the deadly virus its name when it was discovered there in the 1970s, and comes less than a year after its last outbreak which killed eight people.
""Our country is facing another epidemic of the Ebola virus, which constitutes an international public health emergency,"" the ministry said in a statement.
""We still dispose of the well trained human resources that were able to rapidly control previous epidemics,"" it said. 
Ebola is believed to be spread over long distances by bats, which can host the virus without dying, as it infects other animals it shares trees with such as monkeys. It often spreads to humans via infected bushmeat.
Before the outbreak was confirmed, local health officials reported 21 patients showing signs of hemorrhagic fever around the village of Ikoko Impenge, near the town of Bikoro. Seventeen of those later died.
Medical teams supported by the World Health Organization and medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres were dispatched to the zone on Saturday and took five samples from suspected active cases. 
Two of those samples tested positive for the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus, the ministry said.
""Since notification of the cases on May 3, no deaths have been reported either among the hospitalised cases or the healthcare personnel,"" the statement said. 
After Congo's last Ebola flare-up, authorities there approved the use of a new experimental vaccine but in the end did not deploy it owing to logistical challenges and the relatively minor nature of the outbreak. 
The worst Ebola epidemic in history ended in West Africa just two years ago after killing more than 11,300 people and infected some 28,600 as it rolled through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. 
Despite regular outbreaks every few years, death tolls in Congo have been significantly lower.
""Our top priority is to get to Bikoro to work alongside the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and partners to reduce the loss of life and suffering related to this new Ebola virus disease outbreak,"" said Dr Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director-General, Emergency Preparedness and Response.
""Working with partners and responding early and in a coordinated way will be vital to containing this deadly disease.""
Health experts credit an awareness of the disease among the population and local medical staff's experience treating for past successes containing its spread. 
Congo's vast, remote geography also gives it an advantage, as outbreaks are often localized and relatively easy to isolate.
Ikoko Impenge and Bikoro, however, lie not far from the banks of the Congo River, an essential waterway for transport and commerce. 
Further downstream the river flows past Democratic Republic of Congo's capital Kinshasa and Brazzaville, capital of neighboring Congo Republic - two cities with a combined population of over 12 million people.

572,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",U.S. urges judge to force AT&T to scrap deal or sell DirecTV or Turner,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In its final push, the U.S. Justice Department has urged a federal judge to stop AT&T Inc (N:T), which owns biggest pay TV provider DirecTV, from buying movie and TV show maker  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX), or at least cut a big chunk out of the proposed $85 billion transaction.
U.S. District Judge Richard Leon is expected to rule on the deal on June 12.
In filings sent to the court last week and unsealed on Tuesday, the Justice Department reiterated that if AT&T owned Time Warner it would have the incentive and opportunity to withhold CNN, HBO and live sports from pay TV companies like  Charter Communications  (O:CHTR). 
The government also said it would have the incentive to refuse to license its networks to cheaper online TV distributors, like Hulu since these cheaper services bite into pay TV revenues.
The government estimated the increased cost to industry rivals at $580 million a year and asked in its post-trial brief that the deal be deemed illegal and stopped.
The government said Leon could order AT&T to sell an asset - either DirecTV, with more than 20 million subscribers, or Time Warner's Turner channels.
""The evidence demonstrated that the bulk (though not all) of the anticompetitive effects flow from the combination of Turner with DirecTV,"" the Justice Department said.
AT&T said in its final brief, which was available last week, that the judge should reject any request by the government to force it to sell DirecTV or Turner, claiming it would ""destroy the very consumer value this merger was designed to unlock.""
AT&T and Time Warner also said the deal would help them compete with internet titans like Facebook (O:FB) and Netflix (O:NFLX). ""The government did not even begin to make a credible case that the merger would likely harm competition, substantially or even just a little,"" AT&T said. ""This is not a close case.""
AT&T argued that Time Warner's licensing fees from pay TV and online distributors were too valuable for the company to forego.
AT&T also sought to assuage critics by offering to submit any disagreement with distributors over pricing for Time Warner's networks to third-party arbitration and to promise not to black out programming during arbitration for seven years.
The government dismissed the offer as ""half-baked"" since it covers only the Turner channels, not HBO. 
Leon asked few questions during the trial, but asked witnesses several times if they felt the arbitration proposal was adequate.
The deal, announced in October 2016, was quickly denounced by Donald Trump, who as a candidate and later as president has been critical of Time Warner's CNN.

Before the trial started, AT&T lawyers said the Time Warner deal may have been singled out for government enforcement but Leon rejected their bid to force the disclosure of White House communications that might have shed light on the matter.

Agrokor, the biggest employer in the Balkans, was put under state-run administration after an ambitious expansion drive left it weighed down by debt.
The court's president, Miroslav Separovic, said the adoption of the law was necessary as an emergency measure aimed at shielding the economy from failures of big businesses, such as Agrokor, Croatia's largest private company.
A number of individuals and companies, including Agrokor founder Ivica Todoric, had asked the court to examine the legality of the law commonly known as Lex Agrokor.
The fallout from the Agrokor crisis extends beyond Croatia's borders. Its single biggest creditor is Russia's Sberbank, which has a claim of more than 1 billion euros ($1.18 billion). Overall debt claims against Agrokor amount to 58 billion kuna ($9.3 billion).

Last month Agrokor said its creditors had reached agreement on a settlement deal including a debt-for-equity swap, a certain level of write-offs and sustainable debt levels.

London-listed IAG last month took a 4.6 percent stake in the airline, which in turn triggered interest from other suitors, according to earlier statements from Norwegian's board.
""Acquisition interest from several parties confirms the sustainability of the business model,"" Chief Executive Bjoern Kjos told the company's annual shareholder meeting.
Loss-making Norwegian is in the midst of a massive transatlantic expansion aimed at turning around the company's fortunes by replicating the low-cost model that worked for European flights.
Analysts on average expect the airline's revenue to grow by an 84 percent between 2017 and 2020 to 56.9 billion Norwegian crowns ($7 billion), according to I/B/E/S forecasts on Thomson Reuters Eikon.
While the company is expected to post a net loss of 650 million crowns in the current year, the analysts forecast a profit of 723 million crowns in 2019 and 1.2 billion crowns the following year.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Lucy DeStefano, former head of trading at hedge fund Citadel's Aptigon unit, is set to join Soros Fund Management later this year, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Soros Fund Management is the $26 billion family office of billionaire philanthropist George Soros, and the firm's investments as well as its staffing decisions are closely watched in the $3.2 trillion hedge fund industry.
At Soros, DeStefano will report to head of trading Jessica Murphy and join the firm's trading team to focus on systematic trading strategy for macro investments. Dawn Fitzpatrick has been leading investments at Soros as chief investment officer for roughly one year, cementing her status as one of Wall Street's most powerful women.
A spokesman for Soros declined to comment.
Citadel, which invests roughly $28 billion, cut staff at its Apitgon business, one of its stock picking units, by more than 30 percent from late February to early March.
The cuts included portfolio managers, analysts, associates and other ancillary staff.
DeStefano, who did not respond to requests for comment, resigned from Citadel's Aptigon unit in April, a Citadel spokesman confirmed. She will join Soros in the fourth quarter of 2018, one of the people familiar with her plans said.
DeStefano graduated from Princeton University and previously worked at hedge fund Pine River Capital Management.

In a note announcing his decision to join the buy-side on Tuesday, Bove said he will take on the role of chief strategist at Hilton Capital Management, a division of research and investment firm Rafferty Holdings. 
Since joining the securities industry at the end of 1965, Bove worked his way up from being a salesperson to heading research at various Wall Street firms.
Bove was one of the earliest to warn that the problematic mortgage-backed securities - which were at the heart of the 2008 financial crisis that led to the collapse of some well-known names on Wall Street - were ticking time bombs.
His move comes at a time when investment banks are slashing their equity research business, thanks to new rules by European regulators that require brokerages to charge separately for research products and services.
A frequent guest on business channels, Bove has covered banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and is known for being bullish on banks.
Bove said he believed the outlook for the banking industry was better than it had been in decades. 
He has also courted his fair share of controversies.
He was sued by BankAtlantic Bancorp in July 2008. The lawsuit accused the analyst of defaming the company by mentioning its name in a research note titled ""Who is Next,"" two days after federal regulators seized IndyMac Bancorp Inc a large mortgage lending specialist.

598,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2018 08:01PM ET</span>",Jay-Z ordered to testify next week in U.S. SEC investigation,"By Brendan Pierson and Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in New York on Tuesday ordered Jay-Z to testify on May 15 in an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission involving the sale of the rapper's Rocawear clothing brand to Iconix Brand Group Inc.
At a hearing in Manhattan, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe said Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, had failed to respond to SEC subpoenas served on him November and February, despite the regulatory agency's repeated efforts to schedule a time for him to testify. 
""The testimony has been delayed for five months, and I do not intend to tolerate any further delay,"" Gardephe said.
Jay-Z was represented at the hearing by his lawyer, Alex Spiro, and did not appear himself. Spiro and lawyers for the SEC did not say where the testimony would take place.
The SEC filed a petition last week to enforce its subpoenas against Jay-Z.
Jay-Z sold Rocawear to Iconix in 2007 for about $204 million. The SEC has said it is looking into writedowns totaling this sum, $169 million in 2015 and $34.6 million in 2017, that Iconix took in connection with Rocawear. 
The agency has said it wants to ask Jay-Z about his personal involvement with Rocawear and about transactions between his companies and Iconix.
Jay-Z said in a court filing on Monday that forcing him to testify at length would interfere with his preparations for an upcoming world tour, and that his testimony would not be relevant.
Gardephe disagreed, saying at Tuesday's hearing that the agency had a ""legitimate purpose"" in seeking to interview Jay-Z.
In Monday's filing, Jay-Z asked the judge to limit his testimony to a single day. The SEC said it opposed any time limit.
Gardephe said Tuesday he would not impose a time limit, saying that could be an incentive ""run out the clock."" However, he said he expected the testimony could be finished in a day, and that the SEC must ask him for permission to go beyond that.
Spiro said after the hearing that he was ""pleased"" with the outcome.
Jay-Z, 48, is famous for songs including ""Hard Knock Life,"" ""99 Problems"" and ""Big Pimpin.'""
The Brooklyn native has won 21 Grammy Awards, most recently in 2015 for Best R&B song and Best R&B performance for “Drunk in Love” with his wife, pop star Beyonce.

His most recent album, ""4:44,"" was nominated for eight Grammys but did not win any.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Emirates is facing a cabin crew shortage and is struggling to fully staff some flights following a spate of resignations and other workforce constraints, several employees told Reuters.
The cabin crew staffing issue follows on from a pilot shortage which Emirates said in April meant it would have to cut back on the frequency of some routes this summer.
Four employees said a series of resignations among cabin crew and a spike in the number of crew calling in sick had put pressure on the Dubai-based airline.
Emirates did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Major airlines are having to adapt to a more competitive marketplace and the impact this has on staffing. Ryanair (I:RYA), Europe’s biggest budget airline, was forced last year to recognize unions to avoid a Christmas strike after a shortage of standby pilots forced it to cancel flights.
Emirates, which employs about 25,000 cabin crew staff from around the world, has seen growth affected over the last few years by lower oil prices, a major driver of wealth in the Gulf region, and volatile demand.
The employees said there was no suggestion that the airline was operating flights with fewer cabin crew or pilots than required by regulations or that employees were exceeding working hours set by regulators.
The airline is holding recruitment open days for new crew in at least 12 countries this month, including the United States, United Kingdom and France, according to one of its websites.
According to an internal Emirates email dated April 8, seen by Reuters, a ""significant increase in on-the-day sicknesses reports"" due to a change in the way sick leave is reported was impacting ""crew rostering and operations"". 
Seven Emirates employees said the airline was operating flights with fewer cabin crew than usual and increasingly reassigning flight attendants to other routes at the last minute to enable them to operate.
Emirates' fleet of Airbus A380 and Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777-300 jets requires more cabin crew per flight than smaller aircraft and to meet the requirements of long-haul routes.
Some employees said the carrier has tried to mitigate staff shortages by asking pilots and cabin crew to work longer hours each month.
The airline is assigning two fewer cabin crew on some flights from May to ""ensure consistency across our aircraft configuration"", according to another internal email dated April 12 and seen by Reuters.
In a bid to improve working conditions and benefits following complaints from cabin crew in February, Emirates has started providing them with full medical coverage and is reviewing calls for pay increases, according to employees.

Emirates is scheduled to report its annual results on Wednesday.

601,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Walmart's grocery delivery partnerships with Uber, Lyft fail to take off","By Nandita Bose and Heather Somerville
(Reuters) - Walmart Inc's (N:WMT) online grocery delivery partnerships with ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft have ended, according to two sources, a potential setback for the retailer's ambitions to challenge Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) head-on with speedy delivery of groceries to people's homes.
The end of the Walmart partnerships, which has not been previously reported and was confirmed by Walmart and Uber, undercuts a vision the ride-hailing companies laid out: a service that can efficiently deliver anything on-demand, including people and cargo, at the touch of a smartphone app. 
""It is incredibly hard to deliver people and packages together,"" said a source with a delivery company that works with Walmart and has direct knowledge of the matter. ""They are two completely different business models.""
The decision marks an abrupt end to a business relationship that Walmart and Uber announced with much fanfare less than two years ago. At Walmart's shareholders meeting in June 2016, CEO Doug McMillon touted the company's investments in technology and spoke about the partnerships in front of a cheering crowd of 14,000 employees. https://goo.gl/xJdN2e
Soon after, Uber's grocery delivery service was launched and expanded to four markets. As recently as March, just before Uber ended the arrangement, Walmart said Uber would be a partner in its plans to deliver groceries to more than 40 percent of the country.
""There was clearly some lack of communication there,"" said one of the sources with knowledge of the partnerships ending.
Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman confirmed the end of the tie-ups when asked by Reuters, but did not detail the reasons behind the decision. She said Walmart will use other delivery service providers in the four markets where it had previously used Uber. 
""Customers shouldn't notice any difference as the transition takes place,"" said Blakeman, who added that the partnership with Lyft never expanded beyond the initial test market of Denver.
Blakeman said the end of the partnerships will not impact Walmart's plans to scale grocery delivery as they are not tied to any single provider. 
Uber put a stop to the grocery partnership when it informed Walmart in March that it would cease delivery operations on June 30, Uber spokeswoman Ellen Cohn told Reuters. The retailer was Uber's largest partner for its 'Rush' service, which delivered groceries as well as clothes, flowers and other goods. 
Uber will shutter the entire Rush program at the end of next month.
""We are coordinating with Walmart to make this change as seamless as possible,"" Cohn said. 
Lyft declined comment and deferred to Walmart on the issue.
For Walmart, which is the country's largest grocer and gets 56 percent revenue from groceries, the partnerships offered a fast solution to expand its online grocery offerings and improve overall revenue from internet shoppers. 
For example, Walmart delivers groceries in China through a partnership with ecommerce company JD.com Inc (O:JD), and in Japan through an alliance with Rakuten. 
But the retailer was recently punished for its fourth-quarter online sales performance, which investors say is key to the company's future.
LAST-MILE COMPETITION
Last-mile delivery of packages is an intensely competitive business, with companies ranging from Amazon to  United Parcel  Services Inc (N:UPS), FedEx Corp (N:FDX) and the U.S. Postal service, as well as startups like Instacart and Deliv, vying for a share.
Since the dot-com boom, companies have tried to crack the business model for online grocery delivery. The rush to solve the technological and logistical challenges has gotten even more frenzied since Amazon acquired high-end grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.7 billion last year, a deal that has intensified competition in the sector.
Former Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick touted the idea of carrying a person in the backseat and a bag of groceries in the trunk as the ultimate cash-generating transportation service in a smart-phone era.
The delivery service marked the first time Uber publicly committed to a business outside of ride-hailing that was supposed to be meaningful to its bottom line and support its stratospheric valuation, although the private company never offered exact dollar projections. 
But startup investors and experts in on-demand delivery say there is a much different set of logistical and economic challenges for moving around cargo than people, requiring a single company to be proficient in two distinct business models.
Uber's Cohn said Rush was ""an experiment"" and the company has turned its focus and resources to UberEats, a restaurant delivery service that in the fourth quarter last year generated $1.1 billion, or about 10 percent of Uber's overall revenue.
NEW PARTNERS
Walmart has added startups Deliv, Postmates and DoorDash to its list of delivery partners. These companies have the singular business of delivering goods, not people, and drivers have more experience safely transporting perishables.
It remains unclear if these startups will step in and replace Uber in the various markets they served. 
    A particular challenge for companies such as Postmates, however, will be offering rush delivery in suburban and rural areas, where most Walmart stores are located. Such startups have been most successful in urban centers, where there is a high density of customers and couriers can use bicycles or walk to deliver multiple packages in one trip.

""Density has been a challenge historically for all types of delivery companies, all the way back to the Pony Express,"" said Ben Narasin, a partner at venture capitalist firm NEA who has been critical of the on-demand delivery business model. ""The reality is that the far-away drives will likely be subsidized.""

602,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2018 10:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Hudson's Bay seeks to revive Lord & Taylor's fortunes,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Nichola Saminather
(Reuters) - Hudson's Bay Co (TO:HBC) is working with investment bankers and consultants to identify deals and new measures to turn around its Lord & Taylor department store chain, once the cornerstone of its retail empire, people familiar with the matter said.
The move shows how the chain's fortunes have diverged from Hudson's Bay's luxury Saks Fifth Avenue banner, which has managed to better weather the rise of online shopping sites including Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and the resulting decline of brick-and-mortar stores. It comes as the company decided to sell its eponymous Hudson's Bay department store in downtown Vancouver, Reuters reported exclusively on Monday. 
The Canadian retailer has been working with investment bank PJ Solomon Co for advice on potential deals regarding its department store portfolio, and is also working with consulting firm AlixPartners LLP on cutting costs and reforming its business, the sources said. 
Much of their focus has been on Lord & Taylor, which accounts for about one tenth of Hudson's Bay's stores, the sources added.
Hudson's Bay is also open to divesting Lord & Taylor, but considers this outcome unlikely given the scarcity of potential buyers that would pay top dollar for it amid the retail sector's malaise, according to the sources, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential deliberations. AlixPartners and PJ Solomon declined to comment.
Hudson's Bay shares climbed as much as 4.6 percent on the news to their highest in almost eight weeks on Tuesday, and were trading up 2.9 percent at C$9.47 at 9:54 a.m. ET (1354 GMT). 
""Lord & Taylor is a storied brand and we will continue to evolve it for the future,"" a Hudson's Bay spokeswoman said in an emailed statement, declining to comment on moves the company was considering with investment bankers and consultants. 
""As we shared on our last earnings call, recent performance at Lord & Taylor has not met expectations. However, we see a lot of opportunity to grow the business.""
Hudson's Bay Executive Chairman Richard Baker has publicly expressed disappointment with the chain's performance. His investment firm NRDC Equity Partners acquired Lord & Taylor for $1.2 billion in 2006, when department stores were still thriving, and used it as a launch pad to build a holding company with several retail chains.
Long focused on upper middle class markets in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest, Lord & Taylor's 50 department stores are now increasingly struggling to distinguish themselves from competitors such as Macy's Inc (N:M) and off-price retailers including TJX Companies Inc (N:TJX).
Unless Hudson's Bay, which has lost two-thirds of its market value in the last three years, can reposition Lord & Taylor, the chain risks weighing further on the company's stock performance, industry insiders said.

""'What do we offer consumers that's differentiated?' If they can't answer that question, they need to come up with a reason for consumers to care,"" said Greg Portell, lead partner in the retail practice of A.T. Kearney, a management consulting firm. 
Lord & Taylor's president Liz Rodbell left Hudson's Bay at the end of April, leaving the retailer with another challenge to face. The company expects to name a replacement in the coming weeks, a Hudson's Bay spokeswoman said.
ABORTED DEALS
Hudson's Bay has mulled a range of options for Lord & Taylor. In March, it considered acquiring Bon-Ton Stores Inc, a bankrupt retailer operating 250 department stores in 23 U.S. states, to merge it with Lord & Taylor, the sources said.
Such a deal would have complemented the two chains' customer base and improved their buying power, the sources added. However, Hudson's Bay subsequently abandoned its pursuit of Bon-Ton to focus on other opportunities and continue its revamp, according to the sources. A U.S. bankruptcy judge approved Bon-Ton's wind-down last month.
Hudson's Bay held talks earlier this year about merging with private equity-owned department store operator Neiman Marcus Group Ltd, a deal it also pursued unsuccessfully last year, the sources said.
The talks once again ended without an agreement, in part because Neiman Marcus' $5 billion debt load was too big for Hudson's Bay, the sources added.
SALES DROPPING
Lord & Taylor's 10 percent contribution to total retail sales at Hudson's Bay has declined significantly over previous years as the company has grown through acquisitions, analysts estimate. The Lord & Taylor division, which includes the Hudson's Bay department stores and Home Outfitters in Canada, reported comparable sales falling 2.6 percent year-on-year in the three months that ended in February. 
Comparable sales at Saks Fifth Avenue, whose 41 stores analysts estimate make up a third of sales at the company, rose 2.1 percent over the same period.
Lord & Taylor has announced it plans to launch a dedicated internet store on budget retailer Walmart Inc's (N:WMT) website this month, a move that may help its presence online but could take further sheen off its name, according to the sources.
Hudson's Bay has also shown willingness to trim some Lord & Taylor locations. The chain's flagship property in New York City was sold to WeWork Cos last year for $850 million. As a result, that store will shrink to a quarter of its current size.  
The company also said in October it was exploring a sale of its Hudson's Bay store in downtown Vancouver, together with its joint venture partner RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust (TO:REI_u). Reuters reported on Monday it had found a buyer for that store for C$675 million ($524.4 million).
Some Hudson's Bay shareholders want more. The company should sell one of its weak banners, rather than add another to its stable, which include Galeria Kaufhof in Germany and Galeria Inno in Belgium, said Joshua Varghese, portfolio manager at CI Investments Inc, which is Hudson's Bay's sixth-largest shareholder.

""Hudson's Bay should focus on having fewer stores,"" Varghese said. ""If that means selling certain brands, then so be it. Lord & Taylor does make sense.""

""I am deeply grateful for Drew and his many contributions to the growth of Snap,” Evan Spiegel, Snap's CEO,  said in a regulatory filing announcing the leadership shakeup.“He has done an amazing job as Snap’s first CFO, building a strong team and helping to guide us through our transition to becoming a public company. The discipline that he has brought to our business will serve us well into the future. We wish Drew continued success and all the best.”
Stone, who has worked at Amazon since 1998, will start on May 16 with an annual salary of $500,000 plus a $20 million bonus of restricted stock and 500,000 options to purchase more shares. His predecessor Vollero was making $300,000 per year with a $200,000 bonus,  according to regulatory filings.
Vollero's departure comes after a turbulent year for Snap since going public in March 2017. It has faced sustained pressure from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and after it announced it failed to meet analysts' expectations for Q1 2018, its stock cratered as much as 17%.
The stock is now down 55% since its IPO.

At 9:31AM ET (13:31GMT), the Dow Jones slipped 19 points, or 0.08%, the S&P 500 dropped 5 points, or 0.17%, while the Nasdaq Composite traded down 8 points, or 0.11%.
Trump is widely expected to pull out of the 2015 international nuclear deal and reinstate sanctions against Tehran which in turn could impact Iranian oil exports.
Iran, which is a major Middle East oil producer and member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), resumed its role as a major oil exporter in January 2016 when international sanctions against Tehran were lifted in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear program.
Trump will make the announcement from Washington at 2:00PM ET (18:00GMT) on Tuesday.
Oil prices pulled back from three-and-a-half year highs reached a day earlier in what was largely attributed to be a “buy the rumor, sell the news” market move as the announcement comes several days ahead of the original May 12 deadline.
U.S. crude futures slumped 0.68% to $70.25 by 9:32AM ET (13:32GMT), while Brent oil traded down 0.33% to $75.92.
Meanwhile, in a relatively light day for economic data with just the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey (JOLTs) to be released at 10:00AM ET (14:00GMT), the dollar continued to show strength against major rivals, hitting fresh four-month highs.
At 9:34AM ET (13:34GMT) Tuesday, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.48% to 93.05.
Earlier on Tuesday, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell downplayed risks to financial markets from policymakers’ plans to gradually raise interest rates.
Powell promised to “communicate our policy strategy as clearly and transparently as possible to help align expectations and avoid market disruptions”.
“Fed policy normalization has proceeded without disruption to financial markets, and market participants' expectations for policy seem reasonably well aligned with policymakers' expectations...suggesting that markets should not be surprised by our actions if the economy evolves in line with expectations,” he said.
In the meantime, traders priced in the recent slew of earnings reports. Among the biggest moves, Hertz (NYSE:HTZ) crashed 10% as the rental car company posted a $1.58 loss per share, wider than the expected $0.98 loss.
Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) was also off around 5% as the real estate website operator suffered from a disappointing revenue forecast.
To the upside, Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX) jumped around 9% as the firm beat sales estimates and raised its full-year outlook.
Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) also gained nearly 7% after smashed forecasts on both the top and bottom line.
In other company news, shares in Snap (NYSE:SNAP) gained around 4% as it announced that its chief financial officer Andrew Vollero was to be replaced by former Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) exec Tim Stone.
Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) was reportedly making preparations for a possible all-cash bid for 21st Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX)'s entertainment assets. Fox had an agreement to sell those assets to  Disney  for $52.4 billion in stock.

PARIS (Reuters) - Air France's (PA:AIRF) French unions called on management on Tuesday to resume talks over a pay dispute four days after the chief executive's surprise resignation sent the strike-hit carrier deeper into turmoil.
Pilots, cabin crew and ground staff in France were on strike for a 15th day since February on Tuesday and Air France said one in five flights would be canceled.
It estimates the industrial action has so far cost it 300 million euros ($356 million).
Unions said on Monday they would not renew their strike notice, meaning no further strikes are planned for now.
""Air France management must now hear the demands of a majority of employees. The inter-union groups is asking management to return to the negotiation table in the coming days,"" a group of 10 French unions said in a joint statement after a meeting on Tuesday.
""The fight is not over and the ball is now in the management's court!""
Dutch union representatives said on Tuesday that Dutch carrier KLM would have to stick with its partnership with Air France even though the French airline is under increasing pressure from strikes.
Shares in parent Air France-KLM closed nearly 10 percent lower on Monday after striking airline staff rejected a wage deal offered by managers and CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac said on Friday he would step down on May 15. 
They jumped at the open on Tuesday but shed most of their gains later.
French Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne said on Tuesday that the conflict was ""costing a lot of money"".
""I am concerned for the future of Air France and I think that all those who are attached to this beautiful company can be,"" she told franceinfo radio.
""Everyone should be aware that Air France is playing in a global, European competition where its competitors are more competitive,"" she said. 
Asked about a risk for the alliance with KLM, the minister said ""KLM partners are very concerned about this situation.""
Janaillac accused the pilots' unions, in a letter published in La Tribune newspaper, of deliberately creating a deadlock and urged them to resume talks after a ""destructive conflict"". https://www.latribune.fr/entreprises-finance/services/transport-logistique/air-france-le-pdg-vide-son-sac-avant-de-partir-et-fustige-le-snpl-777826.html
Air France had offered workers a pay rise of 2 percent in 2018 and a further 5 percent over the following three years, but French unions, which have demanded 5.1 percent this year, have complained management is not serious about talks.
After negotiations reached deadlock, Janaillac called a vote last Friday, the results of which went against him.
Janaillac had been CEO for less than two years, running into the same union resistance to reform as his predecessor. His exit raises questions over Air France's ability to cut costs to compete with Gulf carriers and low-cost airlines.
The French government, the national carrier's largest shareholder with a 14 percent stake, has said it will not ride to the rescue.

609,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China ramps up checks on U.S. pork imports in potentially costly slowdown,"By Dominique Patton
BEIJING (Reuters) - China has ramped up inspections of pork shipped from the United States, importers and industry sources said, the latest American product to be hit by a potentially costly slowdown at Chinese ports in the past couple of weeks.
Some trade experts said they believe Beijing is sending a defiant warning to Washington in response to sweeping U.S. trade demands made on China last week.
The stepped-up checks have even hit China's WH Group Ltd (HK:0288), the world's largest pork company and owner of Smithfield Foods in the U.S., and come amid increasing scrutiny of other U.S. farm goods, including fruit and logs. 
Ports are opening and inspecting every cargo that arrives, said Luis Chein, a director at WH Group, China's top importer of U.S. pork.
That compares with inspections carried out only ""randomly"" in the past, he told Reuters, significantly lengthening the time product stays at the port.
China's General Administration of Customs, which oversees food imports, did not respond to a fax seeking comment.
Increased checks on U.S. products are ""not terribly surprising,"" said Even Rogers Pay, an agriculture analyst at China Policy, a Beijing-based consultancy.
""In a situation where trade tensions are high, China will enforce every possible regulation on its books. It makes strategic sense to do so at this point,"" she said.
Late on Monday, China's customs agency announced it was stepping up quarantine checks on apples and logs from the United States after detecting pests in imports of the products at Chinese ports.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese goods, largely because of U.S. allegations that Beijing misappropriates U.S. technology through joint-venture requirements, unfair licensing practices, outright theft and state-backed acquisitions of U.S. technology firms.
Beijing denies those accusations.
China's top economic official, Liu He, will visit Washington next week to resume trade talks, the White House said on Monday, after a U.S. delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin came away from a visit to Beijing last week with no agreement over a long list of U.S. trade demands.
FROM DAYS TO WEEKS
U.S. pork is now sitting at Chinese ports for up to two weeks, instead of a few days, industry sources told Reuters.
Most of the imported pork is frozen and not at risk of perishing. But the move comes on top of the additional 25 percent duties Beijing slapped on American pork and a slew of other goods last month, in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.
The United States is one of China's top overseas pork suppliers, shipping $489 million worth of the meat last year.
A person working at a Shanghai-based meat trading firm said customs officials were also taking samples from about 20 percent of U.S. pork shipments since last month, up from about 5 percent previously. 
He declined to be named because of the sensitive nature of the topic.
There had been no change for imports from other destinations the company buys from, including Canada and Europe, he added. Two German pork exporters said they were not aware of any changes to inspections.
Stepped up inspections and sampling were also cited in an April 30 report by the United States Department of Agriculture attache in Beijing, which said the new measures had started on April 23 but gave no further details.
The tariffs have already cut off demand for muscle cuts, or higher value pork meat, and pressured the price of so-called ""variety"" meat, such as offal and feet, the biggest portion of U.S. pork exports by volume.
In addition, China's domestic hog prices have plunged in the first quarter, and are still hovering around eight-year lows of about 10 yuan ($1.57) per kg. That has led WH Group to sharply reduce its imports anyway this year, added Chein.
China's total pork imports declined 10 percent to 595,611 tonnes in the first three months of the year, according to Chinese customs.

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - British hedge fund Caius Capital has asked the European Banking Authority (EBA) to open an investigation into the regulatory treatment of a complex financial instrument as UniCredit's (MI:CRDI) core capital.
In a May 3 letter seen by Reuters, Caius asked the EBA to examine a 2.98 billion euro ($3.46 billion) convertible bond issued in 2008, which it said had been misclassified as Common Equity Tier (CET) 1, or the best-quality capital held by a bank and a key measure of its financial strength.
Reclassification would reduce UniCredit's CET 1 ratio by about 50 basis points, a source familiar with the fund's thinking told Reuters.
According to Caius, UniCredit - Italy's top bank by assets - should convert the transaction into shares, the source said.
This would increase its CET1 ratio, the source said, but would cause big losses for holders of the instruments, known as convertible and subordinated hybrid equity-linked securities or CASHES. This is because the underlying shares have since lost 94 percent of their value.
The Financial Times, which first reported Caius's letter, said the fund was likely to profit from such a conversion as it had taken a position betting against the CASHES. A spokesman for Caius declined to comment.
In the letter, Caius blamed the Bank of Italy and the European Central Bank for allowing what it said was the ""incorrect regulatory capital treatment derived by UniCredit"" from the instruments.
UniCredit said on Tuesday the regulatory treatment of the CASHES had been fully disclosed to the market and confirmed and reviewed by regulators. EBA confirmed it had received the letter from Caius and said it would respond in due course. The Bank of Italy was not immediately able to comment. The ECB did not comment.
Caius said UniCredit incorrectly booked 2.374 billion euros of the CASHES proceeds as CET 1 capital.
""We believe the proceeds derived from the CASHES are ineligible as CET 1 instruments and their existence also makes the ordinary shares of UniCredit ineligible as CET1 instruments,"" it said.
UniCredit's CET1 would fall by about two-thirds, to less than 5 percent, if the underlying ordinary shares did not qualify as core capital, the source familiar with Caius's thinking said.
Caius said the current treatment of the CASHES ""undermines the European level playing field, and risks weakening the perceived quality of CET1 across the EU.""
UniCredit said it had a ""very strong"" CET1 ratio of 13.6 percent at the end of 2017, adding the CASHES shares' current contribution to the overall capital position of the bank had no material impact on its regulatory ratios.
In 2011, UniCredit restructured the Cashes to make them eligible for core capital. It said then the move would allow it to keep about 2.4 billion euros, or about 50 basis points, as CET 1 capital as of Sept. 30, 2011 on a pro forma basis.
At 1149 GMT UniCredit shares were down 3.1 percent, with the Italian banking index falling 2.9 percent due to worries about fresh political turmoil. Caius Capital was launched in October, 2016 by former Och-Ziff portfolio manager Antonio Batista and William Douglas, former head of EMEA prime brokerage advisory at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

612,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 08, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>",Takeda Moves to Join Pharma Giants With $62 Billion Shire Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. (T:4502). is joining the drug industry’s giants with Japan’s largest-ever overseas takeover -- a $62 billion deal for much larger rival  Shire  Plc (LON:SHP).
Chief Executive Officer Christophe Weber capped a drawn-out pursuit of the U.K.-listed company with an acquisition he described as transformational that will give Takeda wider reach into the world’s biggest drug market and strengthen its global pipeline for lucrative drugs that treat rare diseases.
“The two combined create a rich pipeline in all stages -- early and late stage, which is very important,"" Weber said on a call after the deal was announced Tuesday. “We are in a good momentum and in a strong position.”
Takeda’s largest acquisition would catapult the company into the top 10 within the global pharmaceutical industry. Weber, a Frenchman who is the first foreigner to lead the 237-year-old Japanese firm, is seeking growth in new markets amid patent expirations and drug pricing pressures at home.
After fielding multiple bids for Shire, it was the fifth proposal -- a preliminary agreement the two companies reached last month -- that finally stuck. The Japanese company will acquire Shire for 46 billion pounds, or 49.01 pounds a share in cash and stock, according to a statement.
To help fund the cash portion of the deal, Takeda said it has secured a bridge loan facility of $31 billion with JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and MUFG Bank Ltd., among others. Shire shares rose as much as 5.7 percent early Tuesday in London, while Takeda rose 4 percent in Tokyo before the deal was announced.
The bridge loan will be refinanced with a combination of long-term and hybrid debt, as well as cash, Weber said. The company could also consider issuing shares, he added.
With few late-stage experimental drugs in its own pipeline, Takeda needs lucrative new therapies. A Shire takeover brings Takeda treatments for rare diseases such as hemophilia -- a field that’s luring a growing number of drugmakers that can charge more for unique life-saving drugs than for routine treatment.
The deal increases Takeda’s exposure to the U.S., the world’s biggest pharmaceutical market. Shire, based in Lexington, Massachusetts, gets more than two-thirds of its revenue from North America. Takeda generates only 30 percent of its sales from the region.
Takeda had raised its bids over a six-week chase and agreed on a 60 percent premium to Shire’s closing price on March 27, before Takeda disclosed its interest. The agreement offers $30.33 in cash and either 0.839 new Takeda shares or 1.678 Takeda American depositary receipts.
The companies indicated in late April they had reached a preliminary deal valued at $64 billion, based on a stronger exchange rate for the pound at the time.
Takeda’s financial advisers included Evercore Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and Nomura Holdings Inc., while Shire received financial advice from  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
While the deal would boost Takeda’s earnings potential, it also comes with risks. Japanese investors have worried about the hefty debt. S&P Global Ratings placed Takeda on a watch and warned it may lower the company’s ratings by up to two notches, it said in a statement Tuesday.
Moody’s Investors Service warning last month that Takeda could face a multiple-step credit downgrade due to a “spike in leverage.”
READ: Takeda’s ‘Scary’ Debt for Shire Deal Fuels Credit Market Concern
Takeda said the deal will save about $600 million in duplicated research and development costs. The company expects $1.4 billion in overall savings by the third year.
“The cost synergies seem to be much bigger than expected in the next three years,”  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Fumiyoshi Sakai said.
Bigger Rival
Takeda, which has seen its market value slide to $34 billion since announcing its interest, is taking over a much bigger rival. Shire’s shares have soared 31 percent, giving the company a market capitalization of about $50 billion.
A completed deal would dwarf SoftBank Group Corp.’s $40 billion purchase of Sprint in 2013, which ranked as the biggest takeover by a Japanese company. Takeda’s largest previous purchase was a $13.7 billion takeover of Nycomed A/S in 2011. Last year, the company expanded its footprint in the U.S. oncology market with the $4.7 billion purchase of Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Takeda said it will maintain its headquarters in Japan and will evaluate consolidating Shire’s operations into Takeda’s in the Boston area, Switzerland and Singapore.
The company expects it may reduce the combined workforce by 6 percent to 7 percent in the three years after the takeover, it said.

Operators are seeking creative ways to boost sales as restaurant traffic growth has been weak to flat for several years due to competition ranging from grocery stores that sell prepared food to a proliferation of meal kit companies.
Pizza Hut started its beer delivery project in downtown Phoenix in December as part of a larger push to set the chain apart from rivals like Domino's Pizza Inc (N:DPZ).
Domino's does not deliver alcohol, but it recently added 150,000 new delivery ""hotspots"" at U.S. parks, beaches and other destinations that do not have traditional addresses in a bid find new business.
The enlarged Pizza Hut test will include Arizona cities such as Tucson, Prescott and Winslow. California cities include Los Angeles, Bakersfield, Sacramento and Santa Barbara.
More than 1,700 of Pizza Hut's roughly 6,300 U.S. units have liquor licenses, giving the chain a potential lead over some rivals.
""Many Pizza Hut restaurants are already licensed to serve and distribute beer, without third party services, additional fees, or extended wait times,"" Pizza Hut Chief Marketing Officer Zipporah Allen told Reuters.
Pizza Hut's beer delivery drivers will be at least 21 years old and trained in local alcohol laws, the company said. They have the authority to cancel a beer delivery order if customers cannot verify they are old enough to legally consume alcohol.
Pizza Hut's announcement landed hours after privately held Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA) Co said it had completed the national roll-out of its own food delivery service to 897 cities.
While pizza chains and Panera do their own delivery, many other restaurants farm the work out to companies that take a slice of revenue.
Strategy firm Pentallect Inc has forecast that U.S. third-party food delivery industry sales will grow from $13 billion in 2017 to $24.5 billion by 2022.
Pizza Hut parent Yum, which also owns the Taco Bell and KFC brands, earlier this year spent $200 million to buy a 3 percent stake in food delivery company GrubHub Inc (N:GRUB).
McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) partners with UberEats for fast-food delivery in the United States.
DoorDash, which delivers craft beer six-packs for BJ's Restaurants Inc (O:BJRI) in some California markets, has been offering alcohol delivery in select cities since 2016.

There's one problem: many of the regulators who will police it say they aren't ready yet.
The pan-EU law comes into effect this month and will cover companies that collect large amounts of customer data including Facebook (O:FB) and Google (O:GOOGL). It won't be overseen by a single authority but instead by a patchwork of national and regional watchdogs across the 28-nation bloc.
Seventeen of 24 authorities who responded to a Reuters survey said they did not yet have the necessary funding, or would initially lack the powers, to fulfill their GDPR duties.
""We've realized that our resources were insufficient to cope with the new missions given by the GDPR,"" Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, president of France's CNIL data privacy watchdog, said in an interview.
She, like some other regulators, was pressing her government for a substantial increase in resources and staff.
Many watchdogs lack powers because their governments have yet to update their laws to include the Europe-wide rules, a process that could take several months after GDPR takes effect on May 25.
Most respondents said they would react to complaints and investigate them on merit. A minority said they would proactively investigate whether companies were complying and sanction the most glaring violations.
Their responses suggest the GDPR enforcement regime will be weaker than the bloc's anti-trust authority run directly by the European Commission, the EU executive, which hit Google https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-google-antitrust-idUKKBN19I102 with a 2.4-billion-euro ($2.9 billion) fine last year. 
The launch of GDPR comes as data privacy is making headlines, with Facebook facing intense scrutiny over the leak of 87 million users' personal data to Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that advised U.S. President Donald Trump's election campaign.
HEAVYWEIGHTS IN IRELAND
The law aims to give EU citizens more rights to control over their online information. It has a slew of technically demanding requirements, and threatens fines of up to 4 percent of a company's annual revenue for serious infringements. 
Companies, for example, must be able to provide European customers with a copy of their personal data, and under some circumstances delete it at their behest. They should also report serious data breaches within 72 hours.
The industries most affected will be those that collect large amounts of customer data, including technology companies, retailers, healthcare providers, insurers and banks.
Reuters sent all the regulators a four-question survey about how they would handle their responsibilities. Eighteen national authorities replied, plus data protection officers in six of the 16 German federal states who are responsible for enforcement. 
Only five in total said the necessary data protection laws and funding in their jurisdiction were in place. Of the 17 who said they did not have the necessary funding and legislation, 11 expected both to be provided in future.
The new law calls for national watchdogs to assume the lead role in overseeing companies headquartered within their borders.
It does however create a central body, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), in an attempt to ensure the law is applied consistently across the bloc. The panel would serve both as a forum for regulators and issue binding rulings in disputes.
In the recent Facebook breach case, most regulators have not taken an active role because the firm's EU headquarters is in Ireland, falling under the country's Data Protection Commissioner (DPC). Cambridge Analytica is being investigated by the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).
The DPC of Ireland, which is also home to Google, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Twitter, was among those who declined to take part in the survey, citing the complexity of the issues, as did the UK ICO.
The Irish authority did, however, say its budget and staffing had been ramped up in preparation for GDPR. Yet its funding this year, at 11.7 million euros, works out at less than one-thousandth of Facebook's annual net income of $15.9 billion.
Johannes Caspar, the data protection commissioner in the German city-state of Hamburg, told Reuters he had had many differences of opinion with the Irish regulator in the past over its handling of Facebook, without giving details.
He welcomed the data protection board as an important new forum for neutral decision-making but criticized its design, calling it ""a cumbersome – and for outsiders certainly opaque – exercise"".
'CONVENIENCE ESTABLISHMENTS'
Italy's data protection chief Antonello Soro welcomed the pan-European rules as a ""guarantee against companies opening 'convenience' establishments in countries"". But its 2018 budget of just under 25 million euros and 122 active staff were inadequate to fulfill its responsibilities, and it would require double the funding and 300 staff.
Regulators largely did not specify what duties might be affected by a lack of resources. Experts expect oversight to be inconsistent at first, with regulators facing tough choices on whether to prioritize outreach work to encourage compliance, or enforcement actions against violators. Working smoothly as a group in the EDPB could also be a challenge. 
""I think it will work but it will take time for companies and data protection authorities,"" said Joerg Hladjk, counsel for cybersecurity, privacy and data protection at law firm Jones Day. ""They need to try this out in practice."" 
Estonia, known as a pioneer of e-governance, had backed a stronger regime enforced by the Commission. 
Viljar Peep, head of the Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate, said the quality of enforcement under the chosen local system risked being inconsistent and would depend on the ""administrative culture"" of officials, which varied widely. 
Some countries, like Estonia, took a broad view of data privacy, engaging with business and society to ensure the new rules are understood and respected, whereas others took a far narrower view, he added.
""Are we supposed to be proactive?"" he asked.

The blue-chip Dow futures fell 69 points, or 0.28%, by 6:45AM ET (10:45GMT), the S&P 500 futures lost 9 points, or 0.33%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 21 points, or 0.30%
Trump is widely expected to pull out of the 2015 international nuclear deal and reinstate sanctions against Tehran which in turn could impact Iranian oil exports.
Iran, which is a major Middle East oil producer and member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), resumed its role as a major oil exporter in January 2016 when international sanctions against Tehran were lifted in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear program.
Trump will make the announcement from Washington at 2:00PM ET (18:00GMT) on Tuesday.
Oil prices pulled back from three-and-a-half year highs reached a day earlier in what was largely attributed to be a “buy the rumor, sell the news” market move as the announcement comes several days ahead of the original May 12 deadline.
U.S. crude futures slumped 1.23% to $69.86 by 6:47AM ET (10:47GMT), while Brent oil traded down 0.95% to $75.45.
Meanwhile, in a relatively light day for economic data with just the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey (JOLTs) to be released at 10:00AM ET (14:00GMT), the dollar continued to show strength against major rivals, hitting yet another 2018 high.
Earlier on Tuesday, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell downplayed risks to financial markets from policymakers’ plans to gradually raise interest rates.
Powell promised to “communicate our policy strategy as clearly and transparently as possible to help align expectations and avoid market disruptions”.
“Fed policy normalization has proceeded without disruption to financial markets, and market participants' expectations for policy seem reasonably well aligned with policymakers' expectations...suggesting that markets should not be surprised by our actions if the economy evolves in line with expectations,” he said.
At 6:48AM ET (10:48GMT) Tuesday, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.29% to 92.88.
As the earnings season winds down this week, Tuesday will see the publication of a slew of reports. While markets will likely focus on Disney (NYSE:DIS), with the Dow component set to report after the market close, other notable firms releasing numbers include Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH), Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR), Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP).
Elsewhere, European stocks were mostly lower, with a flurry of first-quarter corporate earnings and mergers and acquisitions deals prompting sharp individual price moves.

619,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",Standard Life Aberdeen challenges Lloyds Banking Group over axed mandate,"LONDON (Reuters) -  Standard Life  Aberdeen (SLA) (L:SLA) has launched a contract dispute process against Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) over the lender's decision to cancel a 109 billion pound ($147 billion) asset management contract.
Britain's biggest mortgage lender and parent of pensions provider Scottish Widows, told SLA on Feb. 14 that it intended to cancel the mandate at the end of a 12-month notice period, citing competition concerns following the 11 billion pounds merger of Aberdeen Asset Management and Standard Life.
At the time, Lloyds said the combined entity had become a ""material competitor"" to its wealth and insurance units, and it had started a process to find a new manager for the assets, which mainly comprise of lower margin passive equity and fixed income securities.
SLA said on Tuesday it did not agree that it posed a competition threat to its largest client, and the bank therefore had no right to terminate the asset management agreements.
It said the two sides were ""engaging with each other within the framework of the dispute resolution process"" envisaged in the contract, without elaborating.
In response, Lloyds said it was ""surprised"" by SLA's move and confident in its legal right to terminate the agreement. 
""We note and are disappointed by the comments made by Standard Life Aberdeen, particularly in the light of our position as a major customer,"" Lloyds said in a statement, adding the contract to manage the assets would have ended ""in any event"" in March 2022.
""Standard Life Aberdeen is a clear and material competitor of Scottish Widows and Lloyds Banking Group in the UK and to suggest otherwise is not credible.""
Shares in the asset manager were trading 0.2 percent down at 361.4 pence by 0956 GMT, while Lloyds stock was up 0.4 percent.
The annual revenue associated with the asset management contracts represents around 130 million pounds or 4.4 percent of SLA's full year 2017 pro forma revenue.
SLA said it would provide a further update in due course.
Clients have pulled billions of pounds in assets in the nine months since the union forged one of Europe's biggest asset managers. The Lloyds mandate represents around 17 percent of SLA's remaining 646 billion pounds under management.

620,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 08, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>",Bond Buyers Can't Get No Satisfaction in Long Treasuries,"(Bloomberg) -- As the fastest U.S. inflation in a year converges on the flattest Treasury yield curve in a decade, long-dated debt is the last place many investors want to be.
Instead, they are scouting for alternatives that offer the prospect of better returns in an environment of increasing price pressures. Pacific Investment Management Co. is shunning long-maturity Treasuries in favor of shorter tenors and Troy Asset Management is long U.S. inflation-protected debt, while  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors also favors such securities issued by Japan and France.
Global inflation-linked bonds are gaining appeal at the cost of long-dated Treasuries as President Donald Trump’s tax cuts and $300 billion spending plan threaten to spur consumer prices and increase the supply of debt. Securities protected against an increase in price pressures are also benefiting from conventional German 10-year bonds trading at the most expensive levels versus U.S. counterparts since at least 1989.
“We don’t feel that you’re paid enough to go into longer-duration assets,” said Eve Tournier, head of European credit portfolio management at Pimco. “We prefer certainty, short-term maturities -- which already pay us well without having more mark-to-market risk going into longer-duration assets.”
Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond’s price to a change in interest rates, with shorter or negative duration strategies faring better during periods of rising borrowing costs or inflation. Investors had loaded up on longer-dated debt in the wake of the global financial crisis as interest rates plummeted and inflation stalled.
Flatter Curve
But now, the Treasury yield curve is the flattest it has been since the crisis, with 30-year bonds offering just a 30 basis point premium over their five-year counterparts. While speculators are shorting U.S. bonds across maturities, real money managers are bullish on the belly of the curve, according to CFTC data.
Jeffrey Gundlach’s DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund is the top performer among intermediate bond portfolios, betting on a shorter-duration strategy, while developed market inflation-protected securities handed investors returns of nearly 5 percent over the past year. That compares to a 0.8 percent loss on nominal Treasuries and a 0.2 percent loss on German bonds, according to Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) indexes.
Inflation-linked debt is one of the few options that offer value to investors, according to Sebastian Lyon, a fund manager at U.K.-based Troy Asset. He sees little room for further gains in equities or nominal bonds, which have been boosted by unprecedented levels of monetary easing. And while breakeven rates are picking up, price-protected securities also benefit from their relative scarcity, according to Lyon. TIPS, for example, make up just 9 percent of outstanding U.S. debt.
Inflation Protection
“We need some inflation protection,” said Lyon, who has an overweight position in shorter-dated global inflation-linked notes, but would move further out the curve if sovereigns continue to decline. “Linkers effectively have a foot in the bond camp but also in the inflation protection camp as well. There is little supply -- there is a huge amount of debt out there. Not so much inflation-protection debt.”
U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds that offer protection from price increases have taken in about $2.5 billion this year, 6 percent of their assets, according to Bloomberg data. The $24.4 billion iShares TIPS ETF, the largest U.S.-listed passive vehicle that tracks Treasury inflation-protected notes, has taken in $695 million.
Aviva is running long positions in U.S., French and Japanese inflation-linked debt. President Trump’s spending boost and rising oil prices will likely spur price pressures in the U.S., while securities protected against faster consumer-price growth are fundamentally cheap elsewhere, according to money manager Charles Diebel.
“It’s a cyclical story in the U.S.,” he said in emailed comments. “The fiscal spend late in the cycle is adding to the upside inflation risk.”

Diess, who took office last month after his predecessor Matthias Mueller was ousted as CEO by major stakeholders, spoke with representatives of the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Bild said, without citing the source of the information.
Diess, who joined Volkswagen (VW) in July 2015, about two months before the ""Dieselgate"" scandal broke, was accompanied by Larry Thompson, the U.S. monitor appointed last year to oversee reforms at the German group, the newspaper said.
VW declined comment on the report.
A person familiar with the matter confirmed that Diess and Thompson had traveled to the U.S. recently for talks with relevant authorities, without being more specific. 
Last week, the U.S. filed criminal charges against former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn accusing him of conspiring to cover up the emissions manipulations. They subsequently issued an arrest warrant against Winterkorn, 70, who resigned days after ""Dieselgate"" broke in September 2015.

The German industrial company is targeting savings of several hundred million euros in the program, which follows plummeting demand and a switch to renewable energy.
In November, Siemens said it would cut 6,900 jobs worldwide, mainly at the PG division, which once thrived on supplying turbines for electricity generation. Around 3,400 of the jobs will go in Germany.
Concrete details of the deal will now be negotiated in the coming months in Germany, Siemens said. Although the company was seeking voluntary job cuts, compulsory redundancies could not be ruled out, it said.
Excluding its services business, the PG division has around 30,000 employees worldwide, of which 12,000 are based in Germany.
The cuts are separate to the temporary shutdown at PG sites around the world reported by Reuters on Monday. 

Around 30,000 workers globally will be affected by the week-long shutdown, which will take place in either May and June.

626,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2018 05:16AM ET</span>",Exclusive: World's biggest gold ETF launching new low-fee fund - source,"By Peter Hobson
LONDON (Reuters) - The World Gold Council, owner of the world's largest gold-backed exchange traded fund (ETF), is launching a new fund with a cut-price management fee to fend off rivals with lower charges, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The move is a sign that cost competition among gold ETFs is heating up after a price war in the much larger equities ETF sector slashed management fees. Gold ETFs allow buyers to invest in physical gold without having to buy and store the metal.
The council's SPDR Gold Trust (P:GLD), which launched in 2004 and trades using the ticker GLD (NYSE:GLD), dominates the industry but its share of total bullion held by gold-backed funds has slipped below 50 percent from 75 percent at the start of the decade, Reuters data show.
GLD's gold holdings have risen 5 percent since the start of last year while rival iShares Gold Trust, which is run by investment manager BlackRock with a lower management fee, has grown 47 percent, by far the fastest growth among the five biggest gold ETFs tracked by Reuters.
Other low-fee funds such as Deutsche Asset Management's Xtrackers Physical Gold ETC are growing rapidly and others such as GraniteShares, launched last year, are popping up. 
GLD charges a fee of 40 basis points, or 0.4 percent, of the value of an investment, around the higher end of the market, while iShares Gold and Xtrackers take 25 basis points and GraniteShares 20 basis points, near the bottom.
The council's new fund will charge a fee of around 25 basis points, said the source, describing it as a ""countermove"" by the council to rivals' gains. 
The source said the council's two funds were designed to appeal to different audiences, with the new product targeted at investors looking to buy and hold gold who want a low management fee, and GLD aimed at financial investors who use its scale and liquidity to trade in and out of positions cheaply. 
""The idea is that the new product grows without damaging the existing product,"" the source said.
The World Gold Council declined to comment.
To keep the offerings separate, shares in the new fund will represent a smaller allocation of gold than shares in GLD. This smaller share size will make it more expensive to move in and out of positions, encouraging financial investors to stick with SPDR, the source said. 

The World Gold Council filed for the new ETF in November last year with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but did not reveal its management fee or share size. It is expected to launch the fund in the second quarter.

The world's largest sovereign wealth fund is seeking to get the 9,000 firms it invests in to disclose non-financial data, including on carbon emissions, and to stress tests their businesses against the risks posed by climate change.
""We will support the shareholder resolution asking for a report reviewing Kinder Morgan's policies, actions and plans to measure, monitor, mitigate, disclose and set quantitative reduction targets for methane emissions from all operations, including storage and transportation,"" it said in a statement.
 Kinder Morgan  owns and controls oil and gas pipelines and terminals in North America. 
The motion is one of three motions to be presented by some shareholders of Kinder Morgan that the fund will support and that Kinder Morgan's management opposes, fund data shows. 
The other two are shareholder proposals for the firm to have a report on sustainability and another for it to assess the impact on its portfolio of policies to limit a rise in global average temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). 
The fund has a stake of 0.87 percent in Kinder Morgan valuing it at $352 million at end-2017. It rarely discloses its voting intentions ahead of time.
The fund, which invests the proceeds from Norway's oil and gas production for future pensions in stocks, bonds and real estate abroad, is one of the world's biggest shareholders, with stakes totaling 1.4 percent of all listed companies.

633,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2018 08:48AM ET</span>",Japan's Takeda clinches $62 billion Shire deal as pharma M&A rolls on,"By Ben Hirschler, Paul Sandle and Sam Nussey
LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical agreed to buy London-listed Shire for 45.3 billion pounds ($62 billion) on Tuesday, the biggest yet in a wave of deals sweeping the drugs industry.
Assuming it wins the backing of shareholders, the deal will be the largest overseas purchase by a Japanese company and propel Takeda, led by Frenchman Christophe Weber, into the top 10 rankings of global drugmakers. 
The tie-up crowns a hectic few months of M&A activity as big drugmakers, including Novartis and Sanofi (PA:SASY), have brought in promising medicines developed by younger firms.
The enlarged group will be a Japanese national champion in pharmaceuticals and a leader in gastroenterology, neuroscience, oncology, rare diseases and blood-derived therapies, used for serious conditions such as hemophilia.
Shire has profitable businesses selling drugs for hyperactivity and rare disorders but the size of the deal will make Takeda one of the most indebted drugmakers, prompting Standard & Poor's to warn of a potential credit downgrade.
To pay off debts quickly, Takeda plans to slash thousands of jobs and cut back on duplicated drug research.
The deal, struck on the last day Takeda had to make a firm bid, is around 46 percent cash and 54 percent stock, leaving Shire shareholders owning around half of the combination.
Shire had rejected four previous offers, due to price concerns and the fact that the Japanese company is proposing to pay for much of the acquisition in stock.
Shire investors will receive $30.33 in cash and either 0.839 new Takeda shares or 1.678 Takeda American depositary shares for each share, valuing the offer at 48.17 pounds a share based on the latest price and exchange rate.
That is a 60 percent premium to the price before Takeda first declared its interest six weeks ago.
Shire's shares were trading 4 percent up on the previous close at just over 40 pounds by 1230 GMT, still well below the agreed price and indicating that some uncertainty remains.
""I think it is a good deal for Shire shareholders but not everybody may think that. However, the risk is that if shareholders vote this down then the shares are going to go down a lot,"" said Polar Capital fund manager Dan Mahony, who owns both Shire and Takeda stock.
The deal must get the support of 75 percent of Shire's voting shareholders. While some of them do not want to hold Takeda paper, Weber told reporters he believed most would accept.
""Their board and our board is confident that both shareholders will see the benefit of the acquisition,"" he said.
Jefferies analysts said they expected the shares to trade at a relatively wide discount to the offer, given the large stock component and the fact the deal is not expected to close until the first half of 2019. 
The transaction also needs two-thirds approval from Takeda shareholders. 
GOING GLOBAL
Weber became Takeda's first non-Japanese CEO in 2015 and has been hunting for acquisitions to make the company more global and reduce its exposure to a mature Japanese pharmaceutical market.
Prior to his arrival, Takeda bought Nycomed for $14 billion in 2011 in its previous biggest deal. Last year Weber bought U.S. cancer specialist Ariad Pharmaceuticals for $5 billion.
Buying Shire is a big financial stretch for Takeda but Weber believes it will generate substantial cash flow, enabling the enlarged group to pay down its borrowings quickly. 
Takeda said $30.1 billion in bridge loan financing would be replaced with a combination of long-term debt, hybrid capital and available cash ahead of completion, without providing a breakdown.
The Japanese company predicts annual cost synergies of at least $1.4 billion three years after completion, including $600 million in research and development costs, and the deal is expected to boost underlying earnings significantly from the first full year after closing.
Jobs will go, with the group's combined 52,000 workforce likely to be reduced by 6-7 percent. The companies have a number of commercial, research and manufacturing overlaps, particularly in the United States.
Takeda said it would maintain its global headquarters in Japan and evaluate consolidating Shire's operations into Takeda's in the Boston area, Switzerland and Singapore.
Up to three Shire directors will join the board when the deal is completed and Takeda will retain the services of key staff, including Shire CEO Flemming Ornskov, who will get 200 percent of his 2018 annual salary and target bonus.
Weber argued Takeda would be able to maintain its investment grade credit rating with a target of achieving a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.0 times or less in the medium term. 
""The commitment to get down to two times EBITDA in three to five years really shows how cash-generative Shire is,"" said Polar Capital's Mahony. 
Some analysts have suggested Takeda could sell off certain Shire businesses to make the deal more manageable but Weber said gastroenterology, neuroscience, oncology, rare diseases and blood products were all important areas to be retained.
There may, however, be opportunities to divest certain medicines falling outside these fields.
""There is 25 percent (of the portfolio) which is more isolated products. Some are doing very well, some less well. That's where you could have some portfolio assessment and potentially some disposals,"" Weber said.
Shire said last month it would be willing to recommend an offer from Takeda after it rejected four previous approaches.
The company traces its roots back to 1986, when it began as a seller of calcium supplements to treat osteoporosis, operating from an office above a shop in Hampshire, southern England. Since then, it has grown rapidly through acquisitions to generate revenues of about $15.2 billion last year.
But it has been under pressure in the past 12 months due to greater competition from generic drugs and debt from its widely criticized $32 billion acquisition of Baxalta in 2016.
Takeda was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan and Nomura, while Shire worked with Citi, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).

In dollar terms, exports in April rebounded from a drop in March and rose 12.9%, while imports surged 21.5%, resulting in a trade surplus of $28.72 billion for the period.
Analysts had previously expected exports in dollar terms to rise 6.3% on year, while import growth was expected to pick up to 16%.
The data came after the U.S.-China trade talks last week in Beijing, where the U.S. asked China to cut the trade deficit by at least $200 billion by 2020.
China’s export outlook is being clouded by an escalating trade dispute with the United States as well as a potential full-scale trade war, as the two nations threatened each other with tariffs since the beginning of the year.
The impact of the data on equities seemed to be limited however, as the Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component traded 0.9% and 0.7% higher respectively by 1:05AM ET (05:05 GMT). Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 1.3%.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Trump’s decision on whether to withdraw from the Iran deal later in the day is likely to be a focus on Wednesday. The U.S. is also due to release its PPI and CPI data on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.

637,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2018 01:17AM ET</span>",More heads roll at Australia's AMP as shareholders demand renewal,"By Byron Kaye and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Three directors quit top Australian wealth manager AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) ahead of Thursday's annual general meeting, as big investors signaled their displeasure with the embattled firm's response to allegations of criminal misconduct.
The resignations follow the exits of AMP's chairman, CEO and in-house lawyer in the wake of damaging revelations at a government-ordered inquiry that the once-venerable firm had lied to regulators and allegedly doctored an independent report.
Major shareholders rejected AMP's calls to back directors who are up for re-election at the meeting, demanding renewal instead of continuity and signaling more upheaval for companies that have been named and shamed by the banking sector inquiry.
""Our shareholders are demanding board accountability and need to know that meaningful change is underway,"" said Interim Executive Chairman Mike Wilkins, a director who stepped up after former CEO Craig Meller quit last month over the scandal.
Three months into the Royal Commission inquiry into financial industry misconduct, AMP has been accused of charging thousands of customers for financial advice it never gave then doctoring a supposedly independent report to the regulator about it. The commission has said it may recommend criminal charges.
None of Australia's Big Four banks - Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), National Australia Bank (AX:NAB), Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) - have emerged unscathed from the year-long inquiry so far, with all promising to transform how they conduct themselves and rebuild consumer trust.
But AMP has suffered the worst reputational damage. While it denies criminal conduct, shareholders have revolted, wiping A$4 billion from the company's market capitalization in a month and vowing to vote out three directors - Vanessa Wallace, Holly Kramer and Andrew Harmos - on Thursday.
Having stood by the directors, AMP caved into the pressure on Tuesday and said Wallace and Kramer would leave along with longest-serving director Patty Akopiantz. It said Harmos would stay on despite investor calls for his head as well.
SHAREHOLDERS SAY ENOUGH
Australian companies receive proxy, or absentee, votes two days before their AGM, and proxy advisers have recommended shareholders vote against the three directors up for re-election - including Harmos.
CGI Glass Lewis, a proxy adviser which had urged clients to vote against all three, said in a client note that ""none of our recommendations have changed"" after the resignations. 
Bill Watson, CEO of First Super, an AMP shareholder, said the organization would vote against Harmos's re-election in the interests of board renewal.
Australian Shareholders Association monitor Ian Graves also said Harmos should ""review his position"".
Louise Davidson, CEO of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI), which holds AMP shares, said the exit of four women from senior roles at the firm raised concerns for gender diversity as the board rebuilds.
""We strongly encourage AMP to make sure they don't end up with no women on their board as a result of this development,"" she said.

""There is no shortage of appropriately skilled, experienced and talented women for directorships in Australia.""

638,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 07, 2018 09:31PM ET</span>",Iran Nuclear Deal's Fate in Trump's Hands With Decision Tuesday,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump will announce on Tuesday whether the U.S. will leave the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, a signature achievement by his predecessor that he’s long derided as “the worst deal ever.”
Foreign leaders and analysts say the president is likely to exit, casting the future of an accord widely seen as reining in Iran’s nuclear program into doubt. Trump has said the deal doesn’t do enough to address threats from the Islamic Republic’s ballistic missile program and the country’s involvement in regional conflicts.
The president said in a tweet Monday that he’ll announce his decision at 2 p.m. in Washington, ahead of a May 12 deadline set by U.S. law. He could still surprise his allies by agreeing to stay in the accord a while longer as American and European diplomats try to negotiate side agreements aimed at addressing his concerns. Both sides in those talks have signaled that they are close to a breakthrough, though it may be too late to salvage the broader accord.
Oil prices have climbed in recent weeks as uncertainty over the future of the agreement rose. A resumption of U.S. sanctions would threaten Iran’s ability to attract foreign investment, keeping the country’s output flat or lower through 2025, according to a research note published Monday by  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
Trump reiterated his frustration with the agreement on Monday, calling it the “very badly negotiated Iran Deal” in a Twitter post, and singling out former Secretary of State John Kerry for being “the one who created this MESS in the first place!”
French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel signaled after meeting with Trump last month that he seems intent on quitting the agreement, which curbed Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for relaxing Western financial sanctions. A European diplomat said Monday that the chance Trump remains in the agreement is very small and added that there was little clarity on the administration’s ‘Plan B.’
Under legislation passed by Congress, Trump has until Saturday to decide whether to keep waiving sanctions on banks of foreign countries that haven’t reduced Iranian oil imports, according to an analysis by the Congressional Research Service. Under that law, those sanctions have to be waived every 120 days.
‘Will Not Survive’
Trump last agreed to waive the sanctions in January, but his frustration with the agreement has only grown since then. If he now decides against waiving the restrictions, an assessment of whether foreign countries are violating the sanctions would be due Nov. 8, according to the CRS study.
But “regardless of his decision, the current Iran deal will not survive under President Trump,” Barclays wrote in its report.
Trump has long criticized the nuclear accord, which was forged under President Barack Obama. In addition to saying the agreement didn’t address Iran’s missile program or meddling in other nations, he’s also complained that it freed up Iranian money abroad for military purposes and said “sunset clauses” in the deal allow the country to resume some uranium enrichment after 2025, setting the stage for a nuclear weapons program.
Following the visits by Merkel and Macron, U.K. Foreign Minister Boris Johnson was in Washington this week to make a last-ditch argument to persuade Trump to remain in the accord, arguing that it is flawed but can be improved by additional side agreements that have been under discussion for months.
“We need to find a way of fixing that, and the president has been right to call attention to it, but you can’t just do that without throwing the baby out with the bathwater,” Johnson said Monday in an appearance on Fox News.
Johnson met this week with Vice President Mike Pence, National Security Adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other administration and congressional officials.
‘Fixed or Nixed’
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the 2015 accord is fatally flawed and must be “fully fixed or nixed” to stop Iranian aggression sooner rather than later. His comments came as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned that the U.S. would face “historic” regret if it pulled out.
While analysts are betting Trump will quit the deal, the president said last week that his opposition “doesn’t mean I wouldn’t negotiate a new agreement.”
Members of Trump’s own party are split. Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Sunday he “would counsel against” Trump quitting the accord. But House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he’s “very comfortable” that the president is standing up to Iran.
Where Trump’s Scorn for the Iran Nuclear Deal Could Lead: QuickTake
Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Netanyahu said the agreement fails to address the potential weaponization of Iran’s nuclear knowledge, imposing only temporary limits on uranium enrichment.
“I say that a deal that enables Iran to keep and hide all its nuclear weapons know-how is a terrible deal,” Netanyahu said. He delivered a televised presentation last week on secret Iranian files his country’s intelligence services obtained that he said prove that Tehran sought to build a nuclear weapon in the past despite its government’s denials.
The agreement must be “either fully fixed or fully nixed” because otherwise, “you will end up with Iran with a nuclear arsenal in a very short time,” he said.
‘Non-Negotiable’
Iran, however, has ruled out new talks, calling the current agreement “non-negotiable.”
Rouhani, addressing crowds at a rally Sunday in the northeastern city of Sabzevar, said the U.S. has “always sought to sow intrigue against Iran” and would make a mistake by exiting the agreement.
“If it wants to leave the nuclear deal, it will quickly see that this decision will be a regret of historic proportions,” Rouhani said.
The European diplomat, who asked not to be identified, said it’s not clear what will happen should Trump reimpose sanctions on Iran. The president and his top national security aides haven’t explained how his administration will proceed should he withdraw from the deal, according to the official.
“I am sure of one thing: every available alternative is worse,” U.K. Foreign Minister Johnson said in column published by the New York Times on Sunday. “The wisest course would be to improve the handcuffs rather than break them.”
Side Deals
U.K. officials think “we can find some language, produce some action that meets” Trump’s concerns about the deal, Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to the U.S., said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday.
“We haven’t got there yet,” Darroch said.
By leaving the accord, the U.S. would lose visibility into what Iran is doing, Representative Thornberry said.
“I thought it was a bad deal,” he said. “But the key question is, ‘OK, now we are where we are, what happens next if the U.S. pulls out?’”

The rolling five-year average of stockpiles is inflated by the glut that’s been around since 2014, Khalid Al-Falih said in Tokyo on Monday. The objective of production curbs by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is to bring equilibrium to the market, he said, adding that he’s concerned about lower investment leading to potential shortages in the future.
While the industry is in better shape than in 2016, “we certainly don’t feel we are where we need to be,” Al-Falih said. “We believe we are on our way to restoring energy stability to the markets.”
OPEC, along with its allies such as Russia, seem determined to keep cutting production even after their campaign to rebalance world oil markets has all but eliminated surplus inventories and prices have reached the highest level since 2014. Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, is urging fellow producers to keep output restrained to fulfill a new priority: encouraging companies around the world to invest more in future supply.
Targets and metrics for OPEC’s curbs will be determined when the producer group meets next month in Vienna, Al-Falih said on Monday. Saudi Arabia is watching investment levels closely to make sure that the pipeline of project flows is sufficient to meet incremental demand, which is “very healthy,” he said, adding that he’s also concerned about tight spare capacity.
He isn’t the only voice warning about a lack of spending on new projects. Influential figures from the International Energy Agency to the boss of oil major  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) have warned a supply shortage could emerge early next decade after a period of deep cuts in spending. Under-investment could push prices as high as $300 a barrel within a few years, prominent hedge-fund manager Pierre Andurand said recently.
Al-Falih said in April that investment is the “most important metric” for gauging how long OPEC cuts need to continue. The group will examine this proposal along with a “menu” of other possible targets at its next meeting in late June, he had said.

TOKYO/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Oil prices eased slightly on Tuesday, a day after hitting 3-1/2 year highs, as investors braced for President Donald Trump's decision on whether to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, a move that could disrupt global oil supply.
European shares are seen steady to slightly firmer after Asian shares picked up, helped by technology stocks as generally upbeat earnings overcame weakness in the global smartphone market and concerns about more regulation. 
Spread-betters expect Britain's FTSE to rise 0.2 percent and Germany's Dax to inch up 0.1 percent. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures on Monday rose above $70 for the first time since November 2014, putting it more than 18 percent above this year's low touched in February.
On Tuesday, some of those oil-price gains were pared as traders took profit after Trump said in a tweet he would announce his decision on the nuclear deal at 1800 GMT Tuesday. 
""The oil market has priced in the high likelihood of Trump withdrawing from the nuclear deal with Iran. If he is going to impose sanctions similar to those the U.S. had in 2012, that would likely cause a shortage in oil,"" said Tatsufumi Okoshi, senior commodity economist at Nomura Securities.
Adding to market pressures, falls in Venezuelan oil production due to problems at the country's oil company PDVSA also added to the rally.
U.S. crude futures last traded at $70.11 per barrel, down 0.9 percent from Monday's settlement price.
Global benchmark Brent crude futures stood at $75.64 per barrel, down 0.7 percent, having risen as high as $76.34 on Monday.
While caution on Trump's statement kept investors edgy in early trade, technology firms helped to generate gains for Asian equities. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.6 percent, with information technology shares rising 1.3 percent. Japan's Nikkei was 0.2 percent higher.
SOARING VALUATIONS
Some analysts cautioned that the rally in technology shares could face a short-term correction as valuations soar. 
Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management in Tokyo, noted that technology shares have been moving higher, taking up a larger share of indices as more money flows into the exchange trade funds (ETF) market.
There is currently a ""positive feedback loop"", but if some sort of unforeseen negative event takes place, it ""may turn into a negative feedback loop,"" he said.
China's blue-chip CSI300 index rose 1.3 percent after the White House said on Monday that U.S.-China trade talks would resume next week.
On Tuesday, China reported exports and imports jumped in April, beating forecasts, but the news did not impact markets.
On Wall Street on Monday, the S&P 500 gained 0.35 percent, boosted by Apple's sixth straight day of gains.
In currency markets, the dollar broadly held firm on the prospect of solid U.S. economic growth, helped partly by Trump's tax cuts and spending, pointed to further rises in U.S. interest rates down the road.
That prompted investors to buy back dollars they had sold earlier this year on worries about Trump's protectionist trade policies.
The euro hit a four-month low of $1.1897 on Monday and last stood at $1.1930.
Against the yen, the dollar stood little changed at 108.93 yen, off its three-month high of 110.05 yen.
The combination of higher oil prices, a strong dollar and higher U.S. rates is risky for some emerging market assets as it could significantly worsen their trade balance and also encourage investors to shift funds to higher-yielding U.S. assets.
""The emerging market currencies are now playing catch up with some of the excessive losses seen in developed currencies ... Asian currencies have also fallen victim to the latest round of USD buying momentum,"" Jameel Ahmad, Global Head of Currency Strategy & Market Research at FXTM wrote in a note.
JPMorgan's emerging market bond index hit its lowest level in more than a year.
The Indian rupee hit a 15-month low while the Indonesian rupiah hit its lowest level since December 2015 on Tuesday. 
Dhian Karyantono, fixed income analyst at Mirae Asset Sekuritas Indonesia, said that the rupiah had weakened after weaker-than-expected first-quarter growth data.
Indonesia's economy grew at 5.06 percent in January-March, down from 5.19 percent in the previous quarter.

The divergence between developed and emerging markets was also visible in equity prices. Brazil's Bovespa hit three-month lows on Monday, when Germany's Dax hit three-month highs and Italian shares hit 8-1/2-year highs.

642,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 07, 2018 07:31PM ET</span>",BOE to Keep Interest Rate Unchanged After Roller Coaster Buildup,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England will probably keep interest rates unchanged this week after an economic roller coaster that saw market bets on an increase flip from near-guaranteed to almost no chance.
A majority of the nine Monetary Policy Committee members will vote to maintain a 0.5 percent benchmark on Thursday, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Governor Mark Carney will address a press conference, and the central bank will also publish new forecasts, crucial in explaining why policy should stay on hold for now but still be tightened in the next few years. Two officials may vote to hike, keeping alive the prospect of tightening later in 2018.
The BOE’s new outlook is likely to point to excess demand and inflation, an “intolerable” combination that indicates an overheating economy in need of tighter monetary policy, according to Philip Rush, an economist at Heteronomics.
With investors leaning toward a move in August, officials are also expected to emphasize their reliance on how the data turns out. Brexit looming over the outlook means that growth could fail to recover from its first-quarter dip and inflation stay firmly above the BOE’s target.
The economic backdrop, for the moment, is mixed. The following charts outline the issues for policy makers as they take their next decision.
Inflation has slowed more than the Monetary Policy Committee expected. The panel flagged back in February that their view of the pass-through of the weaker pound to inflation could be incorrect, so the recent weakness in the data means they may need to re-evaluate it. That could lead to some downgrades to the inflation projection, according to Bloomberg Economics analysis.
The BOE was expecting weak first-quarter growth, but not as dismal as 0.1 percent. That was the estimate from the Office for National Statistics, which played down the impact of severe weather. The big question is whether it’s temporary, or the beginning of a more protracted slowdown. If the latter, the economy would be growing far more slowly than its potential rate and would be less at risk of overheating, reducing the need for rate hikes.
On the other hand, officials might argue that the figure will eventually be revised up, since the ONS estimate is based on less than half of the data that will eventually be available.
So far, the evidence points to an underlying loss of momentum. Purchasing Managers Indexes for services and manufacturing were both worse than economists expected in April, and IHS Markit’s estimate of the rate of economic growth fell. The services industry, which makes up the biggest part of the economy, saw only a modest rebound from the 20-month low posted in March.
Labor-market tightness is a go-to reason to hike rates for hawks on the MPC, and data in recent months hasn’t disappointed. Unemployment is the lowest since 1975, and annual pay growth accelerated to 2.8 percent in the three months to February.
While the impact of the pound’s depreciation on price growth has been substantial, measures of homegrown price pressures are of most concern to the MPC. One gauge of domestically generated inflation is now at the BOE’s CPI target of 2 percent, and likely to rise further, according to Dan Hanson, an economist at Bloomberg. That could prove crucial in explaining why rates need to rise further out, even if they stay on hold for now.

643,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 10:28PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Comcast prepares all-cash bid to gate-crash Disney-Fox deal - sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is asking investment banks to increase a bridge financing facility by as much as $60 billion so it can make an all-cash offer for the media assets that Twenty-First Century Fox Inc has agreed to sell to Walt Disney Co for $52 billion, three people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts only plans to proceed with the bid if a federal judge allows AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc's planned $85 billion acquisition of  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX) to proceed, the sources said. The U.S. Department of Justice has opposed the AT&T-Time Warner deal over antitrust concerns, and a decision from U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon is expected in June.
Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger clinched an all-stock deal with Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch in December to acquire Fox's film, television and international businesses, giving the world's largest entertainment company an arsenal of shows and movies to combat growing digital rivals Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Comcast, owner of NBC and Universal Pictures, has also made a 22 billion pound ($30 billion) offer to acquire the 61 percent stake in European pay-TV group Sky Plc (LON:SKYB) that Fox does not already own. In doing so, it topped an earlier offer for the entirety of Sky by Fox.
Last November, Comcast offered to acquire most of Fox's assets in an all-stock deal valued at $34.41 per share, or $64 billion, a regulatory filing showed last month. Like Disney, Comcast sought to buy Fox's entertainment networks, movie studios, television production and international assets, the filing shows.
Fox ended up announcing an all-stock deal with Disney for $29.54 per share. In the regulatory filing, Disney and Fox cited regulatory hurdles as reasons to reject Comcast's bid, even though they did not reference it by name.
The exact value of Comcast's new bid for the Fox assets is not yet clear, although the $60 billion in new financing indicates it is seeking significant firepower to outbid Disney. Comcast already has a $30 billion bridge loan to finance its Sky offer.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Comcast, Fox and Disney declined to comment.
Fox shares rose 5.13 percent to $39.99 on the news in after-hours trading in New York on Monday. Comcast shares were down 1.5 percent to $31.90, while Disney shares were down 0.5 percent to $102.00. 
Murdoch, who owns close to a 17 percent stake in Fox and holds about 40 percent of the voting power, prefers to be paid in stock rather than cash for the Fox assets, because this makes the transaction non-taxable for shareholders, sources have said. It is not clear how receptive he would be to an all-cash offer.
Last month's regulatory filing also showed that Fox viewed Disney's stock as more valuable than Comcast's, based on historic prices, and felt that a deal between Disney and Fox would generate greater long-term value. The Roberts family controls Comcast through a dual-class stock structure.
Comcast's stock has dropped since then, from around $38 to about $32 now, giving the company a market capitalization of $149 billion. 
Disney has committed to share buybacks as a way of returning cash to Fox shareholders. As a result, Comcast sees an opening in being disruptive to the deal by making an all-cash bid, according to the sources. 

In its deal with Disney, Fox agreed to separate the Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, its sports channels FS1, FS2 and the Big Ten Network, into a newly listed company that it will spin off to its shareholders.

645,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 08:23PM ET</span>",ValueAct takes $1.2 billion stake in Citigroup: letter,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and David Henry
(Reuters) - Activist investing firm ValueAct Capital Partners invested $1.2 billion in  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), citing the U.S. bank's low risk and reliable revenue and not calling for major changes, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Monday.
The hedge fund also invested about $1 billion in SLM Corp's student lender Sallie Mae. Citigroup shares rose 1.5 percent after the news while SLM's stock was little changed.
In the letter ValueAct sent to clients, the firm said it built its roughly $1.2 billion Citigroup position over the last four to five months and is adding to it ""opportunistically."" 
ValueAct said that the bank could return about $50 billion in cash to shareholders over the next two years, according to the letter. That would be $10 billion more than the $40 billion management has said it intends to return.
""We have been having constructive conversations with ValueAct and welcome them as investors,"" Citigroup said. 
The San Francisco-based hedge fund said the time is right to invest in the banking system because of effective intervention by regulators after the financial crisis and greater transparency. 
""The U.S. banking system now has a structurally lower risk profile than any time in our investing lifetimes,"" ValueAct said in the letter.
It made its investment in Citigroup at a time the bank's stock price has sharply lagged its rivals, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
But what appeals to ValueAct is the consistent and reliable nature of the bank's business as it services large multinational companies with day-to-day activities, according to the letter. For example, Citigroup manages their cash and the timing of their payments and receipts, as well as hedging out currency risk.
It is less active in the flashier mergers and acquisitions business than some of its rivals but that may be a plus, according to ValueAct's letter. The bank is now ""growing in a sustainable fashion"" the hedge fund said, adding, it is ""less exposed to both earnings volatility and risk of capital impairment and is better capitalized and more securely funded than at any point in our lifetime.""
While ValueAct is known as an activist investor, it prefers to conduct discussions with companies behind closed doors instead of on cable television. The hedge fund is often asked to join the board of its investment targets and it said that its partner Brandon Boze has been named chair at the  CBRE  Group Inc (NYSE:CBRE) board, where ValueAct has invested roughly $1 billion.
ValueAct now has roughly 40 percent of its capital committed to the financial sector, including on investments in  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and KKR & Co LP.
Earlier in the year, the firm returned some $1.5 billion in capital to investors and said that it is now fully invested. Some large hedge funds have chosen to give money back at a time they have found it tough to find new opportunities. 

Since its launch in 2000, ValueAct's flagship fund has gained an average 14.6 percent a year after fees, making for one of the industry's best long-term records.

646,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 07:47PM ET</span>",Easy credit no more: how shocks from Australian banks' inquiry may squeeze a nation,"By Jonathan Barrett and Tom Westbrook
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's biggest banks are imposing stricter lending conditions on borrowers as damaging disclosures at an inquiry into financial-sector misconduct prompt fears the economy will be the victim of a new era of subdued credit growth.
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group last week said that in the wake of the Royal Commission, which has uncovered wide-spread examples of careless and at times fraudulent lending practices, it would likely be harder for customers to borrow money.
And National Australia Bank said net interest margins on its all-important mortgage book were falling; while Westpac Banking Corp told Reuters it had recently increased scrutiny of borrowers' living expenses, including asking them to disclose such items as gym memberships and pet insurance, when making loan assessments. 
The inquiry has come at a time when there was already a push for increased controls on lending and new capital requirements. Those had helped spark a wave of divestments of cash-intensive wealth management, insurance and financial planning arms. 
Borrowers have begun to feel the squeeze, according to Sydney real estate agent Peter Wong, as banks dig through credit histories and ask borrowers for bigger deposits.
""The residential sector has become very, very cautious and so, obviously, they're making sure that they dot their i's and cross their t's, and before it wasn't like that,"" said Wong, who runs an agency in inner-city Chinatown.
""I've got property on the market and I've had it on for over three months whereas previously, being a popular area, people would buy fairly quickly."" 
Australia has an oligopoly banking system - Commonwealth Bank of Australia sits alongside Westpac, NAB and ANZ making up the so-called ""Big Four"" - which collectively dominate property, investment and business lending, giving Australians limited options when seeking credit.
The banks withstood the financial crisis, and found ways to increase revenues and profits even during times when regulations were ratcheted up, such as a 2012-13 crackdown on investment and insurance product-selling practices.
But the first few months of the Royal Commission inquiry are creating more than just a reputational hazard, with the practices, structures and market dominance of the banks subjected to unprecedented scrutiny.
New regulatory controls are almost certain to be imposed, as examples of fraud and poor lending controls are revealed.
It all means that banks will not only find their ability to make money from lending squeezed, but they also face increased costs - especially as they hire more lawyers and compliance officers to cope with the immediate problems brought up by the Commission and to deal with tougher regulation in the future.
""You don't have to be Einstein to work out that credit growth slows down, do you?"" said Brian Johnson, banks analyst at brokerage CLSA.
ANZ Chief Executive Shayne Elliott told analysts last week that lending conditions had changed. ""(The) Royal Commission impact is real, people will still want to buy and own a home...but it will change the process and it probably will make it harder for people to be successful in their applications,"" he said.
ANZ did not respond to Reuters' questions sent on Friday. Westpac referred to the increased scrutiny of borrowers' expenses, while NAB directed Reuters to previous remarks. 
NAB introduced stricter conditions for mortgage borrowers in February and lowered the sums it was prepared to lend, helping push its mortgage margins four basis points lower to 1.34 percent.
CBA directed Reuters to previous statements, which show the bank has been tightening its mortgage lending rules since 2015. It was also ordered last week to hold an extra A$1 billion ($753 million) in capital against its loans after Australia's banking regulator delivered a scathing report into the bank's risk-management culture amid allegations it has allowed money laundering to flourish.
""If credit slows down and margins don't improve, and I don't really see margins improving here...profits definitely do take a hit,"" said Omkar Joshi, portfolio manager at Regal Funds Management, which owns bank shares.
HONEY, I SHRUNK THE BANKS 
The banks are core to the health of the Australian economy.
Australia's authorized deposit-taking institutions - a financial subsector the ""Big Four"" dominate - hold A$4.6 trillion in assets, according to papers filed by the Royal Commission, more than two-and-a-half times the size of Australia's economy as measured by gross domestic product.
Official lending statistics, which tend to be volatile, show personal and commercial lending has slipped 1.5 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis since December. Home prices, as measured across the capital cities of the nation's states and territories, fell 0.1 percent in April from a year earlier, the first negative reading since 2012, according to property consultant CoreLogic.
""You need to be careful there isn't an over-reaction because a bank can make or break an economy,"" said Anne Nalder, head of the Small Business Association of Australia.
She said any obstruction to obtaining credit had an immediate impact on business expenditure and hiring decisions, in an economy, especially as wages growth is modest. 
REGULATOR-IMPOSED PANGS 
To be sure, Australia's banks are not in the kind of trouble that led to rescues and emergency injections of cash in Europe and the United States during the financial crisis. 
But the increased regulation and scrutiny will be a financial burden and the Australian banks have few defenders given the shocking nature of the revelations.
There have, for example, been disclosures that CBA charged the accounts of customers after they had died, while falsified mortgage documents were used at NAB to help people collect bonuses and beat sales targets. Even Australia's conservative government – which had resisted for years the calls for a Royal Commission - is now an active critic of their practices.
While borrowers and businesses fret over credit, there is at least one industry benefiting from the banks' day of judgment.
ANZ estimates it will incur about A$50 million in legal costs linked to the Royal Commission over a 12-month period. CBA has booked a combined A$575 million in charges and provisions in preparation for legal fees, remediation and potential penalties tied to the inquiry and, on another legal front, civil charges linked to a money-laundering case. 

There is a huge demand for lawyers with relevant experience, said Jason Johnson, managing partner at Sydney-based Johnson, an executive search firm. ""Major law firms, those that participate in the financial and regulation space, are having an absolute purple patch,"" he said.

In a letter sent to the Justice Department's antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, the senators said that they worried that the deal between the No. 3 and No. 4 wireless service providers would lead to higher prices for consumers.
""T-Mobile and Sprint have led the way in offering wireless products and service options that are more appealing to lower-income consumers, including no contract plans, prepaid and no credit check plans, and unlimited text, voice, and data plans,"" the lawmakers wrote.
While AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon dominate the U.S. wireless market overall, T-Mobile is the most popular among customers who make less than $75,000 per year, and Sprint's prepaid brand Boost counts 83 percent of its users in that income range, according to data from Kagan, S&P Global Market Intelligence data.
T-Mobile has 38 percent of the U.S. prepaid market, while Sprint has 16 percent, which would give the combined company 54 percent, according to S&P.
In addition to Klobuchar and Warren, the letter was signed by Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal, Mazie Hirono, Tina Smith, Tom Udall and Ed Markey, according to the press statement.

649,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 06:39PM ET</span>",Walmart likely to announce Flipkart deal before end of week: sources,"By Sankalp Phartiyal and Nivedita Bhattacharjee
MUMBAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Walmart (N:WMT) is likely to announce its much-anticipated deal to buy a controlling stake in Indian e-commerce player Flipkart before the end of this week, two sources said, in what is likely to be the U.S. retail giant's biggest acquisition of a business.
Walmart and Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) will buy up to 75 percent of Flipkart, the two sources familiar with the matter said, declining to be named as the talks are private.
Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart will acquire about a 60 percent stake in Flipkart, while Alphabet will get a roughly 15 percent stake in the online marketplace for about $3 billion, one of the sources said.
Reuters previously reported that Walmart was in advanced talks to acquire 51 percent or more of the e-commerce player for $10 billion to $12 billion, valuing Flipkart at some $18 billion to $20 billion.
Both sources said that Flipkart Group Chief Executive Binny Bansal held a closed-door meeting with the firm's top leadership at its Bengaluru headquarters on Monday, and one added that Bansal said that Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal would exit after the Walmart deal is sealed.
Flipkart last year named Kalyan Krishnamurthy, a former executive of investor U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global Management, as the head of its core business, while Binny Bansal took the broader strategic role of group CEO. Sachin Bansal remained as executive chairman.
The Flipkart Group includes fashion portals Myntra-Jabong, payments unit PhonePe and logistics firm Ekart.
Sachin and Binny Bansal, both former Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) employees, founded Flipkart in 2007, and like their U.S. rival, began by selling books.
Walmart is expected to get three board seats at Flipkart and will also have a say in the appointments of the group's finance, legal and compliance heads, one of the sources said.
Krishnamurthy and Binny Bansal will remain in their current roles after the deal, the two sources said.
Early Flipkart investors Tiger Global and venture fund Accel will sell a majority of their stakes, one of the sources said.
Japan's SoftBank Group (T:9984), which owns roughly a fifth of Flipkart through its Vision Fund, is expected to completely exit, Reuters has previously reported.
The Vision Fund had invested close to $2.5 billion in Flipkart via primary and secondary share purchases last year.
Flipkart will hold a townhall for employees on Friday, with Walmart CEO Doug McMillon likely to attend, one of the sources said. Other top Walmart executives will also be in India for the announcement, the other source added.
A third source said Flipkart had scheduled multiple batches of townhall meetings with employees on Friday, sparking chatter within the ranks that a deal is likely imminent.

Walmart declined to comment. Flipkart, Alphabet, Tiger Global and Accel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Nicolas Amato, who heads the alternative investment activities at Wilshire Funds Management, is leaving the firm, a person familiar with the move said.
Wilshire Associates, based in Santa Monica, California, hired Amato three years ago as a managing director and head of Alternative Portfolio Management at Wilshire Funds Management. 
Amato has managed alternative investment portfolios and led the group's alternatives research team, which focuses on hedge funds, liquid alternatives and risk premia strategies.
His last day at Wilshire is Monday. Wilshire declined to comment.
While hedge funds have delivered lackluster returns and investor confidence has ebbed for a number of years, industry analysts say the asset class may find new favor now that market volatility has returned and investors are eager for firms like Wilshire to help them create portfolios and research managers.
Amato joined Wilshire after a decade at Dorchester Capital, an alternative investment firm where he was a partner and managed portfolios of hedge funds and oversaw research and risk management groups.
Last week Andrew Jarrous, a vice president for hedge fund manager research who covered global macro and relative value strategies and reported to Amato, also left Wilshire.
Jarrous is joining HighMark Capital Management, the investment management arm of Union Bank. He will reunite with former colleagues Razmig Der-Tavitian and James St. Aubin who left the Wilshire alternative investment team in 2015. Jarrous did not respond to messages seeking comment. 
Wilshire Associates was founded by Dennis Tito in 1972 and ranks among the industry's best known consulting and investment firms. It developed the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index, which is widely viewed as a benchmark for U.S. stocks performance.

654,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>",Comcast formally notifies Brussels of intention to bid for Sky,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Comcast (O:CMCSA) has formally notified the European Commission of its intention to bid for Britain's pay-TV group Sky (L:SKYB), starting the clock on a review, a regulatory source told Reuters on Monday. 
Comcast is racing to get ahead of Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) in the battle to buy the European company, and the notification in Brussels is a key requirement.
The Commission can clear the 22 billion-pound ($30 billion) bid with or without conditions or it can open a four-month investigation if it has serious concerns about the deal. The deadline for a decision is June 14. 
Comcast, the world's biggest entertainment company, stunned the industry in February when it made an informal bid for Sky, taking on Fox which is in the final stages of its own bid to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own. 
Comcast made its bid formal in April and the notification in Brussels starts the clock on the regulatory review. It is keen to show Sky's investors that it can get through the regulatory process quickly, unlike Fox which has faced repeated delays since it first agreed a takeover of Sky in December 2016. 
The Fox-Sky deal has been held up by concerns about the influence Murdoch could wield over public opinion through owning all of the broadcaster as well as British newspapers The Times and The Sun.
Fox has offered a raft of remedies to gain regulatory approval, such as protecting the independence and funding of Sky's news division.
The original Fox-Sky combination has also been further complicated by Fox’s agreement to sell many of its TV and film assets to Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), including its stake in Sky, for $52 billion (37 billion pounds).
Comcast has so far made the higher offer, at 12.50 pounds a share compared with Fox's 10.75 pounds. Investors in Sky expect Fox to return with a higher offer if it can secure approval from Britain's media secretary, who is reviewing that bid. 

The regulatory source declined to be named because the process is not public. Comcast declined to comment.

656,By Investing.com,"<span>May 07, 2018 04:09PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. US Labor Market Vacancy Data in Focus 
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics survey to measure job vacancies for March could garner added attention as it is the sole top-tier U.S. economic report slated for Tuesday.
The U.S. Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs) report at 10:00 am ET, is expected to show job openings in March fell to about 6.02 million.
The Federal Reserve's May policy statement, released last week, showed policymakers were optimistic that labor market conditions would remain strong. Tighter labor markets, however, have yet to translate into a meaningful boost in wages, much to the dismay of policymakers and market participants.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on Monday it remains puzzling why the low unemployment rate has not translated into wage growth.
Yet, the lack of wage growth has not significantly weighed on inflation, which rose to 1.9% in March, just shy of the Fed’s 2% target.
The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies on Monday, supported by an ongoing slump in EUR/USD as German factory orders fell short of economists’ forecasts.
2. API Data, Trump's Iran Decision on Tap 
The Iran nuclear deal will remain front and centre on Tuesday after President Donald Trump tweeted that he would announce a decision on the deal Tuesday afternoon, ahead of the May 12 deadline.
Traders will look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) due Tuesday after data last week showed a second-straight weekly build in U.S. crude stockpiles.
The American Petroleum Institute reported last Tuesday crude oil stockpiles rose by 3.427 million barrels. The Energy Information Administration’s weekly report, however, showed a much larger build of 6.218 million barrels.
The uptick in U.S. output has been largely overshadowed by ongoing expectations for a fall in global crude supplies amid weaker production in Venezuela and expectations the U.S. will impose new sanctions against Iran.
Crude oil futures on Monday settled higher above $70 a barrel for the first time since late-2014.
3. Disney Box Office Hits to Drive Earnings Beat?
As earnings season draws to a close, Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the notable names slated to report fiscal second-quarter results after US markets close on Tuesday.
The results come as Disney attempts to readjust to changing consumer viewing trends away from broadcast television toward on-demand internet content, with the launch of its ESPN+ app.
Disney has pinned its hopes on the app offsetting the ongoing ESPN subscriber losses in recent years ahead of its plan to launch a broader streaming service next year.
Disney’s other revenue segments including parks and theater is expected to report good performance, with the latter likely boosted by the release of the Black Panther movie, which had dominated the box office in February.
The parks segment, meanwhile, is expected to have benefited from rising ticket prices and longer stays, contributing to an uptick in consumer spending.
Disney is expected to report earnings of $1.50 per share on $12.34 billion in revenue.
As well as Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ:MAR), Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), The Wendy’s Co (NASDAQ:WEN), Dean Foods Company (NYSE:DF),  Etsy Inc  (NASDAQ:ETSY),  Jd.Com Inc Adr  (NASDAQ:JD), and Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) are slated to report earnings on Tuesday."
657,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 07:51PM ET</span>",Wynn Resorts allowed to drop Wynn from Massachusetts casino license,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts' gambling regulator on Monday said it will allow  Wynn Resorts Ltd  (O:WYNN) to remove founder Steve Wynn's name from its license for a planned $2.5 billion casino following allegations that Wynn subjected women who worked for him to unwanted sexual advances.
The Massachusetts Gaming Commission's decision came as state regulators investigate the allegations as part of a process that could affect whether Wynn Resorts continues to be deemed suitable to retain its 2014 casino license.
The five-member commission ruled that Wynn no longer be considered a ""qualifier"" for the purposes of its license upon confirmation that he did not exercise voting rights at the company's upcoming May 16 shareholders' meeting. 
Qualifiers, who must pass a state background check, can include top executives and shareholders. The commission can factor in character, reputation and integrity to determine whether a casino operator is suitable to hold a license.
""We are pleased with the Gaming Commission's decision and look forward to having nothing further to do with this matter,"" Brian Kelley, a lawyer for Wynn at the law firm Nixon Peabody, said in a statement.
Wynn Resorts also said it was pleased with the conclusion of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission that Steve Wynn should no longer be considered a qualifier. 
""We look forward to continuing to move Encore Boston Harbor forward,"" the Las Vegas-based company said in a statement.
Wynn, the company's long-time face, resigned as chief executive in early February after The Wall Street Journal reported on allegations that the billionaire had engaged in a decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct.
The newspaper said former and current company staff members it interviewed accused Wynn of creating a hostile work environment for women and of regularly pressuring employees to perform sex acts.
Reuters has not independently verified the allegations. Wynn, 76, has called the accusations ""preposterous.""
In March, Wynn divested himself of his entire 11.8 percent stake in Wynn Resorts. As a result, lawyers for the company and Wynn argued the Massachusetts commission should no longer deem him a ""qualifier"" for the purposes of its casino license.
At an April 27 hearing before the commission, Wynn Chief Executive Matt Maddox detailed steps the company has taken to distance itself from its namesake and adjust its corporate culture.
He also announced that the company was removing the name ""Wynn"" from the casino it is building in Massachusetts by changing the name of the Wynn Boston Harbor project to ""Encore Boston Harbor.""

The resort under construction in Everett, Massachusetts, adjacent to Boston along the Mystic River, will have more than 600 hotel rooms. The company expects it to open in mid-2019.

658,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>","NRA names Oliver North, known for Reagan-era scandal, as president","(Reuters) - The National Rifle Association on Monday named as its next president retired U.S. Marine Colonel Oliver North, a conservative commentator best known for his central role in the 1980s Iran-Contra affair.
The group named North following its weekend annual meeting in Dallas, where President Donald Trump vowed not to tighten U.S. firearms laws despite suggesting earlier this year that he would take on the NRA in the wake of a mass shooting at a Florida school.
""Oliver North is a legendary warrior for American freedom, a gifted communicator and skilled leader,"" NRA Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre said in a statement. ""In these times, I can think of no one better suited to serve as our president.""
North, 74, who already serves on the NRA's board of directors, was a pivotal figure in the Iran-contra affair involving secret sales of arms to Iran by Republican President Ronald Reagan's administration and the unlawful diversion of the proceeds to Nicaraguan rebels.
North, who was a White House National Security Council aide, set up a weapons pipeline to the rebels even though Congress had forbidden military aid to them. North was convicted of three felonies in 1989, but his convictions were overturned on appeal in 1990 because witnesses in his trial may have been influenced by congressional testimony he had previously given under a grant of immunity from prosecution.
North has been a conservative radio talk show host and frequent commentator on conservative television networks since.
He is stepping down from his commentary role at Fox News television, the NRA said in its statement.
The NRA said its current president, Pete Brownell, planned not to seek a second term. Brownell serves as CEO of Brownells Inc, a maker of firearm parts, accessories and ammunition.
The February massacre of 17 teens and educators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, had seemed to mark a turning point in America's long-running gun debate, sparking a youth-led movement for tighter gun controls.
Trump said in the days following the massacre that politicians have to disagree with the NRA ""every once in a while.""
But since then, no major new federal gun controls have been imposed, although the Trump administration is pursuing a proposed regulatory ban on ""bump stocks,"" which enable a semi-automatic rifle to fire a steady stream of bullets. The devices were used in an October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people.
North, long a hero to some on the political right, lost as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate from Virginia in 1994 after former first lady Nancy Reagan publicly said that North had a ""great deal of trouble separating fact from fantasy"" and ""lied to my husband and lied about my husband.""

659,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 04:53PM ET</span>",Lockheed resumes F-35 jet deliveries to Pentagon,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Defense resumed accepting F-35 jet deliveries from  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) last week after reaching an agreement on covering the costs to fix a production error, the Pentagon told Reuters on Monday.
Terms of the agreement were not disclosed. The cost of the fix was $119 million, people familiar with the situation had previously told Reuters.
The Pentagon had stopped accepting the jets on March 29, the Pentagon's F-35 Joint Program office told Reuters in a statement. The dispute was over responsibility for paying to fix corrosion related to an error discovered in the second half of 2017.
The military, U.S. allies that own F-35s and Lockheed Martin are making the necessary repairs to all aircraft, the Pentagon's office in charge of the fighter program said in the statement.
When the Pentagon stopped taking delivery of F-35s, foreign customers also were affected. At least two foreign governments, Australia and Norway, had their jets caught up in the acceptance pause.
The majority of aircraft will be repaired within two years, the statement said.
Lockheed shares added to gains after the news and closed up 2 percent at $317.71. 
Last year, the Pentagon stopped accepting F-35s for 30 daysafter discovering corrosion where panels were fastened to theairframe, an issue that affected more than 200 of the stealthyjets.
During routine maintenance at Hill Air Force Base in Utah last year, the Air Force detected ""corrosion exceeding technical limits"" where the carbon fiber exterior panel is fastened to the aluminum airframe.
Once a fix had been devised, the deliveries resumed andLockheed hit its target aircraft delivery numbers for 2017.
A lack of protective coating at the fastening point thatwould have prevented corrosion was identified as the primaryproblem, the Pentagon said at the time.
The fastening issue on the F-35 fleet did not affect flights, nor was it a safety concern, the Pentagon said last year.
On Monday, Lockheed said an agreement had been reached with the Pentagon, adding that it expected to hit its F-35 delivery target of 91 aircraft for 2018.

The pause was the latest production issue that has arisen in the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program. In 2016, a fix for insulation problems in the fuel tanks and lines of the jets caused a slowdown in deliveries.

The campus, opened in 2013, is the first Facebook data center set up outside the United States.
The expansion will make it one of the largest data centers in the world, said Node Pole, an investment hub, partly owned by utility Vattenfall (VATN.UL), which seeks to promote investments in power-hungry data centers.
Sweden and its Nordic neighbors, with cheap electricity and low temperatures, are attractive for data centers, with many Silicon valley giants and cryptocurrency miners rushing to move in. 
Facebook will add a third building to the existing two at the Lulea data center, which Vattenfall supplies electricity to.
""This third building will measure nearly 50,000 square meters, and we anticipate will start serving traffic in early 2021,"" Facebook said in a statement.
The expansion will increase the social media giant's total cumulative investment in the region to around 8.7 billion crowns, it added, without disclosing the exact cost of the new project.
Lulea's mayor Niklas Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) said the new building would double the size of the data center to more than 100,000 square meters (1.1 million square feet) and double its capacity of operations.
The current two-building campus consumes more than one percent of Sweden's total power production and that will also double, he told Reuters.
The expansion will create about 100 new Facebook jobs at the center, which currently employs fewer than 200 people, while its construction will create about 1,000 temporary jobs, Nordstrom said.
In 2017, Sweden cut its tax rate on electricity for data centers by 97 percent, to the same level as other heavy industries such as steelworks and car plants, making it attractive for new investments, said Node Pole.
""Sweden now has the lowest energy cost in the EU, with the lowest carbon footprint,"" it said, explaining Facebook's move.
The city of Lulea in northern Sweden, on the same latitude as Alaska's Fairbanks, was built on the foundation of the steel industry. In the past decade, it has also developed into a hot-spot for data centers and other energy-intensive industries.
More than 18 data centers today operate in the area, with German car maker BMW (DE:BMWG) one of the companies storing data in the region. Amazon (O:AMZN) also recently announced that three data centers will be built in Sweden.
Boston Consulting Group estimated data centers could employ 30,000 people in Sweden by 2025 – twice as many as are employed in the country’s steel industry today, according to a press release by Lulea's mayor and Lulea Naringsliv, a local development company.

""We call it the 'Facebook effect'. The new business and new jobs generated by the initial investment makes this about much more than a data center,"" said Li Skarin, chief executive of Lulea Naringsliv.

662,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>","Go to Omaha, young man: Chinese investors flock to Buffett","By Trevor Hunnicutt
OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - China's growing middle class is becoming a bigger force in global tourism. For a case in point, look no further than Nebraska the week of the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc annual shareholders' meeting.
For all his fame in the United States, where some regard him as the best investor of all time, billionaire Warren Buffett on Saturday said the company's brand carries much less weight with potential partners beyond U.S. borders.
But a clear exception is the world's second largest economy, where Buffett is something of a rock star: One early estimate put the number of Chinese visitors expected for Berkshire week at 5,000. Berkshire sent out slightly more tickets to this year's extravaganza than in 2015, when an estimated 42,000 celebrated Buffett's 50th year at the helm.
Posters for an investment conference across the street from Berkshire's convention hall are written in Chinese and boast the conglomerate Tencent Holdings Ltd as a partner.
Tables at a nearby hotel are set with a centerpiece of fortune cookies. Inside each: a Buffett aphorism. On the evening schedule one night were cocktails and ping-pong, a sport Buffett plays that is also popular in China.
At one closed-door event, five groups of U.S. start-up companies presented ideas to Chinese investors in a ""Shark Tank""-style forum held at the Nebraska Chinese Association, according to the group's president, Linda Steele.
""It's not just people snapping pictures at Dairy Queen. There's a lot going beyond the superficial. There's real business going on here,"" said Les Baquiran, founder of Pinebase, an online financial forum which sponsored several events aimed at Chinese investors in Omaha, including one that drew more than 400 people.
""It would be more intense if everyone from China who wanted to come came.""
A map of where Berkshire visitors came from, broadcast on Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Finance, showed push-pins up and down the Middle Kingdom's eastern coastline.
Buffett and his right-hand man, Charlie Munger, are relatively well-known in China, where Buffett's face appeared on cans of his beloved Cherry Coke. 
Buffett has been known to meet with groups of visiting students from China, while Munger pushed for the 2008 investment by a Berkshire subsidiary in Chinese electric carmaker BYD Co Ltd. 
Buffett took several questions from Chinese shareholders on Saturday, including one that elicited Buffett's comment that Washington and Beijing are two intelligent superpowers who will avoid a trade war. [nL1N1SC08J]
One young Shenzhen native, now studying in Boston, asked Buffett for advice.
""I never was any good at languages, but if I were in college today in either country I'd be learning the language of the other country because I think it'd be a great advantage over time,"" Buffett told him, referring to the United States and China.
The 87-year-old ""Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) of Omaha"" did show fluency with Chinese culture.
""In August, I'm going to be 88, and that will be the 8th month of the year, and it's in a year that ends with an 8,"" he said.

""As you and I both know, 8 is a very lucky number in China. So if you find anything over there for me this is the time we should be acquiring something.""

663,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2018 01:30AM ET</span>","Icahn, Deason want bid of at least $40 per share for Xerox","By Laharee Chatterjee
(Reuters) - Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, shareholders in  Xerox Corp  (N:XRX) who oppose an agreed deal with Fujifilm Holdings (T:4901), said they would consider an all-cash bid of at least $40 per share - a 43 percent premium to the Japanese firm's offer.
In an open letter to shareholders, the billionaire investors also said they were posting a $150 million bond to preserve court-ordered preliminary injunctions - including one that blocks Xerox from holding a shareholder vote on the Fujifilm deal.
The months-long saga pits Icahn and Deason, who own about 15 percent of Xerox, against current Xerox management who have agreed to a complex $6.1 billion deal that would give Fujifilm control and values the U.S. copier and printer maker at about $28 per share.
The letter also offered a blistering attack on Xerox's current board for going back on an agreement to settle their dispute, with the investors adding they were ""confident other potential buyers are waiting in the wings"" and they saw the possibility of similar or better value in a standalone Xerox.
Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO) has approached Xerox about a possible acquisition, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.
Xerox declined to comment on the letter. It failed to gain a quick appeal to the decisions blocking the Fujifilm deal on Monday and the court will now hear its appeal in September, which gives Icahn and Deason time to look for other suitors.
A representative for Fujifilm was not immediately available for comment. It has previously said it is planning to appeal the court order blocking its deal with Xerox and that Xerox shareholders should decide for themselves the merits of any deal.
At $40 per share, Xerox would be valued at more than $10 billion. Last month, Icahn and Deason said Xerox could be valued at $54-$64 per share, if their suggested alternatives to the proposed merger were taken up.
Xerox first agreed to a deal with Fujifilm in late January but then sought better terms at the behest of Icahn and Deason, who gained the court order to temporarily block the deal.
A New York judge last week agreed that CEO Jeff Jacobson had been ""hopelessly conflicted"" in negotiating a deal that would put him in charge, since he knew the board was looking to replace him.
In a dramatic turn of events last week, Xerox agreed to fire its chief executive and part of its board to settle the litigation with Icahn and Deason.
But it then said the agreement had expired over last-minute issues that arose in negotiations with the judge overseeing the case that made the parties unable to finalize their settlement.
A source familiar with the matter said Xerox's board let the settlement expire because it came to believe it had flexibility to renegotiate a deal with Fujifilm.
Fujifilm's credit quality might suffer if it renegotiates terms that favor Xerox even as an acquisition under the current plan could worsen its key financial ratios, S&P Global Ratings said in a statement on Monday.
The combined company is likely to be less competitive than Fuji Xerox because Xerox's business would expose the new firm to the maturing North American document market, S&P said.
Xerox's shares closed little changed at $28.46 per share on Monday. Fujifilm's shares were up 1.9 percent in Tuesday afternoon trade.

676,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>","In Omaha, preparing for change at Berkshire Hathaway","By Jonathan Stempel
OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - The first question Warren Buffett was asked at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc's annual meeting on Saturday was whether he was ""semi-retired,"" having given four lieutenants oversight over the company's operating businesses and some investments.
""I've been semi-retired for decades,"" the billionaire joked. Many in the audience of tens of thousands laughed.
""Warren is very good at doing nothing,"" Vice Chairman Charlie Munger later retorted. More laughter.
How long Buffett and Munger stay on is more serious.
They have built Berkshire into a $481 billion conglomerate whose dozens of businesses sweep across the American economy. Running it well, and doing a convincing job of it, would challenge many of even the best executives.
Buffett is 87. Munger is 94. And that means change is likely soon, not just for Berkshire, but also for the weekend of events in Omaha, Nebraska, celebrating their accomplishments and values.
""Warren and Charlie remain the principal show, but there is so much more to this culture,"" said Lawrence Cunningham, a law professor who has written books about Berkshire. ""This is not a one-man show or a two-man show.""
Buffett and Munger are still responsible for major Berkshire capital allocation and investment decisions.
But in January, Buffett tapped longtime executives Greg Abel and Ajit Jain to oversee Berkshire's business units, making them front-runners to succeed him as chief executive. 
He has also for several years given Todd Combs and Ted Weschler some Berkshire money to invest. They could become chief investment officer.
But none has Buffett's and Munger's public profile, magnetism, or history of investing success.
Buffett and Munger took the rare step on Saturday to assure shareholders about Berkshire's future under new leaders.
""The reputation belongs to Berkshire now,"" Buffett said.
Munger elaborated: ""I think we've started something here that will work well enough that it will last. And one of the reasons it will last is, it's not that damn easy to duplicate.""
When they're gone, shareholders expect Omaha's largest annual event other than the College World Series of baseball to feel different, with fewer people coming for the meeting and the shopping discounts from Berkshire businesses.
""Crowds will be smaller,"" said Richard Callahan, a banker at Bank of the West in Omaha.
They're big now.

Across town, Borsheims Fine Jewelry, a Berkshire unit, hosted its Friday night cocktail reception. Ten thousand people were expected.
Karen Goracke, Borsheims' chief executive, said she wouldn't expect Berkshire itself to run much differently under Abel or Jain, whom she has known for a decade.
""People feel like they got to know Warren and Charlie personally,"" Goracke said. ""They feel very connected because they've had years to build that up. I expect there will be some transition. That's just human nature.""
David Brown, president of the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, expressed optimism the weekend won't lose its ""Road to Mecca"" feel.

679,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 12:51PM ET</span>",Algeria to open farming concessions to foreigners: document,"By Hamid Ould Ahmed
ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria plans to offer foreign investors concessions for farm land for the first time, according to an official document, as the oil producer seeks to boost food output and reduce reliance on imports.
Under the plan, which is expected to be discussed by the cabinet this week before being submitted to parliament, any foreign investor would need to work in partnership with the state or a private Algerian firm, the document seen by Reuters said.
Algeria, a member of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has been encouraging farmers with incentives such as low interest loans in a bid cut the state's $50 billion annual bill for food and other imports.
The government relies on oil exports for about 60 percent of its revenues, which are only now starting to recover after a crash in crude prices from above $100 a barrel in 2014 to below $30 in 2016.
""Agricultural concessions will also be open to foreigners,"" the government said in the document on the initiative.
The document did not give details about what areas of farmland would be offered or say how concessions would be granted. An official said details would be outlined in separate legislation.
Foreign investors have long complained about bureaucratic red tape and other hurdles to investment in Algeria, a nation of 41 million people.
In 2010, Algeria approved a law allowing private firms to lease state-owned farmland for 40 years. The private firms were allowed to enter partnerships with foreigners, but the foreign investors were not allowed to directly hold a concession.
That initiative failed to provide a major agricultural boost. Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said this year that 3 million hectares from that scheme were still undeveloped and he promised more steps to improve the situation.
Algeria, one of the world's largest grain importers, bought 8.4 million tonnes of cereals in 2017 at a cost of $1.7 billion.
The government aims to boost wheat output to 5.3 million tonnes by 2022 from 3.5 million tonnes in 2017. It also wants to double production of potatoes, milk, meat and other products in the next four years.
As part of its effort to boost agriculture, the government plans to expand areas under irrigation to 2 million hectares in 2019 from 1.3 million hectares now with new dams, helping offset the reliance of farms on unpredictable rainfall.

699,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 11:38AM ET</span>",Exclusive: South African farmers take AB InBev to competition watchdog,"By Tiisetso Motsoeneng
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Farmers in South Africa have filed a complaint with the country's competition watchdog about Anheuser-Busch InBev's (BR:ABI) decision to change its pricing formula for buying malt barley, a key ingredient in beer making.
The farmers lobby group Grain South Africa believes AB InBev, the world's biggest brewer, has contravened one of the conditions set when the country's competition tribunal approved its $106 billion acquisition of rival beer maker SABMiller (LON:SAB).
""We are aware of the complaint lodged by Grain SA and have formally responded to the Competition Commission,"" AB InBev Africa spokeswoman Robyn Chalmers said. ""We have, at all times, conducted our operations in compliance with the conditions imposed by the Competition Tribunal.""
In a letter to farmers in the barley growing region of Western Cape province, AB InBev said it was changing what it will pay for the 2018 crop to 97 percent of the price for top grade wheat (B1) from 102 percent of second tier wheat (B2).
""We are of the opinion that they are not sticking to what was agreed at the Tribunal,"" said Jannie de Villiers, chief executive of Grain SA. ""AB InBev has refused to engage any further. The Competition Commission is the only avenue we can use. As the biggest buyer of barley, this a competition issue.""
In the final approval https://www.comptrib.co.za/assets/Uploads/INBEV/Final-Conditions-PUBLIC-VERSION-signature-document-2.pdf for AB InBev's acquisition, South Africa's competition tribunal said the merged entity had to comply with the terms and conditions of SABMiller's existing supply agreements with suppliers.
ANNUAL REVIEW
Farmers also worry the new formula will leave them worse off. On May 7, B1 wheat cost 3,910 rand ($311) a tonne and B2 cost 3,814 rand, taking into account a fixed discount of 96 rand per tonne this season. That would mean the price of barley would be about 100 rand a tonne lower under the new formula.
AB InBev said in its letter dated Nov. 8, seen by Reuters, that the new formula ensured the average gross margin for malting barley was competitive versus wheat in all South African growing regions.
It said would review the crop pricing formula and the amount of barley it would buy in South Africa on an annual basis.
""We believe AB InBev is in contravention of one of the conditions set by Competition Tribunal when they approved the merger with SAB,"" said one farmer, who declined to be named.
AB InBev, which sells local brands such as Castle Lager in South Africa as well as pricier international brands including Budweiser and Corona, buys 85 to 90 percent of the malted barley grown in the country.
The Competition Commission investigates cases before deciding whether to refer them to the Tribunal for adjudication. 
The Commission's spokesman Sipho Ngwema confirmed the farmers had written to the watchdog complaining about AB InBev's new pricing formula.
""We are interacting with Grain SA about this issue. No decision has made about the merits of the complaint. That's all I can tell you at the moment,"" Ngwema said.
SELF-SUFFICIENT
The pricing formula AB InBev wants to change was set by SABMiller in 2009. Previously, the barley price was set each year but farmers found it difficult to plan production and mitigate risk. So in 2009, barley prices were tied to the price of wheat futures on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).
As part of the merger approval, AB InBev has agreed to increase the amount of barley it buys in South Africa to 475,000 tonnes from the 415,000 it hopes to get in 2018.
The brewer said that meant the industry would have to increase production in drier regions and the new pricing formula rebalanced the competitive position of barley versus wheat in all growing regions.
South African farmers are expected to have harvested about 300,000 tonnes of barley in 2017. When there have been shortfalls, South Africa has imported barley from countries such as Australia and Canada.
""Our goal is to ensure that beyond 2021, South Africa remains self-sufficient in malting barley production through establishing a competitive, robust and thriving local malting barley industry,"" AB InBev said in the letter.
With operations in more 20 countries and output of more than 600 million hectolitres, AB InBev is among the world's biggest buyers of barley.

As a result of the new influx of money, Starbucks intends to give shareholders $20 billion in the form of buybacks and dividends through 2020. The coffee company also said the deal will also increase earnings per share by the end of 2021 or sooner.
Nestle will continue to pay royalties on top of the $7.15 billion to market and distribute Starbucks products such as  Starbucks coffee capsules and Teavana tea while getting the opportunity to step further into the US market. Starbucks, which is looking to expand more into international markets, will likely benefit from Nestle's international reach. 
The alliance between the largest and fifth largest market player in the US will bring their combined market share in coffee to nearly 20% and follows a string of deals in the highly fragmented consumer drinks category. In January, Dr. Pepper Snapple and Keurig Green Mountain announced a merger which would result in the combined company, Keurig Dr. Pepper.

(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn has sold his stake in American International Group Inc (N:AIG), ending a more than two-year association with one of the largest U.S. property and casualty insurers, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The activist investor started accumulating AIG shares in 2015 and became its third largest investor with a 4.76 percent stake as of the end of 2017.
But Icahn began planning to sell that stake last year as it became evident that AIG would name Brian Duperreault, an industry veteran who would oppose demands to break up the company, as its new CEO, said a second person familiar with the matter.
Both people spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
Icahn exited AIG when the company's stock changed hands at a price between $60 and $65 - levels last seen in February, one of the sources said.
At $65 per AIG share, Icahn's stake would have been worth $2.78 billion, according to Reuters' calculations.
It was not immediately known how much Icahn made from the AIG investment.
AIG shares fell nearly 1 percent to $52.30 in morning trade on Monday.
 Icahn Enterprises  (O:IEP) did not immediately respond to a request for comment and AIG declined to comment.
In the company's first quarter investor presentation released last week, AIG was not included on a list of significant holdings. Its presentation for the fourth quarter of 2017 had shown AIG as the largest of five significant holdings.
In keeping with his aggressive activist investment strategy, Icahn had publicly pressed AIG to shrink and threatened a proxy fight with the company's management.
The insurer was forced to embark on a two-year turnaround plan developed by former Chief Executive Officer Peter Hancock, which intended to return $25 billion to shareholders.
The company also sold some assets and hired Duperreault, spurring Icahn to back off on his demand to break up the company.
In March, AIG said Samuel Merksamer, a representative of Icahn on the company's board, would not seek re-election.

On Wednesday, AIG shareholders will vote on a $43.1 million 2017 compensation package for Duperreault, who has vowed to grow the company by making acquisitions and boosting revenues.

The ruling on whether the EU removed illegal subsidies for Airbus will end 14 years of litigation, leaving only the question of the amount of trade sanctions to be set if the EU loses the appeal. 
U.S. trade lawyers have argued that the EU failed to undo subsidies worth $22 billion, costing the United States tens of billions in lost exports. But EU officials dispute that number.

The appeal ruling, due no later than May 15, ties up one half of the EU-U.S. long-haul transatlantic legal battle, with a parallel ruling in the EU's complaint about U.S. planemaker Boeing (N:BA) running some months behind the Airbus case.

The view may come as a surprise to market participants who are bracing themselves for an economic slowdown — or even a recession — but the disparity in outlook makes sense when you consider Goldman's comparatively rosy outlook.
The firm sees the ongoing nine-year period of expansion continuing for several more years. It says there's only a meager 5% chance of a recession in the next four quarters, and a 34% probability one transpires in the next three years.
Assuming the economy is safe over that period, what does it all mean for financial stocks? Goldman argues the industry is perfectly positioned, at least according to one indicator linked to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM)'s quarterly manufacturing report.
Goldman notes that financials have historically been the best-performing sector during periods in which ISM manufacturing is declining from a peak, but still above the 50 threshold that indicates economic expansion. Call it a sweet spot of sorts.
But that's not all. Goldman has gone as far as to identify what it sees as the seven main reasons financials will outperform going forward. All quoted comments are from the firm's chief US equity strategist, David Kostin.
1) Rising interest rates — ""Financials typically outperform when 10-year Treasury yields rise, but lag when the yield curve flattens. However, a sharp divergence has occurred as the recent back-up in Treasury yield has corresponded with sector underperformance.""
2) Increased capital return — By late June, the Fed will give its opinions on the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) plans proposed by banks.
""Last year, the government approved a 43% jump in capital returned to shareholders via buybacks and dividends,"" said Goldman. ""Our Banks analyst Richard Ramsden expects the Fed will authorize a 16% rise in payouts for large cap banks during the 12 months ending June 2019.""
3) Further deregulation — ""Proposed amendments to the CCAR rules that would take effect next year would increase balance sheet capacity and give boards more control over the use of their capital.""
4) Strong M&A advisory fees — ""In the past two weeks, deals totaling $150 billion were announced, lifting YTD growth to +100% vs. the same period in 2017.""
5) Net interest margin (NIM) expansion — ""As the long end of the yield curve rises, benefits accrue to banks through higher investment and loan yields.""
6) Loan growth — Goldman notes that this is the primary source of investor pushback when it comes to its overweight recommendation, but it sees two elements working in its favor.
""Small banks have registered a 7.7% jump in loan growth boosting the overall bank loan growth to 4.6%. Furthermore, the drivers of loan growth are trending in a positive direction (increased capex plans, increased M&A, and low cash balances.)""
7) Attractive valuation and growth — ""The Financials sector trades at an above average relative valuation discount vs. the S&P 500 across several metrics. However, Financials operate with much lower leverage than in the past. Consequently, the median return on tangible equity (ROTE) for the sector equals just 13%."""

A Nissan spokeswoman said there would be a gradual withdrawal of diesel cars in Europe. A source had earlier told Reuters last month that Nissan would cut hundreds of jobs at its Sunderland plant, Britain's biggest automotive factory, due to falling demand for diesel models in Europe.
The auto industry and its suppliers are facing a global regulatory crackdown on diesel emissions and are adjusting their businesses, including investing heavily in electric vehicles.
German carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is also still in the process of emerging from a 2015 emissions cheating scandal that resulted in about $30 billion in fines and other costs. 
""Along with other manufacturers and industry bodies we can see the progressive decline of diesel but we do not anticipate its sudden end in the short-term. At this point in time and for many customers, modern diesel engines will remain in demand and continue to be available within Nissan's powertrain offering,"" said the Nissan spokeswoman.
""In Europe, where our diesel sales are concentrated, our electrification push will allow us to discontinue diesel gradually from passenger cars at the time of each vehicle renewal,"" she added.
Data earlier this month showed a sharp drop in demand for diesel cars in Britain, which is Europe's second-largest autos market.

Nissan has a partnership with French car group  Renault  (PA:RENA).

717,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 07, 2018 09:32AM ET</span>","Nestle Latching On to Starbucks Keeps JAB at Bay, Analysts Say","(Bloomberg) -- Nestle SA’s $7.2 billion latch-on to  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX).’s empire is a positive move for the Swiss maker of Nescafe, which needs to defend itself from increasing competition in the coffee market and bolster U.S. sales of the brown beverage, analysts said.
Nestle plans to use the Starbucks brand in its Nespresso and Dolce Gusto capsule systems, starting next year, after inking rights to sell Starbucks coffee products in supermarkets, restaurants and catering operations. Its shares were up 0.7 percent as of 11 a.m. in Zurich.
Nestle is “fighting back with the right weapons,” MainFirst Bank AG analyst Alain Oberhuber wrote in a note to clients. “Especially in the U.S., packaged coffee and ready-to-drink coffee beverages face new and large entrants.” The deal helps it keep competitor JAB Holdings at bay, according to Vontobel.
Here’s what else Nestle analysts think of the deal:
Bernstein, Andrew Wood
(Market-perform, PT CHF81)
There are “several” positives for Nestle, including a “clear strategic alignment,” given the acquisition is in one of the company’s core, high-growth, high-margin categories”; transaction enhances Nestle’s global number 1 position in coffee. The price paid is “fairly reasonable.” Among the concerns is Nestle’s acquisition track record, which over the past 10 to 15 years was “less than stellar,” both in terms of purchase price and post-deal integration. This is Mark Schneider’s “first big M&A test” as new chief executive officer of Nestle.
Bryan Garnier, Virginie Roumage
(Neutral, Fair Value CHF85)
Coffee is a priority category for the Swiss company, alongside petcare, infant nutrition and water. Deal with Starbucks will help accelerate growth in the out-of-home channel by combining Nestle’s soluble business with Starbucks products. It’s likely Nestle will record a low single-digit positive impact on estimated 2019 earnings per share.
Kepler Cheuvreux, Jon Cox
(Buy, PT CHF90)
Deal strengthens Nestle’s coffee business in roast and ground and is part of the company’s strategy to make investments in its key coffee category. Nestle is underrepresented in coffee in North America. Expect the Swiss company to use its sales platform to accelerate sales of Starbucks products elsewhere in the world: “Starbucks is a popular brand, appealing to millennials.” Assumes the transaction will add 2% to estimated 2019 earnings per share.
Vontobel, Jean-Philippe Bertschy
(Buy, PT CHF90)
As was the case with its purchase of Canadian dietary supplements maker Atrium Innovation, Nestle once again surprises the market with an “unexpected” transaction. Starbucks deal allows it to keep JAB Holding Co. at bay. It also will help Nestle gain scale in the U.S., “a weak spot so far.” The price might appear expensive but, given the returns, the deal could exceed the cost of capital in three to four years.
Zuercher Kantonalbank, Patrik Schwendimann
(Underperform)

MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (TIM) (MI:TLIT) reappointed Amos Genish as chief executive on Monday, as the phone group enters a new phase after activist fund Elliott wrestled board control from top shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV).
Elliott pulled off a boardroom coup at the former state monopoly on Friday, winning a shareholder vote to appoint 10 independent directors - or two-thirds of seats - to the board, loosening the grip of French media group Vivendi. 
TIM said in a statement late on Monday the board had unanimously backed Genish's reappointment and would support the CEO and his team in implementing the 2018-2020 business plan.
""I confirm my long-term commitment to the transformation of the group,"" Genish said.
The 58-year old CEO is close to Vivendi but is also respected by Elliott, the Italian government and investors. 
He had previously said he would only continue in his role if the new board backed his plan, which focuses on a digital transformation of the company, fixing its finances and getting back an investment grade credit rating.
In an earlier statement on Monday, Vivendi said it welcomed the appointment of Genish and reaffirmed its long-term commitment to TIM.
It said it would make sure the group's plan was ""coherently implemented in its entirety"" and that measures taken to improve profitability continued.
ACTIVIST CAMPAIGN
Elliott launched its campaign to loosen Vivendi's grip over TIM in March. It built a stake of 9 percent to try to shake up the way Vivendi - which owns 24 percent - runs it.
Elliott accused Vivendi, backed by French tycoon Vincent Bollore, of serving its own interests, while the French group said Elliott was only after short-term financial gains.
After becoming a shareholder in 2015, Vivendi gradually tightened its grip on TIM, appointing the majority of its board last year - all in the name of Bollore's stated ambition of building a southern European media powerhouse. 
The hands-on approach led to friction with politicians in Rome, concerned about a nationally important asset.
TIM said on Monday it had temporarily given its head of security, Stefano Grassi, powers to manage all assets deemed strategic for national security and defense.
Five of Vivendi's candidates, including Vivendi CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine, will be on the board, so the two sides will have to find a way to work together to help the company slash debt and become more competitive. 
TIM said the new board had also appointed Fulvio Conti, a former TIM manager and CEO of state-controlled utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI), as chairman.
""Today, we have confirmed our full confidence in Amos Genish and his management team...,"" Conti said.
De Puyfontaine, the previous executive chairman, was one of the board members who resigned in March, triggering the full board reshuffle.
Beyond asking for a governance shake-up, Elliott had called for the spin-off and partial sale of TIM's soon-to-be-created network company, a conversion of savings shares, a return to dividends and potential asset sales - all moves TIM management had called premature, unfeasible and financially risky. 

But recently the U.S. hedge fund has toned down its requests, saying it would be up to the new board and management to decide whether and when to carry out any such initiatives.

Last year AGCOM asked Vivendi, which owns 24 percent of TIM and just under 30 percent of Mediaset, to reduce its stake in one of the two groups by April this year to comply with Italian antitrust regulations designed to prevent a concentration of power in the country's telecoms and media sector.
Vivendi last month transferred a 19.19 percent shareholding in Mediaset into a trust. On Friday, activist fund Elliott wrestled board control at TIM away from Vivendi, raising the question over whether this would impact the regulator's view on the French media group's holdings in the two companies.

(Reuters) - Wall Street climbed on Monday, boosted by Apple's sixth straight day of gains and by a surge in oil prices to their highest since 2014.
The S&P energy index ended 0.18 percent higher, although it surrendered earlier stronger gains after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that on Tuesday he would announce his decision on whether to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.
Trump has threatened to withdraw from the agreement, which provided Iran with relief from sanctions in exchange for limiting its uranium enrichment capacity, unless European signatories to the accord fix what he has called its shortcomings.
Energy stocks rallied earlier in the session due to troubles for Venezuelan oil company PDVSA and by the looming decision on whether the United States will re-impose sanctions on Iran. [O/R]
""Oil has done well in anticipation of the announcement from Trump. People are braced for the worst,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) added 0.72 percent, extending gains since it reported results last week and after Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) on Friday disclosed it had boosted its stake in the iPhone maker. Warren Buffett told CNBC on Monday, ""I'd love to own 100 percent of it.""
""Buffet took such an outsized position in Apple, which was reassuring to a lot of people,"" said Jack Ablin, Chief Investment Officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. ""Psychologically, people went into last week a little skeptical, but I think we saw a thawing of that late last week and over the weekend.""
Worries over inflation and interest rates, along with tariff and geopolitical tensions, have overshadowed a solid earnings season, which is on track to record its best quarter in seven years.
Nearly 80 percent of the 417 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have topped profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That is well above the long-term average of 64 percent and the average of 75 percent over the past four quarters.
Three quarters of companies have reported revenue above expectations, compared to 60 percent in a typical quarter. That suggests that companies are growing their businesses, and not solely benefiting from deep corporate tax cuts introduced this year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.39 percent to end at 24,357.32, while the S&P 500 gained 0.35 percent to 2,672.63. Earlier, the S&P 500 was up as much as 0.75 percent.
The Nasdaq Composite added 0.77 percent to 7,265.21.
Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors rose, with the technology index climbing 0.79 percent.
AthenaHealth jumped 16.39 percent after hedge fund Elliott Management proposed an all-cash offer that would value the healthcare IT company at about $6.5 billion.
Utilities, healthcare consumer staples and telecoms all declined.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.70-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.62-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 25 new 52-week highs and seven new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 124 new highs and 23 new lows.

722,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",Regulatory battle heats up over future of Japan's regional banks,"By Junko Fujita and Sumio Ito
TOKYO (Reuters) - Two small Japanese banks made a fresh appeal on Monday to be allowed to combine and pledged to ease antitrust concerns, as a battle between two government agencies that could shape the fate of the nation's 100-plus struggling regional banks intensified.
Fukuoka Financial Group Inc (T:8354) has been wanting to buy  Eighteenth Bank Ltd  (T:8396) in Nagasaki prefecture and merge it with one of its three lenders, Shinwa Bank.
But the Fair Trade Commission (FTC), Japan's antitrust watchdog, has objected to the takeover since 2016 on the grounds that the merged entity would control about 70 percent of the lending market in Nagasaki, which it says would limit customers' choices and could lead to higher lending rates.
The FTC, which is still reviewing the case, is concerned the merger could create banks that are too dominant, undermine competition and lead to the closure of bank branches in remote areas.
Although Fukuoka Financial and Eighteenth Bank did not offer concrete steps to reduce their share of the lending market in a joint statement issued on Monday, they pledged the merged bank would not raise interest rates unfairly and maintain branches in depopulated areas. ""The merger of these two banks is the best choice for the financial support of economies in Nagasaki,"" according the statement, adding that deteriorating bank earnings would hurt the local economy.
The country's financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), on the other hand, wants to promote mergers to help lenders survive as the population shrinks.
Last month, a report from a panel of independent members commissioned by the FSA directly challenged the FTC's notion that mergers would limit customer's choices and lead to higher interest rates by saying an exemption from antitrust law should be made to help the industry survive.
The report even suggested that Japan's antitrust policy may need to be reviewed to adjust to the ongoing change in Japan's economy.
""The competition law is based on the assumption that the economy will grow but Japan is losing population much faster than any other advanced countries,"" said Naoki Ohgo, an adviser to the FSA. ""I wonder whether it is reasonable to apply traditional competition policy to the current situation.""
But a senior FTC official last month ruled out the need for applying different rules for mergers for smaller banks. ""We do not believe we need to use certain rules for growing industries and other rules for declining industries,"" Akinori Yamada, FTC's secretary general, told a media briefing.
""All we examine is the current market situation and how a planned merger will affect the market,"" he added.
Fukuoka Financial and Eighteenth Bank have not specified a target date for the merger but the pledges they made on Monday mean they are still aiming to merge. The FTC could not be immediately contacted for a comment late on Monday.
The outcome will signal how Japan will handle future situations in the regional banking industry, which controls almost half of the nation's 489 trillion yen ($4.5 trillion) in bank lending and is the lifeblood for small businesses.

The Delhi High Court last month concurred with Indian seed company Nuziveedu Seeds Ltd, which argued that India's Patent Act does not allow Monsanto any patent cover for its genetically modified (GM) cotton seeds.
The case is being submitted for an expedited preliminary hearing on July 18, said a Monsanto India spokesman.
""We remain confident on the merits of the case. India has been issuing patents on man-made biotech products for more than 15 years, as is done widely across the globe,"" the Monsanto India spokesman said.
New Delhi approved Monsanto's GM cotton seed trait, the only lab-altered crop allowed in India, in 2003, and an upgraded variety in 2006. The approvals helped turn the country into the world's top producer and second-largest exporter of cotton.
Monsanto's GM cotton seed technology now dominates 90 percent of India's cotton acreage.
The Delhi High Court's decision in April would provide relief to farmers by reducing royalties and seed prices, said Kalyan Goswami, director general of the National Seed Association of India (NSAI).
Details of the Supreme Court's refusal to grant a stay on the ruling against Monsanto were not immediately available.

The acquisition has an equity value of $4.42 billion, according to Reuters' calculations. Gramercy's total liabilities, as of March 31, were $3.14 billion.
Gramercy's shareholders will receive a second-quarter dividend of 37.5 cents per share.

729,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 11:28AM ET</span>",Cognizant cuts profit forecast due to tax hit,"By Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - IT services firm Cognizant (O:CTSH) lowered its forecast for annual earnings on Monday saying that it now expected to pay higher taxes than previously thought, driving its shares down 6 percent.
The forecast overshadowed double-digit growth in Cognizant's first-quarter revenue that beat Wall Street expectations, as businesses continued to spend more on digital services such as analytics, cloud computing and cyber-security.
The Teaneck, New Jersey-based company predicted a 9-cent hit to 2018 earnings per share due to an updated interpretation of new U.S. tax laws, which limits the amount of foreign tax credits that Cognizant can receive for the overseas taxes paid by it.
Much of Cognizant's operations are overseas, and some 70 percent of its roughly 260,000 employees were based in India as of end-2017.
The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has slashed effective tax rates for hundreds of major U.S. companies, although many have taken one-time charges to implement the changes. Cognizant recorded a $617 million charge in the three months to the end of December.
The company on Monday cut its 2018 earnings forecast to at least $4.47 per share from $4.53 per share.
Cognizant's shares fell 6.1 percent in response on a day when technology stocks were generally helping pull Wall Street higher.
Still, most of the analysts commenting immediately on the company's results day were upbeat. 
Jefferies' Ramsey El-Assal said he viewed Cognizant's ""underlying fundamentals as solid.""
Pivotal Research analyst Lou Miscioscia added: ""Keep in mind most of Cognizant's Indian competitors are growing revenue in the mid-single digit range, thus the company is outperforming peers.""
Major Indian software services exporters  Tata Consultancy Services  (NS:TCS) and  Infosys  (NS:INFY) each recorded revenue growth of about 8 percent and 6 percent in their latest quarters. Wipro (NS:WIPR) reported a fall in revenue.
Cognizant's revenue rose 10 percent to $3.91 billion in the three months ended March 31, edging past analysts' estimates of $3.90 billion. 
The company also raised the lower end of its expected range for full-year revenue, forecasting revenue of between $16.05 billion and $16.30 billion.
Revenue from healthcare clients rose 11.8 percent, while financial services revenue climbed 6.2 percent.

731,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 05:14AM ET</span>",Carlyle set to close new Asia fund at $6.5 billion: sources,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Carlyle Group  (O:CG) is set to close its biggest-ever Asia private equity fund at $6.5 billion, people with direct knowledge of matter said, in a deal that adds to the record levels of funds seeking deals in the region. 
The private equity giant had initially targeted a fund of $5 billion but raised its expectations following a strong response from its investors, known as limited partners, said the people. The fundraising could be completed as early as this month-end, one of them said, although a separate source said the timing of the close could change. 
Investor interest in Asia-focused private equity has grown as deals have increased in size following corporate restructuring and as global private equity funds make headway in key markets, including China, India and Japan. 
Last year Carlyle's rival Bain Capital led the region's biggest ever-buyout with the $18 billion purchase of Toshiba Corp's (T:6502) chips unit.
Carlyle's latest fund will combine buyout and growth opportunities, one of the people said, with the bulk going to buyouts. The firm merged its Asia buyout and growth teams in 2017.
Separately, the U.S. private equity fund has also kicked off a process to raise a Chinese yuan fund of 4 billion ($629 million) that would target opportunities in the world's second-largest economy, one of the people told Reuters.
Carlyle declined to comment. The sources declined to be named as the information is private.
The two funds of Carlyle add to fundraising momentum in a region that has become a key battleground for global financial sponsors.
A total of 342 funds raised a combined $107 billion in Asia last year, according to data provider Preqin.
Other global groups that have recently raised fresh capital include KKR & Co (N:KKR), which closed a new Asia-focused buyout fund in June last year after raising $9.3 billion, a record for the region.
Bain is also targeting up to $4 billion for a new Asia-focused fund.
Carlyle's existing portfolio firms in Asia range from a stake in Chinese internet giant Tencent's (HK:0700) e-book unit  China Literature  (HK:0772) to Metropolis Healthcare, an India-based global operator of pathology laboratories.
Last month, it agreed to invest, along with TPG Capital Management and others, $1.9 billion to buy a majority stake in the financial services business of Chinese search engine Baidu (O:BIDU). 

The Washington, D.C.-based firm generated an 18 percent net internal rate of return in its last $3.9 billion Asia fund by the end of March, according to its first quarter earnings report.

""In the first three months (of 2018), imports from Russia rose by 139 percent from a year earlier, those from Turkey by 76 percent,"" daily Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung quoted Hans Juergen Kerkhoff as saying in an interview published on Monday.
He urged the EU to quickly implement measures to prevent foreign steel from flooding the EU market, for instance by imposing its own quotas or tariffs.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration said in March it would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum in a bid to stanch imports from China, which it said have driven down prices and put U.S. companies out of business.
It has extended a temporary reprieve from the tariffs for the EU, Canada and Mexico until June 1, but the EU has demanded a permanent exemption.
""I think the EU is in a good position (for negotiations). But it must present a united front and cannot let itself be divided,"" Kerkhoff said.
Germany is urging its European partners to show some flexibility and pursue a broad trade deal with the United States that benefits both sides. But that puts Berlin at odds with European peers such as France.

735,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 03:53AM ET</span>",Asian jet fuel buyers paying the highest premiums to get supply since 2008,"By Koustav Samanta
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian jet fuel buyers are paying the highest premiums for this time of year in 10 years as new and expanded airports in the region push its consumption to new highs.
The premium for jet fuel cargoes in the Asian trading hub of Singapore was $1.01 a barrel above benchmark quotes on Friday , the highest for this time of year since 2008, according to data on Thomson Reuters Eikon. (Chart: https:// The booming aviation market has also pushed up the profit margins, known as cracks, refiners make from producing jet fuel to their highest since early 2015.   Demand for jet fuel, which is composed of the middle distillate fuel kerosene that is also used for heating, was expected to ease after the winter heating season, but consumption has stayed strong on a jump in orders from the aviation industry. The demand earlier this winter drove the jet fuel/kerosene premium to $2.28 a barrel Feb. 27, the most since May 2008. ""A rise in air-passenger traffic coming from increasing consumer affluence and improving infrastructure supports the strength in Asian jet fuel demand growth,"" said Sri Paravaikkarasu of energy consultancy FGE. The Asia Pacific region makes up over one-third of the global air passenger market, gaining on average a bit over 1 percent in global market share per year. ""Asia will remain the corner-stone for global jet fuel demand expansion in the coming decades,"" Paravaikkarasu said. In March alone, Asia's passenger traffic rose by 12 percent compared to last year, according to data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) released last week. ""The strong first quarter provides healthy momentum heading into the peak travel period in the northern hemisphere. Benign economic conditions are supporting — and being supported by —good demand for air travel,"" Alexandre de Juniac, IATA's chief executive said last week. TIGHTER SUPPLY The current run of seasonal oil refinery maintenance in Asia has added to the pricing pressure by curtailing the supply of jet fuel available to the market.  There is 2.46 million barrels per day (bpd) of Asian oil refining capacity planned to undergo maintenance in May, according to data from consultants Energy Aspects. That is nearly equal to the crude oil demand of South Korea. This supply tightness is occurring as travel demand in country's like China and India spur more jet consumption. China's domestic air traffic alone climbed 15 percent in March from a year ago, the strongest pace in five months, IATA data showed. India's March domestic traffic rose by 28 percent, marking the 43rd straight month of double-digit growth, as the government embarks on an ambitious infrastructure development plan. Lagging slightly behind India and China, but still seeing strong expansion thanks to economic growth and rising tourism figures, is Southeast Asia.  Singapore's DBS Bank expects passenger growth for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), home to more than 600 million people in 10 countries, to be around 6 percent in 2018. The general boom in demand is a boon for refiners. Asia's jet fuel crack was at $15.75 per barrel above benchmark Dubai crude, more than 50 percent higher than a year ago. The cracks peaked at $18.03 in February. For all of 2018, Sukrit Vijayakar, director of energy consultancy Trifecta, said he expects an average jet fuel crack of $16.50 per barrel. While an advantage for refiners, the high jet fuel prices threaten airline profits, for whom fuel is by far the biggest cost factor. 
""We are on track to post a profit in 2018, but (this) will depend on the fuel price going ahead,"" said Pahala Mansury, chief executive of Indonesia's state-owned carrier Garuda (JK:GIAA), this week.

Air France tumbled to a one-year low after its CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac said on Friday he would resign after staff rejected a pay deal, plunging the airline into turmoil amid a wave of strikes that has cost the company 300 million euros. 
Traders said brokers were downgrading the stock while Bernstein analysts said that was the worst possible outcome for the airline carrier.
""This leaves the company with no CEO, no labor contract, an ongoing dispute, and likely emboldened unions which will be even less likely to concede on their demands, now,"" they said.
Over the weekend, the French government urged Air France managers and unions to resolve the stand-off.

744,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2018 02:17PM ET</span>",Nestle and Starbucks strike $7.15 billion coffee licensing deal,"By Lisa Baertlein and Martinne Geller
LOS ANGELES/LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss-based Nestle , the world's largest food and beverage company, will pay  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) $7.15 billion in cash for exclusive rights to sell the U.S. chain's packaged coffees and teas around the world, tying a premium brand to Nestle's global distribution muscle. 
The agreement announced on Monday could rev up Starbucks' roughly $2 billion business selling packaged Starbucks coffee, Teavana tea and other products through grocery stores and other retailers, including in China. 
The alliance, which amounts to a licensing arrangement, frees Seattle-based Starbucks to focus on improving its mainstay U.S. cafe business, where traffic growth has stalled amid competition from fast-food chains and upscale coffee houses, while rapidly adding shops in China.
Starbucks will use proceeds to increase planned stock buybacks to $20 billion from $15 billion through fiscal 2020. It said the deal would add to earnings per share by 2021. Nestle said it expects the alliance to add to its earnings by 2019, but will not alter its share buyback plans. 
In addition to the cash payment, Starbucks will receive revenue from product sales and royalties.
""This global coffee alliance will bring the Starbucks experience to the homes of millions more around the world through the reach and reputation of Nestle,"" said Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson, calling the arrangement a brand amplifier.
""That would have taken a lot of capital and years to build outside the U.S.,"" John Culver, Starbucks' group president for international and channel development, said on a conference call with analysts. 
Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider has made coffee a strategic priority as he tries to convince uneasy shareholders, including activist Third Point, that he can boost the sprawling group's performance.
The alliance could bolster Nestle's position as the world's biggest coffee company atop a fast-changing landscape. Rival JAB Holdings, a private investment firm of Europe's billionaire Reimann family, narrowed the gap with Nestle with a recent series of acquisitions, including Peet's Coffee & Tea and Keurig Green Mountain.
In January, Nestle sold its U.S. confectionery business to Ferrero. It had been losing ground in the United States confectionery sector as rivals moved towards healthier products.
Nestle, which will take on about 500 Starbucks employees, will not buy any industrial assets as part of the deal. Shares in Nestle rose about 1.6 percent in Switzerland, while Starbucks shares slipped 0.5 percent to $57.37. 
RICHER BREW 
Coffee is popular with younger customers who have grown up with Starbucks and are willing to pay for exotic beans and specialty drinks that translate into richer profit margins than mainstream packaged food. 
The agreement will strengthen Nestle's position in the United States, where it is the No. 5 player with less than 5 percent of the market. Market leader Starbucks has a 14 percent share, according to Euromonitor International. Other big players are growing as well, including Italy's Lavazza, which is now the world's No. 3. 
Nestle CEO Schneider last year identified coffee as an area for investment. It bought Texas-based Chameleon Cold-Brew in November and took a majority stake in Blue Bottle Coffee, a small upscale cafe chain, in September. Starbucks, which in April reported a global drop in quarterly traffic to its established cafes, has been streamlining its business. It sold its Tazo tea brand to  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) for $384 million and closed underperforming Teavana retail stores. Starbucks plans to open 1,000 upscale Starbucks Reserve stores and a handful of Roastery coffee emporiums to take on high-end coffee rivals such as Intelligentsia Coffee & Tea and Blue Bottle. 
Starbucks has long farmed out retail distribution of its packaged products to a company more specialized in that process, but the partnerships have not always been smooth. 
Kraft began marketing and distributing bags of Starbucks coffee in grocery stores in September 1998. Starbucks ended the contract in March 2011, giving the business to privately held Acosta Inc. Acosta did not immediate return calls seeking comment. 
Starbucks accused Kraft of multiple material breaches of contract, including mismanaging the brand, and in 2010 proposed a payment of $750 million to end the deal. In November 2013, an arbitrator told Starbucks to pay $2.76 billion for ending the partnership early.
The Kraft deal had been set to expire in March 2014, and would have renewed automatically for successive 10-year terms. 

Nestle is also not shy when it comes to partnering with rivals through licensing deals or joint ventures, having reached arrangements with General Mills' and Hershey, among others.

745,By Investing.com,"<span>May 07, 2018 01:04AM ET</span>","Asian Equities Rise, Tracking Wall Street Gains ","Investing.com – Asian stocks were mostly higher in afternoon trade on Monday, tracking gains on Wall Street as U.S. shares recorded the biggest advance in almost four weeks on Friday.
China’s Shanghai Composite jumped 1.2% while the Shenzhen Component also gained 1.6% by 1:15AM ET (05:15 GMT).
Tension between the U.S. and China took center stage as the two nations issued a long list of demands for each other on Friday in an attempt to resolve the trade dispute between them.
In a statement titled “Balancing the Trade Relationship”, China demanded the U.S. to stop imposing 25% extra tariffs against Chinese products, adjust export ban on ZTE. Corp, and open its e-payment market to Chinese companies.
Meanwhile, the U.S. requested several conditions, including protection of American technology and intellectual property and reducing the two nation’s trade deficit by at least $200 billion by 2020.
Separately, Yi Gang, the Chinese central bank governor, said on Monday that China has a ""huge"" trade imbalance with the U.S. and that it needs to be viewed rationally as a long term structural problem.
Elsewhere, The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission imposed a total of 183 million yuan of fines on three local banks for more than a dozen violations, reports on Monday suggested, adding that this is the largest fines since China reshuffled its supervisory regime in March.
The upcoming U.S.-North Korea meeting also remained in focus as North Korea’s state-run news agency accused the U.S. of trying to mislead the public to believe its sanctions were the reason behind North Korea’s willingness to remove nuclear weapons.
The news came after Trump said on Friday that a date and place are confirmed for the upcoming summit. While official details were not provided, South Korean newspapers have reported that the meeting would most likely take place in the third week of June in Singapore.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4% in afternoon trade. Reports that several policymakers said the Bank of Japan should make it clear to the public that it is not ready to consider the details and timing of when it could exit its ultra-loose policy garnered some attention.
Elsewhere, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 0.5%, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.4%. South Korean markets are closed for a holiday, but reports that the Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol said the central bank should lift its benchmark rate raised some eye brows, although the bank later released a statement and clarified Lee was just speaking in ""general terms."" 
Looking ahead, China trade data and Australia’s federal budget are due out Tuesday, while Wednesday would bring Japanese wages data and then later on U.S. PPI. Inflation releases in China and the U.S. are scheduled to be released on Thursday.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwanese chip designer Mediatek Inc has received an export permit from the government to sell components to ZTE Corp, a Chinese telecoms equipment maker subjected to restrictions in the United States.
The U.S. government last month banned American firms from selling to ZTE for seven years, saying the company had failed to comply with a settlement related to ZTE shipping U.S.-made goods to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.
Following the U.S. ban, Taiwan had instructed local firms wanting to ship goods to ZTE to apply for permission. 
Mediatek confirmed to Reuters on Monday that it had received the export permit last week to ship products to ZTE. 
An official with Taiwan's Bureau of Foreign Trade said the government had approved a permit for Mediatek, and that it had received applications from ""several"" other tech firms.
""We fully understand high-tech factories' characteristic of fast-paced shipments of goods, we won't create obstacles for the pace of their exports,"" the foreign trade official told Reuters, on condition of anonymity. 
""Taiwan's government has its own control mechanisms, which is independent of the way the U.S. looks at it in a given situation,"" the official said. ""The mechanism will consider America and other advanced countries' controls."" 
He said the permit that Taiwan had issued, or was looking to issue, would give domestic companies permission to proceed with exports to firms on the government's watch list. 
He did not give names of the other companies that had applied for permission, but said chipmaker Nanya Technology Corp was not one of them.
Shipments to ZTE by Nanya Tech will be hurt in the short term given the government's procedure, local media has reported. 

A Nanya Tech spokesperson was not immediately available for comment on Monday.

The rating agency, however, affirmed the IDR at 'AA-' saying it expects the lender ""will maintain its strong franchise and sound financial profile despite negative findings from an independent prudential inquiry into its governance, culture and accountability"".
Australia's financial sector has been rocked by evidence of wrongdoing revealed by a powerful independent inquiry established by the federal government, following a series of scandals at CBA and other big banks.
Australia's banking regulator last week also slapped an extra A$1 billion ($754 million) capital requirement on CBA, as it released a scathing report into how the lender allowed money laundering to flourish. 
The same week the bank was forced to reveal that it had lost records of 20 million accounts.
""We believe the initially identified shortcomings of CBA, being risk appetite as well as management and strategy, are more widespread than we had incorporated into the previous assessment of these factors,"" Fitch said. 
The quasi-judicial inquiry has also led S&P Global to say the credit worthiness of Australia's largest wealth manager AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) may be downgraded to 'A-' from 'A' if damaging revelations of the firm's misconduct affects its core wealth management business or if the risk of fines and legal actions increases materially.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Melco Resorts (O:MLCO) $1.1 billion hotel tower set to open in Macau next month will not resort to casino junket operators to lure in high rollers, as it bets on a resurgence in the city's gambling sector to drive revenues, Chairman Lawrence Ho said.
Melco's move to ditch a usual casino practice - using middlemen known as junket companies to bring in VIP punters - comes amid a government push to diversify away from gambling and scrutiny of junket patrons on concerns over money laundering. 
""Eventually it's much better to develop your own database than rely on junkets,"" Ho, also Melco's CEO, said on Friday.
Melco's 160-meter tall hotel Morpheus, to be opened at its City of Dreams casino resort, will house over 700 rooms, event facilities and casino tables, and will exclusively cater to premium mass customers. 
VIPs bet about HK$1 million ($127,395) at a time while premium mass customers bet thousands of Hong Kong dollars. The VIP sector accounts for over half of Macau's casino revenues.
Gambling revenues in the Chinese territory have been going through the roof over the past year, with April's 28-percent spike marking the 21st month of gains.
""Year-to-date growth right now is well over 20 percent. It will normalize but will still blow out the original expectations,"" Ho told Reuters.
Ho expects Macau's gambling revenue to grow around 20 percent this year, beating market projections for a rise in the high-single to low-double digits.
Ho is the son of the flamboyant 96-year-old tycoon Stanley Ho, who founded SJM Holdings (HK:0880) and is set to retire as chairman of Macau's oldest gambling company on June 12 - a move analysts say could spark a power struggle.
The 42-year-old Ho has, however, always distanced himself from his father's legacy and built a separate empire. His sisters are Pansy Ho, who co-chairs  MGM China  (HK:2282), and Daisy Ho who will take the helm of SJM from Ho senior. 
""From day one, creating Melco was to be separate from that empire,"" Ho said. ""Everything we have done...we have tried to do it our way."" 
MELCO OPERATIONS 
Melco operates a casino in the Philippines and aims to set up in Japan. Ho is pushing to expand to Cyprus where he said Melco will open a temporary casino by this summer and a full integrated resort in 2021. 
In Macau, Melco has three casinos, which have entertainment options such nightclubs and theater, in line with Beijing's directive to develop more non-gaming amenities.
Melco, which has a market capitalization of $15.9 billion, has its Macau license until 2022. Its shares have jumped almost three-fold from 2016 lows. 
Ho said the government had provided little detail on the upcoming license expirations, starting in 2020, for the six Macau casino operators.
""We are very interested in what the rebidding and the renewal process will be. The Macau government and even in Beijing they have kept it very close to their hearts right now.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to fresh 2018 highs on Monday while oil prices surged to their highest since late 2014, driven by declining Venezuelan crude production and worries the Unites States could re-impose sanctions on Iran.
The crude surge lifted energy stocks in Europe and on Wall Street, with European shares supported by strong results and gains in Nestle after the Swiss company agreed to pay $7.15 billion to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) in a global coffee alliance.
The euro broke below $1.19 for the first time this year on weaker-than-expected German industrial orders and declining euro zone investor sentiment.
Investors increased bets that rising U.S. interest rates would continue to boost the dollar, while traders unwound their bearish positions on the greenback.
An index that tracks the dollar against a basket of leading currencies climbed to 92.974, its highest since December. The index was last up 0.18 percent at 92.729.
""The general view right now is that the dollar is probably going to continue to move a bit higher against the euro in particular, maybe against the yen as well,"" said Larry Hatheway, chief economist at GAM Investment Solutions. 
The euro could slip to 117.50 or even 115 as a support level, Hatheway said, as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy and the European economy trends weaker, he said.
""There's a general appreciation the Fed is going to move at least twice again this year and the consensus is shifting toward three more moves this year.""
The euro slid 0.27 percent to $1.1926, while the Japanese yen was little changed at 109.09 per dollar.
Venezuelan oil exports came under threat after U.S. oil major ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) moved to take Caribbean assets of state-run PDVSA to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award, three sources told Reuters. 
The move could further crimp PDVSA's declining oil output and exports.
Widespread expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump will withdraw from the Iranian nuclear pact also weighed on crude prices.
U.S. crude rose 73 cents to $70.45 a barrel, while Brent gained $1.22 to $76.09.
Nestle rose 1.6 percent after it gained the rights to market Starbucks products around the world outside of the U.S. company's coffee shops.
Nestle was the biggest contributor to the 0.61 percent advance in the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares. Oil giants Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and Total also were among the biggest contributors.
On Wall Street, the S&P energy index was the biggest gainer, rising more than 2 percent, among the 11 major sectors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 163.91 points, or 0.68 percent, to 24,426.42, the S&P 500 gained 13.78 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,677.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 65.01 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,274.62.
Euro zone government bond yields slid as the unexpected fall in German industrial output was seen as encouraging the European Central Bank to prolong an unwinding of stimulus.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year German bund fell to 0.531 percent, while yields on U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.9572 percent.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's ANZ said it would quit paying bonuses to financial planners for selling its products, becoming the country's first major lender to change business practices in response to a powerful inquiry that has unmasked widespread misconduct in the sector.
The move by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd highlights how the Royal Commission has started to refashion an industry central to the world's 12th largest economy, just three months into what is scheduled to be a year-long run.
""The world of financial services, particularly for individuals, will look very, very different in two years' time,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets.
""The Royal Commission is playing a key part in it.""
The barrage of banking headlines continued on Monday with Commonwealth Bank of Australia hit by a cut to its ratings outlook that cited potential ramifications from the Royal Commission and other inquiries as a key factor. The industry's regulator also gave its first restricted license to an online bank which aims to take on the sector.
And in the past month, AMP Ltd, Australia's biggest wealth manager, has seen its CEO and chairman depart over allegations aired in the inquiry that it charged fees for financial advice without actually giving it.
The judge-led inquiry reports back to the government with recommendations in early 2019, but the industry's biggest players are already scrambling to control the fallout.
ANZ's decision to scrap sales bonuses for financial planners came after witnesses employed by the company told the inquiry 5 percent of the bank's financial planning product sales were deemed inappropriate.
""We know it has taken too long for changes to occur, so where we see solutions we will act,"" Chief Executive Shayne Elliott said in a statement, which did not mention the Royal Commission.
""That is why we are getting on with these initiatives now.""
By comparison, the UK banned commission-based advice by financial advisers in 2012 in an upheaval dubbed ""death of the salesmen"" at the time.
""The removal of remuneration that both is conflicted, or that is perceived to be conflicted, is a positive step,"" Dante De Gori, chief executive of the Financial Planners Association of Australia, said in an email.
Moves in the United States to shift to fee-based advice for retirement accounts, which began in 2017, from commission-based advice are currently being challenged in the courts.
CBA SEEN AT MORE RISK 
ANZ's action comes as many of Australia's big lenders are cutting back their exposure to financial planning - part of a sectorwide push to simplify business structure and reduce exposure to a highly competitive market.
ANZ is selling most of its planning businesses to IOOF Holdings Ltd, while CBA and National Australia Bank are seeking to exit from wealth management.
Westpac Banking Corp is the only ""big four"" lender without plans to sell out of wealth management, reaffirming its commitment to its unit at an earnings call on Monday.
But Westpac, which posted a better-than-expected profit in the first half, also warned it expected to sell fewer mortgages, saying tighter lending standards would squeeze growth. That echoes predictions of slower revenue growth in the wake of the inquiry by ANZ last week.
CBA, Australia's biggest lender, saw Fitch Ratings cut its issuer default rating for the bank to ""negative"" from ""stable"", citing the risk that it may be hit with tougher regulations than its peers.
In addition to the Royal Commission, CBA is facing a federal lawsuit accusing it of more than 50,000 breaches of anti-money laundering protocols. The Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulatory Authority (APRA) has forced the bank to carry an extra A$1 billion in cash provisions as punishment.
""We believe the initially identified shortcomings of CBA, being risk appetite as well as management and strategy, are more widespread than we had incorporated into the previous assessment of these factors,"" Fitch said in a statement.
In another blow to the status quo, APRA granted online-only lender volt bank Ltd the country's first ""restricted authorised deposit-taking institution"" license as part of a push to encourage competition in the sector.
The license lets volt, founded by former staffers at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Westpac subsidiary St George, test its platform and gather A$2 million ($1.5 million) in deposits while it works on getting a full banking license. 

""The trust between many Australians and their banks has been broken and the path to repair starts with new market entrants who are willing to do things differently,"" volt CEO Steve Weston said in a statement.

754,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2018 06:49PM ET</span>","Activist investment rising in Asia, led by local players: JP Morgan","By Alun David John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Activist investing in Asia is rising steadily, driven more by local players rather than headline-grabbing foreign firms, as the region's regulators pay greater attention to corporate governance, according to research from JP Morgan (N:JPM). 
Last year, there were 106 activist campaigns in Asia, versus 94 the previous year and just 10 in 2011, the investment bank said, citing data from Activist Investor and Shark Repellent.
Domestic players accounted for almost two-thirds of activist campaigns between 2011 and 2017, JP Morgan said. 
""In Asia, as regulators look to protect the interests of minority shareholders, corporate governance has risen up the agenda ... activist investors now have more power to push for change in the companies in which they have invested,"" said David Hunker, JP Morgan's head of shareholder activism defense.
In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been a public advocate of corporate governance, providing a boost to activists. 
Earlier this year, Sparx Asset Management (T:8739) urged synthetic fiber maker Teikoku Sen-i (T:3302) to triple dividend payouts. The proposal was rejected, but the company separately announced a small increase in dividend, for which Shuhei Abe, founder and CEO of Sparx, claimed some credit.
Similar trends are emerging in other parts of Asia.
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HK:0388) finalised new rules recently for capital raisings by listed issuers aimed at ""restricting abusive practices ... and protecting the interests of minority shareholders"". 
South Korea's Financial Services Commission has also announced a plan to facilitate and encourage minority shareholder participation at meetings for listed companies.
Another factor in the rise of shareholder activism is the growing presence of large global institutional investors among Asian listed companies' top shareholders, Hunker said.
These investors have already shown a willingness to support activist investors, if not in Asia, then at least elsewhere in the world, he said, adding that such firms are certainly willing to disagree with management decisions. 
U.S. activist fund Elliott Management has challenged South Korea's top two family-run conglomerates, most recently  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380), over better corporate governance and returns to shareholders.

BlackRock said in its Asia Pacific investment stewardship report for the fourth quarter of last year that of the 8,390 proposals it had voted on in the three months, it had voted against management recommendations on 7 percent of them.

Spain's third-largest bank has agreed to pay 178 million euros ($212.85 million) for that stake - valuing each BPI share at 1.45 euros - for a premium of 22.67 percent to the stock's closing price on May 4.
Caixabank said in a statement it would buy another 8.4 percent stake from the Portuguese arm of insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG), taking its stake to 92.935 percent. It originally took over BPI in February 2017 in a bid to boost revenue.
Subsequently, Caixabank will ask BPI's board to de-list its shares. If the Portuguese bank approves the request, Caixabank will offer to buy all the remaining stock.
Caixabank said it would offer 149.25 million euros for the second tranche of shares, valuing them at the same level as the Allianz quota. 
The first purchase will knock Caixa's fully-loaded CET 1 capital ratio - a key measure of financial strength - down an estimated 20 basis points to 11.4 percent, the bank said.

Washington imposed a seven-year ban on U.S. companies selling components and software to ZTE last month after finding that the Chinese telecoms company breached U.S. sanctions on Iran.
ZTE's exchange filing on Sunday did not give details of its request or say when it had been made, but it did say that the company had provided additional material at the BIS's request.
The Chinese firm is heavily reliant on imports of U.S. chips and the ban on sales threatens to scupper its smartphone business. ZTE has said the ban is unacceptable and threatens its survival.
Last week, Chinese negotiators holding trade talks with U.S. counterparts in Beijing asked the United States to hear ZTE's appeal, take into account the company's efforts to improve its compliance and amend the ban.
U.S. officials have said the action against ZTE was not related to trade policy, but the move has been seen by many in China as part of the broader trade spat playing out between the world's two biggest economies.
DBS Vickers analyst Tam Tsz-Wang said the ZTE request appeared to be procedural. 
""(This) doesn't make me turn all positive,"" Tam told Reuters. ""The outcome is more an issue that depends on the negotiation between U.S. and China,"" he added, declining to speculate.
The ban on sales to ZTE has also underscored China's heavy reliance on semiconductor imports amid growing trade tensions with the United States.

DUBAI/PARIS/ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) are preparing for possible changes to dozens of plane orders from Middle East carrier Etihad Airways as it presses ahead with a company-wide review, four sources familiar with the matter said.
Etihad has been reviewing its business since 2016 when investments in other airlines contributed to a nearly $2 billion loss for the Abu Dhabi state-owned carrier.
Etihad is considering its options for over 160 aircraft it has ordered, ranging from swapping models to delaying deliveries to outright cancellations, the sources told Reuters.
A final decision could be based on a combination of the three options, one source said.
Etihad declined to comment. A Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment, citing company policy to ""not comment on delivery schedules nor any discussions with customers"". An Airbus spokeswoman declined to comment, telling Reuters talks with customers were confidential.
Few details of the review have been made public but Etihad's new Group Chief Executive Tony Douglas said on April 30 that the airline aims to develop in ""a sustainable way"". 
Etihad has 88 Airbus and 78 Boeing jets on order worth tens of billions of dollars, largely from deals signed in 2013, which are scheduled to start delivery from this year.
The orders include 62 Airbus A350s and 52 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, according to the two planemakers' websites.
The bulk of the aircraft were ordered when Etihad was pursuing an aggressive expansion strategy to keep pace with regional rivals Emirates and Qatar Airways. 
Etihad said then that under the agreements with Airbus and Boeing, it could transfer orders to airlines it had invested in. At that time, the airline had stakes in several other carriers.
The expansion strategy seemingly collapsed last year when Air Berlin and Alitalia filed for insolvency after Etihad invested in them. 
Air Berlin, one of Etihad's biggest investments, ceased operations last October, while Alitalia, the most high profile, is unlikely to take any aircraft as insolvency proceedings continue.

Etihad currently holds stakes in four other airlines.

765,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2018 08:31AM ET</span>","Apple and Buffett saw value, and acted","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) was not the only one to leap on a chance to buy its stock at a fat discount last quarter as Warren Buffett stepped in to scoop up an additional 75 million shares for Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa) at the same time.
Between them - the two biggest players in the iPhone maker's shares - they bought nearly one of every 10 Apple shares traded during the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters calculations.
But the discount window did not stay open long, with Apple's stock back at a record high above $183 on Friday after trading in the mid-$150s for part of the first quarter. 
The recovery in the share prices makes it less opportune for Apple's corporate treasury to execute purchases as it proceeds with an additional $100 billion of buybacks in an effort to further winnow down its mountain of cash.
Apple bought more than $23 billion of its own shares in the first three months of the year at an average price of $171.48, the company said this week. A Buffett representative on Friday confirmed Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in Apple by 75 million shares, for which the company looks to have paid between $12 billion and $13 billion, based on the stock's trading range during the period.
Funds from the repatriation of Apple's $252 billion overseas cash hoard arrived at an convenient time for traders working on behalf of Apple. The Cupertino, California, company's massive share purchase in the March quarter coincided with a 10 percent slump in the S&P 500 between Jan 26 and Feb 8. 
That drop raised fears across Wall Street that a nine-year bull market was ending and made it easier for big players amassing shares in a company to find willing sellers. 
Apple shares fell even more than the broader market, tumbling over 13 percent from their record high close. But while the S&P 500 has remained in correction territory, Apple shares quickly recovered, and it seems the company and Berkshire were there to help. 
Buffett, a billionaire bargain hunter, increased his company's stake to 240.3 million shares worth $42.5 billion during first quarter.
At its low in February, the stock was available for as little as $150, an 18 percent discount to its current price.
On more than a third of the trading days during the March quarter, Apple's stock traded below its volume weighted average price, or VWAP, for the prior 60 days. 
On Feb 8, when it closed at $155.15, the low for the quarter, it was at a nearly 10 percent discount from its 60-day average VWAP. The stock had not been available at such a large discount to its prevailing average since May 2016, which happens to be when Buffett bought his first-ever shares of Apple.
At its close of $183.83 on Friday, however, Apple now stands at a premium of nearly 7 percent to its 60-day VWAP of $172.11.

Prior to last quarter, Apple's largest-ever quarterly repurchase occurred in early 2014, a year after it initiated its first $210 billion buyback program. The stock traded at a discount to its 60-day VWAP through much of the quarter, and Apple spent $18 billion to buy up its own shares, according to filings.

766,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",How a trade row may split the fortunes of two U.S. farm companies,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The threat of steep tariffs on soybeans, wheat and corn from an escalating U.S.-China trade dispute may decide the survivor among the two largest real estate funds in the hard-hit U.S. farm sector.
 Farmland Partners Inc  (N:FPI), a $251 million market cap real estate investment trust that owns more than 166,000 acres of farmland, appears to be more vulnerable to the effects of a trade war than its largest publicly traded competitor, $186 million market cap  Gladstone Land Corp  (O:LAND). 
That is because while Gladstone Land has focused primarily on so-called permanent crops such as oranges and almonds that grow on trees and vines, Farmland Partners has roughly 60 percent of its portfolio in row crops such as soy that China included in its April 4 list of retaliatory tariffs against the United States.
Roughly 35 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans imported each year by China will now face an additional 25 percent import tax. Soy futures  plummeted 5 percent on April 4, the day the tariffs were announced. 
With its concentration on farmland that produces soy, Farmland Partners is ""the most likely to be in the crosshairs of China"" and may have more difficulty passing on rent increases to its farmer tenants than Gladstone Land, putting its dividend at risk, said Robert Stevenson, an analyst at Janney who covers both companies. 
Paul Pittman, the chief executive of Farmland Partners and one of its largest investors, told Reuters in an interview he thinks his company's stock is undervalued and that chief competitor Gladstone Land is spreading misinformation about the challenges facing row crops. 
""Our company is misunderstood,"" Pittman said. 
When asked for comment on Pittman's allegations, David Gladstone, Gladstone Land's chief executive, told Reuters: ""We have no idea how the tariffs will impact them."" 
His own company, meanwhile, focuses mostly on perishable berries and vegetables that are not shipped to Asia and organic almonds that have little export sales, Gladstone added in a statement.
Higher trading costs would only add to the challenges facing U.S. farmers. Before the tariffs were announced, the United States Department of Agriculture estimated in February that inflation-adjusted net farm income would decrease 6.8 percent, or $6.7 billion, this year, to its lowest level since 2009. Those declines would mark the fourth-straight annual loss for the sector, which has been undercut by rising interest rates and high land prices. 
Between 2003 and 2013, the average acre of farmland in the United States jumped 213 percent in noninflation-adjusted dollars, according to research by Brent Gloy, an agricultural economist at Purdue University, an average annual increase of 12 percent. Prices have stalled since, up just 1 percent over the last four years.
The twin impacts of rising tariffs and rising interest rates have taken shares of Farmland Partners down 10.6 percent for the year to date, compared with an 8.4 percent decline in Gladstone Land and a 0.1 percent decline in the broad S&P 500 (SPX). 
BETTING ON A 'TABLE POUNDER'
Farmland Partners, which at $7.50 per share trades 46 percent below its April 2014 initial public offering price of $14, was the first dedicated farmland REIT in the United States and launched near the height of the farmland boom. 
""A lot has changed since the IPO: crop prices dropped, there's a discussion of tariffs, and the capital markets haven't been as supportive,"" said David Rodgers, an analyst at Baird Equity Research who lowered his target price for the company on March 5. ""You would need to see some cash flow growth and dividend growth to give confidence to investors that the business is on the right path and is healthy."" 
Pittman, who in addition to being chief executive is one of Farmland Partners' largest investors, said tariffs will not affect the company as much as the market expects. 
""The downside in the near-term is probably muted because frankly the world needs to eat,"" he said in an interview.
Gladstone Land, meanwhile, is more exposed to policy risks than Farmland Partners because its crops are more dependent on migrant labor, Pittman said. 
""If someone figures out how to get spinach from Mexico to the U.S. cheaper - when we know that growing costs will be half of what it is here - then it will crush (Gladstone's) portfolio,"" Pittman said. 
Joel Beam, a senior portfolio manager at Salient Partners (O:FFREX), said he has a position in Farmland Partners in part because he believes that Pittman is a ""table pounder"" who will continue to make a case for his company despite the mounting threats. 
Pittman ""is pretty vociferous about its value, which is a refreshing thing,"" Beam said. 
While Farmland Partners purchased $110 million of almond, pistachios and walnut groves in California's Central Valley in September, Pittman said the company is not going to deviate from its strategy of owning predominantly row crops because of the threat of tariffs. 

""Our stock is horribly depressed,"" he said. ""We have a good business but a bad stock price.""

The carrier is in a stand-off with employees which on Friday prompted Air France-KLM CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac to step down, after staff rejected a pay rise proposal. 
Unions said they would be sticking with plans to strike on May 7 and May 8. 
""Air France deplores the decision to go ahead with the strikes as we enter a period that will not enable negotiations to continue in order to put an end to it,"" the airline said in a statement, referring to a looming period of interim management.

768,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2018 02:16PM ET</span>",French government urges Air France to pursue reforms as strikes bite,"By Sarah White and Sophie Louet
PARIS (Reuters) - The French finance minister on Sunday raised the pressure on Air France managers and unions to resolve a stand-off over wages, saying the government would not ride to the carrier's rescue as it grapples with worker strikes and a leadership vacuum.
The dispute at Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF)'s French arm intensified on Friday when staff rejected a pay deal, prompting the group's chief executive to resign and raising questions over the airline's capacity to cut costs and reform.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire urged the company and workers to resume talks, delivering a blunt assessment of the airline's future as he warned the state's 14 percent Air France-KLM stake was no guarantee it would pick up the pieces. 
""If Air France does not make efforts to become more competitive, allowing this flagship to be at the same level at Lufthansa and other airline companies, Air France will disappear,"" Le Maire told BFM television. 
""We're minority shareholders ... those that think that whatever happens the state will come to Air France's rescue and soak up Air France's losses are mistaken,"" Le Maire said. 
Air France-KLM CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac, who will stay on until May 15, had been battling to cut costs to keep up with competition from Gulf carriers and low-cost airlines. 
Rivals like British Airways (L:ICAG) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) have already gone through painful restructurings to cope.
Air France-KLM, which reported widening losses in the first quarter even as profits at Dutch carrier KLM improved, has reined in growth expectations for 2018 after walkouts at the French airline.
Strikes have already cost the company 300 million euros ($359 million) and stoppages by pilots, ground staff and other workers are due to resume on May 7 and May 8. Close to 85 percent of flights are likely to run on Monday, the carrier said. 
Air France-KLM's board is set to announce an ""interim governance solution"" on May 15 following Janaillac's departure. The company declined to comment further on what format that would take or how long the transition would last. 
Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) and China Eastern both hold 9 percent of Air France-KLM. 
NOT ASTRONOMICAL
Until new management plans are in place, Air France executives lack a mandate to continue negotiations with unions, prolonging the dispute.
Some worker representatives hit back at Le Maire on Sunday, after he called their demands unjustified. 
Unions had been calling for a salary hike of 5.1 percent in 2018 alone, and staff rejected a management pay deal offering 7 percent wage increase over four years. 
""Our demands are far from astronomical,"" Yannick Floc'h, vice-president of the SNPL pilots union, told BFM TV later in the day, adding there was room to find middle ground between the two sides. ""I think we can find a way out.""
Others, including the more moderate CFDT union, which had urged Air France to back management's pay proposal, warned that ""dialogue was blocked"" and said the SNPL was too inflexible. 
""There's reason enough to be worried,"" CFDT leader Laurent Berger. 
The Air France turmoil has coincided with other strike action as rail workers press on with rolling stoppages to protest President Emmanuel Macron's planned overhaul of SNCF, the state-run train operator.
French travelers have faced transport misery since early April, and Le Maire said the drag on economic growth from the strikes stood at around 0.1 percentage points of output as tourism and the transport of raw materials took a hit. 
Representatives from Air France unions are due to meet on Monday. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe is also due to meet rail unions for talks over the SNCF stand-off.

769,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",GrubHub case could be barometer for new rules on independent contractors,"By Daniel Wiessner
(Reuters) - Food delivery company GrubHub Inc (N:GRUB) may be one of the first tech firms to feel the impact of a ruling this week from California's highest court that makes it easier for workers to prove they are a company's employees and entitled to costly legal protections.
Late on Friday, lawyers for a former GrubHub delivery worker asked a U.S. appeals court in San Francisco to send his closely watched case against the company back to a judge who had previously dismissed it. In light of the California Supreme Court's decision, the lawyers said, the judge should reconsider Raef Lawson's claims that he was an employee entitled to overtime pay and reimbursement for expenses.
Gig economy companies such as GrubHub, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and TaskRabbit Inc rely heavily on the use of independent contractors to contain costs. The California court's ruling on Monday could push some companies to rein in their use of contractors, according to several employment lawyers.
Companies must pay taxes and contribute to unemployment and workers' compensation funds on behalf of employees, pay them the minimum wage and overtime, and cover their work-related expenses. Contractors can cost up to 30 percent less, according to several studies.
In February, a judge ruled Lawson was not GrubHub's employee because the company did not control how he made deliveries. Many gig economy companies have faced similar claims, but the GrubHub case was the first of its kind to go to trial.
GrubHub, which has denied that delivery workers are its employees, did not respond to a request for comment on Friday's filing.
Before Monday's high court ruling, workers had to show that companies controlled how they did their jobs, among other factors, to win on claims that they are employees rather than contractors under California law.
Now, the burden is on businesses to prove that workers are not under their direct control, do not perform a core function of their business, and are ""engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business.""
In Friday's filing, Lawson's lawyers said the judge who dismissed the case found delivery drivers were vital to GrubHub's business. Under the new test, that means Lawson was the company's employee, they said.
Similar tests have been adopted by courts in several states, including New Jersey, Illinois and Massachusetts. But California is home to many of the largest gig economy companies and its courts are a hub for lawsuits against them.
""A majority of gig companies emerged out of Silicon Valley, and California courts have always been seen as the incubator for how these cases should be decided,"" said employment lawyer Richard Meneghello.
Shannon Liss-Riordan, who represents Lawson in the GrubHub case, said Monday's decision provides stronger legal protections for workers and could stem companies' increasing reliance on contractors.
The decision could also affect pending cases accusing Uber, home-services provider Handy, and other companies of improperly treating workers as contractors.
However, it is not clear whether courts will agree to apply the new test to older legal claims, such as those in the GrubHub case. Judges could find it unfair to apply the new standard retroactively, said employment lawyer Richard Reibstein.
But moving forward, he said, companies in the gig economy and beyond will need to consider major changes.
""Businesses operating in the state will need to re-evaluate their use of (contractors) and restructure their businesses to comply with this new decision,"" Reibstein said.
The case is Lawson v. GrubHub Inc, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-15386.

771,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Bank of America's loan to Remington tests its firearms pledge,"By Tom Hals and Jessica DiNapoli
WILMINGTON, Del./NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) is preparing to provide critical financing to Remington Outdoor Co, which makes assault-type rifles, just weeks after the U.S. bank said it would stop financing ""military-style"" firearms for civilians. 
The bank is contributing $43.2 million to a $193 million lending package funded by seven banks, according to court documents, which will help put Remington back on stable footing as it emerges from bankruptcy later this month into an uncertain environment for gun makers.
The package replaces a similar credit facility the banks committed to providing Remington. Both were agreed in late March, before Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, changed its policy to stop financing companies that make military-style guns for civilian use.
Anne Finucane, Bank of America's vice chair, said in April that the bank had decided on its pledge to help reduce mass shootings, saying in an interview with Bloomberg TV that ""it is not our intent to underwrite or finance military-style firearms on a go-forward basis.""
The comment came weeks after a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, triggered a new movement for gun control, led in part by student survivors, increasing pressure on U.S. companies to seek to distance themselves from the firearms industry.
Finucane in the Bloomberg TV interview said that Bank of America was in discussions with its gun-manufacturing clients following the change, but did not give details. She did not mention Remington.
Bank of America's plans to go ahead with the credit facility following its change of policy in April have not previously been reported. 
Bank of America said it does not comment on client matters.
Representatives for Remington and Cerberus Capital Management L.P., Remington's private equity owner, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cerberus will give up its equity stake in Remington under the weapons maker's bankruptcy plan.
According to a review of bankruptcy court documents and interviews with restructuring experts, Bank of America's agreement with Remington allows it to back out and find another lender to cover its commitment.
But withdrawing from the deal would hurt the bank's reputation for standing by its lending agreements and could undermine Remington's survival, according to one person familiar with the bank's thinking. 
Noting that the credit facility is part of a court-supervised bankruptcy, the source said that if the bank were to pull out of the deal it could expose itself to lawsuits and potential damages.
Remington makes the Bushmaster assault-style rifle, including the one used in the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut in 2012 that killed 20 children and six adults.
At Bank of America's annual shareholder meeting in April, Chairman and Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said the change of policy toward some gun makers was prompted in part because more than 150 Bank of America employees ""directly lost a relative in the shootings in the last couple years.""
Moynihan was responding to conservative activist and shareholder Justin Danhof, who said at the meeting that the bank has an obligation to its investors to make profitable loans.
""The company is willfully giving up money,"" Danhof said of the guns pledge.
Remington has been a client of Bank of America and the six other lenders providing the credit facility since at least 2012, according to court records. 
For the new facility,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co and Regions Bank are each providing $43.2 million, while Branch Banking and Trust Co, Synovus Bank, Fifth Third Bank and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) are providing smaller amounts.
Wells Fargo has said it believes the government should set gun policy, not companies through their credit.
The other banks declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. 
In the weeks leading up to Remington's bankruptcy, 30 other potential lenders turned down requests for help from Remington's financial adviser, many of them citing firearms as the reason, according to court documents.
One corporate restructuring specialist suggested Bank of America could have used the new credit facility as leverage to demand that Remington stop making assault-style rifles.

""It's perfectly reasonable for them to say to any borrower, 'We're happy to lend to you if you don't make military-style assault weapons,'"" said Ted Gavin of the Gavin/Solmonese LLC restructuring advisory firm. ""The lender has all the power.""

772,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Three-quarters Facebook users as active or more since privacy scandal: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"By Chris Kahn and David Ingram
NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Most of Facebook's U.S. users have remained loyal to the social network despite revelations that a political consultancy collected information about millions of accounts without owners' permission, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday showed. 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has faced pressure from regulators, privacy advocates and shareholders since it said in March that political consultant Cambridge Analytica wrongly obtained personal data through a quiz app connected to Facebook. U.S. lawmakers grilled Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg for two days on the matter.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll adds to other indications that Facebook has so far suffered no ill effects from the episode, other than a public relations headache. 
The national online poll, conducted April 26-30, found that about half of Facebook's American users said they had not recently changed the amount that they used the site, and another quarter said they were using it more. 
The remaining quarter said that they were using it less recently, had stopped using it or deleted their account.
That means that the people using Facebook less were roughly balanced by those using it more, with no clear net loss or gain in use. 
Among all adults, 64 percent said they use Facebook at least once a day, down slightly from 68 percent who said so in a similar poll in late March, shortly after news organizations reported Cambridge Analytica's activity.
Full poll results: https://tmsnrt.rs/2JWt0Eq
Analyst Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities said Facebook is lucky the data apparently has been used only for political ads and not more nefarious purposes. 
""I have yet to read an article that says a single person has been harmed by the breach,"" he said. ""Nobody's outraged on a visceral level."" 
Facebook declined to comment. Its executives have apologized for the data-harvesting, pledged to investigate others who collected Facebook user data and reduced the amount of data available to similar app developers now. 
The Cambridge Analytica scandal broke on March 16, sparking interest online in the hashtag #deletefacebook. 
In its first quarter results, however, Facebook said the number of monthly users in the United States and Canada rose to 241 million on March 31 from 239 million on Dec. 31, growth that was roughly in line with recent years.
According to the poll, more Facebook users said they knew how to guard their personal information on the site than users of other social media platforms such as Snapchat, Instagram, Pinterest and Tumblr. 
It found that 74 percent of Facebook users said they were aware of their current privacy settings, and 78 percent said they knew how to change them. 
In comparison, 60 percent of Instagram users said they knew their current privacy settings and 65 percent said they knew how to change them. And 55 percent of Twitter users knew their privacy settings, and 58 percent knew how to use them.
Despite their understanding of Facebook's privacy settings, only 23 percent of its users said they have ""total control"" over the information they store on the platform. Another 49 percent said they have ""some control,"" and 20 percent said they had ""no control."" The remaining 9 percent said they do not know how much control they have.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 2,194 adults, including 1,938 Facebook users, 1,167 Twitter users and 1,237 Instagram users. It has a credibility interval of 3 percentage points, meaning that the results could vary in either direction by that amount.

Buffett made his assessment before tens of thousands of Berkshire shareholders attending the conglomerate's annual meeting on Saturday in Omaha, Nebraska.
It came two days after Buffett revealed having bought 75 million additional Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL), and four days after Apple said it may buy back $100 billion of stock.
""I'm delighted to see them repurchasing shares,"" Buffett told Berkshire shareholders at the conglomerate's annual meeting.
""I love the idea of having our 5 percent, or whatever it is, maybe grow to 6 or 7 percent without our laying out a dime. But you have to have a very, very special product, which has an enormously widespread ecosystem, and the product is extremely sticky.""
Apple's share price hit a record high after Buffett revealed having boosted Berkshire's already large stake in the Cupertino, California-based company to roughly 240 million shares, now worth some $44 billion. 
While Buffett ""very much"" approves of Apple repurchasing shares, he and Munger expressed skepticism that Apple could find meaningful acquisitions on which to spend cash.
""The reason companies are buying their stocks is that they are smart enough to know it's better for them than anything else,"" Munger said. He said he and Buffett do not approve of all repurchase strategies. 
Buffett's initial commitment to Apple surprised many given his usual aversion to companies in the technology sector, but the billionaire views Apple more as a consumer products company.
The investment also helps Buffett deploy Berkshire's cash and equivalents while he looks for his first major acquisition since paying $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp in January 2016.
Even after the Apple investment, Berkshire's holdings of cash and equivalents was $108.6 billion, the company said on Saturday.
Buffett made his comments in response to a shareholder question posted by CNBC journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin.
""$100 billion is a lot of money,"" the question concluded.

""I used to think so,"" Buffett joked, prompting laughter and applause.

More than half of the staff at the French carrier who cast a ballot voted against the offer of a 7 percent salary increase over four years, prompting Janaillac to say he would resign.
Strikes over the pay dispute, due to resume on May 7 and May 8, have cost the company 300 million euros ($360 million) so far. 
Janaillac, who is chairman at Air France as well as chairman and CEO of parent group Air France-KLM, agreed to stay on until a May 15 shareholder meeting, the company said in a statement. Air France-KLM's board will also meet then.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Saturday sharply criticized China's efforts to force foreign airlines to change how they refer to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, labeling China's latest effort to police language describing the politically sensitive territories as ""Orwellian nonsense.""
Amid an escalating fight over China's trade surplus with the United States, the White House said China's Civil Aviation Administration sent a letter to 36 foreign air carriers, including a number of U.S. carriers, demanding changes.
The carriers were told to remove references on their websites or in other material that suggests Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau are part of countries independent from China, U.S. and airline officials said.
The White House said in a statement that President Donald Trump ""will stand up for Americans resisting efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to impose Chinese political correctness on American companies and citizens.""
""This is Orwellian nonsense and part of a growing trend by the Chinese Communist Party to impose its political views on American citizens and private companies. ... We call on China to stop threatening and coercing American carriers and citizens.""
Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial issue. Beijing considers the self-ruled, democratic island a wayward province. Hong Kong and Macau are former European colonies that are now part of China but run largely autonomously
The White House's sharp criticism follows contentious trade talks between senior U.S. and Chinese officials earlier this week. 
The Trump administration demanded a $200 billion cut in China's trade surplus with the United States by 2020, sharply lower tariffs and a halt to subsidies for advanced technology, people familiar with the talks said.
“My group just got back from China. We’re going to have to rework China because that’s been a one-way street for decades,” Trump said at an event in Cleveland on Saturday.
“We can’t go on that way,” he said, although he also said he has a lot respect for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Trump earlier this week praised his relationship with Xi but there were no signs of significant progress at the talks on Thursday and Friday, raising fears of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies.
TARIFF THREATS
Trump has already proposed tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods which could go into effect next month. 
China has said its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, including soybeans and aircraft, will go into effect if the U.S. duties are imposed. 
It has also requested that Washington treat Chinese investment equally under national security reviews and stop issuing new restrictions on Chinese investment.
The dispute over how airlines refer to Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau is another area of tension in U.S.-China relations.
A spokesman for Airlines for America, a trade group representing United Airlines (N:UAL), American Airlines (O:AAL) and other major carriers, said on Saturday it was working with the U.S. government to determine ""next steps"" in the dispute.
In January, Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), following a demand from China over listing Taiwan and Tibet as countries on its website, apologized for making ""an inadvertent error with no business or political intention,"" and said it had taken steps to resolve the issue.
Also in January, China suspended Marriott International Inc’s (O:MAR) Chinese website for a week to punish the world’s biggest hotel chain for listing Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as separate countries in a customer questionnaire.
The apparent intensification of efforts to police how foreign businesses refer to Chinese-claimed territories - even if only in pull-down web menus - underscores how sensitive the issue of sovereignty has become in China.
China's aviation authority said in January it would require all foreign airlines operating routes to China to conduct comprehensive investigations of their websites, apps and customer-related information and “strictly comply with China’s laws and regulations to prevent a similar thing from happening.""

Australia’s Qantas Airways (AX:QAN) said in January it had amended its website to no longer refer to Taiwan and Hong Kong as countries rather than Chinese territories after China issued a similar warning.

OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett has been buying a boatload of Apple Inc shares and on Saturday suggested he would buy even more shares at the right price.
At Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc's annual shareholder meeting, Buffett credited Apple with developing ""extremely sticky"" products to which consumers become attached and endorsed Apple's decision to buy back its own stock, saying it was the technology company's most productive use of cash.
""We would love to see Apple go down in price,"" Buffett said. Berkshire is now Apple's third largest shareholder, behind Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).
""I'm delighted to see them repurchasing shares,"" Buffett said, just two days after he revealed having bought 75 million additional Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL), and four days after Apple said it may repurchase $100 billion of stock. At the end of 2017, Berkshire had owned 165.3 million shares.
""I love the idea of having our 5 percent, or whatever it is, maybe grow to 6 or 7 percent without our laying out a dime.""
And Buffett described it as a mistake that he never thought Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) made sense as investments for Berkshire.
Buffett, 87, and his longtime partner and fellow billionaire Charlie Munger, 94, also took pointed questions on China,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, guns, healthcare and their investment choices from shareholders, journalists and analysts at the more-than-six-hour meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.
The questions also elicited views on politics from the ""Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) of Omaha"" and Munger.
Buffett said it was unlikely that the United States and China would come to loggerheads on trade and believed the countries would avoid doing ""something extremely foolish.""
""The United States and China are going to be the two superpowers of the world, economically and in other ways, for a long, long, long time,"" Buffett said, and that any tensions should not jeopardize the win-win benefits from trade.
""It is just too big and too obvious ... that the benefits are huge and the world is dependent on it in a major way for its progress, that two intelligent countries (would) do something extremely foolish,"" he said. ""We both may do things that are mildly foolish from time to time.""
The Trump administration has drawn a hard line in trade talks with Beijing, demanding a $200 billion cut in the Chinese trade surplus with the United States, sharply lower tariffs and advanced technology subsidies, people familiar with the talks said on Friday.
Buffett suggested U.S. President Donald Trump should be an ""educator-in-chief"" on the invisible benefits of trade.
Munger, meanwhile, answered a question on steel tariffs imposed by the White House by acknowledging that U.S. producers are hurting.
""Even Donald Trump can be right on some of this stuff,"" he said.
Asked why Buffett was willing to do business with gun makers, he retorted, ""I do not believe in imposing my political opinions on the activities of our businesses."" 
The billionaire investor said U.S. corporate tax cuts were good for shareholders but cautioned that the long-term effects of economic choices could be hard to gauge.
And Buffett predicted ""bad endings"" for cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, and said long-term U.S. government bonds were a terrible investment because inflation would consume their returns.
CARDINAL SIN
Buffett defended Wells Fargo and its chief executive, Tim Sloan, when asked when Berkshire would ditch the bank, one of its largest common stock holdings. Many shareholders applauded the question.
Buffett said the bank had committed the ""cardinal sin"" of incentivizing employees into ""kind of crazy conduct."" U.S. regulators imposed $1 billion of fines last month over lending abuses.
But he maintained that the bank was not ""inferior,"" as an investment or morally, to its main rivals.
Berkshire owned $25.2 billion of Wells Fargo stock as of March 31, down 14 percent from year end as a series of scandals weighed on the bank's reputation.
Wells Fargo investors last week gave strong backing to the bank's directors and executives on Tuesday, indicating confidence in its overhauled leadership to rebound.
Buffett addressed his alliance with another banker, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co's Jamie Dimon, and Amazon's Jeff Bezos to tackle healthcare. Buffett said U.S. healthcare costs are a tapeworm on the economy, and he said the venture partners expect to name a chief executive within a couple months.
CASH STOCKPILE
Buffett faces a challenge investing Berkshire's more than $108 billion of cash and equivalents, including for acquisitions, saying his ""phone is not ringing off the hook with good deals.""
Shortly before the meeting, Berkshire ended its more than year-long stretch of falling operating profit, while a new accounting rule caused the conglomerate chaired by Warren Buffett to suffer an overall net loss. Buffett said the net results were not representative of the business.
The accounting change required Berkshire to report unrealized losses in its equity portfolio, which totaled $170.5 billion at year end, regardless of whether it planned to sell those stocks.
Berkshire's net loss was $1.14 billion, compared with profit of $4.06 billion a year earlier. 
But operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses, rose 49 percent to a record $5.29 billion, or about $3,215 per Class A share, higher than the $3,116 per share analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
GIDDY SHAREHOLDERS
Shareholders have been enthusiastic about Berkshire, which sent out slightly more tickets to this year's extravaganza than in 2015, when an estimated 42,000 celebrated Buffett's 50th year at the helm. An even larger audience likely watched online via Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Finance.
Outside the convention center, Berkshire shareholders lined up for prime seats in the middle of the night.
William Robertson, a Scotland native who fights fires and does forestry work in Switzerland, said he lined up at 11:30 p.m. Friday, 7-1/2 hours before doors opened. This year's meeting is his third.

""It gets me first place in the queue, I think when people go to so much effort it shows Warren how important he is for us,"" Robertson said.

Altmaier told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung that a stalled comprehensive U.S.-European trade deal known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) had ""proved to be unrealizable"", but added:
""We should talk about doing something new, such as an understanding concerning selected industrial products.""
This should result in a solution ""in which tariffs overall go down, not up"", he said.
In the run-up to June 1, the date when U.S. President Donald Trump says he will impose steel and aluminum tariffs on the EU unless it makes concessions, Berlin is urging its European partners to show some flexibility and pursue a broad trade deal that benefits both sides.
But some countries are resisting. France, the other half of the motor driving European integration, resents Germany's big trade surplus and wants a tougher EU stance against the U.S. tariffs.

""I strongly warn against recklessly sliding into a spiral of isolation,"" Altmaier said. ""I strongly argue for an agreement with the United States.""

House of Fraser said on Wednesday it would close some of its stores as a condition of securing new funds from Chinese retailer C.banner (HK:1028), which will become the majority owner of the department store group with a 51 percent stake.
Sportswear chain Sports Direct, which owns 11.1 percent of House of Fraser, said on Saturday that it had applied to London's High Court for an injunction requiring House of Fraser to provide a copy of its corporate plan and other information.
""We have been frozen out by House of Fraser. Their dealings in China are opaque, and it is blatant that we have been unfairly prejudiced,"" Sports Direct's head of strategic investments, Liam Rowley, said.
A representative of House of Fraser was not immediately available for comment.
C.banner, a major retailer of mid-range to premium footwear brands in China, bought famous London toy shop Hamleys in 2015.

OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett lost money but had a pretty good quarter.
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) on Saturday reported an unusual quarterly net loss, the result of an accounting change that Buffett had warned would produce ""wild"" but in his view meaningless swings in results.
But Berkshire also ended a long stretch of disappointing operating performance, posting record operating profit as insurance rebounded from a difficult quarter while economic growth bolstered results in railroad, industrial and consumer businesses.
Berkshire posted a first-quarter net loss of $1.14 billion, or $692 per Class A share, compared with net income of $4.06 billion, or $2,469 per share, a year earlier.
The accounting change required Berkshire to report $6.2 billion of unrealized losses in its marketable stock portfolio, which totaled $170.5 billion at year end, regardless of whether it planned to sell those stocks.
Two of Berkshire's biggest stock investments,  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO), had tough first quarters, falling 13.6 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively.
Buffett has called the new accounting rule a ""nightmare"" that would produce ""truly wild and capricious swings"" in bottom-line results that could, depending on their direction, unnecessarily scare or embolden investors.
""It really is not representative of what's going on in the business at all,"" Buffett told shareholders at Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.
Berkshire said its operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 49 percent to $5.29 billion, or about $3,215 per Class A share, from $3.56 billion, or $2,163 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts, on average, expected operating profit of about $3,116 per Class A share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Operating profit had previously fallen for five straight quarters, and missed Wall Street forecasts for eight straight.
Book value, which measures assets minus liabilities, also took a hit from falling stock prices, falling 0.3 percent to $211,184 per Class A share, even though Buffett boosted his stake in Apple Inc (O:AAPL) by $12.5 billion in the quarter.
Some analysts have said the stock losses have weighed on Berkshire shares, which are 10 percent below their record highs set on Jan. 29. In Friday trading, the Class A shares closed at$292,600, and the Class B shares at $195.64.
Buffett, 87, and Vice Chairman Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 94, are answering five hours of questions from shareholders, journalists and analysts at the annual meeting.
PLENTY OF CASH
Despite the Apple purchase, Berkshire ended the quarter with $108.6 billion of cash and equivalents, giving Buffett ammunition to make one or more ""huge"" non-insurance acquisitions he has said he wants.
Berkshire's insurance businesses, which had been struggled with losses from hurricanes and other events, posted a $407 million underwriting profit, compared with a year earlier $267 million loss.
Buffett said the Geico car insurer had ""quite a good-sized turnaround in profitability."" Pre-tax underwriting gains nearly quadrupled, as it sold more policies despite having raised rates, while the rate of policyholder losses fell.
""The trends look pretty good,"" Tony Nicely, Geico's chief executive, told Reuters on Friday. ""The number of claims are down somewhat. Yet the costs keep going up.""
An improving economy led to higher business volume at the BNSF railroad, which saw profit rise 37 percent to $1.15 billion.

Pretax profit at industrial businesses such as Precision Castparts rose 32 percent, while lower taxes helped boost profit at the Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit by 22 percent.

VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (Reuters) - A powerful Atlas 5 rocket was poised for liftoff early on Saturday from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, carrying to Mars the first robotic NASA lander designed entirely for exploring the deep interior of the red planet.
The Mars InSight probe was due to blast off from the central California coast at 4:05 a.m. PDT (1105 GMT), creating a luminous predawn spectacle of the first U.S. interplanetary spacecraft to be launched over the Pacific.
The lander will be carried aloft for NASA and its Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) atop a two-stage, 19-story Atlas 5 rocket from the fleet of United Launch Alliance, a partnership of  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.
The payload will be released about 90 minutes after launch on a 301 million-mile (484 million km) flight to Mars. It is due to reach its destination in six months, landing on a broad, smooth plain close to the planet's equator called the Elysium Planitia.
That will put InSight roughly 373 miles (600 km) from the 2012 landing site of the car-sized Mars rover Curiosity.
The new 800-pound (360-kg) spacecraft marks the 21st U.S.-launched Martian exploration, dating to the Mariner fly-by missions of the 1960s. Nearly two dozen other Mars missions have been launched by other nations.
Once settled, the solar-powered InSight will spend two years - about one Martian year - plumbing the depths of the planet's interior for clues to how Mars took form and, by extension, the origins of the Earth and other rocky planets.
InSight's primary instrument is a French-built seismometer, designed to detect the slightest vibrations from ""marsquakes"" around the planet. The device, to be placed on the surface by the lander's robot arm, is so sensitive it can measure a seismic wave just one-half the radius of a hydrogen atom.
Scientists expect to see a dozen to 100 marsquakes over the course of the mission, producing data to help them deduce the depth, density and composition of the planet's core, the rocky mantle surrounding it and the outermost layer, the crust.
The Viking probes of the mid-1970s were equipped with seismometers, too, but they were bolted to the top of the landers, a design that proved largely ineffective.
Apollo missions to the moon brought seismometers to the lunar surface as well, detecting thousands of moonquakes and meteorite impacts. But InSight is expected to yield the first meaningful data on planetary seismic tremors beyond Earth.
Insight also will be fitted with a German-made drill to burrow as much as 16 feet (5 meters) underground, pulling behind it a rope-like thermal probe to measure heat flowing from inside the planet.
Meanwhile, a special transmitter on the lander will send radio signals back to Earth, tracking Mars' subtle rotational wobble to reveal the size of the planet's core and possibly whether it remains molten.

Hitching a ride aboard the same rocket that launches InSight will be a pair of miniature satellites called CubeSats, which will fly to Mars on their own paths behind the lander in a first deep-space test of that technology.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Friday that former Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn, indicted on four felony charges in Detroit in the company's diesel emissions scandal, is a fugitive who faces a U.S. arrest warrant.
As long as Winterkorn remains in Germany, the U.S. warrant is unlikely to have practical impact because Germany does not extradite its citizens to the United States. 
Winterkorn, 70, a German citizen, was indicted in March on fraud and conspiracy charges, but the case was only unsealed on Thursday. 
David Ashenfelter, a spokesman for the U.S. District Court in Detroit, confirmed a warrant for Winterkorn's arrest was issued. 
Nicole Navas Oxman, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said on Friday, ""Martin Winterkorn remains a fugitive."" A Volkswagen spokeswoman declined to comment, except to reiterate that the company is still cooperating.
""We are surprised at the charge,"" a lawyer for Winterkorn, Felix Doerr, told German news outlet Handelsblatt.
A grand jury in Detroit has indicted nine people in connection with the diesel emissions scandal. Two former VW executives have pleaded guilty and been sentenced prison terms, while a former manager of VW’s Audi unit, Giovanni Pamio, 61, an Italian citizen, has been charged and remains in Germany pending extradition.
The remaining six, including Winterkorn, are believed to be in Germany and are unlikely to face U.S. charges. Prosecutors in Germany are also investigating the VW emissions issue.
The September 2015 disclosure that VW intentionally cheated on emissions tests for at least six years using secret software led to Winterkorn's ouster, damaged the company’s reputation around the world and prompted massive bills.

In total, VW has agreed to spend more than $25 billion in the United States to address claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers and offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal investigators were assigned last year to monitor Southwest Airlines' (N:LUV) maintenance operations, the Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday, after whistleblower complaints of mistreatment of mechanics raised safety concerns.
The agency found no rule violations, it said, and the assignment of additional inspectors was standard practice to preclude any deterioration in maintenance.
The FAA issued a statement on the incident as investigations continue on last month's midair engine fan blade blowout on a Southwest plane that killed a passenger. The two incidents are unrelated.
The FAA, which oversees U.S. civil aviation, investigated Southwest in 2017 after employee reports that airline management had discouraged maintenance workers from reporting mechanical issues. 
The investigation at the time found that some management practices were being used to ""influence a relaxing of standards, to look the other way, or to gain a degree of approval through a leniency of standards."" The agency said the additional scrutiny ended at an unspecified date.
In response to inquiries regarding the matter on Friday, the FAA said: ""The Federal Aviation Administration investigated the whistleblower complaints against Southwest Airlines and found no violations of Federal Aviation Regulations.
""However, investigators raised concerns that the strained relationship between the company and mechanics might potentially affect safety. As a precaution, the FAA assigned additional inspectors to monitor the company's maintenance operations. This is standard protocol during contentious labor negotiations and other situations that warrant increased scrutiny.""
Southwest and its mechanics had been locked in acrimonious contract negotiations for the last five years. In April, they reached an agreement in principle toward formalizing a five-year deal.
In a statement on Friday, Southwest pushed back against the FAA findings.
""Southwest’s Culture of Safety does not align with the comments made by the individual FAA employee who conducted the investigation. Nothing is more important in our business than Safety and, as such, compliance is always our theme,"" the carrier said.

A representative for the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, Bret Oestreich, said: ""The culture of safety in airlines has really deteriorated. The airlines are more concerned about the stockholders and the on-time performance over safety.""

(Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc can depose Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's services chief Eddy Cue in addition to Chief Executive Tim Cook, a magistrate judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California ruled on Friday, part of the chipmaker's effort to determine whether Apple worked with Samsung to focus regulatory scrutiny on Qualcomm.
The access to Cue is important because Qualcomm alleges talks between executives at Apple and its rival Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd were central to its decision to cut off Apple from a stream of nearly $1 billion in licensing rebate payments. 
Apple sued Qualcomm early last year, contesting the San Diego-based chipmaker's licensing practices and asking for those rebate payments back. Qualcomm then sued Apple for patent infringement in several countries. As part of the disputes, Qualcomm is also seeking to ban the import of some iPhones it believes are violating its patents.
In the lawsuit in Southern California filed by Apple, Qualcomm has alleged that at a conference in Idaho in 2015, a top Apple executive encouraged Samsung to ""get aggressive"" in asking South Korean antitrust regulators to pursue action against the chipmaker. 
Cook and Cue are regular attendees of a media mogul conference held each year in Sun Valley, Idaho. The Apple executive in question, Qualcomm alleged, explained that a regulatory ruling on Samsung's home turf would be Samsung's ""best chance"" to force Qualcomm to change its licensing practices.
Qualcomm did not name the Apple executive cited in its filings. However, the conversation between Apple and Samsung is important because Qualcomm alleges it amounted to Apple ""wrongfully inducing"" a regulatory action against Qualcomm.
Qualcomm said such a move violated a cooperation agreement it had with Apple and that it stopped sending rebate payments to Apple because of that and other violations of the agreement.
Apple has argued in court filings that it cooperated with requests from regulators and that Qualcomm improperly retaliated against it for doing so. 
Though Qualcomm is known as a chipmaker, its profit has been driven by a patent licensing business. Some of Qualcomm's practices caused conflicts with customers such as Apple and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], as well as with regulators in China, Korea and the United States. Qualcomm has begun changing some of those practices to become more ""regulator friendly,"" its executives have said.

Apple declined to comment, and Samsung and Qualcomm did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

791,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2018 07:05PM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank to move NY headquarters from Wall Street,"(Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) will shift its New York headquarters from Wall Street to a location midtown, at a time when Germany's largest bank is scaling back its U.S. operations. 
The bank will relocate to One Columbus Circle from 60 Wall Street, according to an internal memo to employees.
The move is expected to start in the third quarter of 2021 and will be completed in 2022, according to a source familiar with the matter.
The new location will consolidate the bank's New York presence and would reduce its commercial presence in the city by 30 percent, according to the memo.
Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said last month that the bank would cut back bond and equities trading and would invest in German retail banking and asset management in Europe. 

The bank is expected to cut around 1,000 jobs or 10 percent of its workforce in the United States, Reuters reported last month.

792,By Investing.com,"<span>May 04, 2018 04:53PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com – Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week
1. Earnings Bonanza Fails to Prevent US Stocks From Weekly Slide 
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA),  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP),  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) and  Alibaba  Group Holdings Ltd (NYSE:BABA) were a few of the notable names that reported quarterly earnings this past week, attracting the bulk of investor attention.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) eased investor concerns after posting quarterly earnings that topped Wall Street estimates, and revealed iPhone sales numbers that were not as bearish as many had feared.
Yet, the best was saved for the final trading day of week as Apple’s stock hit all-time highs amid reports Warren Buffett increased his stake in the iPhone maker.
Tesla’s earnings call, meanwhile, drew more attention than its quarterly report – which showed a record first-quarter loss – after CEO Elon Musk refused to answer a raft of 'bonehead questions' from analysts. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell sharply following the earnings call.
Quarterly earnings reports from both Snap and Spotify failed to impress Wall Street, triggering a sharp selloff in both shares.
Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd (NYSE:BABA), meanwhile, ended the week strongly, closing 3.5% higher after revealing bumper revenues that topped consensus estimates.
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones posted a weekly loss.
2. Crude Oil Prices: Up, Up and Away
Crude oil prices settled at three-and-a-half-year highs on Friday, riding a wave of bullish bets on the U.S. imposing new sanctions on Iran next week, raising the potential for tighter global crude stockpiles.
U.S. President Donald Trump is widely expected pull out of the Iranian nuclear on May 12, leading to the re-imposition of secondary sanctions on Iran, pressuring countries to cut their purchases of Iranian crude.
Focus on the prospect of lower global supplies has dominated flows in oil prices this week, overshadowing a second-straight weekly build in U.S. crude supplies amid an ongoing expansion in output.
On Friday U.S. crude futures rose 1.89% to settle at $69.72 a barrel.
3. Full Steam Ahead: Dollar Hits Highs
The dollar added to last week’s gains on its way to its highest level of the year underpinned by the prospect of further rate hikes and a slump in the both the pound and euro.
The greenback navigated its way through a raft of top-tier economic data including a widely expected unchanged Federal Reserve interest rate decision and a mixed U.S. jobs report.
The U.S. economy created 164,000 in April, missing economists’ forecast of 189,000, while wage growth also fell short of expectations despite a steeper than expected decline in the unemployment rate.
The Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold on Wednesday but signalled that inflation was nearing its 2% target, cementing the prospect of a June rate hike.
Both GBP/USD and the EUR/USD were largely supportive of the dollar rally this past week, after both pairs posted a third weekly loss in a row.
The dollar traded close to year-to-date highs against a basket of major currencies on Friday.
4. Sell Gold in May and Go Away?
Gold prices made a tame start to May, falling for the third-straight week as demand fell in the wake of a stronger dollar and limited safe-haven demand.
Gold prices struggled to attract safe-haven bids despite the prospect of new U.S. sanctions on Iran, and renewed focus on U.S.-China trade after a U.S. financial delegation left Beijing without making any big breakthroughs following trade talks.
5. Bitcoin: Traders Ready to Bet the ‘Next Guy Pays More’
Following its best start to the year in April, bitcoin continued to tease further inflows as it eyed another crack at a key $10,000 price level.
The recent turn in sentiment on cryptocurrencies emerged as traders appeared willing to hold, or “hodl” bullish bets, underpinning a move in bitcoin on Friday to a nearly two month high of $9,875.
Traders pointed to signs of institutional demand for the popular digital currency as a supportive factor amid reports that Goldman Sachs was on the cusp of opening its bitcoin trading operation.
The Wall Street bank’s first ever ""digital assets"" division, spearheaded by trader Justin Schmidt, reportedly will begin operations within the next few weeks.
This added to expectations for a ramp up in institutional demand after famed investor George Soros was reported to be eyeing an entry into the market last month.
But as institutional demand for bitcoin heats up, the popular crypto continued to attract its fair share of detractors.
Legendary investor Warren Buffet claimed recently bitcoin investors were making a “gamble,” not an investment as their rationale for investing was mainly based on “hoping the next guy pays more.”
Institutional demand is widely seen as a crucial step to legitimise bitcoin as an asset class capable of competing with traditional assets for a space in institutional investors’ portfolios.
Over the past seven days, Bitcoin rose 5.96% on the Bitfinex exchange, Ethereum rose 18.08%, while Ripple XRP rose 7.34% on the Poloniex exchange."

795,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2018 07:03PM ET</span>",Foes of market data fee hikes encouraged by SEC scrutiny,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A recent move by U.S. securities regulators demanding stock exchanges do a better job justifying price changes for public market data feeds could lead to more transparency around data costs, the head of one of the world's largest trading firms said on Friday.
Wall Street firms and industry groups have complained for more than a decade, with little effect, that market data fees charged by stock exchanges are too high and that regulators rubber stamp the exchanges' data price increases. 
But on Tuesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the first time repealed two data price changes by exchanges, giving hope to some in the market that increased regulatory scrutiny around data pricing will help keep those prices in check.
""When we started down this path a couple of years ago just questioning the need for market data increases, I certainly felt a little bit like Don Quixote, you know, tilting into the windmill,"" said Doug Cifu, chief executive officer of Virtu Financial. 
Market data contains key information on quotes and orders and is the lifeblood of the electronic marketplace. 
The data fees changes the SEC repealed are for public feeds for Nasdaq- and New York Stock Exchange-listed securities. Those data feeds are essential for trading and brought in nearly $400 million in revenue last year for U.S. securities exchanges, which collectively govern them.
While the fee changes would not have raised revenues for the exchanges overall, at least one firm could have seen a steep price increase, with the monthly cap on how much any single firm must pay for the essential data rising to $1,260,000, from $686,400. 
The exchanges said the change was needed because firms could merge, hit the monthly cap sooner, and pay less in fees. 
For context, in September, TD Ameritrade bought Scottrade, combining two of the largest online brokerages, both of which use the data.
The SEC said the exchanges did not give enough information on why they were making the fee changes, raising ""questions as to whether the changes will result in fees that are fair and reasonable, not unreasonably discriminatory,"" the SEC said.

""The move is seen by many brokers and electronic market makers as an indication that the SEC is focused on reining in the data fees that exchanges collect from their customers,"" said Doug Clark, a managing director at brokerage Investment Technology Group, in a note to clients.

801,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2018 04:31PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Redstone makes concessions on Viacom CEO in bid to clinch CBS deal - sources,"By Jessica Toonkel
(Reuters) - Shari Redstone, the media heiress whose family controls CBS Corp (N:CBS) and Viacom Inc (O:VIAB), has offered CBS CEO Leslie Moonves to drop her demands for Viacom CEO Bob Bakish to be his No. 2 following a merger, as long as Bakish sits on the combined company's board, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The offer is an attempt by Redstone to resolve an impasse in the deal negotiations. Redstone has been trying to put together a deal that will keep Moonves, a 68-year-old media industry veteran credited with turning CBS around, at the helm, while positioning up-and-coming Bakish, 54, as Moonves' successor.
CBS shares rose 8 percent after Reuters first reported Redstone's offer, giving the company a market value of $20 billion. Viacom shares were up 5 percent, giving it a value of $12.6 billion. 
Moonves has agreed to run the combined company for at least two years, as long as CBS Chief Operating Officer Joseph Ianniello will be president and chief operating officer of the combined company, so he can succeed him, sources have previously said.
Redstone, daughter of media mogul Sumner Redstone, has offered not to give Bakish any executive role in the combined company, but still wants him to sit on the board of directors and eventually succeed Moonves, the sources said on Friday. 
Moonves does not want Bakish to be part of the combined company at all - either as an executive or board member - because he is seeking as much autonomy as possible in running the combined company, said one of the sources.
    As a result of the impasse over Bakish's role, CBS executives have serious doubts that a deal will happen, the source said. CBS and Viacom have also disagreed about the stock exchange ratio that should be used in a merger, although the two sides are making progress on that front, the sources added.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. CBS, Viacom, and National Amusements Inc, the company of Shari Redstone, declined to comment.
Redstone offered her concessions earlier this week in a meeting with Moonves that included Richard Parsons, who recently joined the CBS board and is acting as a conduit between the two sides, the sources said.
There has not been any agreement about the composition of a combined company's board, the sources said. 
     Ten of the 14 director nominees for consideration at this year's CBS annual meeting are 70 or older. The average age is 72. The average for companies in the S&P 500 Index as a whole is 62. Two of Viacom's directors are 70 or older, according to the company's proxy statement.
REUNITING AFTER SPLIT?
CBS and Viacom set up special board committees to explore a merger in February, a move that would reunite the companies split by Sumner Redstone more than a decade ago. The merger would combine CBS's television network, local TV stations and Showtime cable network with Viacom’s cable networks, including MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, as well as its Paramount Pictures film studio.
CBS and Viacom also explored a merger in 2016, instigated again by the Redstone family, but those talks ended unsuccessfully, due to concerns by CBS about price and governance issues.
Since then, many of Viacom and CBS's competitors have combined, as scale becomes more important in the media business, with more customers cancelling pricey cable contracts and Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) spending billions of dollars on making shows and movies.
AT&T Inc (N:T) is seeking to buy  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX), pending a judge's ruling on a Department of Justice lawsuit to block the deal. Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) announced in December it would buy the majority of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's (O:FOXA) assets. Discovery Communications recently acquired Scripps Networks Interactive Inc (O:SNI). 
In their price negotiations, Viacom last month asked for 0.68 CBS shares for each Viacom class B share, the sources said at the time. CBS had offered 0.55 of its shares for each Viacom class B share, sources have said.
CBS reported first-quarter earnings on Thursday that topped revenue and profit estimates. Last month, Viacom reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue.

""The strategy that we have laid out for you is clearly working and the good news is that there is much more to come,"" Moonves said on a call with analysts on Thursday.

802,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2018 03:21PM ET</span>",Exclusive: World's biggest gold ETF launching new low-fee fund - source,"By Peter Hobson
LONDON (Reuters) - The World Gold Council, owner of the world's largest gold-backed exchange traded fund (ETF), is launching a new fund with a cut-price management fee to fend off rivals with lower charges, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The move is a sign that cost competition among gold ETFs is heating up after a price war in the much larger equities ETF sector slashed management fees. Gold ETFs allow buyers to invest in physical gold without having to buy and store the metal.
The council's SPDR Gold Trust (P:GLD), which launched in 2004 and trades using the ticker GLD, dominates the industry but its share of total bullion held by gold-backed funds has slipped below 50 percent from 75 percent at the start of the decade, Reuters data show. <0#ETFHLD=XAU> 
GLD's gold holdings have risen 5 percent since the start of last year while rival iShares Gold Trust (P:IAU), which is run by investment manager BlackRock (N:BLK) with a lower management fee, has grown 47 percent, by far the fastest growth among the five biggest gold ETFs tracked by Reuters.
Other low-fee funds such as Deutsche Asset Management's Xtrackers Physical Gold ETC (L:XGLD) are growing rapidly and others such as GraniteShares (BAR), launched last year, are popping up. 
GLD charges a fee of 40 basis points, or 0.4 percent, of the value of an investment, around the higher end of the market, while iShares Gold and Xtrackers take 25 basis points and GraniteShares 20 basis points, near the bottom.
(Graphic: iShares rises - https://reut.rs/2rjqukm)
The council's new fund will charge a fee of around 25 basis points, said the source, describing it as a ""countermove"" by the council to rivals' gains. 
The source said the council's two funds were designed to appeal to different audiences, with the new product targeted at investors looking to buy and hold gold who want a low management fee, and GLD aimed at financial investors who use its scale and liquidity to trade in and out of positions cheaply. 
""The idea is that the new product grows without damaging the existing product,"" the source said.
The World Gold Council declined to comment.
To keep the offerings separate, shares in the new fund will represent a smaller allocation of gold than shares in GLD. This smaller share size will make it more expensive to move in and out of positions, encouraging financial investors to stick with SPDR, the source said.

803,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",MarketAxess allows Pimco to trade by its own rules,"By Davide Scigliuzzo
NEW YORK (IFR) - MarketAxess has granted Pimco a special arrangement that allows the bond giant to limit the information it shares on the electronic trading platform and take advantage of any off-market prices, three sources with knowledge of the matter told IFR.
The arrangement, which has been in place for at least three years but is largely unknown outside the close-knit dealer community, allows Pimco to block the transmission of the so-called covers for trades it executes on the platform.
A cover is the second-best price at which an investor could have executed a particular trade after soliciting simultaneous bids from competing dealers.
The concession granted to Pimco isn't prohibited, but it has raised eyebrows among some market participants, as it gives the firm a prerogative that is not readily available to the platform's more than 1,000 other institutional investor clients.
MarketAxess declined to respond to detailed questions about its relationship with Pimco and the platform's set-up. A spokeswoman for Pimco similarly declined to comment.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees alternative trading systems, did not respond to requests for comment. A representative for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which regulates broker-dealers, declined to comment.
Some critics see the agreement as another example of the considerable sway that the largest institutional investors hold in the US$8trn US corporate bond market - from commanding larger allocations on new bond sales to calling the shots in debt restructurings.
NEW PLATFORMS
Despite their growth, electronic platforms only absorb around 17% of the total trading volume in US corporate bonds, according to consulting firm Greenwich Associates. Most transactions are still negotiated over the phone, email or instant messenger.
Electronic trading providers have sought to establish themselves as the disruptors of what they see as an antiquated and inefficient market structure, promising market participants increased liquidity and a level playing field.
Such platforms typically earn commissions on each trade executed on their systems as well as membership fees from some of their members.
MarketAxess is by far the largest player in e-trading of US corporate bonds, with a market share of 86% last year, according to data from Greenwich.
Tradeweb - which is majority owned by IFR's parent company Thomson Reuters - and Bloomberg trail with shares of 6% and 5% respectively.
Tough post-financial-crisis rules have made it more costly for banks to hold bond inventory and the resulting reduction in market liquidity has accelerated an investor shift to electronic trading in recent years.
MarketAxess saw nearly US$1trn of US corporate bonds change hands on its platform in 2017, up 77% from 2014, while its stock has roughly quadrupled in value over the past four years.
PLEASING PIMCO
While other large asset managers initially sought to develop their own platforms, Pimco traditionally resisted the move to electronic trading in corporate bonds.
""Pimco didn't really do any electronic trading. They were voice traders,"" one of the sources, who is a former trader, told IFR.
Pimco has a long-standing practice of declining to disclose the cover bid, regardless of whether a deal is negotiated over the phone or through other means, according to traders who have done business with the firm.
That practice stands in contrast with what the traders described as the standard market practice of providing the winning dealer with information about the cover.
By declining to provide that information, they say, Pimco makes it harder for dealers to get a sense of how their levels compare with the rest of the market. That allows the firm potentially to exploit any gaps by seeking to trade more with the same off-market dealer.
Pimco's unwillingness to provide cover levels posed an issue for MarketAxess, whose platform had been programmed to automatically display covers under its popular request-for-quotes RFQ trading protocol, two of the sources said.
As a condition for trading on the platform, Pimco requested - and obtained - that MarketAxess block the transmission of cover information for all its trades under the RFQ protocol, according to the two sources.
""Pimco demanded that MarketAxess - for all of their inquiries - removed a function that disseminated to the dealer with the winning bid what the cover was,"" one of the two sources told IFR.
""I was told that they were doing this specifically for Pimco and not for everybody else.""
MarketAxess's decision to accommodate Pimco's request did not sit well with some market participants, who argue the special treatment is at odds with the platform's objective of becoming the marketplace of choice for electronic credit trading.
""You are violating the trust that everybody has the same rules in the sandbox,"" the same source said.
A third source noted that the fact that MarketAxess provided covers automatically for all its clients was one of the key incentives for many dealers to join the platform in the first place.
IFR was unable to determine whether any other firms have requested - or obtained - the same treatment from MarketAxess following the deal with Pimco.
The decision to accede to Pimco's request to hide cover bids was never publicized and there is no option on the platform that allows any user to decide whether to provide covers on trades, the three sources said.
A spokesman for Tradeweb declined to confirm whether his company similarly allows certain clients to decline to display covers, while a representative from Bloomberg was not available to comment.
UNDER COVER
Because firms responding to an RFQ don't see each other's levels in the process, the cover information is viewed by some as precious because it offers the winner a glimpse into where the closest competitor stood.
""It gives you a sense of your chance of exit, an idea of your potential margin and how far you were from the second-best dealer,"" a trader at a major investment bank told IFR. ""The difference between the winner and everybody else is just that cover.""
While investors have always had the possibility to decide whether to provide covers over the phone, the majority choose to do so as that helps dealers calibrate their responses and, ultimately, make markets.
""Most accounts who transact with regularity in the corporate bond market are trying to be decent partners and are happy to allow that information to go back to the dealer,"" a trader at another major institution said.
""We use cover information to try to improve our performance on subsequent inquiries.""
Many investors who discussed the matter with IFR said they believe covers are so important for market liquidity that they would continue to display them even if they had the option not to do so.

""I love the cover,"" one buyside trader told IFR. ""That type of transparency is good. That is how the platform should work.""

(Reuters) - The CME will launch next week futures based on a new benchmark rate published by the Federal Reserve, but investors may be slow to embrace them after unexpected volatility and a calculation error led to a rocky start for the new rate.
The CME Group’s (O:CME) launch of the contracts tracking the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, is part of a multi-year effort to move around $200 trillion in U.S.-dollar based derivatives and loans away from the use of the London interbank offered rate (Libor) as a benchmark. Cleared interest rate swaps based on the rate are also slated for this year.
Regulators including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell have warned that Libor could pose systemic risks in the event it stops being published due to the sheer size of markets based on the rate.
Still investors are also not yet comfortable with SOFR, which the New York Federal Reserve only began publishing on April 3.
“It doesn’t feel like there is a great reason to get involved whole hog right away with these futures,” said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies in New York.
Libor is fragile as a decline in loans between banks means that borrowing rates are often estimated and not transaction-based. The benchmark also lost credibility after revelations that banks manipulated Libor submissions, in many cases to boost profits on their derivatives positions.
Analysts have expected SOFR to be more volatile than Libor as it is based on the overnight repurchase agreement market, which can have relatively large fluctuations that include declines in the middle of the month, and spikes at month-end that are exaggerated at quarter- and year-end.
Still, the rate has remained more elevated than many expected despite the Treasury’s repayment of Treasury bills as it received tax payments in April.(New reference rate has a choppy start: https://reut.rs/2rkqxMX)
“There is still a lot of volatility in the rate that I think is surprising on a daily basis. I think people don’t really feel like they totally understand it yet,” said Simons.
The New York Fed said on April 16 that forward-settling overnight repo transactions were inadvertently included in data that was provided to the bank to calculate the rate, though that problem has since been rectified.
Futures based on SOFR are expected to help develop a term market on the rate, which does not yet exist as the majority of repo transactions are overnight.
Term rates will offer a view on where the rate is likely to trade at fixed points in the future.
They are also crucial for increasing investor interest in the rate. Most loans and interest rate swaps are based on term rates such as three months.
“You want the market to start forming an opinion of what it will look like in six months or twelve months,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.
However, ""it’s very difficult for people to get a good idea of what this is going to look like in a few months when you really don’t have a good idea of what it's even going to look like in a few weeks,"" Kohli said.
While SOFR, unlike Libor, is based on a robust and liquid market, it remains to be seen whether asset managers will be reluctant to adopt the rate due to the absence of the credit component that Libor offers.
For SOFR to succeed “what we really need is some conviction in the marketplace that this is something that is really going to persist for a long term and that it’s a somewhat efficient way of expressing a view of what the forward rate is going to reset at,” Kohli said.

811,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>",EU states back softer rules tackling unfair airline competition: sources,"By Julia Fioretti
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU ambassadors have backed watered-down proposals to tackle unfair competition from foreign airlines following opposition from some member states to the threat of revoking flying rights across the bloc, six people familiar with the matter said. 
European Union members are considering a legislative proposal that would allow EU governments or airlines to submit complaints to the European Commission about any alleged discriminatory practices they face in non-EU countries or illegal subsidies benefiting non-EU airlines.
While some countries, such as France and Germany, and the European Parliament, have pushed for airlines' flying rights to be revoked if they are found to be causing injury - or even a threat of injury - to European carriers, other member states have staunchly opposed this.
Flying rights are typically granted on a bilateral basis between governments.
Some EU airlines, notably Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), have long complained about what they see as unfair competition from foreign carriers such as those in the Gulf region - Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways - which they accuse of receiving illegal state subsidies.
The three airlines strongly deny such claims.
Under the text agreed on Friday and which still needs to be endorsed by ministers in June, the prospect of withdrawing traffic rights is explicitly excluded and the possibility of launching an investigation based on a ""threat of injury"" to EU carriers has been removed, three of the people said.
The original Commission proposal did not explicitly exclude the suspension of traffic rights as a possible redressive measure, while the European Parliament included that possibility when it voted on its position in March.
Once ministers give their approval, EU member states will be able to start negotiations with the Parliament to find a final compromise on the draft law.
The version backed by EU ambassadors also gives national governments a say in whether to impose operational penalties on a foreign airline, such as suspending some ground-handling services, whereas the Commission will have the sole authority to impose financial sanctions, the people said.
The investigation period was also shortened to 18 months from the proposed two years.
Furthermore, ""concerned"" countries will be able to ask the Commission to suspend its investigation into a third country or airline for up to 12 months if there are dispute settlement procedures in a bilateral deal between that third country and an EU country that will be exhausted first, one of the people said. 
Some countries had feared the original proposals would interfere with their bilateral arrangements and lead third countries to take retaliatory measures against them.

Some also saw it as a protectionist move to shield uncompetitive European carriers, something the Commission denies.

The global auditor has been under close scrutiny since 2017 over work done for a company owned by the Gupta family -- who have been accused of using their links to former president Jacob Zuma to influence government decisions and the awarding of tenders -- and more recently for small lender VBS Mutual Bank.
The Guptas and Zuma have denied any wrongdoing.
The firm responded by appointing veteran public servant and former chairman of the Development Bank of Southern Africa Wiseman Nkuhlu as its chairman in January and said it was reviewing the work of its partners.
""The IRBA has taken the unusual step of mobilizing a specialized team specifically to do a review of KPMG’s turnaround strategy,"" the IRBA said in a statement. 
The IRBA, which will start the review next week, referred a former KPMG employee to a disciplinary hearing in February over work carried out for Linkway Trading, a project management firm owned by the Gupta family.
Sibanye-Stillwater (J:SGLJ) is the latest company to consider a new auditor, saying on Friday it would start looking for a new auditor to replace KPMG.

This follows a decision by  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Africa (J:BGAJ), one of KPMG's major financial customers and South Africa's second-biggest lender by market value, to join more than 10 other clients, including the government and broker  Sasfin  (J:SFNJ), to break ties with KPMG since 2017.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Aluminum producer  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) Corp said on Friday that management at its Quebec smelter have notified the provincial labor ministry they are ready to resume mediated contract talks with the United Steelworkers union.
The smelter, which produces some 430,000 metric tonnes of aluminum annually, has been operating at reduced capacity by non-union workers since Jan. 11, when 1,030 unionized workers were locked out after their contract expired.
Aluminum markets, roiled for weeks by U.S. sanctions on Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and the massive Rusal aluminum producer he controls, calmed with the extension of a sanctions deadline to Oct. 23. 
Prices, which hit a seven-year high of $2,718 per tonne on April 19, were down at $2,350 a tonne Friday.
The United Steelworkers welcome a return to contract talks, a spokeswoman said.
Union workers rejected the company's final contract offer because it included a new, member-funded pension plan for all workers and concessions on seniority rights, the Steelworkers said.
Quebec appointed lawyer and former politician Lucien Bouchard as special mediator to the talks on April 23, saying it was very concerned about the dispute's economic impact. Bouchard and another mediator, appointed in November, will set dates for future negotiations.

Alcoa, which holds its annual meeting May 9, owns 74.95 percent of the Becancour, Quebec smelter and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) holds the remainder.

817,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2018 03:04PM ET</span>",Air France-KLM CEO to quit after staff reject pay deal,"By Cyril Altmeyer
PARIS (Reuters) - Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac said on Friday he would resign after staff rejected a pay deal, plunging the airline into turmoil amid a wave of strikes at its French brand that has cost the company 300 million euros ($359 million).
In the job for less than two years, Janaillac had been battling to cut costs at the French national carrier to keep up with competition from Gulf carriers and low-cost airlines. But he ran into the same union resistance as his predecessor, raising questions over the airline's capacity to reform.
Janaillac said he would resign in the days ahead after more than half of the staff at Air France who cast a ballot voted against the offer of a 7 percent increase over four years. 
""This is an enormous mess that will only put a smile on the faces of our competitors,"" Janaillac told a news conference. 
He said he hoped his departure would spark ""a more acute collective awareness"" before leaving without taking questions.
Unions said they would stick with plans to strike on May 7 and May 8. 
Air France-KLM earlier on Friday reined in its 2018 profit and growth expectations, partly due to the effects of the strikes, and said it was not able to take advantage of a good market environment for European carriers.
Air France needs to cut costs to keep up with leaner rivals in Europe. Profits at Dutch sister company KLM, which has cut costs, rose in the first quarter, contrasting sharply with losses at Air France.
Rivals British Airways (L:ICAG) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) have already undergone painful cost-cutting in recent years as they battled to compete with the rise of low-cost carriers in Europe and new competition from Gulf carriers. 
Air France has lagged behind, with unions hampering efforts.
""There is inevitably some pain for staff when structural changes are made, but once that is dealt with, you’re left with a much healthier company,"" said aviation consultant John Strickland. ""That has been proved in the cases of the turnarounds achieved by Iberia and British Airways.""
HIGH-STAKES GAMBLE
Shares in Air France-KLM have tumbled 39 percent so far this year. The French state is Air France-KLM's largest shareholder with a 14 percent stake, ahead of Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) and China Eastern which both hold 9 percent.
""It is up to the board to define how the airline gets itself out of this current crisis,"" the French finance and transport ministries said in a joint statement.
In a high-stakes gamble, Janaillac said before Friday's vote that it would be hard for him to stay in the role if the unions pushed back against the salary offer. His stance was backed by the French government which has previously said the dispute is damaging the company.
The reform-minded CFDT union, the largest in France, said it regretted the vote's outcome as well as Janaillac's decision to quit, but that it would not sign the pay offer in light of the result. A total of ten other unions rejected the offer.
Air France management had offered workers a salary increase of 2 percent in 2018 and a further 5 percent over the following three years. Unions demanded 5 percent this year.
""We were asking 5 percent this year, the company was proposing 2 percent. There is probably an answer to be found somewhere in between,"" Philippe Evain, president of the SNPL pilots union, told news channel TF1. 
Janaillac was appointed CEO of Air France-KLM in June 2016 after his predecessor failed to reform the airline in the face of union resistance.
Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said ahead of the vote result that a rejection of the offer would suggest that Air France was incapable of being reformed. 

""Losing two consecutive CEOs who have taken significantly different approaches to the unions would imply the business is unmanageable,"" Khoo said.

826,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2018 12:28PM ET</span>",Swedish Academy to reform after controversy postpones Nobel prize,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The Swedish Academy which decides the Nobel Prize for Literature said it would not make an award in 2018 and instead focus on internal reforms to restore its reputation in the wake of allegations of sexual harassment and information leaks. 
The scandals have threatened to undermine the credibility of the award and attracted unprecedented scrutiny of the Academy, a highly secretive body whose choices of prize winner fascinate and often baffle literature lovers the world over.
Below are key elements of the controversy and its consequences.
WHAT SPARKED THE CRISIS?
At heart of the row are allegations of sexual assault and harassment made by several women against Jean-Claude Arnault, a photographer and well-known cultural figure in Sweden who is married to poet and Academy member Katarina Frostenson. 
He is also accused of leaking prize-winners' names ahead of their official announcement, a major cultural event which is covered each year by the world's media. 
Arnault denies all the allegations against him, including that of being the source of leaks, his lawyer said. 
State prosecutors are conducting a preliminary investigation of assault allegations against Arnault. Another such investigation, regarding alleged assaults dating between March 2013 and April 2015, was dropped last month due to a lack of evidence and because for some the statute of limitations had passed. 
The allegations made by 18 women against Arnault were first published in Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter in November. The same paper also reported that the Academy had carried out an internal investigation alleging that Arnault had leaked the closely-guarded names of Nobel prize winners on seven different occasions.
The paper said these included Bob Dylan in 2016 as well as French author Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio in 2008 and British playwright Harold Pinter in 2005. 
The Swedish Academy last month acknowledged that names had been leaked though it did not specify which laureates this concerned nor who was the source of the leaks.
WHY DID THE CONTROVERSY CAUSE A RIFT IN THE ACADEMY?
After cutting ties with Arnault, the Academy held a vote on whether to exclude Frostenson from the body for allegedly breaching conflict of interest rules and divulging names of prize winners to her husband, who could then leak them. 
The motion failed, with Frostenson allowed to stay, prompting three of the Academy's 18 members to resign in protest. In the following weeks another three, including the Permanent Secretary of the Academy, Sara Danius and Frostenson herself, also withdrew.
Eight Academy members said in an open letter to a newspaper that they had voted against excluding Frostenson on the grounds that the evidence, some of it from anonymous sources, was insufficient.
Frostenson has so far not commented publicly on the vote and accusations against her. She did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.
WHAT REFORMS ARE UNDERWAY? 
Sweden's king has stepped in to drive reforms of the Swedish Academy, established in 1786 by his forebear Gustav III and of which he is the formal patron.
Appointments to the Academy have been for life and there has been no formal provision under the arcane rules for members to resign. That has meant those who withdrew could not be replaced.
This week, King Carl XVI Gustaf revised the Swedish Academy's rules to allow members resign. The change also means that members who have not participated in the Academy's work for two years will be considered to have resigned.
Other changes are likely in store. In connection with its decision to postpone the prize, the Swedish Academy said it had begun a wide-ranging project to alter the way it conducted its business while still seeking to respect its historic legacy.
Besides the right to resign, procedures for handling conflicts of interest and secret information would be strengthened while its external communication would also be modernized, it said in a statement.
""The active members of the Swedish Academy are of course fully aware that the present crisis of confidence places high demands on a long-term and robust work for change,"" it said.
WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES?
The Academy took the rare decision to postpone the 2018 Nobel literature prize to next year, meaning it will award two prizes in 2019. 
The prize has been postponed or canceled only a handful of times, for instance during World War Two. The most recent postponement was the award to American novelist William Faulkner, who received his 1949 prize a year late, in 1950.
The biggest risk by far is to the reputation of the prize, which has come to be seen as one of the most important international honors in the field of literature.
The Nobel Foundation, which administers the estate of dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel, said the crisis at the Academy had ""adversely affected"" the Nobel Prize.
""Their decision underscores the seriousness of the situation and will help safeguard the long-term reputation of the Nobel Prize,"" the Foundation said in statement.

OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's manufactured housing unit Clayton Homes is borrowing the playbook of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc's longtime chairman as it boosts its bet on a growing market for traditional site-built homes.
Clayton entered the field in 2015, and has grown in larger markets such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Denver and Nashville, and smaller markets including Salt Lake City and Birmingham, Alabama, marketing vice president Carl Hill said on Thursday. 
""We've looked for businesses that have really similar cultural values that happen to be in strong and growing housing markets,"" he said, ahead of Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday.
""Business owners, when they come on board, have a very strong interest in remaining part of the businesses and continuing to run operations, really very similar to the way Berkshire Hathaway has grown through its subsidiaries.""
Site-built homes are still a small part of Clayton's business, with much of its $765 million pretax profit last year coming from its $13.7 billion mortgage portfolio.
Clayton also dominates the manufactured home market, where profit margins are greater, and where it commands a 49 percent share, Buffett said in February.
Such homes are often bought by people with low credit scores, low incomes, and financial profiles that can come undone by divorce or death.
Clayton is trying to move past reports three years ago in the Seattle Times claiming it exploited black, Latino and Native American borrowers into unaffordable subprime loans.
The Maryville, Tennessee-based company has denied those allegations and Buffett has defended Clayton repeatedly, lauding what he called its ""best-in-class"" management group and culture.
Clayton stands to benefit from a bill in Congress that would exempt builders of manufactured homes from lending rules applying elsewhere in the housing market, and let them refer prospective buyers to affiliated lenders.
The U.S. Senate in March passed the White House-backed legislation 67-31, with 16 Democrats voting in favor, and sent it to the House of Representatives.
Supporters believe the bill could spur homebuying and lending, while critics say it could restrict competition and strain lower-income homebuyers through higher borrowing costs.
""We're particularly interested in supporting legislation that makes for a more open and competitive marketplace,"" Hill said.
With U.S. homeownership at a five-decade low, Clayton is targeting homebuyers with a $200,000 budget but who want land - a combination admittedly unattainable in parts of the country.

""There is a deficit of available inventory,"" Hill said. ""A lot of people are having to move into smaller, older homes to get into that price point.""

835,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 04, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>",One of Exxon's Top Women Tests If Big Oil Can Win Big in Shale,"(Bloomberg) --  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM).’s Sara Ortwein has delivered some of the energy industry’s biggest engineering feats over a 38-year career. Her newest challenge: Winning in the nimble, fast-moving world of shale.
Ortwein’s task is as much cultural as technical. Exxon had given the XTO shale unit she runs a long leash to free it from the parent company’s famously exhaustive planning process. Now she’s moving XTO’s headquarters to Exxon’s Houston hub to better blend the unit’s shale know-how with the oil giant’s technical and management expertise.
Exxon was slow to the shale revolution that wildcatters began in 2005. By buying XTO in 2010, it served notice it had arrived. And Ortwein, who started at Exxon drilling wells in East Texas, was named to lead the unit in 2016. She’s one of just three women among the company’s top tier of 25 executives, in an industry long dominated by men.
“It’s a different culture for a different part of the business than a big mega-project,” Ortwein said in an interview. “Bringing it on campus means we can still retain all the experience and expertise of XTO” in shale while getting “the face-to-face benefit” of Exxon’s experts across disciplines.
Ortwein is seen within the company as the perfect leader for such an effort, with a career marked by a string of breakthroughs. Off Russia’s Pacific Coast, she was part of a subsea project that broke multiple drilling records, boasting an 8 miles-long sideways well. She also worked on liquefied natural gas operations in Qatar that were unprecedented in their day, enabling the kingdom to tap one of the world’s largest gas bonanzas.
Now, the pressure is on for Ortwein to deliver once again.
Exxon is struggling with global production declines that are weighing on its stock price. Her portfolio, which includes fast-to-develop wells in the Permian Basin, provides the best opportunity to quickly arrest the output gap, making it the cornerstone of Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods’s 8-year, $230 billion plan to resuscitate Exxon.
She’s orchestrating a big expansion of the company’s rig fleet in the region from 24 in March to 30 by the end of the year. If successful, that’ll make Exxon the region’s top driller.
‘Another Dimension’
“We have the ability if the market changes, upwards or downwards, either to pick up rigs rapidly or lay down rigs if we need to,” Ortwein said. “It adds another dimension to our portfolio.”
The oil and gas industry is still mostly a man’s world but was even more so in the 1980s when Ortwein began her career. That didn’t put her off when she graduated from the University of Texas as a civil engineer.
“I interviewed with a lot of different industries, but I found the oil and gas industry very dynamic,” she said. “I really was drawn to the people, the passion for the business and the pace of the business.”
For greater gender diversity in the industry, society as whole needs to encourage more women and minorities to study science and math “to ensure we are accessing the entire talent pool,” she said.
Notable Successes
There have been some notable recent successes. Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). elevated Vicki Hollub to CEO in April 2016, while  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc both have women CFOs.  BP  (LON:BP) Plc and Shell recently appointed women to lead their U.S. businesses.
Efforts to boost female participation in the industry rely heavily on high-profile executives like Ortwein because they exemplify how women can rise to the top in male-dominated industries, said Katie Mehnert, founder of Houston-based Pink Petro, which promotes gender diversity.
“The first step is to get women in these positions but then we need to socialize it, make it normal,” Mehnert said. “Telling their stories creates a culture of transformation.”
Ortwein was promoted to oversee XTO when oil markets were just starting to recover from the worst crash in a generation. At the time, American crude was trading for about $46 a barrel and Exxon’s U.S. oil and gas wells were in the midst of a two-year run of negative returns.
Now, oil is close to $68 a barrel and production from the Permian has doubled to 3 million barrels a day, which is more than OPEC-member Kuwait. Such is the importance of the field to Exxon that it spent almost $6 billion buying additional drilling rights last year.
The plan is to triple Exxon’s shale production to almost 800,000 barrels a day by 2025, which would be a fifth of the company’s output today. To do that, Ortwein is convinced the XTO will have to incorporate Exxon’s traditional strengths of project management, technology and long-term planning, while preserving its fast-paced no-frills culture.
An example: the Permian’s production has risen so fast that pipeline capacity is scarce, forcing some producers to take lower prices for their oil. To combat this, Ortwein wants to utilize Exxon’s vast Texas infrastructure.
“Connecting the Permian production through the midstream, to the downstream, and chemical gives us a value chain advantage,” she said. “I think it’s a real competitive advantage.”
Ortwein’s rivals aren’t resting easy. Blending XTO’s shale operation into the rest of Exxon will make it a more formidable competitor, said Greg Guidry, the executive vice president who runs Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s shale business.
“I’m much more concerned of XTO as a competitor as being a full part of Exxon than I was when they were separate,” Guidry said. “No question about it.”

Any deal between the coffee giants would not involve any of the Seattle-based chain's more than 28,000 cafes, according to Bloomberg, which reported the news after Swiss financial blog Inside Paradeplatz.
The deal could net Starbucks $3.8 billion after tax, according to Cowen analysts, based on Starbucks' operating earnings excluding its K-Cups and the multiple recently paid for Keurig Green Mountain. They predicted Starbucks would use that to buy back shares.
An agreement will probably be announced on Monday, Bloomberg said. 
Nestle and Starbucks both declined to comment. 
Starbucks, which last week reported a global drop in quarterly traffic to its established cafes, has been revamping its business. It recently sold its Tazo tea brand to  Unilever  (L:ULVR) for $384 million and closed underperforming Teavana retail stores. 
Starbucks previously licensed its business selling packaged coffee to Kraft Foods (NASDAQ:KHC), but ended the agreement in 2011, giving the business to privately held Acosta Inc. 
The cafe chain's partnership with Kraft had been due to end in 2014, but Starbucks sought an early exit and was later forced by an arbitrator to pay $2.76 billion to Kraft, which by then had split into two. The payment went to Mondelez International (O:MDLZ). 

Nestle, also the world's largest packaged food company, has various licensing deals with other companies. Nestle sells General Mills' (N:GIS) Haagen-Dazs brand in the United States and Hershey (N:HSY) sells Nestle's KitKat in the United States.

837,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",Exposed and dependent: Germany desperate to avoid trade war,"By Paul Carrel and Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - As Europe's biggest exporter to the United States and with more than 1 million German jobs at stake, Germany is desperate to avoid a European Union trade war with the United States.
In the run-up to a June 1 deadline for U.S. President Donald Trump to impose steel and aluminum tariffs on the EU, Berlin is urging its European partners to show some flexibility and pursue a broad trade deal that benefits both sides.
But that puts Germany at odds with European peers such as France. Paris, the other half of the motor driving European integration, resents Germany's big trade surplus and wants a tougher EU stance against the U.S. tariffs.
""There is a great danger of slipping into a trade war that way,"" Holger Bingmann, president of Germany's BGA foreign trade association, told Reuters.
Mindful of data from the German-American Chambers of Industry and Commerce that shows more than 1 million German jobs are directly or indirectly dependent on exports to the United States, he cautioned against EU threats of counter tariffs. 
""That way, the Europeans would only embrace the logic of protectionists,"" he said.
The European Commission has said the EU will set duties on 2.8 billion euros ($3.36 billion) of U.S. exports, including peanut butter and denim jeans, if its metals exports to the United States, worth 6.4 billion euros, are subject to tariffs.
Berlin is pushing the idea of an agreement to lower tariffs across a broad spectrum of products, especially in manufacturing. 
""We can negotiate again ... but we should talk about all industrial tariffs,"" said a senior German official.
A French official said there must first be a permanent and unconditional exemption for the EU from the steel and aluminum tariffs, adding: ""That's the prerequisite for any other option.""
Such differences risk driving EU countries apart, weakening their bargaining position with Trump - playing into his hands as he tries to make U.S. businesses more competitive globally.
German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Wednesday that finding a common stance with France and formulating an offer to the United States were ""equally difficult"".
So far, Germany and France's differences have largely been hidden behind the EU position that Washington must give it a permanent exemption from the steel an aluminum tariffs.
But as the June 1 deadline nears, EU trade ministers must resolve their differences quickly to give European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom a clear mandate for negotiations with the U.S. administration.
""BUILD BETTER CARS""
Concerned that a tit-for-tat escalation of tariffs could affect them next, German carmakers are trying to mitigate their exposure to any trade war.
BMW has quietly stopped exporting its X3 offroader from the United States to China, retooling its factory in Shenyang, China to produce the X3 model locally. The X3 is now also produced at a plant in Rosslyn, South Africa. 
But any switch from one factory to another is costly, takes months to plan and implement, and is taken with a long-term view, BMW board member Peter Schwarzenbauer said.
""We have to make decisions, like about factories in Spartanburg (South Carolina) or factories in Mexico, which are based on a horizon of 20 to 30 years,"" he told Reuters in March.
""If we were to change our strategy whenever a tweet comes out, we would get crazy,"" he added.
Tensions around the car sector have been stoked on both sides of the Atlantic. 
In January 2017, when he was president-elect, Trump complained there were many Mercedes-Benz luxury cars visible on New York streets and threatened to impose a border tax of 35 percent on vehicles imported to the United States.
Sigmar Gabriel, then Germany's economy minister, replied that the United States should ""build better cars"".
Gabriel's comments reflect the pride Germans feel in the quality products their country exports, a post-war success that has helped them regain respect and recognition abroad.
SURPLUS TENSION
Yet the surpluses this success has brought are a bone of contention that affect Germany's relations with its peers.
France has complained for years about Germany's current account surplus -- a measure of the flow of goods, services and investments -- which was the world's largest for the second year running in 2017.
The head of the International Monetary Fund said in January the build-up of large current account surpluses in countries such as Germany was partly responsible for the rise of protectionism elsewhere.
France wants Germany to steer its surplus towards economically weaker southern Europe and raise domestic investment to reduce the surplus. 
So too does the IMF and the United States, hoping that an increase in investment would stimulate domestic demand in Germany and help boost imports from its trading partners.
German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz presented government finance plans on Wednesday that showed investment rising this year and next, before decreasing through to 2022 to below the 2017 level.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed trade with Trump in Washington last week but there was no sign of a breakthrough. 
In 2017, German exports to the United States reached 112 billion euros, more than twice the next biggest EU country, Britain, according to the Eurostat statistics office.
""Germany's problem is a lack of realism with respect to its own fragile strategic situation,"" said Jan Techau, a director at The German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think tank.
He said Berlin also showed a lack of awareness of the consequences of its economic policies and failed to realize ""its own strategic long-term interests are largely similar to those of the U.S.""

""We have decided to rationalize our U.S. oil and gas investment banking coverage footprint which will include closing our Houston office,"" the memo said.
The move would likely affect around 50 people employed in covering oil and gas, according to a source familiar with the matter.

NEW YORK (LPC) - The US leveraged loan market has nearly doubled in size in the last five years to a US$1trn asset class from a small private market despite feeling the full weight of regulatory pressure in the aftermath of the credit crisis, and is poised to set new records as regulation is rolled back. 
Agencies have dictated everything from the way financings should be structured to the type of investments portfolio managers can buy in the five years since revised Leveraged Lending Guidance was introduced in 2013, but a softer regulatory touch could take the asset class to new highs. 
President Donald Trump has promised to dismantle the massive 2010 Dodd-Frank bill, which was introduced under President Barack Obama and banned banks from speculating with their own money as well as creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
With new heads at the regulatory agencies, a Republican majority in Congress and some help from a US Appeals Court, aiding Trump’s plans, an unfettered market could turbocharge US leveraged lending. 
“Many of the regulations put in place back in the wake of Dodd-Frank, all of those things were largely reactions to much larger issues than just the loan market – loans got swept up while not being the primary target,” said Elliot Ganz, general counsel at the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA). 
Companies including American Airlines and Four Seasons Hotels rely on the leveraged loan market to back acquisitions and finance their operations. Investors are drawn to the floating debt in a rising-rate environment as they are paid a set coupon over Libor, and yields rise as rates rise. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has increased rates six times since December 2015.
The market has nearly doubled in size, buoyed by breakneck buyside growth including US$117bn of Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) fund issuance and US$12.5bn of loan mutual fund inflows in 2017, which comfortably absorbed a record US$923.8bn of US institutional loan issuance, despite the tougher regulatory environment. 
The Fed, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp updated leveraged lending guidance in 2013 to say debt compared to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, known as leverage, that exceeds six times “raises concerns,” and that at least 50% of total debt should be able to be repaid within five to seven years. 
The result was a pullback in lending by some of the largest banks, which pushed some of the more aggressive financings to institutions that were not subject to the guidance. As regulators cracked down on aggressive lending, they also sought to ensure the soundness of the funds buying the debt. 
Dodd-Frank risk-retention rules that aimed to ensure that manager and investor interests were aligned forced CLO managers to hold ‘skin in the game’ by retaining 5% of their fund, a potential non-starter for smaller firms that lacked the required capital. 
The Volcker Rule, better known for its ban on prop trading, prohibited banks from investing in CLOs that own bonds, which led the funds to purchase loans only or lose important investors. 
Oversight of mutual funds, a retirement account mainstay, also increased. Regulators singled out loans in liquidity risk management rules that were designed to ensure that funds could meet redemption requests during volatility.
Spokespeople for the regulators either declined to comment or could not comment.

TURNING TIDE
The tide is turning on regulation after years of increasing restrictions and red tape. The Treasury Department said that it has eliminated, reduced or proposed to eliminate more than 300 regulations since Trump took office.
Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting said banks have the “right” to do the leveraged lending they want if it does not impair their “safety and soundness,” and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that his agency may seek market comment on the guidance. The US Government Accountability Office ruled that it is subject to Congressional review.
Leverage has climbed to 6.39 times for buyouts in the first quarter from 5.85 times in the same period of 2017, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data, as a result, despite warnings from the LSTA that the guidance is still in place.
As regulation disappears or is not enforced as strictly, more competition for aggressive deals will emerge as banks shut out by the guidance get back in the game, said John Fraser, head of Investcorp Credit Management US.
A February legal victory also paved the way for a risk retention-free CLO market after a US court ruled in favor of the LSTA, which sued the Fed and SEC saying the regulation was “arbitrary, capricious” and “an abuse of discretion.”
CLOs may also benefit from the “fresh look” Powell said the Fed is giving the Volcker Rule.
At US$1trn, the US leveraged loan market is among the closest in volume terms that it has ever been to the US$1.1trn US high-yield bond market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). Reducing oversight is opening the door for further growth as banks and investment firms boxed out by regulations return. 
But one regulatory legacy remains – the rise of so-called shadow banking, which sits outside of regulators’ reach. The US had a massive US$14.1trn of such assets in 2016, according to the Financial Stability Board. 
The critical question of whether markets are safer is hard to answer, according to J. Paul Forrester, a partner at law firm Mayer Brown
“It should be (safer) in that the financial services industry is better capitalized, generally, and there has been a better job of dispersing risk so major systemic problems at banks have probably been reduced,” he said. “But it also pushed a lot of financial activity out of banking and into shadow banking” away from regulators.

LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyd's of London, AIG, Allianz and other insurers are ignoring assurances and establishing new hubs in Britain and the European Union before Brexit in March 2019 to ensure access to customers.
The moves come despite a ""standstill"" transition agreement struck between Britain and the European Union in March of this year which is meant to avoid any such hasty relocations.
""We have urged firms not to wait for and rely on a political process to deliver the answers. This is particularly true of relocation plans, which take two years or more to complete,"" Hugh Savill, of the Association of British Insurers, said.
Insurers are being driven by the fact that after Brexit, European firms selling policies in Britain, as well as British and other non-European Union insurers with UK bases selling into Europe, will need to have local regulated entities.
Many contacted by Reuters have said they are starting to implement the second phase of their Brexit plans - submitting license applications, hiring staff and shifting policies.
""We are prepared for a hard Brexit,"" said Joachim Wenning, chief executive of Germany's Munich Re, the world's biggest reinsurer, which has applied for UK licences.
Such planning has been encouraged by EU regulators who say transition will not be ratified until October and could be derailed without agreement on other parts of Britain's divorce.
""I don't think there is any going back,"" Paul Merrey, a partner specializing in insurance at consultants KPMG, said.
American insurer AIG said it will open new subsidiaries in Britain and Luxembourg by December, and has begun moving policies from one jurisdiction to another.
Meanwhile, Japanese insurer Sompo's international unit last week received approval for its Luxembourg subsidiary, which it said would start operating before the end of the year.
Even Lloyd's of London, the world's largest commercial insurance market which is synonymous with the capital's financial center, will have its new Brussels subsidiary ready by January for the policy renewal season kick-off.
""Companies must take their futures into their own hands, and Lloyd’s is no different,"" its Chief Executive Inga Beale said, while Lloyd's market operator CNA Hardy's CEO Dave Brosnan said it is obtaining a license for a Luxembourg subsidiary.
EARLY CERTAINTY 
The Bank of England says that transition, which is meant to give financial firms breathing space until the end of 2020, can be relied on immediately so that EU insurers do not have to seek reauthorization for UK operations by next March.
It has also eased the rules for deciding if operations of insurers from outside Britain can continue as branches or must convert into subsidiaries with their own capital, an expensive process which only a small number face.
The BoE says UK and EU legislation is needed to ensure 10 million British policyholders with 27 billion pounds in liabilities and 38 million European Economic Area policyholders with 55 billion pounds of liabilities are not hit.
Swiss insurer Zurich is talking to UK regulators about the license for its general insurance business, which has its EU headquarters in Dublin. Its UK CEO Tulsi Naidu said she welcomed the Bank of England and UK government's stance, in ""providing early certainty for in-bound branches"".
Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG) also told Reuters it was applying for a branch license for one of its units in Britain and after requests from brokers, Munich Re said it applied in March for UK licenses as well, at a cost of ""low double-digit million figure"".
Insurers are also moving policies from London to new EU hubs, to ensure that customers can still pay premiums and receive payouts on cross-border contracts after Brexit Day. One-year policies taken out after March 29 this year are at risk. 
""NORMAL THIRD COUNTRY""
Insurers may be implementing Brexit plans, but staff moves are so far modest, far fewer than the several thousand banking jobs expected to shift, according to a Reuters survey.
Thirteen insurers who gave details of job numbers in the survey in March said a total of 173 jobs would be created in or moved to the EU, mainly in Dublin and Luxembourg.
The BoE said in response to a Freedom of Information request from Reuters that it had received contingency plans from 170 insurers regulated by its  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority and 519 such responses from European Economic Area insurance firms and their home state regulators.
A lack of clarity on future trading links after transition is also hastening insurers' Brexit moves.
While Britain wants a bespoke trade agreement based on ""mutual recognition"", the bloc is pushing its existing system of market access for ""third countries"", or non-EU members.

""We are working under the assumption that Britain will be a normal third country in the future,"" Wenning said.

The European Commission, which acts as the competition watchdog in the European Union, said UTC agreed to sell businesses making actuators, pilot controls, ice protection and oxygen systems.
The European Commission said concessions offered by UTC addressed its concerns about the deal, confirming a Reuters report on May 2.
""We can allow this merger to go ahead because in all the markets where we raised concerns, UTC has committed to divest activities covering the entire overlap between the two companies,"" Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.

UTC, maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines and various plane components, is hoping the deal will give it more leverage against plane makers negotiating price cuts. Its customers include Boeing (N:BA), Airbus (PA:AIR) and Bombardier (TO:BBDb).

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Africa's biggest securities exchange, the JSE Ltd (J:JSEJ), is crafting tighter disclosure rules for companies with listed debt instruments, combined with a greater focus on corporate governance to increase transparency.
South African state-owned companies, which are some of the biggest debt issuers, are overhauling their corporate governance after some were caught up in a recent influence-peddling scandal that rocked business and politics in Africa's biggest economy.
""Commentators are often are critical why exchanges don't catch or stop a fraud etc ... what they (regulators) do is they require disclosures so people are informed before they make a decision to invest,"" JSE Chief Executive Nicky Newton-King said in an interview with Reuters.
""That's why we are looking at disclosures for non-listed companies with debt securities as a means for investors, the media and interested shareholders to ask difficult questions."" 
The new regulations, which are expected to be finalised by the end of the year, would have a strong focus on corporate governance, Andre Visser, head of regulation at JSE, added.
""If you make an appointment to board of a company with debt instrument on the JSE, there's no specific requirement to disclose that. You will see a lot more disclosures coming up from companies with debt instruments,"" Visser said.
South African state-owned companies, such as power utility Eskom and trains operator Transnet, are some of the country's biggest issuers of debt. 
TRANSFORMATION 
At the helm since 2012, Newton-King was an instrumental figure in the transformation of the stock exchange in the early 2000s with the acquisitions of the derivatives market SAFEX and debt exchange Bond Exchange of South Africa.
She joined JSE in 1996 from a law firm and wants to make Africa's oldest stock exchange the best in emerging markets.
""We're on a very clear path to become the best global platform in emerging markets,"" she said. ""When you talk about emerging markets' financial markets, you will say, jeez the best one is the JSE,"" she said.
The JSE is already the top-20 capital market in the world with more than 160 companies listed on the its main JSE All-share index. It has a market capitalisation of 11.7 trillion rand ($930 billion). 
The bourse has been cutting transaction prices in a bid to compete with the London Stock Exchange and the Australian Stock Exchange abroad and with newer entrants at home such as ZAR X and Equity Express Securities Exchange, Newton-King said.
It has cut prices by at least 20 percent over the last years and expects more in equity market transactions in the coming months. 
""The competitive landscape, the sweet spot in which a competitor can get to us is much smaller than it was three years ago,"" she said ""We are a different shop today, far more client focused, making strides in pricing far faster than we used to.""

Bonfield's appointment comes at a time when Caterpillar is fighting an IRS demand that it pay $2 billion in taxes and penalties for shifting profit to its Swiss unit to lessen its U.S. tax bill.
Bonfield, 54, has been National Grid's CFO for more than eight years, during which he oversaw the company's $7 billion stake sale in its gas grid in 2016, which was then reported as one of the biggest British infrastructure deals in recent times.
He has held senior finance roles across a range of companies, including confectioner Cadbury Plc, which is now owned by  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ), and drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (N:BMY). In March, Bonfield was named to the board of  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB).
Caterpillar said it would offer an annual base salary of $800,000 when Bonfield takes the job on Sept. 1.
Halverson, who retires on Friday, served as CFO since 2013.

Joe Creed will be the interim finance chief until Bonfield take over, Caterpillar said.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk acknowledged on Friday that it was ""foolish"" of him to snub analysts on a conference call earlier in the week, but further needled Wall Street with a series of accusatory tweets.
In a post-earnings call on Wednesday, Musk refused to answer questions from analysts on the electric vehicle maker's capital requirements, saying ""boring, bonehead questions are not cool,"" before turning questions over to a little known investor who runs HyperChange, a YouTube investment channel.
The outspoken performance shocked many analysts, sparked a fall in Tesla's share price and led some to question whether Musk's behavior could risk the company's ability to raise capital.
In early-morning tweets on Friday, Musk said the two analysts he cut off - RBC Capital Markets' Joseph Spak and Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi - ""were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis."" 'Shorting' means they were betting the stock would fall, but the two have 'hold' or 'neutral' ratings on the stock, according to Thomson Reuters data.
""I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them,"" Musk tweeted.
The two analysts were not immediately available for a comment.
The spat comes at a crunch time for Tesla, when it is struggling to ramp up production of its Model 3 sedan, on which its profitability depends. It is trying to build 5,000 of the vehicles per week by the end of June and overcome manufacturing hurdles that have delayed its rollout.
Although Musk has insisted the company neither needs nor wants new funding, many believe the company will seek to raise more capital by the end of 2018. 
Tesla's stock recovered a little on Friday, up 2.4 percent at $291 in early afternoon trade. But short sellers, who shorted nearly 400,000 shares on Thursday, doubled that amount on Friday, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. 
""Musk's meltdown will change Tesla's ability to raise capital when he needs it with a sector of investors,"" said Eric Schiffer, chief executive of the Patriarch Organization, a Los Angeles-based private-equity firm. 
""At this critical point, he needs to reinforce confidence, not raise a narrative of him as unstable and whose rational side is lost in space,"" said Schiffer, who does not hold Tesla shares.
Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said the underlying business fundamentals were more important in any capital raise, although ""management credibility"" was also a factor.
""That has an impact but it's not something that will prevent them from raising capital,"" Houchois said. 
Nord LB analyst Frank Schwope said that Musk's refusal to answer questions or receive criticism was ""not very clever"" but added that his ability to find new money was still intact.
'DRY' QUESTIONS
The questions Musk cut short on Wednesday related to Model 3 reservations and capital requirements.
""The 'dry' questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors,"" Musk tweeted on Friday. https://twitter.com/elonmusk
""HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them,"" he wrote. On the call, he devoted 23 minutes to 25-year-old Tesla investor, Galileo Russell, who runs HyperChange TV.
At least three brokerages cut price targets on the stock following the call.
Sacconaghi, one of the rebuffed analysts, wrote: ""We do worry that such theatrics will unnecessarily undermine investor confidence in Tesla's outlook.""

Sacconaghi has a price target of $265 on Tesla's stock and Spak lowered his target to $280 from $305 on Thursday. Tesla's median Wall Street price target is $317.

BEIJING (Reuters) -  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) reported better than expected top line results on Friday, driven by strong sales in its commerce and cloud computing units, even as margins were squeezed by flurry of investments. 
The company's March-quarter revenue grew 61 percent to 61.9 billion yuan ($9.73 billion) from a year earlier, beating analyst estimates of a 53 percent increase. 
The results mark two years of continuous quarterly revenue growth above 50 percent for Alibaba, even as new business investments in offline retail, cloud computing and overseas expansion continue to weigh on margins. 
Alibaba's operating margin for the quarter was 15 percent, down from 25 percent a year earlier.
The internet giant announced in March that it will invest an additional $2 billion in Southeast Asian e-commerce firm Lazada Group, adding to a run of recent investments in China including brick-and-mortar stores, microchips and logistics. 
The spending comes as Alibaba faces increased competition from Chinese rival JD.com Inc (O:JD), which has partnered with social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) on offline retail, marketing and payments.
During a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said the firm ""will continue to invest aggressively"" with a goal of surpassing $1 trillion in gross merchandise volume (GMV) by 2020.
Alibaba's core commerce business grew 62 percent year on year to 51.3 billion yuan, while its cloud computing business grew 103 percent to 4.4 billion yuan, buoyed by new overseas data centers.
It also forecast a strong revenue increase of 60 percent for the year to March 31, 2019, versus 58 percent in 2017-18.
Last quarter Alibaba announced it will acquire a one-third stake in payment affiliate Ant Financial, replacing an earlier profit share agreement, under which Ant paid royalty fees to Alibaba equivalent to 37.5 percent of its pre-tax profits. 
The deal, which is expected to close in the second half of 2018, is likely to tamp profit in the short term as the payments company invests heavily to stave off competition in the Chinese market.
Alibaba's net income attributable to shareholders was 7.6 billion yuan in January-March, down 29 percent from the same quarter in 2017. The drop was due in part to gains from the sale investments during the same quarter in 2017, the company said.
The company posted 61.9 billion yuan ($9.73 billion) in revenue for January-March, versus an average estimate of 58.9 billion yuan from 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
March quarter sales are seasonally slow for Alibaba following its bumper sale event, Singles' Day, in November. Sales for the period were also affected by fewer working days due to the Chinese New Year holidays.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's Supreme Court has struck a blow to those who would like to bury news about alleged wrongdoing by executives and others punished for breaking securities laws, a step towards more transparency in the corporate world.
For years, accused violators of securities and banking laws in Mexico could hide behind lengthy appeals, during which regulators were barred from commenting on charges and investors were left in the dark about crimes such as insider trading.
But in a little noticed decision in February, the Supreme Court backed new powers given to the banking and securities regulator CNBV in 2014 to name violators.
In the first case of its kind to reach the highest court, justices threw out a bid by the former chief executive of Mexican builder ICA (MX:ICA) to quash news of a 2016 reprimand for failing to alert investors to key information early enough. 
The ruling gives the CNBV an edge in ongoing legal battles with companies and executives who are using injunctions to keep sanctions under wraps, said Pedro Torres, a legal expert at university Tec de Monterrey.
""It is an achievement of the authorities that sets a precedent for transparency in the securities markets,"" Torres said. ""The rule is clear: people will realize that if they go to court with similar schemes, they are going to lose.""
Mexico has lagged other major Latin American economies such as Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru in fighting corruption and improving market transparency, said Will Landers, a managing director at BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) in Princeton, New Jersey.
""Improvements are needed for Mexico to catch up to other Latin American markets and increase investor confidence,"" he said. ""Any move to get rid of favoritism and provide more certainty to investors will be welcomed by markets.""
ICA's former head was one of at least 13 executives and companies that filed similar gag orders, arguing the new law violated their rights, according to officials, court documents and the CNBV's database. The regulator lost five of those motions in lower courts but overturned eight of them.
Previously regulators were barred from publishing or even commenting on sanctions until all legal options had been exhausted, a process that can take years.
In response to questions from Reuters, the CNBV said in a statement that the Supreme Court's ruling set a general precedent that ratified the watchdog's power to publish sanctions related to both securities and banking laws violations.
The repercussions can go beyond mere embarrassment. In March, for example, when the chief financial officer of conglomerate Alfa (MX:ALFAA) resigned, the company cited a CNBV fine for insider trading.
TEST OF LEGAL FRAMEWORK
For a time, ICA was the country's largest construction company, helping build the Mexico City subway and more than 15 airports. But a drop in the value of the peso in late 2014 and fewer government projects left it struggling to pay dollar-denominated debt. 
ICA's stock price collapsed in 2015 and it was forced to delist from the New York Stock Exchange in 2016 before eventually filing for bankruptcy last August.
ICA's former CEO, Alonso Quintana, was reprimanded by the CNBV in 2016 for failing to inform investors that ICA's stock was in danger of being kicked off the NYSE, according to court documents.
The company also received a fine on the same day of nearly 2.2 million pesos ($117,000) for failing to disclose information, the CNBV's public database showed, though it was not clear if it was for the same violation.
ICA had not paid the fine as of early May, according to the CNBV database.
The company said in a statement that it was still appealing the fine, declining to answer further questions from Reuters. Quintana, who resigned as CEO in February 2016, declined to comment for this story.
Quintana fought in court for two years to block the CNBV from disclosing his reprimand. Like other executives and companies who filed gag orders, he argued that allowing the regulator to publish sanctions could unfairly affect their reputations as they fought to overturn charges in court.
However, the Supreme Court ruled that the CNBV has a constitutional right to publish limited data on sanctions, even as appeals proceed, and that the public's right to know outweighs potential damages to a litigant's reputation.
Mauricio Basila, a former top CNBV official now in private law practice, said the case showed Mexico's elite, who closely control many of the country's publicly listed companies, feared the ""stain"" on their reputation, whether there was a fine or not.
""It is very important that these cases are seen, because they put our legal framework to the test,"" he said.

MUMBAI/BENGALURU/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart's board is yet to finalize a deal to sell a controlling stake to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday, adding a deal could just be days away.
Bloomberg reported earlier on Friday, citing unidentified sources, that Flipkart's board had approved a deal to sell a stake of about 75 percent in the company to a group led by U.S. retail giant Walmart for about $15 billion.
A third source told Reuters that while Flipkart's board had ""in-principle"" approved engaging with Walmart based on the terms of an offer before them, taxation related concerns and a few other issues need to be resolved.
The first two sources said Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc is also likely to invest in Flipkart alongside Walmart, but terms of the deal may change. Japan's SoftBank Group, the biggest investor in the Indian firm through its private equity fund, is considering selling its roughly 20 percent stake as part of the deal if the price is right, two other sources said.
""SoftBank does not like to be a passive investor,"" one of the sources said.
Reuters had previously reported Walmart was in advanced talks with Flipkart to acquire a controlling stake in the Bengaluru-based online marketplace at a valuation of at least $18 billion.
Flipkart has bought back $350 million worth of shares from its investors as it seeks to convert its Singapore-incorporated company to a private limited firm, in a move that could ease the way in for a new strategic investor, regulatory filings show.
Flipkart and Alphabet did not respond to Reuters' requests seeking comment. Walmart and SoftBank declined to comment.
AMAZON OFFER
Earlier this week, Indian TV channel CNBC-TV18 reported Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc had made a formal offer to buy 60 percent of Flipkart and that it had also proposed a $2 billion breakup fee to convince Flipkart to discuss its offer.
Sources told Reuters that Amazon had shown an interest in buying Flipkart, but said a deal with Walmart was much more likely to go through. Amazon is Flipkart's biggest rival in India.
Amazon's move to bid for Flipkart may push up valuations of the Indian firm, but engaging with the tech giant could be fraught with risks for Flipkart, said industry insiders and lawyers.
Beyond the risk of opening its books for due diligence and exposing sensitive commercial agreements to its biggest rival in India, an Amazon-Flipkart combination could face significant antitrust hurdles, they said.
Amazon is currently seeking legal opinion to understand how the country's antitrust regulator, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), is likely to view any deal with Flipkart, a lawyer and an industry source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
A former senior CCI official said e-commerce firms were already giving deep discounts and an Amazon-Flipkart union was likely to be in a position to sway the market their way, but the CCI could be convinced to approve a deal if both firms suggested ""innovations or remedies.""
""This definitely would be a tricky case and not easy to sail through,"" he added.
Amazon declined to comment on whether it had bid for Flipkart or was seeking legal opinion for a potential investment in the firm.
Flipkart, together with its fashion units Myntra and Jabong, controls nearly 40 percent of India's online retail market, while Amazon is a close second with a 31 percent share, according to data from research firm Forrester.

Both Amazon and Flipkart are pouring billions of dollars into winning shoppers in the fast-growing market that is expected to be worth $200 billion within a decade.

Traders are waiting for the publication of the monthly jobs report at 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT).
The consensus forecast is that the data will show jobs growth of 189,000, after adding 103,000 positions in March, while the unemployment rate is forecast to dip to 4.0% from 4.1%.
However, most of the focus will likely be on average hourly earnings figures, which are expected to rise 0.2%, following a gain of 0.3% a month earlier. On an annualized basis, wages are forecast to increase 2.7%, the same as the rise seen in March.
Steady wage growth would add to signs of building inflation pressures and likely keep the Federal Reserve on a gradual path of monetary policy tightening.
Markets are currently pricing in the next hike to come in June with the following increase to arrive in September. Odds for a third hike by the end of the year hover around 40%.
Several Fed policymakers including John Williams, Randal Quarles, Robert Kaplan, Raphael Bostic and Esther George will be speaking throughout the day at the Currencies, Capital and Central Bank Balances: A Policy Conference, in Stanford, California.
While waiting for the data, the dollar crept back towards a four-month high reached at 92.67 on Wednesday. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, edged forward 0.11% to 92.38 by 6:53AM ET (10:53GMT).
Dollar strength weighed on gold ahead of the data as the precious metal becomes more expensive for holders of foreign currencies. At 6:54AM ET (10:54GMT) Friday, gold for June delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange slipped 0.13% to $1,311.00.
Also on markets’ radar, two days of trade talks between the U.S. and China wrapped up in Beijing on Friday with no major breakthrough, as was widely anticipated. Top officials from China and the United States reached a consensus on some aspects of the countries' trade row, but disagreements over other issues remain ""relatively big"", according to China's Xinhua news agency. Both sides committed to continuing the dialog.
In company news, 402 of the S&P 500 firms have already reported first quarter earnings with more than 70% having beaten consensus on the top and bottom line.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) will be among firms reporting before the opening bell on Friday.
Also of note, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) bought 75 million shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the first quarter, pushing its holdings in the iPhone maker to 240.3 million shares worth $42.5 billion.
“If you look at Apple, I think it earns almost twice as much as the second most profitable company in the United States,” CNBC quoted Buffett as saying.
Shares of Apple were up more than 1% in pre-market trade on Friday.
Elsewhere, European stocks traded mostly higher on the back of positive earnings reports, though weak reports from the banking sector capped gains.

Senior managers of foreign-invested futures brokerages must also be based in China, while at least one third should be Chinese nationals, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) told a news conference in Beijing, citing newly-published draft rules.
The rules, which are circulated for public consultation, come after China last April said it would further deregulate its financial industry, raising the foreign ownership ceiling to 51 percent in securities firms, mutual fund houses, life insurers as well as futures brokerages. All ownership restrictions will be scrapped in three years' time.
Currently, several foreign banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland Group (L:RBS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), own minority stakes in Chinese futures brokerage ventures. 
CSRC also published draft rules on Friday to better regulate overseas expansion by Chinese brokerages and asset managers. 

Some companies are expanding their businesses blindly, while others have complicated structures that make internal management difficult, CSRC said, urging them to streamline their overseas businesses.

887,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Hospital operator HCA spends big to keep nurses on board,"By Jilian Mincer
NEW YORK (Reuters) - HCA Healthcare (N:HCA) is raising the stakes in a fiercely competitive labor market, pledging $300 million for employee benefits that are largely designed to attract nurses, company executives told Reuters.
The nation's largest publicly-traded hospital chain said in January that it would invest much of its windfall from a U.S. tax overhaul to offer tuition reimbursement, student loan repayment and extra family leave to all of its employees in the next three years.
Company officials provided Reuters with new details on their spending plans, saying a top priority of the program is to keep nurses in its wards. The retention push is vital to HCA plans to grow in states like Florida and Texas, and comes as a worsening labor shortage forces U.S. hospitals collectively to spend billions of dollars more on nursing staff. 
A generation of Baby Boomer nurses are retiring, while younger staff can choose from many job opportunities outside hospitals that offer higher salaries and better hours. 
HCA and smaller rival  Tenet Healthcare  (N:THC) are particularly vulnerable in fast-growing Texas and Florida, where up to 40 percent of nurses will retire in the coming years, according to healthcare worker groups. Half of HCA's hospitals are located in those states and account for 48 percent of revenue.
HCA faces stiff competition for these nurses, however. Reuters interviews with more than a dozen rival hospitals in those two states found that many already offer similar benefits to what HCA plans to introduce.
""What we are trying to do is become the employer of choice,"" Jane Englebright, HCA's chief nursing executive, said in an interview. ""Investing in nurses pays dividends in so many ways. This additional funding coming our way is allowing us to take this to a new level.""
HCA has already worked to reduce use of more expensive contract nurses and rates of nurse turnover, which hit 22 percent in 2016 and is now closer to 17 percent.
But some Wall Street analysts worry HCA will face rising costs as the labor shortage intensifies in the next three to four years. 
""Are they going to start offering more, and will that hit their margins?” said Michael Newshel, healthcare analyst at Evercore ISI.
EXPANSION PLAN
HCA is viewed as one of the strongest for-profit hospital operator in the country. Seeking new growth, the company plans to spend $10.5 billion in the next three years to expand and upgrade its facilities. Keeping them adequately staffed with nurses is key to that expansion. 
    In January, as it devised the benefits plan, HCA surveyed millennial nurses, who account for almost half of its 87,000 nurses. Their answers on workplace priorities helped shape the benefits most likely to help nurses, such as reimbursing up to $5,250 in employee tuition annually and covering certifications for nursing specialties, such as surgery. 
Until now, such benefits had been offered in a limited number of HCA hospitals, to a small group of employees.
For example, about 1,100 HCA nurses last year received specialty certification after passing the relevant exam. Englebright expects that number to triple now that HCA will cover study materials, exams and certification dues.
Millennial nurses also requested additional training, equipment, advancement opportunities and a voice in the organization, Englebright said. One of HCA's responses is to build 13 new centers to provide recent graduates with hands-on training. It currently has one such training center.   
Englebright said that other benefits and policies are meant to convince late-career nurses to delay retirement, such as paying college tuition for employees' children and offering less physically demanding work in call centers. 
Many hospitals have offered some of these benefits for a while now. About half of nurses are offered educational funds, according to a survey conducted last summer by American Nurse Today, the journal of the American Nurses Association. 
Tenet offers tuition assistance and signing bonuses of $10,000 to $15,000 for experienced nurses in some locations, including Florida. One-time bonuses can be as high as $25,000 in places where competition is fiercest, such as California, the company said.
In Texas, Baylor Scott & White, the largest not-for-profit hospital network in the state, has been focusing on the shortage for years, providing tuition reimbursement of up to $5,250 to more than 2,000 nurses last year. Many organizations cap the tuition at $5,250, the maximum benefit before an employee would pay tax.
A decade ago, Ashley Kent, 33, decided to work there as a patient assistant because of such benefits.
The program allowed her to complete a nursing degree in 2014. Now a manager, Kent is scheduled to graduate in May with a masters degree, which the hospital also helped pay for.
""I didn't have parents who could help support me through college,"" said Kent. ""I knew I was paying for it myself out of pocket.""

888,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2018 10:12AM ET</span>","As Trump's tariffs bite, small U.S. manufacturers begin to tap the brakes","By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Encouraged by a booming demand for construction equipment, Mike Haberman was planning in early February to hire at least 30 more workers for the manufacturing facility of his Gradall Industries in Ohio.
That plan now is shelved, Haberman said, because the cost of steel used in Gradall's telescopic excavators and vacuum trucks shot up by one-third following President Donald Trump's crackdown on steel imports. As steel costs account for 35 percent of his cost of production, he fears rising prices would not only hurt his export sales, but also give an edge to foreign rivals at home.
""At this point, we really need more visibility before we would bring in more workers,"" he told Reuters.
When Trump signed a $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts at the end of 2017, supporters predicted businesses would respond this year with a burst of hiring and investment. 
But Reuters interviews with more than a dozen small to mid-sized manufacturing executives and recent U.S. economic data reveal Trump's protectionist trade policy is starting to lead some of them to take a more cautious approach, and forcing them to put new investment and hiring plans on hold.
While these manufacturers lauded the administration's push to make U.S. businesses globally competitive through measures such as the tax overhaul and a deregulation drive, they complained that the steel and aluminum tariffs along with the escalating trade spat with China were undercutting those benefits.
Trump has proposed a separate 25 percent import tariff on some 1,300 Chinese products to try to force changes in Beijing's intellectual property practices. If the tariff comes into effect, they would upend Haberman's components supplies from China, he said.
The steel and aluminum import tariffs imposed in March were designed to protect the American industries and its workers from global overcapacity and unfair trade practices. Trump justified the measure saying protecting the industries was important to the country's national security. He argued that the tariffs would re-open closed mills, sustain a skilled workforce, and maintain or increase production.
But the tariffs, which came into effect on March 23, have driven up raw material costs and caused supply delays, rendering the manufacturers' ""Made in the USA"" products uncompetitive against their foreign rivals, according to these manufacturing company executives.
Mike Schmitt, president at The Metalworking Group in Ohio, said his metal fabrication company has lost around a thousand hours repricing and renegotiating contracts because it can't honor the old prices. 
The company has delayed plans to spend around $500,000 on equipment this year and bring on new staff to expand. 
""It's going to be 2019 before we buy anything because we don't have enough confidence to do it. There's just too much uncertainty out there right now,"" Schmitt said.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey on Tuesday showed how widespread that sentiment is: manufacturers slowed down hiring for a second straight month in April amid complaints that the tariffs have brought business planning to a standstill.
Nicole Sahin, chief executive at recruitment firm Globalization Partners in Boston, says a large multi-national client of hers recently pulled back from an $800 million investment in a U.S.-based energy project after rising steel costs made the investment not viable.
Sahin said all her clients who are exposed to steel prices have put their investment plans on hold because of the business ""uncertainty"" caused by the tariffs.
LIMITED OPTIONS
Big manufacturers are looking to manage cost increases by controlling expenses through their supply chains or raising prices for their products.
But not all small manufacturers have those options. 
Take Florida Marine Tanks, which makes fuel, water and holding tanks for yachts. Company President Orestes Monterrey said aluminum accounts for 70 percent of the company's cost of production, which has risen 26 percent since December.
When the Henderson, North Carolina-based company tried to pass along rising aluminum costs, customers slowed down orders.
The company has shelved a $2.2 million plan to expand its North Carolina facility and hire 46 new workers. It also fired four workers that were hired in December for the project, Monterrey said.
""(We) don't know where business is going to go,"" said Monterrey. ""Customers are reducing their orders.""
In a March study, Trade Partnership Worldwide, LLC estimated the steel and aluminum tariffs would result in a net loss of nearly 470,000 U.S. jobs. The proposed tariffs on Chinese imports, the Washington-based consulting firm estimates, would put 134,000 jobs at risk.
""There is just no way to sustain expansion, develop new products and bring on new employees - as we thought we were going to do this year,"" said Troy Roberts, chief executive officer at Colorado Springs-based Qualtek Manufacturing.
Roberts' company provides stamped parts to the medical device and aerospace industries. Qualtek was planning to invest up to $1 million in new capital equipment and expand its workforce by 17 percent this year.
Even though the company purchases domestically-produced steel and aluminum, Roberts says the metal tariffs are projected to increase Qualtek's raw material costs by $300,000, putting the investment and workforce expansion plans in jeopardy.
    
TIGHT SUPPLIES, COST CUTS
While the tariffs have increased the demand for local steel and aluminum, domestic mills have not yet fully ramped up their capacity. Data from the American Iron and Steel Institute shows capacity utilization at the steel mills has gone up by just 1.1 percentage points from the same period last year.
As a result, the lead time for delivery of raw material is going up. Roberts of Qualtek Manufacturing says his lead time has doubled to 14 weeks. In Florida Marine Tanks' case, a shipment scheduled for early March hasn't arrived yet.
Trump has postponed a decision on whether to withdraw temporary exemptions from the metals tariffs on Canada, the European Union and Mexico until June 1, and has reached agreements for permanent exemptions for Argentina, Australia and Brazil.
The imports from the exempted countries, however, will be restrained by quotas. Manufacturers are not sure how the quotas will be implemented or will curb rising metal prices.
Faced with supply delays, some manufacturers have decided to pay the tariffs and get the metals from overseas.
The Vollrath Company in Wisconsin, which makes cookware and bakeware items, has started importing aluminum from China after local mills couldn't meet its demand.
The company's chief financial officer, Steve Heun, says the tariffs, including the latest countervailing duties, will make its aluminum products at least 20 percent more expensive than those of its foreign rivals, and are estimated to increase its input costs by as much as $6 million a year.
Its working capital requirements have gone up by 10 percent as the company is now forced to hold more inventory, Heun said.
Vollrath employs 1,000 people in Wisconsin and had plans to hire 25-50 workers this year. But with the tariffs weighing on its profitability, Heun says the company is looking for ways to trim costs and has halted new hiring.

""If there was any positive feeling about the tax overhaul, clearly, it's been wiped out,"" said Heun.

889,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 04, 2018 06:01AM ET</span>",VIX Manipulation Probes Sow Angst Around Wall Street Fear Gauge,"(Bloomberg) -- The world got a stomach-churning lesson in the risks of trading volatility after the VIX swung wildly in February.
Now, traders are experiencing another gut check as market regulators look into allegations that the index is being rigged.
News broke Thursday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission opened probes into the VIX, one of Wall Street’s most widely used benchmarks. One area of investigation is the monthly auction that determines the price of futures contracts tied to the VIX, people familiar with the matter said.
“If they find something that is untoward, that’s a big deal,” said Amy Wu Silverman, managing director and equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets LLC. “VIX has become an industry standard, it’s almost synonymous to volatility. Questions like ‘What exactly is going on?’ make people nervous.”
The development is a blow to Cboe Global Markets Inc., which compiles the so-called fear gauge. Not only has the company been stung by the recent bouts of turbulence, but its crown jewel, the VIX, has become the focus of intense scrutiny after a 2017 research paper alleged its process is vulnerable to being manipulated.
In a statement, Cboe expressed confidence in its market oversight. It has said that allegations of manipulation are unfounded.
Preventing Misconduct
A sign anxiety is rising: Cboe officials have been leaning on compliance departments at firms that trade VIX options and futures, asking what they’re doing to prevent misconduct among customers, according to a person whose company has been queried. The inquiries began about a week ago, said the person, who asked not to be named.
While Cboe officials have repeatedly dismissed the claims as baseless, traders seem less certain. Punished first in February by concern that month’s histrionics would dent its volatility franchise, Cboe’s stock is down 15 percent in 2018, after rising 27 percent annually since the end of 2010 and never posting a down year. It’s fallen in four of the past five weeks.
While trading in VIX options set a record high during the first quarter, as did related S&P 500 contracts, investors have liquidated positions in VIX futures, with open interest sinking to the lowest levels in about two years. Volume slowed in April to the lowest level in more than a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Cboe owns the intellectual property underlying the VIX and charges money to use VIX-related products it created. If you buy an options or futures contract, you usually pay a transaction cost that the Cboe collects, while VIX-related exchange-traded notes and funds owe a licensing fee. Trading fees from VIX futures and options, added together, make up roughly 25 percent to 30 percent of the Cboe’s revenue, depending on the quarter, according to Christopher Allen, senior research analyst at Rosenblatt Securities.
Over the years, allegations of VIX rigging have occasionally surfaced, though were seldom taken seriously by professionals. The latest claims have piqued more interest among traders who have been baffled as settlement values increasingly occurred far away from prevailing market prices.
Research published by Bloomberg News in January showed that of the 10 biggest gaps between the VIX settlement value and its closing level the night before, five came in 2017, including December’s, which was the biggest discount in 11 years.
Leaders of the exchange, among the most respected in the industry, are on the defensive, assuring traders in a letter last week that no manipulation has occurred while at the same time vowing to improve the process by which the auction is conducted. It was signed by Ed Tilly, the chief executive officer, and Cboe President Chris Concannon, once an SEC lawyer.
In response to news of the probe, the company said in a statement that it is “confident of our regulatory program, and that of our regulatory services provider, Finra.” The reference is to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which Cboe hired to help police its markets.
“Both our regulatory program and Finra maintain surveillance programs and dedicated teams of staff that surveil and monitor the trading activity and review every settlement across our futures and securities markets,” according to the statement.
“The VIX and the VIX-related products have been in the spotlight,” Allen said. “It’s obviously important.”

890,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",China asks U.S. to amend ZTE business ban - sources,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has asked the United States to amend a seven-year ban on American companies selling components and software to Chinese telecom equipment firm ZTE Corp, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Friday.
The appeal came during trade talks in Beijing this week between senior officials from both countries aimed at heading off a trade war.
Washington imposed the ban last month, accusing ZTE of breaking an agreement to punish employees after the Chinese maker of smartphones and telecoms gear shipped U.S. goods to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.
While U.S. officials have said the action against ZTE was not related to broader trade policy, the move has been seen by many in China as part of the broader trade spat playing out between the world's No.1 and No.2 economies.
The sources, who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the talks, said Chinese negotiators asked the U.S. side to listen to ZTE's appeal, take into account the company's efforts to improve its compliance and amend the ban.
China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement earlier on Friday that Chinese officials had made ""solemn representations"" over the ZTE case to the U.S. delegation.
It said the U.S. officials, for their part, said they ""attach importance to China's representations and will report China's stance to the U.S. president,"" in reference to U.S. President Donald Trump.
There has been no public read-out of the talks yet from the U.S. side.
The ban on sales to ZTE, which is heavily reliant on imports of U.S. chips, had threatened to scupper the Chinese firm's smartphone business. It has also underscored China's heavy reliance on semiconductor imports amid growing trade tensions with the United States.

ZTE has said the ban was unacceptable and threatened its survival.A commerce ministry spokesman said after the ban was announced last month that China would take any necessary measures at any time in response to the U.S. move against ZTE.

The international airport, the country's most expensive transport project to date, was among 20 infrastructure projects approved by the government last week.
""If you look at our balance sheet and our cash flow, we can easily do that airport alone,"" San Miguel President and Chief Operating Officer Ramon Ang told reporters.
The project aims to ease chronic passenger and aircraft congestion at the main air gateway in Manila, part of President Rodrigo Duterte's ambitious $180 billion ""Build, Build, Build"" infrastructure development and upgrade program.
Ang was responding to a comment by Finance Minister Carlos Dominguez, who on Monday questioned whether the airport project might be too big for San Miguel.
""We must make sure the proponent has the financial and technical capability to carry it out, that's all. And a partnership is obviously allowed for that,"" Dominguez said.
San Miguel, the country's biggest company by revenue, is best known for its beer. It has pursued an aggressive expansion strategy since 2008, adding infrastructure, mining, petroleum and power assets to its staple food and beverage businesses.
The company plans to build and run the airport under a 50-year concession with the government.
The proposal will be subject to a Swiss challenge under government rules, which allows for competing offers, with the original bidder given the right to match a better proposal.
Ang said the project was needed to ease congestion at Manila's main airport which has restricted growth in tourism. 
Flight delays are typical across Philippine domestic airports, mostly due to backlogs at Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport, which is rated among the world's worst airports. 

Ang said the new airport could handle 20 million foreign tourists a year, compared to a record 6.6 million visitors last year, according to government data.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares bounced back on Friday as a flurry of good company results rolled in, although the heavyweight banking sector was left behind following poor updates from HSBC (L:HSBA),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
While the European banking index, recently penalized by softening economic data and cooling expectations about monetary policy tightening, fell 0.7 percent to lead sectoral losers, broad-based gains across sectors lifted the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index up 0.3 percent in mid-morning trading.
The recent fall in the euro following a rally that started in the second half of last year however has helped Europe outperform Wall Street in the last few weeks, putting the euro zone index (STOXXE) on track for six straight weeks of gains.
""The euro has remained under pressure this week on declining expectations about the timeline of an expected tapering of the ECB's bond buying program. Yesterday the latest EU inflation numbers saw an unexpected decline in inflation on both the headline rate as well as on core prices,"" said Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets, in a note.
On Friday solid updates lifted shares in German specialty chemicals firm  Lanxess  (DE:LXSG), British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) and Swiss drug ingredients maker Lonza (S:LONN) to the top of the STOXX, while banking stocks were broadly lower.
Sports car maker  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) rose to a fresh record, up 5.6 percent, as brokers welcomed its better-than-expected quarterly update, providing more fuel to its stock price rally. 
HSBC declined 3.2 percent after it reported an unexpected 4 percent drop in first-quarter pre-tax profit due to a surge in investments, although its new CEO sought to cheer investors with a share buyback of up to $2 billion.
BNP Paribas and Societe Generale fell sharply, down 2.4 and 5.9 percent respectively, as traders and analysts expressed disappointment with a weak-looking set of first-quarter results from the French banks.
Their declines kept the French blue chip CAC (FCHI) down 0.2 percent. 
Still among financials, however, insurers  Swiss Re  (S:SRENH) Generali (MI:GASI) were supported by better than expected quarterly updates, while AXA (PA:AXAF) fell 0.3 percent after first-quarter revenues fell 2.7 percent, pressured by a stronger euro which impacted the value of its sales.
Forex headwinds were also blamed by BMW (DE:BMWG) for its 3 percent drop in quarterly operating profit. Shares in the German luxury carmaker were down 1.6 percent. 

Air France (PA:AIRF) was the biggest loser on the STOXX, down 7.9 percent. The airline said it expected profits to fall this year due to the effect of strikes at its main French unit.

ROZZANO, Italy (Reuters) - Telecom Italia's (TIM) (MI:TLIT) top two investors will face off for the first time on Friday as they put their battle over board seats at the Italian phone group to a shareholder vote. 
Activist fund Elliott has built a stake of 9 percent in the former state phone monopoly to try to shake up the way top investor  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) - which owns 24 percent - runs it.
The two investors have been at loggerheads for two months, with Elliott accusing Vivendi of serving only its own interests and the French media group saying the fund was looking only for short-term financial gains.
Since becoming a TIM shareholder in 2015, Vivendi has gradually tightened its grip on Italy's biggest phone group and last year appointed two-thirds of its board as well as making its own CEO, Arnaud de Puyfontaine, executive chairman.
The hands-on approach has led to friction with Rome, concerned about an asset it considers of strategic importance, and has unnerved other investors at the telecoms group.
On Friday, shareholders are asked to pick between Elliott's slate of 10 independent Italian business heavyweights and Vivendi's list, that did little to allay governance concerns.
The vote was called after the majority of directors resigned in March, triggering a full reshuffle. Whoever secures the most votes will get two-thirds - or 10 seats - on the board, while the remaining five will come from the other slate. 
Proxy advisers recommended backing Elliott's list, saying Vivendi had been damaging for governance and investor returns.
But the vote is likely to be close given the size of Vivendi's stake, and will depend on where big institutional investors place their bets. 
Italian state lender CDP bought 4.8 percent of TIM, a move widely seen as political endorsement of the Elliott campaign, but what the likes of BlackRock and Vanguard might do is harder to predict, analysts and fund managers said. 
Vivendi's slate features CEO Amos Genish, who managed to impress the government in Rome and whose ambitious new three-year strategy, presented in March, was welcomed by investors and could sway the vote in favor of the French camp.
Last week shareholders nearly unanimously backed Genish who, despite being a Vivendi ally, is well respected for his track record in the telecoms industry and is seen as key to re-launching the slumbering Italian telecoms heavyweight.
This might prove a conundrum for some investors who may want to weaken the French grip but will not want to lose the CEO.
Genish has said his position would be ""untenable"" if TIM ended up with a board that did not back his strategy, prompting Elliott to reiterate its support for the CEO and his plans. 
The activist fund also toned down its requests for major strategy moves, saying management and an independent board would evaluate whether and when to carry them out.

Regardless of who wins, other shareholders and analysts say Vivendi and Elliott will eventually need to bury the hatchet to allow the new board to push through measures to slash TIM's debt, tackle growing competition and unlock value at a group that's been underperforming peers for years.

PARIS (Reuters) -  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), France's biggest bank, reported a 17 percent decline in quarterly net profit, in line with expectations, as a weaker dollar and sluggish fixed income trading impacted investment banking revenues.
First-quarter net income fell to 1.57 billion euros ($1.9 billion), in line with analysts' estimates of 1.55 billion euros, according to a Reuters poll of 5 analysts.
Revenues fell 4.4 percent to 10.8 billion euros, compared to 11.04 billion expected by analysts. Revenues at its corporate and institutional bank were also down 9.8 percent.
""Even if the market context was lackluster in Europe compared to the first quarter 2017, the results are in line with the trajectory of the 2020 plan and the achievement of its targets,"" said chief executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafe.
A pick-up in volatility in the middle of the first quarter resulted in a wait-and-see attitude by clients who traded rates and foreign exchange in Europe less actively in contrast to equity trading that performed well in the U.S. 
Revenue from equity and prime services at BNP Paribas rose 19.4 percent, but fixed income (FICC) activities declined 31.4 percent.
BNP Paribas also blamed the drop in profits on an unfavorable foreign exchange effect and a high comparative base in the first quarter of 2017, when a significant level of corporate banking fees were booked.
Earlier on Friday, BNP Paribas' rival  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) had also reported a 13.4 percent fall in revenue at its investment bank.
BNP Paribas is aiming to become more profitable while also saving money to invest heavily in digital infrastructure, on both investment banking and retail banking fronts.
It sees the international financial services division - a unit that includes consumer finance, retail banking in emerging markets and the United States, as well as insurance and wealth management - as its growth engine. That division saw a 3.8 percent rise in quarterly revenue.
This helped outweigh weakness in BNP Paribas' home French market, where revenues declined 1.6 percent, due partly to pressures on its loan businesses.

The bank's profit shrank mainly as a nearly 13 percent rise in operating expenses outpaced revenue growth of 5.5 percent. HSBC said the rise in costs was due to investment in its retail banking businesses in its core markets of Britain and China.

906,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2018 03:24AM ET</span>",China vows to open up more futures markets as iron ore goes international,"By Muyu Xu and Manolo Serapio Jr
DALIAN/MANILA (Reuters) - China plans to open more of its futures contracts to foreign investors, a senior official said on Friday, as Beijing launched its ""internationalised"" iron ore contract, part of a bid to boost its sway over pricing of major commodity imports.
Iron ore is the second commodity China has opened to outside investors following the launching of a crude oil futures contract in March that aims to compete with rival global benchmarks. 
The move is expected to increase trading in the Dalian Commodity Exchange's iron ore contract <0#DCIO:>, which was launched in 2013 and is already among China's most liquid derivatives, with volumes far surpassing shipments of global seaborne iron ore trade.
The immediate impact may be muted as Western trading houses such as Cargill (CARG.UL) and Trafigura [TRAFG.UL] have long had access to the contract through local Chinese entities, but the change means foreign companies will be able to trade directly, opening the door to more market participants.
""We will accelerate the process to attract more foreign investors,"" Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, told a packed crowd at the trading floor of the Dalian exchange.
""We will internationalise all the mature futures contracts and expand Chinese influence,"" he said. 
The most actively traded September iron ore contract  closed down 1.2 percent at 471.50 yuan ($74) a tonne, retreating from a two-day spike that pushed it to a more than one-week high on Thursday.
Volume for the most-traded contract reached almost 2.9 million lots, just surpassing April's daily average of 2.8 million lots.
The strong liquidity in China's markets is a strength in its bid to be a price setter. Trading volumes in its crude oil futures (ISCc1) have outpaced turnover on the rival Brent (LCOc1) and the U.S. West Texas Intermediate (CLc1) contracts during Asian hours since its March 26 launch. 
But the huge volumes also make China's iron ore contract a magnet for speculative retail investors, who have triggered wild price swings and prompted regulators to impose trading curbs over the past two years.

NEW PLAYERS
Unlike oil, gold and copper, for which prices are set in London and New York, iron ore is one of the few commodities whose global pricing takes its cue from China.
Prices there virtually dictate the path for the physical market. In 2017, Dalian iron ore volumes reached nearly 33 billion tonnes versus global annual iron ore trade of about 1.5 billion tonnes.
""Finally the barrier is gone,"" Lee Kirk, managing director at Cargill Metals, said at the Dalian exchange event, although traders pointed to issues that could keep some Western players on the sidelines.
Unlike other global benchmarks that trade on consecutive months, the liquidity in Chinese commodity futures tends to focus on a specific month, due to a different cost structure, which could favor Dalian rival Singapore Exchange, said Kirk.
Prospective players may also be wary of currency exchange, said Trafigura trader Micky Richmond.
""Lots of U.S. hedge funds have showed interest in Dalian iron ore trade and the Chinese market ... but I think it's difficult for them, because of the margin situation and monetary situation, it's hard to exchange between USD and CNY,"" he said.
Bringing in top miners to trade on Dalian would boost China's bid to be a global pricing center, he added.
""I think it's a positive move and will help boost liquidity and form transparent pricing for both suppliers and consumers,"" said Sergio Espeschit, head of top iron ore miner Vale  in China.
However, miners typically don't hedge or fix prices for future sales because that means their earnings can be lower if prices increase.
Japanese trading house Mitsubishi Corp (T:8058), which trades iron ore derivatives on the Singapore Exchange, is among those holding off on Dalian.
""I think the volatility may go smaller at the beginning when foreign spot traders test the waters. But it could go bigger again if they decide to stand by and more speculators come in,"" said Jin Yuandong who works at Mitsubishi's metals business.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc's stock hit an all-time high on Friday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc disclosed it bought an additional 75 million shares of the iPhone maker in the first three months of the year.
Buffett's increased stake, which was confirmed by a representative of the billionaire investor, pushed Apple's shares up as much as 4.2 percent to $184.25, taking the company's market value to about $906 billion.
Apple declined to comment on Friday.
""If you look at Apple, I think it earns almost twice as much as the second most profitable company in the United States,"" Buffett told CNBC, which first reported the news on Thursday. 
Friday's rise was the stock's second significant gain this week after the Cupertino, California-based company surprised Wall Street on Tuesday with resilient iPhone sales and quarterly results that topped expectations.
Daniel Morgan, an investor in Apple, said it is ""not surprising to see Buffet take a big position"" in the company.
""He is an old 'Graham and Dodd' value investor,"" said Morgan, who is a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, which holds 270,415 shares in Apple. 
Buffett's commitment to Apple over the past two years has surprised many, given his historical aversion to companies associated with the technology sector.
""I think Apple was much more of a consumer products business,"" Buffett had said last May in a Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholders meeting. 
Berkshire's initial investment in Apple was small, suggesting it was made by one of Buffett's investment deputies. But with the latest stake purchase, it has grown to a massive 240.3 million shares worth $42.5 billion.
In February, Berkshire said its Apple stake grew by about 23 percent since the end of September to roughly 165.3 million shares.
Recently, Berkshire almost sold out its entire investment in  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp and at the same time bought more Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL).
""They are two different types of decisions. And I was wrong on the first one (IBM), and we'll find out whether I'm right or wrong on the second (Apple),"" Buffett had said a year ago.
There may also be another reason for the investment: Berkshire's cash pile of $116 billion.
The investment company has not made a major acquisition for more than two years and Buffett had said in his latest annual letter that he wanted to acquire one or more ""huge"" non-insurance companies to reduce Berkshire's cash and equivalents.
Buying Apple shares partly accomplishes that, even though Buffett would prefer to buy whole companies.
Berkshire typically discloses its largest common stock holdings and percentage stakes in its quarterly and annual reports. 
The report for the first quarter is set for release on Saturday morning, just before Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett's hometown.

Up to Friday's close, Apple stock had risen 9.8 percent since Berkshire disclosed on Feb.14 that it had raised its stake in the company. The shares closed up 3.9 percent at $183.83 on Friday.

The company, that operates China's largest online healthcare platform, raised $1.12 billion after pricing its IPO at HK$54.80 a share in what is Hong Kong's largest new listing this year. 
Shares in the company opened at HK$57.30 ($7.30).
Founded in 2014, the company also known as Ping An Good Doctor was among several tech start-ups backed by Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd (HK:2318) (SS:601318).
It delivers healthcare services such as online family doctors and health mall services through its mobile platform and has seen its revenue surge nearly seven times to 1.9 billion yuan ($299.59 million) over the past three years.
It has a nationwide network of healthcare service providers covering 3,100 hospitals, 1,100 health check-up centers, 500 dental clinics and 7,500 pharmacy outlets.
""We are at the stage to acquire more traffic and change consumers' habit of seeing doctors and managing their health,"" Ping An Healthcare Chairman Wang Tao said at the listing ceremony.
The company's home doctor and consumer medical segments are expected to further grow, Wang said, adding that he believed that in the future the company would eventually make a profit.
The Shanghai-based company has posted net losses for the past three consecutive years, as high cost of sales offset a stellar revenue growth.
Ping An Healthcare's debut comes at a time when Hong Kong is implementing new rules to attract more tech and biotech IPOs to the city, away from other major centers like New York and the Chinese mainland.
Hong Kong is set to see a slew of blockbuster tech IPOs over the coming months, including smartphone and smart device maker Xiaomi and on-demand online services provider Meituan-Dianping.
The listing of Good Doctor could pave the way for floats of other Ping An units, such as Lufax, China's biggest online wealth management platform, and Ping An Healthcare Management, a medical data collection and analysis business. 
The Good Doctor has secured seven cornerstone investors including Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC [GIC.UL], Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and U.S. asset manager BlackRock, it said in a filing last week.
It added that proceeds from the IPO would be used to fund acquisitions and strategic alliances as well as for research.

909,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 03, 2018 10:00PM ET</span>",Jack Ma's Free Spending Ways Are Spooking Alibaba Investors,"(Bloomberg) -- Jack Ma’s shopping spree is starting to weigh on Alibaba’s bottom line just as profit and revenue growth ease. And investors have shaved about $60 billion off its market value to voice their displeasure.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. is projected to post its first decline in profit in a year and a half -- the result of folding in major loss-making businesses and heightened spending to fend off a charge by Tencent Holdings Ltd. into retail and payments -- traditionally its turf. While revenue is expected to climb 53 percent to 59 billion yuan ($9.3 billion), that would actually be its smallest gain in seven quarters.
China’s biggest online emporium is trying to spend its way out of slowing growth in its core business. Inroads into logistics, cloud computing, online video and physical retail have come at a cost, eating into margins and pushing the company further from its once-cherished “asset-light” philosophy. Coupled with a global technology sell-off, concerns about its growing spending have clobbered its shares more than 10 percent since a January record high. And that margin decline could well carry into the coming financial year, said Jerry Liu, an analyst with UBS Group AG.
“We expect margins to decline in financial year of 2019 before stabilising and then improving over the long term,” Liu said in a research report. “Most of Alibaba’s initiatives are in the early stages, with significant investment poured into video and payments recently.”
That applies equally to Tencent, which has lost more than $100 billion of market value since its Jan. 23 apex. But it’s Alibaba, which rose a tad in New York on Thursday, that leads Wall Street with $34 billion in short-seller bets.
Ma is in a way channeling fellow e-commerce pioneer Jeff Bezos over at Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., which for years bled losses but assuaged nervous shareholders by sustaining breakneck top-line growth. The idea is to lay the foundation for a web empire spanning all aspects of retail, internet computing and data. John Ho, founder of Janchor Partners Ltd., a $4 billion fund whose 2012 stake in Alibaba has grown several times in value, said the Hangzhou-based behemoth could become a trillion-dollar company in less than a decade.
But things are less assured in the near term. Risk-averse traders have dumped tech stocks globally as trade tensions between China and the U.S. escalate and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).’s Cambridge Analytica debacle spur fears of a regulatory clampdown.
Investors will thus be looking at its full-year revenue guidance when Alibaba reports earnings on Friday. Liu estimates Alibaba’s revenue growth at the low- to mid-40 percent range for fiscal 2019. That’s -- again -- down from the 48 percent that Alibaba’s forecasting for the year ended March.
Ma’s lieutenants have little choice but to continue spending. It’s not just that its main markets are getting saturated, it also needs to fend off Tencent -- in e-commerce, cloud computing, payments, entertainment and now even brick-and-mortar retail. The WeChat operator has dramatically stepped up investment in those fronts.
Alibaba’s decision to take full control of several loss-making companies is another reason margins will continue to thin. It said in April it would seek full control of food delivery service Ele.me, conferring a value of $9.5 billion on a company that’s locked in a cash-burning battle with Tencent-backed Meituan Dianping. Both companies are expanding in neighborhood services and heavily subsidizing restaurant deliveries.
While Ele.me’s consolidation isn’t expected to kick in until the June quarter, Alibaba’s already taking hits from its loss-making Cainiao logistics and Youku video businesses. It’s assumed control of Southeast Asian e-commerce platform Lazada to drive an expansion overseas. And it’s formalizing its relationship with payments affiliate Ant Financial by taking a stake in the internet finance giant.
Finally, Alibaba is splurging on datacenters to maintain its lead in a Chinese cloud computing business JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). estimates could reach 152 billion yuan by 2021. Alibaba alone could account for 60 percent of that market, double its share from last year, it said. It could’ve almost doubled its cloud revenue in the March quarter alone, estimates John Choi, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd.
For now however, investors may continue to handle Alibaba’s stock with kid gloves.
The “recent stock price pressure reflects investor’s concerns about organic growth momentum and blended margin decline,” said Ella Ji, an analyst at China Renaissance Securities in a report.

Trade talks is expected to dominate Friday's agenda once again, as investors keep a close watch on whether the world’s two biggest economies could achieve a breakthrough on the tariff standoff during the second day of negotiations.
Mnuchin said on Friday that the two countries are having a “very good conversation, while a White House official added on Thursday that the atmosphere was “fairly positive”, although any real breakthrough would depend on China’s willingness to deliver its promises of economic change.
“What I heard from the first day, and again they’ve been there for a full day of negotiations, has been fairly positive,” Mark Calabria, chief economist to U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, said. “The difficulty will always be that we will most of the time hear pretty positive things from China and the question is whether they will actually do them. So that’s going to be the tough part.”
It is also reported that the U.S. requested China to lower its tariff rates to boost exports of American goods.
The merchandise trade gap with China widened by 16% to $91.1 billion in the first quarter, according to data released on Thursday. 
The U.S. jobs data due later in the day is likely to be another focus for traders. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to increase by 192,000 jobs in April, after rising only 103,000 in March.
In Asia, Japan remain closed for a public holiday, while China’s Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Component opened 0.2% and 0.1% lower respectively by 9:34PM ET (01:34 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 0.9%.

911,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2018 02:41AM ET</span>","Australia's AMP rejects criminal allegations, names veteran banker chairman","By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) denied allegations it had submitted a doctored report to a regulator and committed a criminal offense, saying an inquiry into the country's financial sector had overstated the wealth manager's involvement.
The rebuttal marks the strongest show of defiance yet by a financial services firm to the quasi-judicial inquiry, or Royal Commission, that has so far forced some of the country's top lenders to apologize over damaging revelations of misconduct.
AMP CEO Craig Meller and Chairwoman Catherine Brenner have both quit in recent weeks following disclosures that the firm misappropriated funds of thousands of clients over a decade by charging them without providing advice, and that it repeatedly lied to the corporate regulator.
The inquiry alleged AMP - the country's largest wealth manager - modified a report by law firm Clayton Utz and submitted it to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) as ""external and independent"".
Their intention was to limit the report's findings about the involvement of AMP's senior executives in misappropriating customer fees, the inquiry heard.
Counsel assisting the commission said last week that, in doing so, AMP had breached provisions of the Corporations Act that carry criminal sanctions.
""AMP strenuously denies the allegation"" by lawyers of the commission that they could find AMP has committed a criminal offense, the company said in a 27-page document on Friday.
ASIC is already investigating AMP over the alleged misappropriation of client fees, so there is no need for the Royal Commission to recommend criminal charges, AMP added.
Australia Treasurer Scott Morrison has described revelations of AMP's misconduct as ""deeply disturbing"" and that this type of behavior could attract ""penalties which include jail time"".
Hours after AMP published its defense, it said it had hired banking industry veteran David Murray, who has presided over a previous inquiry into corporate governance in the bank sector, as its new chairman.
The former chief executive officer of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) would preside over a process of board renewal and the appointment of an additional non-executive director in the near-term.
UTZ REPORT
On the Utz report, AMP said the inquiry's lawyer had overstated the number of emails exchanged between AMP and the law firm related to the drafting of the report.
The inquiry heard AMP and Clayton Utz exchanged some 700 emails during the law firm's investigation, but many of those were automated responses to meeting requests, duplications and progress updates, AMP's submission said.
The firm also said that the counsel assisting the inquiry was wrong to suggest that AMP's board had intervened to remove the names of the CEO and chairwoman from the report.
It was the law firm, not AMP, which chose to remove the name of Meller on grounds that he was not culpable and that including his name ""would attract unnecessary attention"" from the regulator, the submission added.
There is no evidence any member of the board knew of this rationale, AMP said, adding that Brenner's actions in relation to the report ""were appropriate and consistent with good governance"".
The Royal Commission is just a couple of months into what is expected to be a year-long investigation. The Federal Government has said it may, however, extend the deadline. 
The inquiry can make wide-ranging recommendations including legislative changes and on criminal or civil prosecutions.
AMP shares have plunged about 20 percent since the inquiry started in February, wiping off around A$3 billion ($2.3 billion) from the company's market capitalization. 
The stock, however, closed up 0.5 percent on Friday, while the broader market (AXJO) fell 0.5 percent.

912,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2018 12:56AM ET</span>","Asia stocks ease, dollar off highs before U.S. payrolls","By Vidya Ranganathan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian shares stepped back on Friday while the dollar ran into some profit-taking after a strong week of gains as financial markets turned their attention to looming U.S. payrolls data for fresh catalysts. 
Investors were cautious after a largely weak performance on Wall Street overnight as some disappointing earnings reports offset strong economic data, while bond yields slid after a surprising slowdown in euro zone inflation. 
The U.S. dollar weakened from a recent four-month peak against major currencies during a choppy session a day after the Federal Reserve ended a policy meeting with no change in rates and a less hawkish statement than investors had anticipated.
Disappointing U.S. company earnings, upbeat data on factory orders and the U.S. trade balance as well as the underwhelming eurozone inflation data made for a challenging trading environment. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) was down 0.2 percent, and looked set to end the week marginally lower, while the dollar slipped 0.16 percent against the yen to 109.01 .
Indonesian stocks (JKSE) led the declines, falling as much as 1.5 percent in early trading before recouping some of those losses. 
Regional trading was relatively quieter as Japan was on holiday. 
""The price action since the FOMC statement indicates a real division of opinion in markets over the US dollar outlook,"" said Sean Callow, a strategist at Westpac. 
The Fed's reminder that its inflation target was symmetric was a clear negative for Treasury yields, and so the U.S. currency's recovery was encouraging for dollar bulls, Callow said. 
Yet the dollar had failed to breach key levels such as 110 versus the yen, $1.20 against the euro and $0.75 versus the Australian dollar , he added.
""A 13-month low in eurozone inflation should have been a big boost for the dollar index - it was not. The payrolls report may not resolve this market battle."" 
The U.S. dollar had erased all its 2018 losses in the past two weeks on expectations the Fed will continue to raise rates, even as other major central banks around the world, including the European Central Bank, take longer to reduce stimulus.
The dollar index (DXY) has risen about 1 percent so far this week and is on track for a third straight weekly gain. 
JOB AND WAGES
The focus for markets will be on the U.S. jobs data due later in the global day, with the April report likely to underscore labor market strength. Non-farm payrolls probably increased by 192,000 jobs last month, according to a Reuters survey of economists, after rising only 103,000 in March.
But it will be the wages figure that could shift views on future Fed hikes, analysts said. 
""A further pick-up in the pace of wage gains could be the 'smoking gun' for the Fed to express any shift away from 'roughly balanced' risks to inflation,"" said Mizuho analyst Vishnu Varathan in a note.
""For now, we expect that reactions may still be subdued given that the runway of evidence remains short; and so the bearish UST and bullish USD trades may not be taking off aggressively just yet."" 
Investors were also keeping a close watch on U.S.-China trade talks, though analysts said they had little confidence that the U.S. delegation in Beijing, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, will achieve any breakthrough on the tariff standoff between the world's two biggest economies.
Chinese shares nudged lower, with the blue-chips (CSI300) off 0.2 percent and Shanghai's SSE (LON:SSE) Composite (SSEC) down 0.1 percent.
The euro (EUR=) was flat on the day at $1.1991 and has lost 0.74 percent in a month. 
Overnight, Argentina's peso , which has been among the worst hit emerging market currencies during the past couple of months on rising U.S. yields, tumbled again to a record low.
The currency has been hit by a lack of investor confidence in Latin America's No. 3 economy, which has been blighted by one of the world's highest inflation rates. 
Argentina's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 300 basis points to 33.25 percent on Thursday, but the second steep rate increase in less than a week failed to stop the peso currency from plunging.
Elsewhere, U.S. crude (CLc1) dipped 7 cents to $68.36 a barrel, while Brent crude (LCOc1) down a shade at $73.59.

Gold was slightly higher. Spot gold  was traded at $1313.4 per ounce.

The benchmark KSE100 Index will probably fall 10-15 percent in the run-up to elections in July or August, said Muhammad Rameez, the head of international sales at Foundation Securities Pvt. in Karachi. That would wipe out this year’s 10.6 percent gain in local-currency terms, the best performance in Asia.
“A chain of events including politics and economic vulnerabilities, coupled with a lack of earnings growth” will spur drops, said Rameez, who correctly predicted declines in Pakistani stocks before its upgrade to emerging-market status by MSCI Inc. last year. Losses might not be as bad if a planned tax amnesty scheme is approved and implemented in the next few months, he said.
A caretaker government will take over June 1 before the election and will be tasked with managing an economy where the current-account deficit widened by about 50 percent in the nine months through March. Shrinking foreign-exchange reserves are also putting pressure on the rupee, which has already been devalued twice in the last six months.
The lack of a clear frontrunner among the three main parties is also adding to uncertainty among investors. Tehreek-e-Insaf -- the party of ex-cricketer Imran Khan -- now has a better chance of leading a coalition government than Pakistan Muslim League, the party of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who was ousted over corruption charges, Exotix Capital said in a report last week.
“We are facing a significant trade imbalance, pressure on the rupee, and the issue with regards to depleting reserves,” said Farid Ahmed Khan, chief executive officer at HBL Asset Management Ltd. in Karachi. “The market is certainly cautious as to what will happen when the caretaker setup emerges as it will be difficult for them to raise short-term funding and shore up the reserves.”

SEOUL (Reuters) - Shares in  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) dipped slightly on Friday but trading activity surged after a 50:1 stock split aimed at making it easier for retail investors to buy into the South Korean technology giant. 
The shares were trading at 52,200 won ($48.50), down 1.5 percent from the basis price of 53,000 won per share, which Korea Exchange said was calculated by dividing the shares' last pre-split closing price by 50. The benchmark KOSPI (KS11) was down 0.6 percent.
Analysts said trading volumes jumped as more investors traded, and attributed the slightly weaker share price to broad concerns about slowing memory chip market conditions since Samsung Electronics share trading was halted after April 27. 
""I bought 10 shares in Samsung Electronics. After I return from my military service hopefully it'll be worth enough money to buy a car,"" said Kim Tae-sik, a college student. 
Retail investors also commented on social media and investor forums, with one saying that ""the Samsung Electronics trading screen is like a madhouse,"" while others debated whether to buy now or wait. 
As of 0120 GMT, turnover for Samsung shares amounted to 1.08 trillion won ($1.00 billion), accounting for 27 percent of the main board's KOSPI total turnover. Samsung accounted for an average of 8 percent of total turnover in the one month before the split, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
Shares in the global leader in semiconductors, televisions and smartphones traded at 2.65 million won ($2,467.48) each prior to the split, putting them out of reach of retail investors. 
Once known as the ""emperor stock"" for its high price, South Korean media renamed the shares the ""people's stock"" after the split. 
Analysts said Samsung's recent efforts to boost shareholder returns would encourage retail investors to take a larger portion of the company than they had previously. 
Samsung had 70 trillion won ($65 billion) in net cash at the end of March and is giving out yearly dividends of 9.6 trillion won as part of a three-year shareholder return policy for 2018-2020. 
By dispersing shares among a greater number of investors, the split also could help owner family members and affiliate companies, the controlling shareholders, fend off attempts by other shareholders to have a greater say over the company's affairs, analysts said. 
""In the case of Samsung Electronics, whose affiliates control about a 20 percent stake, and only 15 percent stakes have voting rights, the stock split is meaningful,"" said Lee Seung-woo, analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities.
Samsung Electronics accounted for around 20 percent of the main KOSPI (KS11) index's market capitalization as of early Friday.

915,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 08:55PM ET</span>",Down and out: CEFC staff go unpaid as once-high flying company flounders,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - CEFC China Energy, the once high-flying conglomerate that is now conducting fire sales of its assets following an investigation into its chief, appears to be hitting rock bottom. 
Staff have not been paid for two months and are being offered severance packages, sources close to the company say, as creditors scramble to collect debts amid growing regulatory scrutiny of the firm.
Interviews with six current and former employees paint a picture of tumult at the ex-Fortune 500 company, with a growing malaise among staff members after its chairman, Ye Jianming, was revealed in February to be under investigation for suspected economic crimes.
CEFC, which in September last year agreed to buy a $9.1 billion stake in the Russian oil major Rosneft, morphed in a few years from a niche fuel trader into a fast-growing diversified conglomerate with assets across the globe and more than 30,000 employees.
But now, unhelmed, apparently out of political favor, and at the mercy of circling creditors, CEFC is trying to shed assets in an effort to repay its extensive debt as banks and auditors pore over its financial statements. CEFC did not respond to requests for comment. 
On April 26, staff at the Shanghai headquarters were offered a severance package of one month salary for each year worked, plus an extra month, said four people with knowledge of the matter. All declined to be identified by name because they were not authorized to speak to the media. 
The deadline for acceptance was one day later.
""The contract is effective immediately,"" said one person who accepted the offer. 
Staff are also seeing other benefits, such as preferential rental rates for apartments slip away, the employees said. 
At the end of April, a CEFC official said CEFC may cut half of its 30,000-strong workforce. 
The swift crumbling of CEFC, which was founded in the coastal province of Fujian in 2002, has led to an exodus of employees and staff cuts. 
For those who are left, hoping that things might turn around, a general malaise has set in, as mounds of paperwork for asset sales pile up, according to three people with knowledge of the situation. 
""No one is working anymore,"" said one person who accepted the severance package. 
""Some people are looking for new jobs, some people are reading books,"" the person said. ""Some people are even openly playing cards."" 
WORKFORCE BLUES 
Inside the plush, centrally located offices of CEFC in Shanghai, staff quickly realized that their roles were changing in early March.
China Development Bank, CEFC's largest creditor, together with Shanghai Lixin Accounting Firm, dispatched around 100 people to CEFC's offices, where they stayed for a month sifting through financial documents, according to one person with direct knowledge. 
""We just had to serve them,"" said one person who is still at CEFC, adding that staff were told to be compliant and provide them with whatever they needed. Some employees found themselves having to handle disgruntled creditors, fielding questions they could not answer, and facing queues of people in the office worried about their loans. 
On Thursday morning, creditors organized a sit-in at the Shanghai headquarters around 9am, according to one person with direct knowledge. They were disbanded by the police, but CEFC employees were unable to enter the building during the protest. 
Employees in CEFC's once-acquisitive investment team are handling the sale of assets they helped to acquire, and wondering if sales deals they forged will be unwound once a new plan for the company is in place. 
""Nobody knows what's happening. It's a case of wait and see,"" said one person in the team. 
SHOULD I STAY OR SHOULD I GO? 
CEFC had been an attractive employer even though salaries were not high, according to multiple current and former employees. There were opportunities to travel to places like Europe and Hong Kong. 
For some mid-level employees in the research department, salaries were in the range of 300,000 yuan a year, which is below the market rate, according to one employee. But junior staff in investment teams who dealt with acquisitions could receive bonuses of up to five months' of their salary.
Some division managers at the company's Shanghai headquarters and Beijing office have told staff at internal meetings to pursue new jobs. 
Those who have decided not to take the severance package will have to wait for the results of how the company will be handled by the government and creditors. 
All teams reporting directly to Ye, the chairman now under investigation, will likely be axed, said one person with direct knowledge of the matter. 
In the firm's internal WeChat group, some staff dealt with the turmoil at the office with a touch of humor. 

""At least we're not the bankers,"" one person said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T (NYSE:T) told a federal judge late Thursday it should reject any request by the U.S. Justice Department to force it to divest its DirecTV unit or Turner networks as part of approving its proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX).
The publication of the closing briefs from both sides brings to end the trial over a deal which took on broader political significance immediately after it was announced in October 2016. 
President Donald Trump, a frequent critic of Time Warner's CNN network, attacked the deal on the campaign trail last year, vowing that as president the Justice Department would block it.
Last week, a Justice Department attorney said Judge Richard Leon should consider requiring AT&T to make a “partial divestiture.”
The Justice Department had urged AT&T last year to divest either DirecTV, the largest pay TV company with more than 20 million subscribers, or TimeWarner's Turner networks because the government said AT&T could use Time Warner content as a ""weapon"" to raise prices. 
The Justice Department had demanded divestitures because it argued that ATT would have the ability to raise prices on Time Warner content for pay TV rivals.  
""Divestitures here would destroy the very consumer value this merger is designed to unlock. Divesting DirecTV would eliminate the price decrease for millions of DirecTV consumers predicted by the government itself, and divesting Turner would eliminate the content innovations and the advertising benefits that put downward pressure on Turner prices,"" the company said in a court filing.
Leon is expected to decide by June 12 whether to approve the merger. The Justice Department has said it is illegal because consumers would end up paying more for television while AT&T and Time Warner say they need the deal to compete with internet titans like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)
""The government did not even begin to make a credible case that the merger would likely harm competition, substantially or even just a little,"" AT&T said in its closing brief. ""This is not a close case. The government failed to meet its burden for multiple independent reasons.""
The Justice Department's final brief was filed under seal late Thursday and a redacted version has not yet been made public.
The government argued the deal would mean that consumers will pay more since AT&T could elect to raise prices for Time Warner content to other pay TV companies, like  Charter Communications  (NASDAQ:CHTR) or Cox. The Justice Department has also said that AT&T could refuse to license the content to new, cheaper online services.
AT&T, for its part, has argued that Time Warner's licensing fees were too valuable for the company to forego. Time Warner reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue in late April, an increase of 10 percent to $3.34 billion, because of advertisers associated with college basketball games.
AT&T sought to assuage critics by offering to submit to third-party arbitration any disagreement with distributors over the pricing for Time Warner's networks and to promise not to black out programing during arbitration. The offer is good for seven years.
Judge Leon, who asked few questions during the trial, asked witnesses several times if they felt the arbitration proposal was adequate.

Leon rejected a request by AT&T to force the Justice Department to turn over records that could have shed light on whether Trump pressured the Justice Department to try to block the deal.

(Reuters) - CBS Corp (N:CBS), which is in tough merger talks with Viacom Inc (O:VIAB), topped revenue and profit estimates on Thursday, helped by healthy ad sales and higher revenue from affiliate and subscription fees.
The New York-based company, whose shows include ""Big Bang Theory"" and ""NCIS"" reported strong results as it and Viacom, which are both controlled by Sumner Redstone and his daughter Shari, have begun tough negotiations over price and management of a combined company. 
Shares of the company were slightly higher in after-hours trading. 
CBS executives declined to comment on merger talks with Viacom on the analyst call Thursday, and Chief Executive Leslie Moonves was upbeat about the company's ability to continue to grow based on its current strategy of increasing revenue outside of advertising.
""The strategy that we have laid out for you is clearly working and the good news is that there is much more to come,"" Moonves said on the call.
The owner of the most-watched U.S. television network said affiliate and subscription fees revenue – which includes revenue from cable and satellite TV operators and from online streaming providers, including its own All Access offering – rose 16.3 percent in the first quarter.
More than two-thirds of subscribers to CBS' online streaming offerings are electing to pay more for the services to watch them without ads, said CBS Chief Operating Officer Joseph Ianniello, on the call. 
""This number should only increase,"" he said, which should help reduce dependence on advertising for revenue.
Advertising revenue rose 8.1 percent to $1.73 billion and CBS executives said they expected continue growth in advertising beyond 2018.
CBS reported net income from continuing operations of $511 million, or $1.32 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, up from $454 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, CBS reported a profit of $1.34 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.19, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

CBS said revenue rose 12.5 percent to $3.76 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $3.64 billion.

920,By Investing.com,"<span>May 03, 2018 04:38PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets Friday, May 4.
1. It's Jobs Friday
Investors will likely look to nonfarm payrolls data due 08:30 am ET – arguably one of the most important economic events of the month – to gauge whether tightness in the labor market, boosted wage growth in April.
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to show 189,000 jobs were created in April.
Economists forecast the jobless rate to decline to 4% while average hourly earnings for April is expected to cooled 0.2% from 0.3% in the previous month.
Morgan Stanley estimated nonfarm payrolls to come in at 145,000 amid expectations that April’s adverse weather likely weighed on some sectors, including retail and manufacturing.
Investors will assess the nonfarm payrolls report for clues about the strength of the economy which could provide fresh direction for the dollar, the policy sensitive United States 2-Year bond and the US stock market.
2. Alibaba: Open Sesame
 Alibaba  Group Holdings Ltd (NYSE:BABA) will be one of the main names in focus on Friday as the Far East e-commerce giant is slated to reveal fiscal fourth quarter earnings before U.S. markets open.
Alibaba is expected to report earnings of $0.84 per share on revenue of $9.28 billion for the quarter.
Expectations for revenue growth are high as the Hangzhou-based company has generated above 50% growth for seven quarters in a row, driven by its ecommerce platform – responsible for the bulk of total revenue.
The growth of its e-commerce platform relies on a sustained increase in the number of users that frequent its platform and the length of time they spend on the platform, so investors will likely scrutinize the firm’s monthly active users (MAUs) growth.
Alibaba increased its monthly active users (MAU) by 31 million quarter over quarter in the fiscal third quarter, to a total of 580 million.
Cloud – the second largest source of revenue – will also garner attention after the segment grew 104% year-on-year in the fiscal third quarter.
Investors are also keen for an update on the firm’s efforts to merge online and offline commerce as part of its “new retail” strategy.
3. Baker Hughes Rig Count Data to Signal Further US Output Expansion?
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand after data last week showed the number of U.S. oil rigs rose for the fourth week in a row.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.

922,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 04:31PM ET</span>",Hedge fund heaps criticism on Tesla after Musk's conference call,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A small hedge fund manager who has long been betting against Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) on Thursday redoubled his call for the stock to fall to zero, comments that came as investors were already hammering the electric car maker. 
Speaking at the Kase Learning Short Selling Conference in New York, Stanphyl Capital Partners founder Mark Spiegel criticized Tesla's financials and said they are ""worsening"" under heavy competition from luxury automakers. 
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday raised eyebrows by cutting off analysts' questions about capital requirements after the company reported a record loss for the first quarter. 
Tesla shares tumbled as much as 8 percent on Thursday as investors worried about the fallout from Musk's behavior on the earnings conference call. 
Spiegel began his presentation at the private investment conference by saying ""That was the funniest friggin' call."" 
He then devoted his allotted 15 minutes to disparaging Musk and arguing that Tesla has no protective moat to give it a competitive advantage, even when it came to technology. 
Spiegel is not the only one betting against Tesla, with the stock listed as the biggest U.S. equity short, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.
Tesla's stock price dropped to $283 on Thursday, down from a record of $389 reached in September. The retreat comes as a relief for some short-sellers after the stock climbed for much of 2017. 
The latest share move wiped out Tesla short-sellers' 2018 losses, bringing year-to-date paper profits to $683 million, according to S3 Partners. 

Prominent funds betting against Tesla include Jim Chanos' Kynikos Associates LP and David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital.

The partnership was struck before Amazon bought rival specialty grocery Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.7 billion last summer. Amazon Prime Now had delivered from 15 of its 298 Sprouts stores.

Amazon Prime Now provides free delivery, with some restrictions, for subscribers of Amazon's $99 Prime service that also offers free video streaming and other perks. Instacart users in Los Angeles pay a delivery fee of $5.99 to $7.99 at Sprouts, or can choose to pay a $149 membership fee.

Its new net sales forecast calls for growth in the range of 10.5 percent to 11.5 percent versus 11.5 percent to 12.5 percent previously.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A Massachusetts hedge fund manager was sentenced on Thursday to six years in prison for defrauding investors in a scheme that prosecutors said cost his clients over $10.5 million and allowed him to fund a lavish lifestyle.
Yasuna Murakami, who managed MC2 Capital Management LLC and another investment advisory firm, wiped away tears before being sentenced by U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock in Boston as he apologized for the harm he caused his victims.
""I'm deeply ashamed of my crime,"" Murakami said in court.
According to securities regulators, from 2007 to 2016, Murakami and a business partner operated three hedge funds through two Cambridge, Massachusetts-based investment advisory businesses, MC2 Capital and MC2 Canada Capital Management LLC.
Prosecutors said that Murakami, 45, schemed to defraud investors in a hedge fund he set up in 2011 that was managed by MC2 Canada and that allowed U.S. investors to gain exposure to a fund overseen by Toronto-based Donville Kent Asset Management.
After soliciting money from investors for MC2 Capital Canadian Opportunities Fund, Murakami misused investments for personal expenses like international travel and high-end department stores, according to a criminal complaint.
He also used investor funds to make personal investments in the MC2 Canadian fund; to pay for a black Nissan GT-R sports car; cover the costs of international travel; and to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors, prosecutors said.
""He went to great lengths to con new and existing investors out of their retirement savings, out of their 401(K)s and IRAs, knowing full well he was never going to be able to pay that money back,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jordi de Llano said in court.
Prosecutors said the multi-year scheme resulted in more than $10.5 million in losses, an amount equal to what Woodlock on Thursday ordered Murakami to pay in restitution to his victims.
Murakami's arrest in May 2017 came after Massachusetts state securities regulators earlier that year accused him of operating a Ponzi scheme. He pleaded guilty in January to one count of wire fraud.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also filed a related lawsuit accusing Murakami and his partner, Avi Chiat, of defrauding more than 50 investors in their three funds after raising more than $15 million.
The SEC's case against Chiat is pending. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
The case is U.S. v. Murakami, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 17-cr-10346.

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Broadway producer Howard Kagan said he has raised his last-minute bid for the Weinstein Company in another push to acquire the TV and film producer, which filed for bankruptcy in the wake of harassment claims against co-founder Harvey Weinstein.
The Weinstein Co on Tuesday selected Lantern Capital's $310 million bid for the company and rejected an offer from Kagan that he said was worth $315 million. Kagan's initial bid, made through his Inclusion Media LLC business, lacked a deposit and financing, according to the Weinstein Co.
""We have increased our offer to $325 million, matching Lantern's cash bid and providing the cash needed to satisfy Lantern's alleged breakup fee claims,"" Kagan said in a statement to Reuters on Thursday. 
Kagan has not yet made a deposit or shown he has committed financing for his new bid, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The money raised from the sale will be used to pay off the Weinstein Co's creditors.
Harvey Weinstein, once one of Hollywood's most influential men, has been accused of rape and other sexual misconduct by more than 70 women. He has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.
Kagan said his bid would include compensation for harassment plaintiffs.

930,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 07:18PM ET</span>",Ex-Volkswagen CEO Winterkorn charged in U.S. over diesel scandal,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday disclosed the filing of criminal charges against former Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn, accusing him of conspiring to cover up the German automaker's diesel emissions cheating.
The indictment, filed in secret in March, was unsealed in U.S. District Court on Thursday as Volkswagen held its annual meeting in Germany. Winterkorn resigned days after the scandal over polluting vehicles in the United States became public in September 2015.
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Environmental Protection Administration chief Scott Pruitt and other senior Trump administration official issued statements criticizing VW with the indictment, which marks a rare instance of a CEO being subjected to criminal prosecution for corporate behavior.
""If you try to deceive the United States, then you will pay a heavy price,"" Sessions said.
In contrast with Volkswagen, no individuals were charged at Toyota Motor Corp in connection with its sudden unintended acceleration scandal or at General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) for the cover-up of a deadly ignition switch defect.
The federal government's decisions not to prosecute senior financial industry executives in connection with the 2007-2009 financial crisis also has drawn fire from advocates of tougher measures to deter corporate wrongdoing.
The U.S. indictment of Winterkorn is likely to be largely symbolic. As a German citizen, he is almost certain not to come to the United States and to seek protection under German extradition law. The former CEO is also under investigation by German authorities. 
Volkswagen settled criminal charges with the U.S. Justice Department in 2017 and agreed to a $4.3 billion payment. In total, VW has agreed to spend more than $25 billion in the United States to address claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers. 
The company also has offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. Many are now stored in parking lots around the United States.
Volkswagen has been fighting to move past the emissions scandal, vowing to spend billions on a number of new electric vehicles as it has seen U.S. sales rebound. The indictment reopens the question of whether other senior VW executives knew about the scandal, which threatens to prolong the crisis.
Winterkorn, 70, is charged with four felony counts, including conspiracy to defraud the United States, wire fraud and violating the Clean Air Act from at least May 2006 through November 2015 after the company admitted using illicit software that allowed Volkswagen diesel vehicles to emit excess pollution without detection. 
A lawyer for Winterkorn in Germany did not immediately comment. Winterkorn in January 2017 told German lawmakers he had not been informed of the cheating early and would have halted it had he been aware, but he did not say when he first became aware of the issue.
A Volkswagen spokesman in Germany said the company ""continues to cooperate with investigations"" of individuals but would not comment on Thursday's charges.
""TOP OF THE COMPANY""
Sessions said in a statement that the charges against Winterkorn showed that ""Volkswagen's scheme to cheat its legal requirements went all the way to the top of the company.""
The indictment describes a July 27, 2015 meeting at which Volkswagen employees presented PowerPoint slides to Winterkorn and ""other senior VW AG management at an in-person meeting at VW's headquarters in Wolfsburg."" The meeting provided a ""clear picture"" of how the company was deceiving U.S. regulators about software used to rig emissions tests of Volkswagen diesel vehicles, it said.
The indictment also alleges that VW employees recommended the company seek to get approval for 2016 diesel models from U.S. regulators without revealing the existence of the cheating software. Winterkorn agreed to the plan, the indictment said.
The indictment also states that Winterkorn was informed of the emissions cheating by a memo sent in May 2014. Winterkorn has said he did not learn of the cheating until late August 2015. 
VW's new chief executive on Thursday in Berlin, Herbert Diess, vowed to make the carmaker ""more honest"" as it fights to recover from the diesel emissions scandal, but wary investors called for outside vetting of steps to restore its reputation.
Volkswagen had initially suggested that only lower-level executives knew of the diesel emissions cheating. But the indictment alleges Winterkorn was informed of VW’s misconduct in May 2014 and in July 2015 and he agreed with other senior VW executives ""to continue to perpetrate the fraud and deceive U.S. regulators,"" prosecutors said.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan in Detroit said Winterkorn was not in custody. In total, nine people have been charged and two former Volkswagen executives have pleaded guilty in the case and been sentenced to prison terms. One Italian citizen, former Audi manager Giovanni Pamio, is in Germany awaiting extradition.
Six former Volkswagen executives charged, including Winterkorn, are believed to be in Germany and have avoided facing U.S. prosecutors.

The September 2015 disclosure that VW had for at least six years intentionally cheated on emissions tests did massive damage to the company's reputation around the world and prompted massive compensation and vehicle refit costs. VW halted the sale of new diesels in the United States after the scandal.

(Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors cracking down on deceptive mortgage bond trading practices on Thursday suffered dual losses as a federal appeals court overturned an ex-Jefferies Group[JGLL.UL] trader's conviction and a jury acquitted a former Cantor Fitzgerald [CNTOR.UL] employee.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York overturned former Jefferies Group trader Jesse Litvak's second criminal conviction for defrauding a customer about bond prices, saying jurors had wrongly been allowed to hear irrelevant evidence.
Shortly after the court ruling, a federal jury in Hartford, Connecticut, acquitted former Cantor Fitzgerald trader David Demos, 37, of charges that he lied to clients in connection with mortgage bond transactions he handled for them.
The developments marked the latest setback for federal prosecutors in Connecticut pursuing cases against traders accused of lying to customers about the prices of mortgage-backed securities they had bought and sold.
Jose Baez, Demos' lawyer, contended prosecutors in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis overreached in seeking to prosecute the traders over what he called typical price haggling practices.
""This wasn't a crime,"" he said.
The 2nd Circuit previously overturned Litvak's initial 2014 conviction, prompting a retrial. Jurors convicted Litvak, 43, in 2017 on one of the 10 securities fraud counts he faced, and he was sentenced to two years in prison.
The latest ruling left open the possibility of prosecutors trying Litvak for a third time. Tom Carson, Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham's spokesman, said prosecutors were reviewing the decision.
Litvak's lawyer had no comment.
Since 2013, federal prosecutors have announced criminal charges against eight traders accused of cheating customers on prices of mortgage-backed securities following the financial crisis.
Prosecutors accused Litvak of lying to customers about bond prices from 2009 to 2011, hoping to boost his own pay while generating $2.25 million of illegal profit for Jefferies.
The single count on which he was convicted concerned a bond transaction with Invesco Ltd. In Thursday's ruling, the 2nd Circuit said a lower-court judge improperly allowed jurors to hear testimony that an Invesco employee believed Litvak was acting on the employee's behalf.
That belief was incorrect, and therefore irrelevant, but could have confused the jury or turned it against Litvak, U.S. Circuit Judge Ralph Winter wrote for the three-judge panel.

Jefferies, a unit of Leucadia National Corp (NYSE:LUK), in 2014 agreed to pay $25 million to resolve U.S. criminal and civil probes into how it supervised Litvak and other traders.

Not only has the S&P 500 Index breached its 200-day moving average, but the Cboe Volatility Index -- the VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge -- leapt from below 15 intraday on Wednesday to above 18 in trading on Thursday.
As Twitter user OddStats notes, the last time this happened in consecutive sessions was Feb. 2-5, when a record spike in the VIX catalyzed the biggest one-day drop in the benchmark U.S. stock gauge since 2011.
The February move heralded the onset of heightened volatility after a prolonged period of tranquility. That volatility tsunami also forced the closure of the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term exchange-traded notes, known by the trading symbol XIV, and other exchange-traded products that allowed investors to bet on enduring market calm. This week’s occurrence of the same dynamic suggests a return to that low-volatility world is not at hand.
Historically, though, such jumps from below 15 to above 18 the next day have marked good buying opportunities. The S&P 500 Index has tended to rise over the following week and three months, based on previous occurrences going back to 1990, according to data compiled by Oddstats and Bloomberg."

Lidl and rival discount supermarket chain Aldi have been ploughing ahead with investment in other countries, especially in Britain, where they have been taking market share from the traditional players there.
Schwarz Gruppe said in a brief statement on Thursday that last year sales rose 7.4 percent to 96.9 billion euros, of which 74.6 billion came from Lidl, which has 10,460 stores in Europe and the United States.
The group invested 7 billion euros last year and said it was aiming for a similar amount this year. 
Lidl plans to add about 300 or 350 new stores this year and increase its product range to 2,500 products from 1,800 currently, Schwarz Gruppe CEO Klaus Gehrig told German Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. 
""The pressure to change is greater than ever,"" he was quoted as saying, adding that Aldi had shown the way when it came to increasing the product range.

935,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 03, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Jack Ma's Free Spending Ways Are Spooking Alibaba's Investors,"(Bloomberg) -- Jack Ma’s shopping spree is starting to weigh on Alibaba’s bottom line just as profit and revenue growth ease. And investors have shaved $61 billion off its market value to voice their displeasure.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. is projected to post its first decline in profit in a year and a half -- the result of folding in major loss-making businesses and heightened spending to fend off a charge by Tencent Holdings Ltd. into retail and payments -- traditionally its turf. While revenue is expected to climb 53 percent to 59 billion yuan ($9.3 billion), that would actually be its smallest gain in seven quarters.
China’s biggest online emporium is trying to spend its way out of slowing growth in its core business. Inroads into logistics, cloud computing, online video and physical retail have come at a cost, eating into margins and pushing the company further from its once-cherished “asset-light” philosophy. Coupled with a global technology sell-off, concerns about its growing spending have clobbered its shares more than 10 percent since a January record high. And that margin decline could well carry into the coming financial year, said Jerry Liu, an analyst with UBS Group AG.
“We expect margins to decline in financial year of 2019 before stabilising and then improving over the long term,” Liu said in a research report. “Most of Alibaba’s initiatives are in the early stages, with significant investment poured into video and payments recently.”
That applies equally to Tencent, which has lost more than $100 billion of market value since its Jan. 23 apex.
Ma is in a way channeling fellow e-commerce pioneer Jeff Bezos over at Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., which for years bled losses but assuaged nervous shareholders by sustaining breakneck top-line growth. The idea is to lay the foundation for a web empire spanning all aspects of retail, internet computing and data. John Ho, founder of Janchor Partners Ltd., a $4 billion fund whose 2012 stake in Alibaba has grown several times in value, said the Hangzhou-based behemoth could become a trillion-dollar company in less than a decade.
But things are less assured in the near term. Risk-averse traders have dumped tech stocks globally as trade tensions between China and the U.S. escalate and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).’s Cambridge Analytica debacle spur fears of a regulatory clampdown.
Investors will thus be looking at its full-year revenue guidance when Alibaba reports earnings on Friday. Liu estimates Alibaba’s revenue growth at the low- to mid-40 percent range for fiscal 2019. That’s -- again -- down from the 48 percent that Alibaba’s forecasting for the year ended March.
Ma’s lieutenants have little choice but to continue spending. It’s not just that its main markets are getting saturated, it also needs to fend off Tencent -- in e-commerce, cloud computing, payments, entertainment and now even brick-and-mortar retail. The WeChat operator has dramatically stepped up investment in those fronts.
Alibaba’s decision to take full control of several loss-making companies is another reason margins will continue to thin. It said in April it would seek full control of food delivery service Ele.me, conferring a value of $9.5 billion on a company that’s locked in a cash-burning battle with Tencent-backed Meituan Dianping. Both companies are expanding in neighborhood services and heavily subsidizing restaurant deliveries.
While Ele.me’s consolidation isn’t expected to kick in until the June quarter, Alibaba’s already taking hits from its loss-making Cainiao logistics and Youku video businesses. It’s assumed control of Southeast Asian e-commerce platform Lazada to drive an expansion overseas. And it’s formalizing its relationship with payments affiliate Ant Financial by taking a stake in the internet finance giant.
Finally, Alibaba is splurging on datacenters to maintain its lead in a Chinese cloud computing business JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). estimates could reach 152 billion yuan by 2021. Alibaba alone could account for 60 percent of that market, double its share from last year, it said. It could’ve almost doubled its cloud revenue in the March quarter alone, estimates John Choi, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd.
For now however, investors may continue to handle Alibaba’s stock with kid gloves.
The “recent stock price pressure reflects investor’s concerns about organic growth momentum and blended margin decline,” said Ella Ji, an analyst at China Renaissance Securities in a report."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Short-sellers who had targeted Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) logged a $700 million paper profit on Thursday after the stock fell nearly 9 percent a day after Chief Executive Elon Musk stunned analysts by dodging ""boring"" questions about the electric car maker's financial outlook.
The windfall wiped out short-sellers' 2018 losses on Tesla, the biggest U.S. equity short, bringing year-to-date paper profits to $683 million, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at financial analytics firm S3 Partners.
Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares with the hope of buying them back later at a lower price.
Tesla's shares and bonds slid on Thursday as investors took Musk to task for cutting off analysts' questions and grappled with concerns over Tesla's ability to raise money in the future. 
In a bizarre conference call, the iconoclastic CEO described questions about Tesla's capital requirements as ""boring"" after Tesla, which also makes solar technology, reported a record loss of $709.6 million, or $4.19 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31.
""Don't let Musk's conference call theatrics fool you. He did not want investors to focus on his rapidly deteriorating finances,"" prominent short-seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates LP told Reuters in an email.
""Tesla's quick ratio dropped to 0.38 and their (Altman) z-score is approaching 1.0,"" Chanos said. 
The so-called quick ratio is a commonly used indicator of short-term liquidity, while an Altman z-score is a combination of weighted business ratios that is used to estimate the likelihood of financial distress.
""Both are indicative of a company in financial distress,"" said Chanos.
Chanos told Reuters in November he continued to add to his short position in Tesla throughout 2017.
EXPENSIVE SHORT
The borrowing cost for Tesla is around 3.69 percent, up from about 1 percent at the start of the year, putting it among the top 5 percent most-expensive stocks on the Russell 3000 index to short, according to S3 Partners.
Shorts have to shell out $1.22 million every day to keep their position on, the most for any stock in the Russell 3000 Index, according to S3 Partners data.
Selling Tesla short has not always paid off. Shorts logged $2.3 billion in mark-to-market losses in 2017, as the shares soared 45.7 percent for the year.
But the stock has lost 9 percent in 2018 so far as investors fretted about issues such as a federal probe of a fatal crash on March 23 in California involving one of its vehicles and a downgrade of its credit position by Moody's Investors Service.
Emboldened by production setbacks at the company, short sellers have boosted short interest in the stock by $2.5 billion, or 26 percent, for the year. 
That took the overall short interest to $11.94 billion, enlarging what had been, off and on since March 2016, the largest equity bear bet in U.S. markets, according to S3 Partners data.
Options traders also boosted their bearish bets against Tesla in recent weeks.
Investor Christopher Irons, founder of independent investigative research website quoththeravenresearch.com, said he had a small position in deep out-of-the money puts on Tesla, that makes money if the stock crashes.
Musk's remarks during the analyst call shook investors' confidence in Tesla, Irons said.

""Being a public company is a privilege and if you are going to take the good of being a public company, you owe it to the public to answer their questions,"" said Irons.

First job: Mucking horse stalls
I have always been obsessed with horses, but riding was an expensive hobby that my parents were just not going to fund. So when I was 13, I was allowed to get a job mucking stalls at a little stable in my hometown on Long Island. I got paid something like $35 a week and used that money to pay for riding lessons. I never even saw any actual cash.
To this day, I still love riding. As a busy person with four kids, I have a pretty crazy lifestyle. It is nice to be able to go somewhere and only focus on one thing. I find horses very relaxing because they are very sensitive animals and you have to really be there in the moment with them.
The woman I worked for at the stable was very demanding and set a high standard for quality. That is a good lesson to learn when you are 13 years old and in a workplace for the first time. She took things so seriously. There was never any half-assing it, even if you were just shoveling manure.

First job: Handling rental properties
In high school, I spent most of my weekends working alongside my siblings at my parents’ rental property business. During the week, my dad worked full time as an engineer, and my mom worked full time taking care of us. But because it was so important to them for all four of us to attend college, they started a business on the side to help save for tuitions.
My duties included mowing lawns, scrubbing floors, cleaning ovens, painting walls, and whatever else it took to get those rental houses in shape. (I’m still pretty handy with a scrub brush and some Easy-Off.)
But my favorite part of the job was keeping the books, because that’s how I got into computers. When I was 16, my dad brought home an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) III and taught me how to use VisiCalc to keep their accounts. This was long before most families had personal computers. 
I don’t think it’s overstating it to say it changed my life. I knew right away that I wanted to work in tech when I grew up.
In fact, my first real job — as in, not for my parents — was teaching kids how to code, which turned into a lifelong passion for computer science. And I’m grateful to them every day for leading me to it.

First job: Selling clothes
When I first moved to California, I worked at a Limited Express clothing store in Costa Mesa. Moms would come in wanting to buy clothes for their daughters, and so I would try the clothes on to help make the sale. That was my tactic, and it always worked. I could get them to buy anything.
I got the job by walking in and applying at the age of 14. I had courage like that from the time I came out of the womb. I was always a tough cookie, and I loved making my own money so I didn’t have to ask my parents for any. I’m still a hustler like that.
For me, that job was all about learning how to reel in the customer and make a sale. You are playing a role, and you figure out how to sell yourself. That’s what we do in the acting business, too. So everything I have gone through in life has been a stepping stone, and I’m better for it.

I’m certainly grateful that I’m not making minimum wage anymore. Not a day goes by that I am not thankful for my success.

(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (N:AIG) executives on Thursday defended their strategy for transforming the company, saying some key improvements would take hold by year-end, but failed to convince investors as shares slid more than 6 percent.
The New York-based insurer reported a 21 percent decline in first-quarter profit on Wednesday, due to higher catastrophe and bad weather claims, as well as weaker investment income.
""We do expect to deliver an underwriting profit by the end of this year,"" said AIG Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault in a call with analysts on Thursday.
Duperreault took charge of AIG nearly a year ago, promising to grow the company and boost revenues. He has been working to improve underwriting practices, increase AIG’s focus on technology and install new executives across the insurer to jumpstart profits. 
But his steps have yet to boost the bottom line. The stock is down nearly 16 percent since Duperreault's arrival in May 2017. AIG's shares were trading at $51.36 on Thursday afternoon after a morning slump during which share were down more than 9 percent.
""Given the results from some other commercial lines insurers in the quarter everyone was expecting a stronger number from AIG, especially in North American commercial business,"" said Elyse Greenspan, a  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities LLC analyst, in an interview.
The unit has been a ""consistent area of focus"" for AIG and one which the insurer's former management team was unable to fix, Greenspan said.
AIG's changes to underwriting practices will take some time to show up in the company's income statement, said Peter Zaffino, chief executive of AIG's general insurance unit, during the call. But a combination of managing expenses and improving ratios of losses to premiums will contribute to AIG's year-end financial performance, Zaffino said.
The company is also making changes to excess casualty business, trying to shed certain risky bets such as being the lead insurer for initial public offerings and professional liabilities, Duperreault said.
AIG also reported on Wednesday that it had released $104 million in reserves from its general insurance unit, the first such development since 2016.

The measure alleviated some investor angst, Greenspan said, after the insurer had to set aside funds in 2016 and 2017 to cover possible future claims.

945,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",Cautious Saudi bankers give reality check on country's economic health,"By Tom Arnold
RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's banks are preparing for muted lending growth this year, providing a reality check on the state of the country's economy and government efforts to stimulate growth.
Saudi Arabia unveiled its Vision 2030 plan in 2016 to transform the country's economy, which is still suffering the after effects of the slump in oil prices, recession and austerity measures to cut the state deficit.
""Vision 2030 is in the future, but we're dealing with the reality of now,” said one senior Saudi banker. “We're having to be more careful and client demand is weak anyway.”
The International Monetary Fund is expecting the Saudi economy to grow 1.8 percent this year, but some local bankers worry their assets are shrinking as loans get repaid but new borrowing opportunities dry up. 
The banks also complain that they have seen little benefit so far from the government's 72 billion riyals ($19.20 billion) stimulus plan, announced last year to kick-start the economy. 
""The expectation is that the rebound in credit growth will be delayed until the end of 2018,"" said Olivier Panis, senior credit officer of EMEA financial institutions at Moody's.
""There’s still a lack of confidence from investors about when economic growth will start again and when some of the big projects will be implemented."" 
Three of the four local banks to report first-quarter earnings so far this quarter, including the two largest National Commercial Bank and Al Rajhi Bank, have revealed shrinking loan growth, setting a gloomy tone to the earnings season.
The Saudi banks subdued outlook contrasts with the enthusiasm of international banks which are keen to muscle into the Arab world's largest economy as it prepares to transform industries ranging from energy to entertainment. 
More than a dozen foreign banks have already licenses to operate branches in the country. Citi (N:C) is considering seeking a full license and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) is seeking one. 
CREDIT DEMAND
Credit expansion in the country contracted by 1 percent last year as the economy slipped into recession, the first since 2009. Credit growth for the first quarter was 0.5 percent.
In retail banking, cuts in government energy subsidies have hit consumer spending. Also, the weak economy led to hundreds of thousands of expatriate workers leaving the country over the past year, also denting demand for consumer credit and loans.
Among the banks' corporate customers, appetite for credit also remains weak. Contractors and other companies serving the government are often still waiting to be paid although the government has taken steps to speed up the process.
One banker said because of this situation his bank had raised its collateral requirement on loans to contractors to up to twice the size of the loan from 1.5 times previously. 
Fallout from the government's anti-corruption drive on the country's business and political elite has increased caution among the local banks, bankers say.
The after-effects of the corruption purge have also delayed lending to some companies, such as Kingdom Holdings.
Another dampener has been new rules on bad debts. From the start of this year, banks had to comply with IFRS 9 accounting rules, which set out stricter provisions on what banks have to set aside for problem loans. 
The banks are also having to meet tighter Saudi central bank corporate lending rules which limit a bank's exposure to a single customer. This means no bank can have exposure to any one client of more than 15 percent of their Tier 1 capital, several bankers said. The previous limit was 25 percent.
With big government-linked companies dominating the Saudi economy, banks are, in some cases, now much more restricted in who they lend to.
""A number of banks are already at the cap for lending to the largest conglomerates, so that's a challenge they will have to manage,"" said Panis at Moody's.

954,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 12:32PM ET</span>","Low income shortens lives, putting Social Security in a bind","By Mark Miller
(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)
Americans are all living longer, so it only makes sense to push back the eligibility age for Social Security - right?
Pushing back the age when workers can claim their full benefit may sound like the fair thing to do in a era of rising longevity - and it would help fix Social Security’s long-range financial imbalance.
But this easy-sounding fix masks two crucial problems. It makes a higher retirement age sound painless - when it actually would cut everyone’s benefits by moving back the goal posts on when you can claim full benefits. Just as important, a higher retirement age would be especially unfair to lower-income workers.
Average longevity has been rising in the United States, but all of the gains have been experienced in higher-income households. A number of studies have reached this conclusion in recent years - but now comes a report from the horse’s mouth, so to speak - the actuaries at the Social Security Administration.
By using mortality and earnings data from the agency’s massive database on American workers, this report confirms that lifetime earnings have a profound impact on longevity. The findings should help put the brakes on any proposal to solve Social Security’s long-range financial imbalance by lifting retirement ages.
The study examines five income segments (quintiles) using Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME), a Social Security measure that averages your top 35 years of earnings when you reach age 60, indexed to reflect average wage growth in the economy. The SSA actuaries compared mortality (death rates) by sex and age. They found lower mortality (death rates) for retired worker beneficiaries with higher-than-average AIME levels, and higher death rates for retired-worker beneficiaries with lower-than-average AIME levels.
The differences are expressed as mortality ratios. An AIME mortality of 1.00 means death rates for a given group were equal to the group as a whole; ratios lower than that number indicate lower mortality, while higher numbers indicate - well, earlier curtains.
Just one example of how this plays out: in 2015, retired men age 62-64 in the highest income quintile had a ratio of 0.52, while those in the lowest income quintile had a ratio of 1.77. The comparable figures for women were not much different - 0.73 for the highest income quintile, and 1.54 for the lowest.
A BENEFIT CUT - NO MATTER WHEN YOU RETIRE
Yet rising longevity is cited routinely as a justification for raising the Social Security full retirement age (FRA). Consider, for example, the Republican-sponsored Social Security Reform Act of 2016. It repeatedly references rising longevity, and a cornerstone element would gradually raise the FRA to 69.
Two years might not sound like much - but recall that we already have raised the FRA as part of the last set of Social Security reforms, enacted in 1983. At the time, Social Security faced a real crisis, with the program due to run out of funds within 18 months. The 1983 reforms gradually raised the FRA from 65 to 67 for workers born in 1960 or later.
Make no mistake - a higher FRA is a benefit cut, no matter when you retire. To understand how that occurs, it is helpful to take a quick refresher on how the timing of your claim affects benefits.
To determine your benefit amount, the SSA starts by translating your AIME into something called the primary insurance amount (PIA). This is a weighted formula that gives a higher benefit relative to career earnings for a lower earner than for a high earner - a bit like income tax brackets. You receive 90 percent of AIME for the first segment (up to $895 for 2018), 32 percent for the second bracket (up to $5,397) and 15 percent for any amount of remaining AIME.
If you wait until the full retirement age (currently 66), you would receive 100 percent of PIA. If you start at 62 (the earliest opportunity), you will receive a reduced benefit for the rest of your life - 25 percent lower. By waiting until after full retirement age (66), you would get the delayed retirement credit, which is 8 percent for each 12-month period that you delay. The credits are available until age 70.
But raising the FRA reduces benefits no matter when you claim. How does this play out? A 2015 report by a group of policy experts for the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) expresses it simply: If we raised the FRA from 67 to 70, a worker claiming benefits at age 67 would receive 100 percent of PIA before the reform, but 80 percent afterward - in other words, it is a 20 percent benefit cut.
How about workers with higher mortality rates?

The NAS study examined the impact of the changing gap in life expectancy by income over time, comparing workers born in 1930 and 1960. The researchers found that raising the FRA to 70 would fall disproportionately on lower-income workers. For men born in 1930, lifetime benefits would fall by 25 percent ($31,000) for the lowest-income workers, and 22 percent for the highest-income group ($50,000).
One solution is to revise the Social Security bend points to restore lost benefits to lower-income workers. But whatever solutions are considered should push beyond all the loose talk about averages.

LONDON/FRANKFURT/MILAN (Reuters) - U.S. hedge fund Elliott is stepping up its activities in Europe, a Reuters review of data shows, as it sees more opportunities to unlock value for shareholders by pushing through management changes, company break-ups and merger deals.
Filings with regulators show that eight of Paul Elliott Singer's activist fund's 15 disclosed positions in the first four months of 2018 were in Europe, compared to three out of eight in the same period of 2017.
Activist hedge funds rarely disclose reasons behind their strategy. But, four sources familiar with Elliott's thinking said Europe offered a lot of scope, as fewer activist funds operated there than in the United States, and European companies have been subject to the attentions of activists for less time.
The first quarter was the most active in Europe for Elliott in at least five years, separate data from research group Activist Insight showed. 
Last month, Elliott bought British bookshop chain Waterstones, disclosed stakes in software firm Micro Focus, shopping center operator Hammerson and hotel and coffee-shop company  Whitbread  (LON:WTB), and upped its holdings in Sky and  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM). 
Industry experts say Elliott appears to be acting on a plan to open up a region that until recently was regarded as less fertile ground for activist funds.
""I think it's a concerted effort that there is too much money to be made here and (they're) not going to be deterred by the structural or cultural defenses (anymore),"" said Chris Young, who works with companies on the receiving end of activist campaigns at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in New York. 
""I think that Elliott - given their size, their relative aggressiveness versus other activists – are saying we've got the capital, we've got the patience that's necessary and we're going to try to now unlock Europe,"" said Young, who is working with Telecom Italia (TIM) where Elliott is attempting to overhaul the board at a shareholder meeting on Friday.
Elliott has accused the Italian company's top shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) of serving only its own interests, while Vivendi says Elliott is looking for short-term financial gains.
A spokesman for Elliott said: ""Our activity in Europe is not a specific strategy shift. It’s just a function of the way this market is growing.""
He said there had been a change in the way people view activism. ""There has just been a shift in the last few years in thinking and you're seeing it now in terms of capital deployed.""
The fund, which in London is led by Singer's son Gordon, manages $35 billion in assets, dwarfing European rivals, like TCI Fund Management, with $17.5 billion, and Cevian Capital, with assets of more than 13 billion euros ($15.6 billion).
It is among the biggest global activists by assets, with peers Icahn Enterprises and Third Point managing around $32 million and $18 billion respectively.
Since it was founded in 1977, Elliott has made gains of 13.3 percent annually after tax, only ever ending a year down in 1998 and 2008, according to an investor letter seen by Reuters. Not all of its positions are activist, as in the case of its investment in Italian football club AC Milan.
As well as making returns, activists say they improve long-term performance. 
More traditional investors say Elliott's swoop on a company does not necessarily mean better returns for long-term shareholders.
""Any time an activist like Elliott comes in, the stock jumps as everyone is betting on some strategic changes happening soon. In reality, it takes much longer than that if it ever gets to that,"" said a U.S. investment fund which also owns TIM stock and fears the fight with Vivendi may drag on and harm the company. 
DISTRUST
The U.S. market, where investors like Singer, Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn sprang up in the 1970s and 1980s, has a long history of so-called ""activists"".
Similar moves were not made in Europe until the 1990s and 2000s, when Elliott, TCI and Cevian all set up there.
Europe has long been considered a more difficult place for activists due to cultural and structural impediments.
Many European companies have bylaws, including voting right caps, loyalty schemes and other legal mechanisms that protect management, as well as a deep distrust of activists.
Deutsche Boerse's Chief Executive Werner Seifert once called TCI's Chris Hohn the leader of a swarm of locusts in a book about the exchange's battle with the hedge fund.
The Elliott spokesman said things had started to change and activist investors were getting a better reception.
""In the last 12 months, a lot more shareholders are willing to consider that maybe management doesn’t know best.""
Elliott registered its London office with the UK regulator in 2004. It does not have another base in Europe, but flies its traders in and out of various countries as necessary. 
""Corporate constitutions in some European jurisdictions can make it more difficult to yield the right results for activist investors versus the U.S., but for Elliott they know the vagaries of European corporate laws and defense tactics very well,"" said Ian Harris, senior analyst at Elevation Securities.
Last year, Elliott failed in its push for Dutch paint maker Akzo Nobel to accept a bid from rival PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) and oust Chairman Antony Burgmans.
Last week, Whitbread yielded to pressure from Elliott and U.S. hedge fund Sachem Head to spin off Costa Coffee, while German activist fund Shareholder Value Management's slate of board candidates at Italy's Retelit was approved.
Sources told Reuters government thinking in Europe is gradually changing. 

Shortly after Elliott's investment in TIM became known, state lender CDP bought a 4.8 percent stake, a move seen as political endorsement of the activist investor.

By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is betting on services such as app downloads and music subscriptions to help drive growth as the cell phone market matures, but the company faces tough competitors and potentially low profit margins in some of its target areas.
Investors support Apple's effort to look beyond its signature product, the iPhone, for growth. A 31 percent increase in services revenue to $9.2 billion was a bright spot in earnings reported on Tuesday, lifting overall gross margins as well as sales, the company said.
Apple subscribers, who include customers paying for third-party apps on iPhones, rose 100 million in the last year to 270 million.
But profitability varies widely among service offerings, and some businesses appear to have lower profit margins than the 38.3 percent company-wide figure Apple reported.
The App Store and iCloud storage are similar to high-margin software businesses while entertainment, such as Apple Music and a nascent video business, are similar to lower-margin media businesses.
""Some of these services are for sure going to have much lower margins"" than Apple's core hardware business, said Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research.
Apple's music effort likely ""can't be dramatically different from Spotify or Pandora or any of those companies. My guess is the next few Apple services aren't going to be investment-light services, with content being the preeminent example.""
Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said he expects services to boost margins but allowed for uncertainties due to product mix.
""As we're able to grow the services business, that should provide a positive (to margins), a tailwind,"" Maestri said in an interview. ""At the same time, within the services portfolio that we have, we have services that have different levels of profitability, so we also need to take into account the mix of services we're going to be selling.""
The App Store is the largest component of the services segment, Maestri told Reuters. Apple receives 30 percent of the price of one-time app purchases and purchases made within apps, such as items in video games, and 15 percent of App Store subscriptions to services like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) after a year.
That is a high-margin business, but the company has been in it for a decade.
""App revenue probably hasn’t peaked, but it isn’t the long-term future either,"" said Julie Ask, an analyst with Forrester Research.
Apple's iCloud online storage business revenue rose 50 percent in the most recent quarter, likely with high margins. Dropbox Inc, for example, had gross margins of 68 percent in 2017 when excluding stock compensation costs.
CHALLENGES IN ENTERTAINMENT
Entertainment, though, is a tougher business where Apple may have to spend substantially to compete with entrenched rivals.
Apple has an installed base of 1.3 billion gadgets, but many play competitors' entertainment.
Apple's servicers could be ""hard to grow in the face of the competitive monsters who have more history and deeper relationships with services customers,"" said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business.
Apple Music has grown rapidly to 40 million paid users and 8 million trial users since launching in 2015, but its chief rival, Spotify Technology SA, had gross margins of 20 percent for 2017, due to the cost of music rights.
And Apple plans to spend $1 billion developing original video content, although it doesn't charge for its shows on its Apple TV device. Netflix's so-called ""contribution margin"" for its streaming business - the metric the company uses to gauge margins on that segment - was 37 percent in 2017.

""Look at what Netflix and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are doing. Those guys are spending hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars on content,"" O'Donnell said.

The bank said employees in finance, risk, compliance, technology and credit functions would be affected and the moves will take place between July and December this year.
Bank of America last July became the first U.S. bank to pick Dublin as its new base for its EU operations, a necessary step to continue serving its clients as Britain prepares to leave the bloc in March 2019. 
The regulatory filing seen by Reuters on Thursday and reported on earlier by Irish media showed the job moves will be a combination of staff relocation and new hires in Ireland.
As part of its preparation for Brexit Bank of America is merging Bank of America Merrill Lynch International, its London-based subsidiary, into its similarly-named Irish entity based in Dublin.
The up to 125 roles the bank said are likely to shift across the Irish Sea represent a first phase of job moves, with a second phase possible depending on the outcome of Britain's negotiations with the EU, the bank added.

Those ""potential second phase relocations"" would mostly be to France, with some going to Ireland, Germany and other locations, the bank said.

969,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Saudi state finalized ownership transfer of $10 billion financial district,"By Marwa Rashad, Tom Arnold and Katie Paul
RIYADH (Reuters) - The Saudi government has finalized terms to transfer ownership of the kingdom's glitzy $10 billion financial district in Riyadh to the finance ministry and Public Investment Fund (PIF), five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The move paves the way for reviving work on King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD), which has been planned since 2006 to house banks and the financial regulator's headquarters across an area roughly four times the size of London's Canary Wharf.
The project, owned by the kingdom's Public Pension Agency, has been plagued by construction delays, cost overruns and uncertainty about the future of its ownership. Cranes at the site have been still for three years.
""It is a transfer (of ownership), not a transaction. The Ministry of Finance will take the legal ownership and PIF will have the operating rights,"" said one of the sources, who like others asked not to be identified.
Another source said the government was planning to commit 2.3 billion Saudi riyals ($613.3 million) to fund the completion of the project, including payment of existing claims.
Officials at the Ministry of Finance and PIF were not immediately available for comment.
The completion of KAFD would be a milestone for the kingdom's economic and social reform drive, launched in 2016 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Talks to transfer the project to PIF began in 2016, around the same time the government said it would rescue the district as part of its Vision 2030 efforts to diversify its oil-reliant economy. 
The plan envisages transforming KAFD into a special business zone with distinct regulations and visa exemptions.
However, the PIF talks fell apart the following year and details for the special regulations were never clarified.
Two of the sources said the project's main contractor, the Saudi Binladin Group, on Wednesday contacted hundreds of workers who have been on leave since the project stalled, and told them to return to work within 10 days.
The government wants the district, whose glassy skyscrapers and Zaha Hadid-designed metro station contrast with drab architecture in much of Riyadh, to be ready in time for Saudi Arabia to host the G20 Summit in 2020.

KAFD will also host a revived film industry in Saudi Arabia, another pillar of the reform program. After almost a 40-year ban, an AMC movie theater opened its doors in late April at a converted part of the district's conference center.

DETROIT (Reuters) - North American orders for Class 8 semi-trucks jumped nearly 50 percent in April as trucking companies struggled to add capacity in a tight U.S. freight market, but the pace of orders cooled from highs seen in the first quarter, FTR, a company that tracks the industry, said on Thursday.
Preliminary orders for the big 18-wheelers that haul freight along the highways of United States, Canada and Mexico hit 34,700 trucks, up 47 percent from 23,538 in April 2017. 
But while April orders were solid, they lagged the first quarter where orders topped 40,000 trucks in all three months.
The tight U.S. freight market means many rail and truck customers are grappling with how to defend profit margins as transportation costs climb at nearly double the inflation rate.
""These order levels will continue to put pressure on the (manufacturers) and suppliers to increase production and output,"" Jonathan Starks, FTR's chief intelligence officer, said in a statement. ""The market will stay red-hot into 2019."" 
""The question remains: how hot can they run?""
Full-year 2017 orders for Class 8 trucks came in at 290,000 units compared with 164,000 in 2016. The United States is by far the largest market in North America.

TORONTO (Reuters) - A group of Canadian coffee chain Tim Horton's U.S. franchisees said on Thursday it is suing parent company Restaurant Brands International (TO:QSR), escalating growing tensions between the company and owners of its U.S. and Canadian coffee shops. 
The Great White North Franchisee Association-U.S. is challenging a clause in Restaurant Brands' franchise agreements that requires all disputes to be resolved in Federal Court in Miami, according to an emailed statement from the group. 
Once this is resolved, the U.S association said it plans to file another lawsuit claiming improper use of an advertising fund franchisees pay into. It said the company had used the fund to pay overhead expenses unrelated to promoting the brand. 
""We can't comment on the specifics of any ongoing legal matters, however, these allegations are completely false,"" Restaurant Brands said by email. ""We're proud of the way we conduct our business, and nothing will distract us from our primary focus, which is serving the needs of our restaurant owners and guests.""
The moves by the U.S. franchisees are the latest in a long-running feud between Tim Hortons' parent company and its franchisees, which has now drawn the attention of the Canadian government.
Tim Hortons fell to 50th from fourth on an annual ranking of brand reputation in Canada based on surveys between Dec. 19 and Jan. 29 by market research firm Leger. Tim Hortons has 729 locations in the U.S. and 4,258 in Canada, according to its website. Restaurant Brands also owns the Burger King and Popeyes Louisiana Chicken chains.
After Tim Hortons' same-store sales fell for the eighth consecutive quarter in the latest earnings period, Restaurant Brands Chief Executive Daniel Schwartz said last month that ""negative media created by this group of franchisees"" is hurting customer perceptions of the brand.
Restaurant Brands shares have fallen 10 percent this year, compared with a 3.8 percent decline in the Toronto stock benchmark. 
The U.S. action follows a C$500 million ($389 million) lawsuit filed by their Canadian counterparts in June, also alleging mismanagement of a national advertising fund. 
The Canadian franchisee association filed a second, C$850 million, lawsuit in October saying the company was trying to intimidate restaurant owners. Both lawsuits are still trying to obtain certification as class actions, a spokesperson for the association said by email on Thursday.
The franchisee association, whose membership includes 60 percent of Tim Hortons owners in Canada, and half of those in the U.S., was formed in March 2017 in Canada ""in response to the mismanagement of the Tim Hortons franchise,"" according to the group. The U.S. arm was formed in June.

(Reuters) - Music streaming service  Spotify Technology  SA's (N:SPOT) shares fell 9 percent in early trading on Thursday as the company's first quarterly report underwhelmed in the face of heightened Wall Street hype.
Spotify, which made an unorthodox direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange in April, reported largely in-line results, raising concerns about its success in turning free music listeners into paying subscribers.
In the past week, as many as seven analysts started coverage on the stock with their top rating. While there were no immediate downgrades or price cuts following the results, some analysts said investors' expectations were overblown ahead of the results.
""Spotify delivered solid Q1, but Street expected more upside in its first quarter as a public company,"" J.P.Morgan analysts wrote in a note.
The brokerage said it saw no change to its overall positive thesis on the Swedish company, reiterating its ""overweight"" rating and a $190 price target.
The stock was down 9 percent at $153.77 in early trading, having risen 14 percent as of Wednesday's close since its listing on April 3.
UBS analysts expected investors to have a muted reaction to Spotify's inaugural results with revenue and subscriptions coming in below the top end of its guided range being a ""light disappointment"".
Slow growth in North America, where the service is up against tech heavyweights Apple (O:AAPL), Amazon (O:AMZN) and Google (O:GOOGL) as well as smaller peer Pandora (N:P), was highlighted as a concern by Atlantic Equities and RBC analysts.
This could reduce revenue growth and increase marketing spending, the analysts said.

Spotify, which launched its streaming music service a decade ago, has enjoyed a surge in subscriber growth only in recent years. It has 75 million paid subscribers, compared with Apple Music's 40 million.

Fresenius abandoned the merger agreement last month and on Wednesday alleged it uncovered ""blatant fraud at the very top level"" of the U.S. generic drugmaker.
Akorn spokeswoman Jennifer Bowles said at the time the company categorically disagreed with the allegations and intended to enforce the merger agreement.
Akorn has sued in Delaware Court of Chancery to try to hold Fresenius to the deal. A hearing is expected to take place on July 9, Fresenius told an analyst call.
""I don't want to speculate ... but you can assume that we will be able to resolve the matter over the course of 2019,"" Chief Executive Stephan Sturm said.
Sturm said Fresenius would seek alternative ways to grow its Kabi generics business in North America, but said the expansion would take longer without Akorn.
Shares in Fresenius, which have shed over 16 percent of their value over the past year, were trading down 1 percent at 64.48 euros by 1332 GMT.
Earlier on Thursday, Fresenius reported a 1 percent fall in first-quarter sales to 8.12 billion euros, broadly in line with the analysts' consensus forecast.
Net income slipped 2 percent to 450 million euros ($539 million), which surpassed the 437 million consensus forecast in a Reuters poll.
The company confirmed its forecast for sales to grow between 5 and 8 percent this year and for adjusted net income to rise between 6 and 9 percent.

Even though first quarter earnings are showing the best profit growth since 2010, the reports since after Wednesday’s close have been casting a shadow on investor sentiment.
Capturing most headlines was the 7% plunge in shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) after Chief Executive Elon Musk cut off analysts asking about profit potential in the company's first-quarter's earnings call.

986,By Business Insider,"<span>May 03, 2018 09:34AM ET</span>",Tesla sinks after 'odd conference call that lacked answers',"Shares of  Tesla, which  initially popped following an  earnings beat Wednesday afternoon, sank as low much as 7% after CEO Elon Musk's bizarre conference in which he interrupted analysts and insulted their questions.
""Excuse me, next, "" Musk said, interrupting an analyst’s question about  Tesla’s need for a cash infusion, something Musk has promised the money-losing company won’t need, but has yet to convince Wall Street of.
""Boring, bonehead questions are not cool,"" he added. ""Next.""
For the first three months of 2018, Tesla  posted an adjusted loss of $3.35 a share on revenue of $3.41 billion, both better than expected. Musk has continued to say the company  will be profitable by the end of the year — something that  has spurred doubts from analysts. The company burned through $1.05 billion in the quarter. 
Ahead of the call, Musk  said he would crowdsource questions from retail investors rather than only answer those from sell side analysts responsible for covering the stock for Wall Street banks. Traditionally, most questions are given to these analysts because their employers often hold sizable positions in Tesla and will be responsible for helping the company raise cash if it were to need another infusion.
""We’re going to go to YouTube,"" Musk said, forgoing any more analyst questions, after getting fed up with analysts' questions that were ""so dry.""
Joseph Spak, an analyst for RBC Capital Markets who was interrupted by Musk, said it was ""an odd conference call that lacked answers to questions on investors' minds and overshadowed earnings.""
RBC lowered its price target to $280, from $305, following the results. Wall Street on the whole remains slightly more optimistic with an average price target of $319, just 5% above where the stock was trading Thursday morning.
The overnight slump brings Tesla back below the  key $300 resistance level that it has been flirting with for months, amid heightened volatility thanks to a  fatal crash, ""production hell,""  plunging bond prices, and a credit downgrade from Moody's. 
""I just left the call very frustrated,"" Rebecca Lindland, an analyst at Kelley’s Blue Book  told CNBC Thursday morning. ""Elon, you’ve got to grow up. You’ve got to stop looking at shiny objects and you’ve got to get on track. You have to take analyst questions, adult analyst questions, not fanboys, not retail analysts."""
987,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 03, 2018 09:31AM ET</span>",Tesla Sinks as Musk Rejects Questions After $1 Billion Cash Burn,"(Bloomberg) -- The earnings report started optimistically enough, with Elon Musk forecasting an end to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s cash-burning days after blazing through another $1 billion last quarter.
But by the end of Tesla’s first-quarter conference call, Musk was berating analysts for asking “boring” questions, and any shred of predictability was out the window. Investors cringed, sending the stock down as much as 7.4 percent to $279 in early trading Thursday.
Musk, 46, has built up a showman’s reputation as the founder and chief executive officer of Tesla, calling on true believers to help him overcome the “haters” who question his company’s ability to usher in an electric-vehicle age on an ambitious timetable. His performance Wednesday revealed his willingness to bite the hand that feeds, ridiculing representatives of Wall Street’s biggest banks who tried to pinpoint how he’d live up to his promises to build more Model 3 sedans and generate cash in the second half of the year.
Musk cut off analysts’ queries about the company’s capital requirements and whether it was retaining Model 3 reservation holders, calling the questions “so dry” and “not cool.”
“The boring questions can also be categorized as the tough ones,” said Dave Sullivan, an analyst at AutoPacific Inc. “I hope the Tesla fans know how to swim, because without the answers to the tough questions, it looks like Musk is leading them straight into the water.”
The often-colorful Musk unveiled what he portrayed as Tesla’s first mass-market car more than two years ago but has pushed back Model 3 manufacturing targets several times. Slow output has limited the amount of money coming in from customers taking delivery and tested Tesla’s balance sheet.
Prospective patrons have showed patience -- there are still more than 450,000 reservation holders waiting, and customer deposits keep rising, approaching almost $1 billion as of March 31.
When Joe Spak, an RBC Capital Markets analyst who rates Tesla the equivalent of a hold, asked Musk how many Model 3 reservation holders were actually taking the step to configure their car when invited to do so, a pause followed.
“We’re going to YouTube,” Musk said, referring to the owner of a channel on the video-streaming service who had lobbied the CEO ahead of time for the chance to ask questions on behalf of retail investors.
“Sorry,” Musk said, “these questions are so dry. They’re killing me.”
Tesla’s balance sheet also was a sore subject for Musk. While Tesla expressed confidence about the second half of the year, negative free cash flow was more than $1 billion for the third time in the last four quarters. The result was also worse than analysts’ average estimate for cash burn of about $978 million.
Tesla had $2.67 billion in cash on hand at the end of the first quarter, down from the $3.37 billion at the end of last year. Toni Sacconaghi of Sanford C. Bernstein, who rates the company the equivalent of a hold, bore the brunt of Musk’s sharpest words after asking about capital requirements.
“Excuse me. Next. Next,” Musk said to the call operator. “Boring, bonehead questions are not cool. Next?”
Manufacturing Reset
Model 3 production probably will pause for about 10 days this quarter, an estimated duration that includes a shutdown last month to address bottlenecks. While Tesla’s battery module line was the main issue plaguing output for months, that’s been resolved, according to the company. Musk now expects to be able to make 5,000 cars’ worth a week before installing an automation system from its German manufacturing unit Grohmann.
On the call, Musk said Tesla is poised to surpass all rivals in manufacturing.
“A really great production system is primarily a software problem, and there’s no one in the auto industry that is remotely as good as Tesla at software,” he said. “Tesla is way better at software than any other car company.”

988,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 03, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>",Goldman Gives Three Reasons Why Investors Should Worry Less,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors should just relax, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Appetite for riskier assets such as stocks and high-yield bonds has been suppressed by a number of factors that have come up around the same time, but the headwinds may be transitory, according to the New York-based investment bank. The firm’s economists point to the sideways movement in the S&P 500 Index since the early-February market meltdown as evidence that nervous traders are unwilling to take a stance.
“We see three reasons why risk assets should worry less,” Goldman economists Charles Himmelberg and James Weldon wrote in a note Thursday. “First, we maintain our conviction in the strong outlook for global growth despite the recent dip in global activity indicators. Second, concerns over monetary tightening are likely overdone. Third, the technical headwinds that have weighed on risk sentiment look likely to ease.”
Global growth might have moderated in the first quarter, but the economists said the U.S. should soon start to show strength from the fiscal stimulus enacted in December, and China, Brazil and India continue to look strong. And while markets have had to absorb a big change in Treasury yields, the bulk of the move is probably mostly done, they said.
Goldman also pointed to some technical factors producing headwinds that are normalizing, including pressure on short-term funding markets due to repatriation of cash parked in short-term credit, and reduced appetite for selling equity volatility. Also, they said nervousness about earnings should moderate now that reporting season is well underway and most companies have beaten expectations with increased cash available for share buybacks as well.
The economists did offer some caveats to their view, adding that risk-reward tradeoffs don’t necessarily look attractive, valuations remain high -- particularly in U.S. high-yield credit -- and there’s a growing risk of an overheated labor market and recession down the road.
“The unusually ‘friendly mix’ of strong growth and low inflation that in recent years provided such a potent boost to risk appetite cannot continue,” Goldman wrote. But in terms of fears about overheating labor markets and recession, “we are not there yet, and these risks may prove to be smaller than many fear,” they said.
All this points to a market that should ease up on the anxiety.
“Growth is likely to remain strong, despite its recent moderation,” the economists said. “Risk assets might begin to worry less.”

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) chief Elon Musk's refusal to answer ""boring"" Wall Street questions about finances sent the electric vehicle maker's shares down as much as 7 percent on Thursday, jarring investors and raising concerns about its ability to raise money in the future.
Tesla's bonds followed the shares lower and, with at least three brokerages cutting price targets for the stock, several wondered what it would now cost the company to raise more funds this year if need be.
In a conference call on Wednesday, Musk refused to answer questions from analysts on Tesla's capital requirements, saying ""boring questions are not cool."" 
Instead, he took over a dozen consecutive questions from YouTube investment channel HyperChange TV, which had previously recommended buying Tesla shares. 
Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne dubbed the call, in which Musk talked of ""barnacles, flufferbots, and bonehead bears"", surreal.
Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas said it was the most unusual he had heard in 20 years in the business, noting that ""the analysts on the call represent the providers of capital that Tesla has throughout its history depended upon.""
Some saw the call in even more stark terms. 
Eric Schiffer, head of the Patriarch Organization, a Los Angeles-based private equity firm, called it ""the single greatest CEO meltdown in American car history."" 
""Elon Musk's war on day traders and analysts from big banks is like him being on the earnings call with a suicide vest on and pulling the cord. It's horribly incompetent with investors and results in the stock getting hit by roaring missiles,"" Schiffer said, adding that he did not own Tesla shares ""for reasons like this.""
Of 27 brokerages covering the stock, nine now have a ""buy"" or higher rating, 10 ""hold"" and eight have ""sell"" or lower.
The company's shares closed down 5.5 percent at $284.45 in New York. They have lost more than a quarter of their value since touching a high of $389.61 in September, hurt by reports of bottlenecks around production of the Model 3 sedan, seen as crucial to Tesla's profitability. 
Musk has won legions of vocal fans for his soaring vision and bold promises, from making electric vehicles mainstream to sending rockets into space as the CEO of SpaceX.
But the entrepreneur has also exhibited erratic behavior in recent months, from late-night tweets and jokes about bankruptcy to a public spat with regulators investigating a fatality involving a Tesla.
Some investors said Musk's behavior was part of his appeal. 
""We like Elon Musk and because he gets frustrated it only makes him human,"" said Gerald Sparrow of Sparrow Capital. ""We focus on the numbers they produce, not the emotions.""
On Wednesday, Tesla forecast lower capital spending for the year and a profit in the second half.
Musk as also bullish on upcoming projects, promising decisions soon on the construction of a new Model Y factory, and the location of a Chinese Gigafactory. He also pledged to reduce third-party contractors, saying their use had ""really gotten out of control."" 
""So we're going to scrub the barnacles on that front. You've got barnacles on barnacles. So there's going to be a lot of barnacle removal."" 
Tesla is closely held, with co-founder Musk owning 22 percent and its top four investors, including him, over 40 percent - giving Musk a certain freedom to brush off analyst concerns.
Tesla's market capitalization of $51 billion exceeds that of  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), which posted revenues of $156.7 billion last year versus Tesla's $11.8 billion. 
MANUFACTURING ON THE FLY 
Tesla has consistently fallen short of its promises on car production and has promised in the past it would not need to raise funds, before doing just that.
The company has raised capital each year since its initial public offering in 2010 and issued debt twice in 2017.
Tesla's free cash flow widened to negative $1 billion in the first quarter from negative $277 million in the fourth quarter, excluding costs of systems for its solar business.
The company plans to reach its weekly goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 cars in two months, after revising the target several times. 
""We believe that Tesla is essentially learning how to become a manufacturing company on the fly,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak. 

""Investor feedback to the call was shock that a CEO would be dismissive and the general sentiment was that the defensiveness spoke volumes.""

Industrial stocks  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) and Boeing (N:BA) were among the biggest drags on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), which dipped below its 200-day moving average for the first time since April 2.
AIG (N:AIG) dropped 8.5 percent after the insurer reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, while  Cardinal Health  (N:CAH) declined 15.6 percent after the drug distributor cut its annual earnings forecast.
Tesla (O:TSLA) shares fell 5.7 percent, extending losses from Wednesday after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk cut off analysts asking about the company's profit potential, despite promises that production of the troubled Model 3 electric car was on track.
""We weakened post the FOMC meeting and it's a little bit of the same carrying over to today,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. ""Augmenting it is some worries about trade negotiations with China that are underway and what may come of that.""
A U.S. delegation, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, arrived in Beijing on Thursday for talks on tariffs, with state media saying China will stand up to U.S. bullying.
However, a breakthrough was viewed as highly unlikely, especially as the U.S. embassy said the delegation would leave as early as Friday evening.
At 9:53 a.m. ET, the Dow was down 140.08 points, or 0.59 percent, at 23,784.90, the S&P 500 (SPX) was down 12.79 points, or 0.49 percent, at 2,622.88 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 22.51 points, or 0.32 percent, at 7,078.39.
The S&P 500, at its session low, was 4 points shy of its 200-day moving average.
Wall Street closed lower on Thursday, weighed down by news about potential U.S. restrictions on Chinese telecommunications companies, and after the Federal Reserve reaffirmed outlook for more rate hikes.
The central bank expressed confidence that a recent rise in inflation near to its target would be sustained, leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June, but emphasized the inflation target was ""symmetric"", suggesting it was not inclined to speed up its tightening plans.
Even as first-quarter earnings continued to come in strong, the rewards to profit beats have been subdued as investors worry that earnings may have peaked, especially after bellwethers including Caterpillar (N:CAT) flagged concerns about rising costs.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Rolls-Royce is working quickly to repair problems with some of its Trent 1000 engines that have left planes grounded, it said on Thursday, adding it remained confident the cost would not cause it to miss financial forecasts. Rolls-Royce (L:RR) was questioned at its annual shareholder meeting about problems with the Trent 1000 package C, the engine used to power some Boeing (N:BA) Dreamliner 787 planes, in what is a new headache for a company in turnaround mode since 2015.
It has said the problems will be fully resolved by 2022. 
But Chief Executive Warren East, tasked with improving profitability at one of the biggest names in British manufacturing, said on Thursday he expected the issue of grounded aircraft to be sorted out much sooner than that. ""Based on where we are at the moment, we would expect to remove the aircraft on the ground situation much, much faster than 2022,"" East told shareholders. 
Despite the higher costs of additional inspections announced in April, Rolls has kept its 2018 free cash flow guidance at around 450 million pounds ($643 million), give or take 100 million pounds.
The company reassured investors again on Thursday it was on track to meet that target, as well as its profit forecast. Rolls shares were last down 0.8 percent at 829.8 pence. The problem with the Trent 1000 package C engines is that turbine blades are not lasting as long as expected, requiring extra inspections and meaning airlines are having to ground some aircraft.
There are 380 package C engines currently in service with airlines such as Air New Zealand and Virgin Atlantic (VA.UL), and estimates put the number of grounded planes at any one time at about 30.
Rolls chairman Ian Davis told the meeting that fixing the problem was: ""The absolute priority for the board, the absolute priority for the company.""
It was not clear whether Rolls could face any legal action as a result of the problems. When asked that question, East replied: ""Our priority right now is getting customers like Air New Zealand flying reliability.""
Rolls has guided the cash hit from the Trent problems should hit a peak of 340 million pounds in 2018 before falling in 2019, with the cost of the additional inspections covered by the company removing discretionary spending elsewhere.
East said the cost guidance included possible compensation for airlines, without giving more details. 
Asked about the potential sale of the company's commercial marine business, which supplies oil and gas customers and is under review, East said he hoped to be able to provide an update at a capital markets day on June 15. 

""It's an ongoing process,"" he said.

996,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",Blockchain-savvy engineers needed to revolutionize energy sector: Statnett,"By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's state-owned grid operator Statnett [STASF.UL] is convinced blockchain technology can improve efficiency in the energy sector but there is a lack of specialist staff, its research and development director Sonja Berlijn told Reuters.
Blockchain provides a secure platform for consumers to buy and sell directly from each other and is being explored by several European utilities which say it could revolutionize the energy sector.
Implementing blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) in the electricity system will reduce daily power consumption peaks and distribute utilization across the day, possibly curbing the length of any consequent demand-related price spikes, said Berlijn.
""As a consumer you can benefit from these technologies... It could possibly reduce the price fluctuations for consumers. That is the aim, we can hope for that,"" she said.
Many prominent European utilities, including Italy's  Enel  (MI:ENEI), Germany's (EON.UL) and Sweden's Vattenfall (VATN.UL), are looking to use the technology, with Britain's  Centrica  (L:CNA) launching a market trial later this year.
The problem is that the global electricity sector lacks engineers with expertise to build blockchain systems and applications but, together with artificial intelligence (AI), it will be the future of electricity systems, Berlijn told Reuters.
""Blockchain technology will be able to reduce the day's power consumption peaks by 20 percent,"" she said.
Statnett wants to hire roughly 100 specialist staff capable of managing blockchain and AI engineering functions and will fund a professorship role in 2019 so a degree can be offered at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, she added.
""Traditionally we have electrical and mechanical engineers. We see a lack of supply with blockchain and digitization knowledge. We need to build it,"" said Berlijn, herself Norway's first professor of digital electrical power systems.
Currently, the company has about ten employees working with AI, but none of their engineers has blockchain specialization.
Applying the technology in the power system will mostly occur via peer-to-peer trading, by which households and firms can trade unused electricity and regulate their consumption better during the day, using AI-modified electronics.
Even though blockchain and artificial intelligence are hard to comprehend for most electricity consumers, understanding them will not be needed or expected, Berlijn said.
""The household electronics will have separate IPs, there will be algorithms that will reduce their consumption. And it will be done automatically in the future via applications,"" she said.

998,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 07:01AM ET</span>",Private equity firm KKR to convert to a corporation after U.S. tax reform,"By Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co LP (N:KKR) said on Thursday it would convert from a partnership to a corporation in the wake of U.S. tax reform, a move that it hopes will expand its investor base at the expense of paying higher taxes.
It is the biggest shake-up in KKR's structure since the firm went public 12 years ago. KKR is now the second alternative asset manager to change its tax status following  Ares Management LP  (N:ARES) earlier this year.
KKR's market capitalization, at almost $18 billion, is more than three times that of Ares. Its conversion will provide a serious test case for peers Apollo Global Management (N:APO),  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG) and Blackstone (N:BX) as to whether the higher tax burden is offset by the market's attributing a higher valuation.
""KKR's conversion from a partnership to a corporation is designed to broaden our investor base, simplify our structure and make it easier to invest in our shares,"" Henry Kravis and George Roberts, co-chairmen and co-chief executives, said in a statement for KKR's first-quarter earnings.
KKR hopes the change to a so-called C-Corp, which is effective July 1, will attract new shareholders by enabling investors such as index funds to buy the stock. Such passive investors, which are becoming more important as they manage even more money, are restricted by their mandates from acquiring KKR stock under its partnership structure.
Private equity firms pay corporate taxes under the partnership structure on the management fees charged to investors, but are mostly shielded from paying these taxes on performance fees.
Under the C-Corp structure, KKR will pay corporate taxes on all revenue. However, the additional tax burden has become much less severe after the headline U.S. corporate tax rate was lowered to 21 percent from 35 percent.
To illustrate the limited impact of the change to the returns of shareholders, KKR said that an average New York City-based shareholder who bought its stock at $20 and sold at $25 a year later would see only a 6-cent hit to their windfall under a C-Corp structure.
Analysts had earlier flagged KKR and Ares as the two private equity firms most likely to convert to C-Corps early on, as the tax hit is less severe because the firms' earnings rely less on the performance fees that are affected by the C-Corp change.
Apollo's CEO, Leon Black, said in March that Ares' stock performance has not made for a compelling case to follow suit. After Ares' shares initially popped on the announcement of the change on mid-February, since making the switch on March 1 the stock is down 7.8 percent.
KKR said it expected to pay an annualized dividend of 50 cents per common share as a corporation for the third quarter and that it had reupped its authorization to buy back shares to $500 million.
KKR also said on Thursday that its first-quarter earnings per share fell by a less-than-expected 35 percent year-on-year, the latest private equity firm to feel the brunt of turbulent financial markets.
KKR's economic net income per share came in at 42 cents in the first quarter of 2018, ahead of analysts' expectations for 11 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Economic net income reflects the mark-to-market valuation gains or losses on KKR's portfolio.
Blackstone and Carlyle have also reported a fall in first-quarter earnings, albeit less than analysts had feared.
KKR's assets under management totaled $176 billion at the end of March, up from $168 billion at the end of 2017.

999,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 03, 2018 07:01AM ET</span>",Aluminum's Turmoil Hands a Lifeline to Embattled Noble Group,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. sanctions against United Co. Rusal have caused havoc across the aluminum industry.
But for one struggling commodity trader, they have proven a veritable lifeline.
Noble Group Ltd. (SI:NOBG), which has spent more than a year battling for survival, is one of the main beneficiaries of a surge in the price of alumina -- the raw material for making finished aluminum metal that’s been in very short supply since sanctions were imposed.
The sudden deficit has sent companies from  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group to Liberty House Group scrambling for supplies, sending prices to a record and turning Noble’s Jamalco alumina plant in Jamaica into one of the most desirable assets in the global commodities industry.
“Trading companies have been rather keen to get hold of this asset for a long time,"" said Jean-Francois Lambert, a consultant and former head of commodity trade finance at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA). ""The Rusal sanction boosts further the strategic nature of the asset.""
The 92 percent jump in alumina in less than two months could go some way toward reviving Noble’s finances as it attempts to push through a controversial restructuring deal. Not only has it inflated the value of the company’s largest asset, but it’s also generating cash to help keep the company afloat.
It comes as Noble suffers a raft of other problems that are likely to weigh down first-quarter results -- from limited credit lines that have curtailed its ability to trade, to lawsuits from a top counter-party, as well as one of its largest shareholders, Goldilocks Investment Co. While its core coal business has been generating operating cash flow, that hasn’t been enough to cover its costs, according to people familiar with the matter.
Still, the company’s future looks a little brighter thanks to the surge in alumina prices. The rally began in March after a plant in Brazil owned by Norsk Hydro ASA was forced to curtail production but really took flight after the sanctions on Rusal in early April.
The back-to-back crises have exposed the fragility of the alumina supply chain, especially in the Atlantic basin, likely making Noble’s position more valuable to any potential buyers, according to several banking and trading executives. Noble valued its position in Jamalco at $441 million at the end of last year.
Take Noble’s 55 percent stake in the plant, which has production costs of about $275 per metric ton of alumina, according to people familiar with the matter. At current prices of just under $700 a ton, that would translate into annual operating profit of about $250 million. That’s more than the $175 million to $200 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization Noble forecasts its trading business could make after the restructuring.
Noble also has an offtake contract with Clarendon Alumina Production Ltd., the Jamaican government entity that owns the remaining 45 percent of Jamalco, a deal that gives the company a significant exposure to rising prices, according to the people. The contract covers just over 6 million tons of alumina over 12 years from 2013; there’s also a loan from Noble to Clarendon, which worth $140.6 million at the end of March 2017, according to Clarendon’s statements.
While the alumina price spike is helping Noble, the increase in value is likely to accrue largely to the hedge funds and banks holding the company’s debt -- assuming the restructuring, which has the support of 83 percent of the senior creditors, goes ahead.
That’s because as part of the restructuring, Jamalco will be placed in a special holding company for Noble’s assets, and any excess cash flows or proceeds from a sale will be used to pay down the holding company’s debt.
The move in alumina prices should improve the valuation of Jamalco, said Brayan Lai, an analyst at credit research firm Bondcritic Ltd., but ""it does nothing towards Noble’s continuing businesses.""
For the company’s creditors, representatives of which recently toured the facility in Jamaica with Noble management, the turmoil in the market creates a happy dilemma: pursue a rapid sale after the restructuring or hold on to the asset and benefit from higher prices. Noble is seeking to fix prices with alumina buyers for some of its output until late 2019, according to a person familiar with the matter.
""Creditors are about to take a leap of faith, hoping for the ability of Will Randall and his team to create an attractive business,"" said Lambert, the consultant. ""Jamalco either brings new optionalities on the table or could contribute, through a sale, to significantly reducing the debt burden.""

The blue-chip Dow futures gained 46 points, or 0.19%, by 6:44AM ET (10:44GMT), the S&P 500 futures added 6 points, or 0.24%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 13 points, or 0.19%
Wall Street appeared set to bounce back on Thursday after losses registered in the prior session with the focus remaining on earnings reports.
370 companies of the S&P 500 have already released numbers for the January to March period with 78% of the firms beating on profit and 75% topping sales estimates. So firms have seen earnings growth of 23.6% in the first quarter, the best since 2010.
Notable earnings reports expected out on Thursday morning include Kellogg (NYSE:K), Teva (NYSE:TEVA), Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN), Cigna (NYSE:CI), DowDuPont (NYSE:DWDP),  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT), and WWE (NYSE:WWE).
After the close, results from CBS (NYSE:CBS),  Overstock.com  (NASDAQ:OSTK), Weight Watchers (NYSE:WTW),  Herbalife  (NYSE:HLF), Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI),  Universal Display  (NASDAQ:OLED), Pandora (NYSE:P), GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO),  Arista Networks  (NYSE:ANET), Sierra Wireless (TO:SW), and  Cardinal Health  (NYSE:CAH) will be on the agenda.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) earnings will also be in focus after Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday cut off analysts asking about profit potential in the company's first-quarter's earnings call, sending shares down nearly 5% in pre-market trading Thursday, despite promises that production of the troubled Model 3 electric car was on track.
Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) shares, meanwhile, plunged around 7% in pre-market trade Thursday, after reporting earnings after the prior session’s close. Its first earnings report since going public last month showed a smaller than expected loss but revenue fell short and guidance disappointed.
Square (NYSE:SQ)'s stock also sank around 7% ahead of the open after the financial services and mobile payment company's weak earnings guidance disappointed investors.
On the economic front, attention will shift back to the data after the Federal Reserve did little to surprise markets in Wednesday’s policy announcement. The Fed kept interest rates unchanged, a move that was widely expected, and noted that inflation was starting to inch higher, leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June.
Thursday will see a raft of economic data with the weekly report on initial jobless claims, as well as readings on worker productivity and the trade balance, all to be released at 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT).
A survey on service sector activity, and a report on factory orders are then due at 10:00AM ET (14:00GMT).
While waiting for the data, the dollar gave back some of its recent gains against major rivals, falling from a four-month high. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.33% to 92.28 by 6:47AM ET (10:47GMT).
Dollar weakness helped prop up demand for gold as the precious metal becomes more affordable for holders of foreign currencies. At 6:48AM ET (10:48GMT) Thursday, gold for June delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange gained 0.53% to $1,312.50.
Meanwhile, two days of tense U.S.-China trade talks between U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He began Thursday in Beijing.
The talks are taking place after President Donald Trump proposed new tariffs on Chinese goods and Beijing responded with a set of duties that could potentially apply to U.S. products too.
Any breakthrough deal during the two days of negotiations is viewed as highly unlikely.
Elsewhere, Europe’s major bourses were mostly lower, in a day dominated by earnings updates.
Earlier, Asian stock markets closed mixed, following the uninspiring overnight lead from Wall Street.
In oil markets, crude prices showed mixed trade as concerns over a rise in U.S. oil inventories and record weekly domestic production kept downward pressure on black gold. U.S. crude futures inched up 0.03% to $67.95 by 6:50AM ET (10:50GMT), while Brent oil traded down 0.25% to $73.17."

1003,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>",Samsung BioLogics' shares slide again; unit's valuation jump questioned,"By Joyce Lee and Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - Shares in South Korea's Samsung BioLogics Co Ltd (KS:207940) fell 3.5 percent on Thursday, a day after losing almost $6 billion in market value as the contract biotech drugmaker was hit by a regulatory probe into its accounting rules.
South Korea's financial regulator said earlier this week it had given preliminary notice to BioLogics, an affiliate of tech giant Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), and its auditors of measures it could take concerning breach of accounting rules.
While the regulator did not elaborate, some lawmakers and an activist group have previously said BioLogics breached rules to inflate net profit before its 2016 listing. The drugmaker has denied it breached rules.
According to its stock market filing in 2016, the valuation in its books of loss-making drug developing unit Samsung Bioepis jumped by 18 times to 4.8 trillion won ($4.5 billion) in 2015 after it switched to valuing the unlisted firm at fair market value instead of at book value.
BioLogics said on Wednesday it treated Bioepis as an affiliate, not a unit, from 2015 and thus switched to fair market valuation, because it could lose control of the unit due to the possibility of the unit's minority investor Biogen Inc (O:BIIB) exercising a call option to increase its stake to nearly 50 percent.
In making the switch of the valuation method, BioLogics said it followed accounting rules and recommendations by accounting experts, with the approval of country's three major accounting firms.
The change in the method helped BioLogics swing to a net profit of 1.9 trillion won in 2015 from a loss of 28 billion won a year earlier, bringing criticism that the process, ahead of its $2 billion IPO in 2016, lacked transparency and may have misled investors.
""It's unclear how they came up with the 4.8 trillion won valuation for a loss-making firm, and what kind of valuation criteria they used to reach that conclusion,"" said Kim Eun-jung at People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, the activist group that reported the case to the regulator last year.
""If the value was inflated, Samsung BioLogics shareholders are the victims here.""
Some blamed the regulators.
""Regulators could have caught it earlier when it was being listed. I am more upset at regulators than Samsung. We are the ones damaged without any protection,"" said an asset manager at a local firm who sold off personal holding of BioLogics shares on Wednesday.
Shares in BioLogics, the world's No.3 biotech contract manufacturer after Lonza Group (S:LONN) and Boehringer Ingelheim, have nearly trebled since its listing. The news of the notice on accounting irregularities sent shares in the $24 billion company down nearly 20 percent, its biggest daily drop, on Wednesday. The stock closed at its lowest level since January on Thursday.
Regulators are expected to begin deliberating on the case within a month before making a final decision. If they rule that BioLogics violated accounting rules, South Korea's stock exchange could then debate whether to delist the firm, an exchange official said.
Biogen, which owns approximately 5 percent of Bioepis, has yet to exercise the option, and its CFO said last week on an earnings call that it plans to do that and increase its equity stake.

1004,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 10:47AM ET</span>","Bombardier commits to aero program after CSeries, Toronto land sale","By Allison Lampert and Yashaswini Swamynathan
(Reuters) -  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) said on Thursday it will stick by its remaining commercial aerospace program after agreeing to sell its biggest land asset, as the Canadian plane and train maker strives to raise cash to pay down its debt.
Investors reacted positively to the news, pushing up the stock as much as 3 percent to C$4.05 in early trade.
The company, which has a long-term debt of $9.1 billion and considered bankruptcy in 2015, sold its Downsview site in northern Toronto to the Public Sector Pension Investment Board for $635 million. That facility is an assembly site for its Q400 turboprop passenger planes and is one of four final assembly sites it uses. 
Thursday's sale, combined with an equity raise of C$638.4 million ($496.73 million) in March gives the company $1 billion in cash.
""This (the Q400) is a product line we'll keep pushing,"" Chief Executive Alain Bellemare told analysts on a call, allaying concerns about the plane line's future. The company has up to five years to find a new assembly site for the plane.
He said the deal would allow the company to ""monetize an underutilized asset and optimize our business aircraft operations.""
The Q400, with a backlog of 50 planes, has about 25 percent of the global market in small commercial planes, second to European rival ATR, the world's largest maker of turboprops.
Bombardier also agreed to sell a controlling stake in its flagship CSeries jet to Airbus (PA:AIR) last year for a token C$1 after struggling for years to make the plane line commercially successful.
Jerry Dias, president of the Unifor union which represents workers who assemble the Q400 and Global 7000 plane in Toronto, said on Thursday the deal means Bombardier will keep the two programs in Canada. 
""My biggest concern all along has been the Q-400 and the Global program,"" he said by phone. ""Those two issues have been resolved. We are keeping all of it.""
Bombardier said it would assemble business jets at a leased facility at Toronto's  Pearson  (LON:PSON) Airport, and would continue leasing space at the Toronto site for three years, with options to renew for two more. 
BENEFITS
Bombardier's first quarter results showed revenue increasing in three of Bombardier's four businesses, led by a 21-percent rise in its rail unit. But the company's loss-making commercial aircraft segment, which includes the CSeries, reported a 12-percent drop in revenue and Bombardier used $721 million of its available cash in the quarter - more than last year.
Bombardier said it is on track to achieve free cash flow breakeven for the full year.
""I assume they will be utilizing the proceeds (of the sale) to reduce debt at an accelerated timeframe,"" William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann said.
In a staff memo on Wednesday, Bellemare said the company's commercial aircraft president would stay on to lead its regional aircraft business once the deal with Airbus for the CSeries is completed.
Bombardier announced 15 new CRJ900 regional jets order worth $719 million from  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL).
""Cash flow for this quarter wasn't strong but if we hear that they are on track to break even and next year begin to reduce debt, I think the stock should do well. Clearly people are anxious to know what's next for Bombardier,"" Heymann said.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Ex-Valeant official accused of kickback scheme faces trial,"By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (NYSE:VRX) executive and the former head of mail order pharmacy Philidor Rx Services will face trial Thursday on charges they orchestrated a multimillion-dollar kickback scheme, more than two years after Valeant drew scrutiny for its business practices.
Gary Tanner, formerly a senior director at Valeant, and Andrew Davenport, formerly chief executive officer of Philidor, have pleaded not guilty to charges including wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. Prosecutors and the two men's lawyers are expected to make opening statements to jurors on Thursday morning.
Lawyers for Tanner and Davenport could not immediately be reached for comment.
Prosecutors have said Tanner and Davenport worked together in secret to steer business and funding from Valeant to Philidor. They said the scheme netted Davenport $40 million, $10 million of which was secretly kicked back to Tanner.
Founded in 2013, the now-defunct Philidor was a specialty mail-order pharmacy formed with Valeant’s assistance. At least 90 percent of the drugs it dispensed were Valeant-branded products, according to prosecutors.
Valeant was a victim of the scheme, which deprived the company of Tanner's ""honest services,"" prosecutors said.
""Our company has cooperated with the authorities throughout the course of the investigation, and now, trial,"" said Valeant spokesman Lanie Keller. ""Today, Valeant is focused on improving people's lives with our health care products.""
The drugmaker's stock fell sharply in October 2015 after it disclosed it had been subpoenaed by U.S. prosecutors over various business practices. Later that month, a short selling firm published a report claiming Valeant hid its ties to Philidor and used the pharmacy to artificially inflate sales in order to drive up prices.
Valeant has denied wrongdoing related to Philidor.

In March 2017, billionaire investor William Ackman and his Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) International Fund sold their stake of roughly 8 percent in Valeant at a $3 billion loss. Ackman had been engaged in a public effort to save the company for about 18 months.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Airlines (N:UAL) has hired former Obama administration press secretary Josh Earnest as chief communications officer, United said on Thursday, as the carrier seeks to recover from a string of public relations missteps.
Earnest replaces former communications head Jim Olson, who stepped down in January after two years in the post. 
Olson's tenure was punctuated by public relations blunders, including an April 2017 incident in which a paying United passenger was physically dragged down the aisle of a parked plane to make room for an airline employee.
In the months since, United has struggled to contain public fallout from that incident and other customer service shortfalls. The airline's publicity suffered another blow in March when a small French bulldog puppy, Kokito, died onboard one of its flights after an airline employee forced the dog's owner to stow its carrying case in the plane's overhead bin.
""Josh is a proven leader and world-class communications strategist who has thrived when the stakes are the highest - and the margin for error is the smallest,"" Chief Executive Oscar Munoz said in a statement.
Prior to joining United, Earnest served as press secretary for President Barack Obama from 2014 to 2016. He has since worked as a political analyst for NBC News and MSNBC. 

Earnest will begin his role at United on May 21.

""I have said this before –- we cannot, unfortunately, simply multiply the first-quarter result by four,"" he said in remarks prepared for the bank's annual meeting in Basel after the world's biggest wealth manager boosted first-quarter net profit by nearly a fifth. 
""While the macroeconomic environment may have improved somewhat, the geopolitical position remains difficult. And the interest rate situation -- particularly in Switzerland and Europe -- continues to be a challenge,"" he said. 
""As with many of our U.S. competitors, the market may have too high short-term expectations."" 
UBS shares were 0.3 percent higher by midday. They have fallen more than 7 percent this year, lagging a 3 percent decline in the Stoxx European bank sector index (SX7P).
Ermotti said UBS was investing heavily in digital infrastructure and spending more than 10 percent of revenue –
or more than 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.01 billion)per year – on technology.
""This makes us more efficient and allows us to further develop our offering. All this, of course, has a short-term effect on our results,"" he said.
The challenge was finding a balance between growing its business and investing in the future.
""But we also want to continue to increase the returns for our shareholders. We want to pay out an ordinary dividend that increases by a middle to high single-digit percentage every year,"" he said, while returning additional capital primarily through share buybacks which began last week.
He said priorities for 2018 included becoming more profitable in the global wealth management business, maintaining its leading position in this area and continuing to increase profits in other businesses, and capturing growth opportunities, ""especially in Asia and the Americas"" while reinforcing its leading position in Switzerland.

1011,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 07:41AM ET</span>","China's Xiaomi picks Hong Kong for $10 billion IPO, lifts lid on financials","By Cate Cadell and Julie Zhu
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese smartphone and connected device maker Xiaomi is bringing its blockbuster initial public offering to Hong Kong, where it could raise about $10 billion in the largest listing globally in almost four years.
The IPO plans, filed on Thursday, will be one of the first in Hong Kong under new rules designed to attract tech listings, a major win for the bourse as competition heats up between Hong Kong, New York and the Chinese mainland.
The listing is expected to give Beijing-based, Cayman-domiciled Xiaomi a market value of between $80 billion and $100 billion, just eight years after it came onto the scene in China, people familiar with the plans told Reuters.
The $10 billion fund-raising target, if achieved, will make it the biggest IPO since Chinese internet giant  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) raised a total of $25 billion through a New York listing in 2014.
The IPO could be launched as early as the end of June, according to the people close to the process who requested anonymity as the details were not yet public. 
Two separate people said the company's valuation would likely be lowered to a bit above $70 billion. One said Xiaomi was looking to sell about 15 percent of its enlarged capital in the offering.
Xiaomi declined to comment on the valuation.
The prospectus gave investors the first detailed look at Xiaomi's financial health ahead of the IPO, showing resilience in a slowing global smartphone market thanks partly to a push into overseas markets like India.
Revenue was 114.62 billion yuan ($18 billion) in 2017, up 67.5 percent against 2016, the company said. Operating profit was 12.22 billion yuan, up from 3.79 billion yuan year-on-year.
Xiaomi made a net loss of 43.89 billion yuan versus a profit of 491.6 million yuan in 2016, though this was impacted by the fair value changes of convertible redeemable preference shares.
THIN MARGINS
Xiaomi plans to spend most of the IPO proceeds on three areas: research and development, overseas expansion, and investments, according to its filing. 
Alongside smartphones, Xiaomi makes dozens of internet-connected home appliances and gadgets, including scooters, air purifiers and rice cookers. 
It has a hard core of followers in China known as ""mi fans"", but there are concerns in the market over whether it will be able to replicate this fan base overseas.
The company boasts large gross margins - 60 percent last year - from internet services, including gaming and advertising linked to its homegrown user interface, MIUI, which had 190 million monthly active users as of March 2018.
Yet margins on its smartphones are razor-thin. Xiaomi posted a gross profit margin of just 8.8 percent for its smartphone business in 2017 compared to 60 percent for its internet services business. 
According to some analyst estimates, Apple's flagship iPhone X and iPhone 8 have gross margins of around 60 percent.
Canalys analyst Mo Jia said that while Xiaomi's finances looked ""positive"", the firm needed to bolster its internet services business to warrant a high valuation. The segment slipped as a proportion of overall revenues last year.
""Xiaomi markets itself as an internet company, its valuation is closely linked to whether the market buys this concept,"" he said. ""Otherwise, as a smartphone brand, Xiaomi couldn't reach (such) a high valuation with what's on paper.""
To be sure, its relatively cheap smartphones pose a rising challenge to market leaders  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL). Earlier this year it toppled Samsung as the top smartphone seller in India.
Xiaomi doubled its shipments in 2017 to become the world's fourth-largest smartphone maker, according to Counterpoint Research, defying a global slowdown in smartphone sales.
It is making a broader push outside China's borders, with 28 percent of its sales derived from overseas markets last year, up from 6.1 percent in 2015.
DUAL-CLASS SHARES
Xiaomi's listing plans come as the company and its investors look to capitalize on a bull run for the Hong Kong market, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index rising about 27 percent over the past year.
Hong Kong is eyeing several tech listings in the coming two years, including those with dual-class share structure, from Chinese firms with a combined market cap of $500 billion.
""For Hong Kong to have the opportunity to put away a deal of Xiaomi's size is a good way of showing other institutions out there that might be considering coming to Hong Kong that there is a clear pathway,"" said Keith Pogson, senior partner for financial services at EY.
Xiaomi said it would have a weighted voting rights (WVR) structure, or dual-class shares. The WVR give greater power to founding shareholders even with minority shareholding.
Lei and co-founder Lin Bin will be the beneficiaries, being the holders of the Class A shares. Each Class A share has 10 votes while each Class B share has one vote. Lei currently owns 31.4 percent of Xiaomi while Lin holds 13.3 percent.
Xiaomi is also likely to be among the first Chinese tech firms seeking a secondary listing in China, using the planned depositary receipts route, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
CLSA,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) are joint IPO sponsors.

MILAN (Reuters) - European bourses fell in morning trading on Thursday, weighed down by a rebound in the euro and a series of disappointing earning updates including from Smith & Nephew.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell 0.2 percent, retracing from three-month highs, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) and Britain's FTSE also fell slightly.
The euro rose off four-month lows as the dollar's recent rally came to a halt after the U.S. Federal Reserve did little to alter market expectations for further interest rate rises this year.
""European markets were on the back foot in early trade as investors digest the aftermath of the Fed’s no-surprise rate hold and US-China trade talks weigh,"" said Neil Wilson, Chief Market Analyst at Markets.com.
""The Fed left rates on hold as expected and signaled that it’s unlikely to respond too aggressively if we get some hot summer inflation readings this year,"" he added.
In earnings, Smith & Nephew (L:SN) slumped 6.8 percent after Europe's biggest artificial hip and knee maker cut its forecast for full-year underlying revenue growth after some markets softened and it saw a slowdown in its bioactives business. 
""Following on from weak results from competitors, results across most product lines were slightly soft... However, Bioactives was the major disappointment,"" said UBS in a note.
Bpost (BR:BPOST) fell 12 percent, leading fallers on the STOXX, and Schibsted (OL:SBSTA) declined 5.5 as results lagged expectations. 
Adidas (DE:ADSGn) fell as much as 3.5 percent after the German sportswear firm posted sales growth slightly shy of analyst expectations, although net profit rose more than expected. The stock recovered some of its losses and was down 1 percent. 
Results elsewhere showed the negative impact of strength in the euro during the first quarter.
German drug and crop chemical Bayer (DE:BAYGn) cut its full-year guidance as a stronger euro weighs on the value of overseas revenues. Its shares edged up 0.1 percent.
Adverse currency also led to a 2 percent revenue drop at healthcare group Fresenius (DE:FREG) and resulted in a lower-than-expected core profit for Belgian chemicals group  Solvay  (BR:SOLB). 
Fresenius fell 1 percent and Solvay was down 2.2 percent. 
Elsewhere, however, some well-received company updates provided support.  Logitech  (S:LOGN) rose 9.1 percent following a better than expected quarterly results.
French utility Veolia (PA:VIE) rose 2.5 percent after quarterly revenues rose, as its French water business returned to growth and international activities also showed double-digit growth.

1018,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>",Southern Europe bond spreads defy the odds even as ECB pullback looms,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Fanny Potkin
LONDON (Reuters) - At a time when the impending withdrawal of European Central Bank stimulus was expected to hurt southern European bond markets, so-called ""peripheral"" euro zone debt continues to outperform its higher-rated peers.
Italian, Spanish and Portuguese bonds have been among the bloc's best performers over the past year, and yield premia -- or spreads -- over benchmark German debt have narrowed relentlessly.
Their outperformance has even defied data indicating Europe's growth acceleration may be running out of steam.
And despite recent volatility in the wake of Italy's inconclusive March 4 election, spreads remain near their tightest levels in months, or even years.
(Graphic: Strengthening economy underpins Italian spread - https://reut.rs/2KlBZQj)
""There has been a regime change in sovereign spreads, which are now reacting mostly to economic developments. As long as growth remains healthy, we can see spreads tighten further,"" said Mizuho strategist Antoine Bouvet.
Reasons for the ""regime change""?
First, the three Southern European countries are well and truly out of recession, helped by 2.55 trillion euros in ECB stimulus. The euro bloc posted its fastest economic growth in a decade last year at 2.7 percent.
Even if growth slows from there, it is a far cry way from 2010-2012, when Spain and Portugal required bailouts and Italy's debt levels spiraled to record highs.
Second, unlike a year ago, anti-establishment parties such as Italy's 5-Star Movement are not considered an existential threat to the single currency. Italy may not have a government yet, but the Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread is near the tightest since August 2016 at 110 bps.
So can it continue?
The Italy/Germany spread can go all the way to 90 basis points, Nick Gartside, chief investment officer at JP Morgan Asset Management, told Reuters in January when the spread was 145 bps.
That target now seems within reach, especially as U.S. Treasuries look expensive, once currency hedging costs are taken into account. That means many European investors who would have bought nominally higher-yielding Treasuries, may seek domestic alternatives.
""Ten-year Italian government bonds at nearly 1.8 percent, or even (German government bonds) at 0.6 percent, yield more than the near-zero yield on equivalent currency-hedged U.S. Treasury bonds,"" said Andrew Bosomworth, head of portfolio management, Germany, for PIMCO, the world's largest bond manager.
In addition, Italy's ""real"" yield, a measure looked at by some investors that discounts the effect of inflation, is higher than that of the United States.
(Graphic: Cost of FX hedging cuts U.S. yield advantage for Europeans - https://reut.rs/2JGE0Fv)

PERIPHERY TO SEMI-CORE
Rabobank strategist Richard McGuire predicts Italy/Germany will reach 100 bps but reckons Spain will outperform.
Spanish spreads stand around 72 basis points, having tightened from around 150 bps a year ago (ES10YT=RR).
""The Spanish spread (over Germany) has traditionally found resistance at the 100 basis-point mark ever since the crisis,"" McGuire said. ""But right now it is well below that level and we think it could go as low as 50 basis points.""
Spain may represent the best ""regime change"" example, in fact. With sovereign credit ratings back in ""A"" territory, many see Spain following Ireland's example to transition out of the periphery into ""semi-core"" - market jargon for the debt of Belgium, France and Ireland.
Portuguese spreads meanwhile recently touched 109 bps, their tightest since 2010. It caps a remarkable comeback for a country until recently classed as junk by the big ratings agencies.
S&P Global and Fitch late last year raised their Portuguese ratings back to investment grade, helping push its 10-year borrowing costs below Italy's.
In early 2017, they were 200 basis points higher.
For this reason, the Portugal/Germany spread is the one which may not have legs -- investors do not see it sustainably trading tighter than Italy, a larger economy with a far more liquid bond market.
PERIPHERAL DANGER
The periphery trade however faces the same danger as it always did - the end of ECB bond-buying. ING analysts for instance predict Italian and Spanish spreads will widen to 150 bps and 80 bps respectively by the end of 2018.
Some investors such as Eric Brard, head of fixed income at Amundi, may also switch back to higher-rated French and German debt should yields there rise. German 10-year yields hitting 1 percent would be the time to return to the euro zone ""core"", Brard said.
 ""That would also mean the French (government bond) market would be above 1.20 percent on the 10-year, we would rather be in these better-rated names,"" he added.
In February, when German 10-year yields rose above 0.80 percent, that day looked ominously close.
But with euro zone growth seemingly cooling -- the economy grew just 0.4 percent in the first quarter -- and the ECB sounding cautious on monetary policy, German yields are back at 0.6 percent. This suggests the gravy train will chug along for southern Europe in the foreseeable future.

1020,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 05:09AM ET</span>",Cash conundrum has investors clamoring for capital ideas,"By Sinead Cruise and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Splashing corporate cash may be in vogue, with bumper share buybacks and record takeovers, but some investors are demanding firms spend more on improving assets they already own.
Of nearly a dozen fund managers contacted by Reuters, three-quarters expressed concern about the way companies are allocating capital during a period of relatively healthy cashflow.
""If you are in boom times, by and large capital tends to be allocated poorly,"" Ben Whitmore, manager of the Jupiter Special Situations Fund, said.
After a nine-year bull run in stock markets, many analysts consider British and European companies to be close to peak values, ramping up the risk of over-priced purchases.
""There's been record volumes of M&A recently and there's bound to be some complete howlers in that. Time will show what they are,"" Whitmore added.
Globally deals totaling $1.55 trillion have been struck so far this year, while in Europe mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have totaled more than $621 billion, up 151 percent on the same period in 2017, Thomson Reuters data shows.
Global cash-only M&A: https://reut.rs/2rfPadA
The aggregated value of cash only takeovers so far in 2018 has risen by 33 percent year-on-year while the value of deals using cash and stock has risen by 221 percent, as companies look to exploit their buoyant share valuations.
""A lot of M&A actually destroys value for shareholders, not adds value ... acquisitions are quite risky, they can be distracting, they have to be integrated effectively,"" Sue Noffke, fund manager at  Schroders  (L:SDR) said.
Meanwhile, companies have spent or committed to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on repurchasing stock so far this year, with Apple Inc (O:AAPL) alone planning to buy back up to $100 billion of its shares in an effort to bolster its returns.
By contrast, the latest Global Corporate Capital Expenditure Survey from Standard & Poors showed that the top 20 capex spenders among non-financial companies in Western Europe invested just shy of $200 billion in aggregate in 2016.
And across Europe, the Middle East and Africa, companies had stashed 974 billion euros of cash by the end of 2016, the latest data from Moody's Investor Service showed, with the ratio of cash relative to revenue at a seven-year high.
That has in part been fueled by ultra cheap debt, an era which is expected to come to an end as central banks around the world gradually tighten the loose monetary policy used to see wobbling economies through the financial crisis.
""What we don't want is for companies to gear up balance sheets ... we do want them to use spare cash to invest in their businesses,"" David Keir, co-manager of the Saracen Global Income & Growth Fund, told Reuters.
S&P data shows the non-financial companies in its rating universe grew capex by just 7 percent in the last 12 months, despite posting sales growth and EBITDA growth of 13.6 percent and 15.2 percent respectively over the same period.
However, there are indications some companies appear to be listening, or at least questioning whether copy-cat M&A deals will deliver their growth ambitions. Analysts at UBS said a net 30 percent of corporate respondents to its Evidence Lab Survey said they expected to increase capex over the next year.
""We're wary of M&A deals, full-stop. Particularly companies going out to find deals because they feel that they are under pressure to do something,"" Andrew Cave, Head of Governance & Sustainability at Baillie Gifford, said.
While some companies have been caught on the M&A escalator, others have won plaudits for stepping off.
Charlie Huggins, manager of the HL Select UK Income Shares fund, which holds a position in GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK), cheered the British drugmaker's recent decision to abandon a bid for Pfizer's (N:PFE) Consumer Health business.
""The key priority now is extending this capital allocation focus to the R&D pipeline,"" he said, adding it was ""critical in getting investors back on side in the long run"".
BYE-BYE BUYBACKS
Corporate America has led the way in passing on the problem of its surplus capital to investors via share repurchases, with around $530 billion spent on U.S. buybacks last year and $800 billion expected in 2018, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
Critics decry a lack of ambition and ideas among company executives, most of whom have long-term incentive plans linked to the price of their shares, which are lifted by buybacks.
Even special dividends are beginning to lose their luster, the fund managers said, particularly when viewed in the context of paltry organic investment figures.
George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, said doubts over how executives deployed their funds was a key reason why he was steering clear of many of Europe's largest companies.
""We are seeing a lot of poor use of capital - too much in dividends and too much in buybacks. We're very, very supportive if they've got sensible M&A to do but the actual grunt of integrating complex transactions can be really tough,"" he said.
Calls on executives to use capital more constructively could yet have a bearing on a number of deals in the pipeline, particularly if shareholders withdraw support in favor of more organic investment, the investors said.
""The market has rewarded solid, predictable earnings growth for the last 8 or 9 years. And clearly M&A comes with elevated risk,"" Old Mutual Global Investors fund manager Ed Meier said.

""You need very strong management teams who are confident in their ability to structure deals, but also execute quickly on these deals. And it's a skillset that isn't available to all.""

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) said it has halted planning for a new office building in Seattle and might sub-lease rather than occupy another future tower downtown, pending a city council vote on a proposed tax on top businesses.
Amazon's decision puts a question mark on more than 7,000 new jobs at those buildings that council members might be loathe to cost the city. Construction work and other businesses that would have catered to the world's largest online retailer could be at risk too.
""Pending the outcome of the head tax vote by City Council, Amazon has paused all construction planning on our Block 18 project in downtown Seattle and is evaluating options to sub-lease all space in our recently leased Rainer Square (NYSE:SQ) building,"" Amazon's Vice President Drew Herdener said in a statement.
The council is scheduled to vote on the proposal on May 14. 
""I'm deeply concerned about the impact this (Amazon's)decision will have on a large range of jobs,"" the Seattle Times quoted Mayor Jenny Durkan as saying on Wednesday.
Durkan's office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Amazon's rapid growth has transformed Seattle's South Lake Union district, replacing warehouses and parking lots with offices towers, highly paid tech workers and expensive eateries. The growth has contributed to an economic boom and rising rents.
Communities across North America are vying for a similar investment from Amazon. Amazon has said it will spend more than $5 billion and create up to 50,000 jobs in the city it chooses for its second headquarters, to be announced this year.
Seattle City Council in April proposed a tax plan affecting the city's roughly 500 largest businesses. 
The proposal, an employee hours tax that would transition to a payroll tax in 2021, would generate $75 million per year for Seattle, most of which would go to building affordable housing.
The efficacy of the specific proposal is unclear. 

Seattle has almost doubled its funding for affordable housing and homeless services programs since 2013 to $63 million per year, according to the report in the Seattle Times.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 04:56AM ET</span>","SoftBank's Son 'not involved' in Sprint, T-Mobile merger approvals","By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp's (T:9984) Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is not involved in trying to get the proposed merger of U.S. wireless carriers Sprint Corp (N:S) and T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) approved, Sprint's outgoing chief executive said on Thursday. 
Marcelo Claure's comments dampen speculation Son may use his ties to U.S. President Donald Trump to ease passage of the merger of the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers, which faces intense scrutiny from U.S. authorities.
Son, founder of Sprint's controlling shareholder SoftBank, is ""not involved at all"" in efforts to complete the $26 billion all-stock deal, Claure told Reuters in a phone interview. 
Sprint and T-Mobile announced on Sunday they had agreed to a merger in which Sprint would acquire T-Mobile. The deal allows the combined entity to bulk up in order to better invest in next-generation 5G wireless technology.
But the deal faces regulatory hurdles starting with scrutiny from the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission. 
Other steps include a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the U.S. federal states, and Trump's White House.
In late 2016 Son met Trump and pledged to invest $50 billion and create 50,000 new jobs in the United States, winning praise from the then president-elect. 
""It's always good to have a good relation, to be well perceived by the head of state but ... these are non-political processes,"" Claure said.
Hit by doubts over the deal's prospects, Sprint's shares have fallen 20 percent since Sunday's announcement. T-Mobile's shares are down almost 12 percent.
""There is a scepticism with our ability to be able to get this merger approved,"" Claure said adding it would be a top priority in his new role. 
NEW ROLE
Claure is stepping down from the top job at Sprint to become the chief operating officer at SoftBank Group and chief executive officer of SoftBank Group International, the technology and telecoms company's sprawling international investments arm. 
The latter role has been vacant since the departure of Nikesh Arora, the former Google (O:GOOGL) executive who was once set to become Son's successor.
Son has pledged to create a group of global companies employing technology such as connected devices and artificial intelligence.
But investor confusion over how mutually supportive such investments are has helped contribute to the ""conglomerate discount"" that has weighed on SoftBank's share price. 
""There are so many synergies within the group that we need to organize,"" Claure said, citing the example of closer cooperation over chip designs between SoftBank subsidiary ARM Holdings (LON:ARM) and other portfolio companies.

Michel Combes, Sprint's chief financial officer, will take over as Sprint CEO by May 31. Claure will become executive chairman.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>","China opens iron ore market to the world in pricing, image push","By Manolo Serapio Jr and Muyu Xu
MANILA/BEIJING (Reuters) - China opens trade in Dalian iron ore futures to foreign investors from Friday, aiming to boost its pricing clout for one of its top imports and hoping traders will take a market notorious for retail speculators more seriously. 
Iron ore is the second commodity China is opening to outside investors after launching crude oil futures in late March. Unlike crude oil, though, the iron ore contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) - launched in 2013 - has a deep pool of liquidity and major Western traders have already had access through local Chinese entities. 
With trading volumes last year that reached 20 times global iron ore trade, and 25 times volumes done in rival contracts on the Singapore Exchange, iron ore futures in China regularly sway benchmark spot pricing. Giving foreign investors direct access can only boost that influence. 
""DCE will always be a leading indicator. It has been and will always be (because of) the sheer volume of it,"" said Kelly Teoh, an iron ore derivatives broker at Clarkson Asia Pte Ltd.
Global commodity traders including  Glencore  (L:GLEN), Trafigura [TRAFG.UL] and Cargill (CARG.UL) already trade Dalian futures via China-registered units, sources with knowledge of their participation say. 
Cargill said it has been trading DCE's iron ore futures since the contract launch, using it as a price reference to manage its own inventory risk. 
""The internationalization of the DCE iron ore contracts will give greater access to the global commodity community to trade in the world's biggest onshore ferrous market,"" Lee Kirk, managing director at Cargill Metals, said in an email. 
More global players on the DCE should lead to ""more efficient pricing and increased liquidity,"" he said.
Officials for Trafigura and Glencore declined to comment. 
Twenty-one foreign trading agencies have so far registered at the DCE, according to the China Securities Journal, the official publication of China's top securities regulator, although the DCE has declined to name the agencies. 
The move should also boost arbitrage opportunities between Dalian and Singapore, said William Chin, head of commodities at the Singapore Exchange. 
It ""will make it easier for foreign participants to take advantage of price movements across both exchanges,"" he said. 
(Graphic: Iron ore traded volumes on Dalian vs Singapore exchanges - https://reut.rs/2rgTxoT) 
MASSIVE VOLUMES
Unlike oil, gold and copper, for which prices are set in London and New York, iron ore is one of the few commodities whose global pricing takes its cue from China. 
With massive volumes of iron ore futures traded on the Dalian exchange, prices there virtually dictate the path for the physical market. In 2017, Dalian iron ore volumes reached nearly 33 billion tonnes versus global annual trade of about 1.5 billion tonnes. 
The huge volumes make the DCE a magnet for speculative retail investors, who have triggered wild price swings and prompted regulators to impose trading curbs over the past two years. 
Nev Power, former boss of world No. 4 iron ore miner  Fortescue Metals  Group (AX:FMG), had criticized the speculative trade on Dalian, saying producers and users should be the main participants. 
Fortescue's new CEO, Elizabeth Gaines, who took over in February, said ""it remains to be seen what impact (the internationalization) will have on speculative trading and volatility in the market."" 
""We ... support pricing mechanisms which accurately reflect supply and demand for iron ore and provide certainty for the industry,"" Gaines said in an email. 
Miners such as Vale (SA:VALE),  Rio Tinto  (AX:RIO) (L:RIO), BHP Billiton (AX:BHP) (L:BLT) and Fortescue typically don't hedge or fix prices for future sales because that means their earnings can be lower if prices increase. 
""We will have to wait and see how this develops as there has been limited use so far by the miners to hedge on SGX,"" said Jamie Pearce, head of commodity derivatives at SSY Futures. 
But even if miners don't join the fray, DCE's internationalization is expected to boost its image as a venue for price discovery, participants say. 

""I expect China's iron ore futures market will be more mature and rational when more foreign investors enter the Chinese market,"" said Jacky Wang, chairman of Shanghai LC Assets Management Co Ltd.

1027,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Fund managers talk up short-selling ideas at New York conference,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers will take center stage at a conference in New York on Thursday to call out companies they are wagering against.
Years of strong equity gains have battered short sellers betting on a company's stock price to fall, marking a harrowing ride for some as they watched their targets climb.
Billed as the first conference to focus exclusively on shorting, the Kase Learning Short-Selling Conference in New York will feature industry icons like David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital and Carson Block of Muddy Waters.
It will also feature less well-known investors including Spruce Point Capital Management's Ben Axler, Aristides Capital's Chris Brown and Kerrisdale Capital's Sahm Adrangi.
Speaking at a private club in midtown Manhattan, they will present ideas, share tips and may even commiserate after years of lean returns.
Short sellers have often drawn attention with takedowns like Muddy Waters' allegations of fraud at timber company Sino-Forest, which subsequently filed for bankruptcy in 2012.
But more recently some bets against high-flying names like Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) have backfired as equity markets continued to surge.
""After a nine-year bull market, (short selling) was like swimming upstream,"" said conference organizer Whitney Tilson, who credits short-selling with saving his own hedge fund during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
""No one does it well,"" Tilson added. He shuttered his fund last year and is now focusing on teaching the next generation.
Last year dedicated short-sellers lost an average 10 percent as other hedge funds gained 6.6 percent, according to Hedge Fund Research data. The S&P 500 meanwhile gained 22 percent.
But short-sellers may have regained an edge after a burst of market volatility earlier this year fueled by fears of rising U.S. interest rates and the Trump administration's tough talk on trade.
""We were the canaries in the coal mine,"" Tilson said about investors including Einhorn, who bet that Lehman Brothers would crash months before the investment bank filed for bankruptcy in 2008.
Tilson himself shorted Lumber Liquidators in 2015, accusing it of selling flooring laced with cancer-causing materials.
While there are loud critics who wage public campaigns against companies they short, many other short-sellers had long kept positions secret for fear of losing access to corporate management or retribution from rival Wall Street investors through a so-called short squeeze.
""Now more than ever I want to hear ideas on the short side and the younger managers are more willing to talk,"" Tilson said.
Adrangi, whose Kerrisdale Capital often announces short bets, said publicity can help create buzz around an idea and that shorting is essential for well-balanced portfolios.
""The reason investors are paying hedge fund fees are to uncover alpha and shorting can help with that,"" he said.

But LJM's losses only became permanent the next day, the fund's lawyers said in a counter-claim filed in federal court in Manhattan. By the end of the two days LJM Partners and an affiliate had lost 80 percent or more of their value.
Wells Fargo Securities forced LJM to unwind its portfolio in ""a series of catastrophic trades that locked in the portfolio's primarily unrealized losses and made them real,"" LJM said in the filing.
LJM lost $266 million across its funds, ""at least $115 million more than if LJM had been allowed to apply its trading procedures,"" the counter-claim said.
A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo said in a statement: ""We will defend ourselves and strongly disagree with LJM’s claims."" 
LJM founder Anthony Caine said in a letter to clients in February that working with its clearing broker, LJM ""agreed that liquidation across all client accounts, regardless of clearing broker, was the most prudent action given market volatility and portfolio risks.""
Wells Fargo Securities has asked the court to help it retrieve $16.4 million, saying the brokerage covered LJM's margin and losses with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Wells Fargo previously declined to comment on Caine's account. 
LJM, which along with the affiliate managed more than $1 billion earlier this year, has not answered questions since the company and the affiliate reported their funds' losses. LJM later told clients it would return what was left of their money.
In Wednesday's filing, LJM's lawyers denied an earlier claim by Wells Fargo that the fund company is now likely to be insolvent. 

Investors are suing Caine and Anish Parvataneni, a portfolio manager at LJM who previously worked for fund investor Ken Griffin's Citadel, over what they said was inadequate disclosure about the risks of LJM's investment approach.

1029,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 10:10PM ET</span>",Brazil's Congress approves covering missed Venezuela payment,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A joint session of Brazil's Congress on Wednesday passed a measure allowing the use of federal funds to pay off debts owed by Venezuela and Mozambique, according to a decision published on the Congress website. 
Venezuela owes the vast majority of the nearly 1 billion reais ($281.60 million) owed to Brazil's BNDES [BNDES.UL] state development bank and also to  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), payment of which is due May 8.
The Brazilian government, under former President Dilma Rousseff, had agreed to act as the guarantor of the loans. The funds were used by Venezuela and Mozambique to pay works carried out by Brazilian firms. 

Brazilian President Michel Temer had earlier warned that if Congress did not approve covering the payment, the government would have been considered as having defaulted on the loans.

1030,By Investing.com,"<span>May 02, 2018 09:36PM ET</span>",Asian Stocks Mixed After Fed; U.S.-China Trade Talk In Focus ,"Investing.com – Asian equities were mixed in morning trade on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged as expected.
Overnight, the S&P 500 slid 0.7%, while the Dow closed 0.7% lower and the NASDAQ Composite lost 0.4%.
The Fed acknowledged inflation is close to its target and has not hinted any intention to change their gradual tightening of monetary policy.
“Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term,” the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement Wednesday. “The committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate.”
In Asia, the Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were 0.4% and 0.6% lower by 9:36PM ET (01:36 GMT).
Reports that a senior government official said “China would not succumb to threat from the U.S.” garnered some attention as U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are scheduled to kick off trade talks later in the day, although any significant breakthrough seemed unlikely.
The Chinese official said the government would not accept any U.S. preconditions for negotiations such as giving up its long-term advanced manufacturing ambitions or narrowing the trade gap.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index underperformed its regional peers and opened 1.7% lower. Electronic and software company Xiaomi made headlines as it filed for IPO in Hong Kong and has become the first major company to use the city’s new rules for going public.
Reports who cited people familiar with the matter expected the offering to be at least $10 billion, which would in turn value the company to be at least $100 billion.
Elsewhere, South Korea's KOSPI was unchanged at 2505.9 while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.8%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 is closed for a holiday.

1031,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 02, 2018 09:01PM ET</span>",Xiaomi Files in Hong Kong for World's Biggest IPO Since 2014,"(Bloomberg) -- Xiaomi Corp. became the first major company to use Hong Kong’s new rules for going public, filing for what’s expected be the world’s biggest debut since 2014.
The Chinese smartphone maker is taking advantage of changes in the former British colony that mean companies with different share classes can now list in the city. While the filing didn’t say how much Xiaomi is looking to raise in the initial public offering, it’s expected to be at least $10 billion, people with knowledge of the matter have said, and could value the business as high as $100 billion.
Xiaomi, reporting detailed financials for the first time, posted a net loss of 43.9 billion yuan ($6.9 billion) in 2017, reversing from a profit a year earlier. Revenue however surged 67.5 percent to 114.5 billion yuan last year.
It’s a big win for Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., whose officials spent years pushing to scrap a ban on weighted-voting rights, which give founders and executives control even with minority ownership. While some investors opposed the move, Xiaomi’s decision, four years after  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. chose New York, signals a new phase for the city in its ambitions to rival the U.S. market.
Xiaomi could be the biggest IPO since Alibaba’s $25 billion debut in 2014. Though it suffered through a challenging 2016, the company bounced back by revamping its sales model and expanding in India, where it rivals Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. as the biggest vendor.
The firm is also expected to issue Chinese depositary receipts after it goes public. Xiaomi has picked Citic Securities to handle its CDR issuance, people familiar with the matter said. While China’s State Council has approved plans to introduce CDRs, timing and details are unclear.
Co-founder and chief executive officer Lei Jun said CDRs were “an excellent idea” in a recent interview, calling them “a great policy innovation.”
Under Lei, Xiaomi is looking to enter developed markets for smartphones as it consolidates its position in emerging markets. It entered Spain last year and is also said to be talking to U.S. carriers to sell devices on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s home turf.
Apart from smartphones, Xiaomi has backed dozens of startups producing a wide spectrum of products from wearables to rice cookers. Total sales from its ecosystem doubled to 20 billion yuan in 2017.
CITIC Securities’ CLSA,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are joint sponsors of the offering.

1032,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 08:08AM ET</span>","Trade worries keep world stocks subdued, dollar holds gains","By Kit Rees
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks made little progress on Thursday as worries over global trade tensions weighed, while the U.S. dollar consolidated recent bumper gains after the Federal Reserve reaffirmed the outlook for more rate hikes.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, traded flat in percentage terms. Europe's pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.3 percent as the euro held firm.
As the Fed policy meeting threw up no surprises with rates left unchanged, the focus shifted back to simmering trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as the ongoing first quarter earnings season.
In Europe, earnings disappointments from medical technology company Smith & Nephew (LON:SN) and postal services provider Bpost soured the mood as the stocks fell 6.3 percent and 10.5 percent respectively, while German drug and crop chemicals maker Bayer (DE:BAYGN) flagged a stronger euro in its update.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 traded flat, with overnight results from Kraft Heinz, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Spotify in focus.
So far it has been a strong earnings season, with the year-on-year blended earnings growth estimate coming in at more than 25 percent in the first quarter for S&P 500 companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data, while the equivalent figure for the MSCI EMU index (European Economic and Monetary Union) is 14.6 percent in dollar terms.
The negative mood carried over from the Asian trading session, where shares slipped as hopes waned for real progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks, following reports the Trump administration is considering executive action to restrict some Chinese companies' ability to sell telecoms equipment in the United States.
""The risk at the moment is that the increasing uncertainty could create ambiguity in executives' heads, it makes corporate decision-making more difficult and then (leads to) a decline in investment,"" Alastair George, chief investment strategist at Edison Investment Research, said.
Edison's George added that the impact from trade tensions was hypothetical at the moment, though.
Talks between U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are due to kick off later on Thursday.
However, a breakthrough was viewed as highly unlikely, especially as the U.S. embassy said the delegation would leave as early as Friday evening.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.5 percent, while South Korean stocks stumbled 0.7 percent.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index ended 1.3 percent lower, but Chinese shares bucked the trend. The blue chip CSI 300 was up 0.8 percent, but not far from an eight-month low hit in April.
NO SURPRISES FROM THE FED
The Fed policy meeting ended with no change, as expected, while the central bank expressed confidence a recent rise in inflation to near target would be sustained, leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June.
""The statement carried only modest changes in wording, but they were meaningful nonetheless, highlighting that the Fed is optimistic on the outlook and intent on continuing to raise rates at a gradual pace,"" said Westpac analyst Elliot Clarke.
Yet the Fed also emphasized the inflation target was ""symmetric"", suggesting it was not inclined to speed up its tightening plans.
""The Fed sees little reason to be concerned with inflation marginally above its 2.0 percent target, particularly after such a long period of underperformance,"" Clarke said.
Westpac, like the market, expects two more hikes this year.
The Fed statement was not quite as hawkish as some had wagered on and caused a dip in the dollar, though sentiment remained bullish given U.S. rates were still clearly heading higher while those in Europe and Japan lagged far behind.
The euro was last at $1.1974, having hit a 15-week trough at $1.1936 on Wednesday, close to the low for the year at $1.1915.
The single currency trimmed gains after Euro zone inflation unexpectedly slipped in April, while Euro zone bond yields hit two-week lows. Germany's Bund yield fell to 0.55 percent, below six-week highs hit last week.
The dollar also scored a three-month peak on the yen at 110.05 overnight, before edging back to 109.400.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index was trading at 92.545, after reaching the highest since late December at 92.834.
Oil prices retreated with Brent crude futures slipped down to $72.95 a barrel, while U.S. crude was at $67.88. [O/R]
Spot gold was up 0.6 percent at $1,311.74 an ounce.

Harris, an activist manager holding 5 percent of AMP's shares, has watched around one quarter of the value of its investment evaporate since March as an inquiry into Australia's financial sector found AMP had misled customers and deceived the regulator.
""It's one thing to make a mistake - it’s another how you handle that mistake,"" Harris's director of international research, Justin Hance, told Fairfax Media.
Harris did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
He said some evidence given at the inquiry, called a Royal Commission, was ""very surprising and disappointing"" and he supported the departures of AMP chief executive Craig Meller and chairwoman Catherine Brenner.
The inquiry, which is also examining the conduct of Australia's biggest banks, is able to make recommendations including legislative changes and criminal or civil prosecutions.
Rating agency S&P Global said on Wednesday it would lower AMP's 'A' rating by a notch to 'A-' if the misconduct were to impact the firm's core wealth management business or if the risk of fines and legal action increased materially.

1035,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",U.S. safety agency says 'did not assess' Tesla Autopilot effectiveness,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. traffic safety regulator on Wednesday contradicted Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's claim that the agency had found that its Autopilot technology significantly reduced crashes, saying that regulators ""did not assess"" the system's effectiveness in a 2017 report.
Autopilot, a form of advanced cruise control, handles some driving tasks and warns those behind the wheel they are always responsible for the vehicle's safe operation, Tesla has said.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which issued the statement, and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating a fatal crash in March in which the driver was using Autopilot.
Following that fatality, Tesla pointed to a 2017 NHTSA report on a May 2016 fatality involving a driver using Autopilot. The report said crash rates fell by 40 percent after installation of Autopilot's Autosteer function, and noted that this number was derived from Tesla airbag deployment data.
The agency said on Wednesday its crash rate comparison ""did not evaluate whether Autosteer was engaged"" and ""did not assess the effectiveness of this technology.""
The agency described the Autopilot analysis in the 2017 report as a ""cursory comparison"" of airbag deployment rates before and after installation of the feature to determine whether models with Autosteer had higher crash rates. Such a finding ""could have indicated that further investigation was necessary,"" the agency said.
Tesla declined to comment.
In March, Tesla said that over a year ago, the U.S. government found that its first iteration of Autopilot reduced crash rates by as much as 40 percent. ""Internal data confirms that recent updates to Autopilot have improved system reliability,"" it added.
On Jan. 19, 2017, Musk tweeted: ""The data show that the Tesla vehicles crash rate dropped by almost 40 percent after Autosteer installation."" Autosteer, a system that automatically keeps the vehicle in the center of a lane, is part of the Autopilot technology package.
The 2017 NHTSA probe found no evidence of a defect. Investigations into the death of Walter Huang, the driver in the March 23 Tesla car crash, are ongoing.
The NTSB confirmed last month it had two other pending investigations of incidents involving Tesla vehicles, including an August 2017 Tesla battery fire in Lake Forest, California, after an owner lost control and ran the vehicle into his garage.
The NTSB previously faulted Tesla in a 2016 fatal crash in Florida in which Autopilot was engaged. NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said in 2017 that ""system safeguards were lacking.""
He also noted that ""Tesla allowed the driver to use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed and the system gave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention.""
Tesla said it had improved the system since the crash.
Tesla on Wednesday told investors in its quarterly financial report that on March 15 it released a ""significant Autopilot update"" that has been well received by its customers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Weapons manufacturer Remington Outdoor Company Inc won approval for its bankruptcy plan on Wednesday, paving the way for the company to slash debt, boost its cash position and better weather the uncertain climate for firearms in the United States.
Remington filed for bankruptcy in March with a deal in hand to cut its debt by about $775 million, a little more than one month after a school shooting in Parkland, Florida.
The shooting sparked protests and a wave of retailers and corporations to limit sales and transactions relating to firearms. Mass discounter Walmart Inc (N:WMT), which Remington is reliant on for sales, said it would stop selling guns to people under 21 years old.
Remington will exit bankruptcy as soon as this month, with some of its creditors, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Franklin Advisors, taking ownership stakes in the company in exchange for forgiving debt. Cerberus Capital Management L.P., Remington's current private equity owner, will give up its equity in the restructuring.
The company confirmed in a statement that its expects to emerge from bankruptcy before the end of May. 
Remington will then have a new Asset Based Loan (ABL) facility of $193 million, the proceeds of which will refinance the existing ABL facility in full.
""I'm satisfied there's sufficient creditor support to win confirmation,"" Judge Brendan Shannon said in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Remington filed a so-called pre-packaged bankruptcy, meaning it had largely won the support of its creditors before it filed in court.
Remington's creditor committee, composed of a representative for its pension and plaintiffs in cases against the company for gun injuries and deaths, supported the bankruptcy plan, an attorney for the group told Shannon.
“I want to especially thank our dedicated employees spread across the United States that have remained focused on Remington throughout this process” said Chief Executive Anthony Acitelli.
The company's bankruptcy plan allows for lawsuits against it to continue, including one filed by the families of the victims of the Sandy Hook, Connecticut, school shooting. One of its rifles was used in the 2012 shooting.

Gun sales fell after President Donald Trump was elected because firearm enthusiasts were no longer worried about increased regulation. That dynamic led in part to Remington's bankruptcy filing.

CBA's acting Group Executive, Retail Banking Services, Angus Sullivan accepted responsibility on YouTube after BuzzFeed Australia broke the story on Wednesday.
Sullivan said in May 2016 the country's largest bank found it had lost two magnetic tapes containing 15 years of data on customer names, addresses and account numbers for 19.8 million accounts. The tapes were due to be disposed of, but CBA could not confirm they were securely destroyed.
The tapes did not contained PINs, passwords or other data that could enable account fraud, Sullivan said.
The bank informed its regulators and launched an internal investigation which found the tapes had ""most likely been disposed of,"" Sullivan said.
""The decision was taken not to alert customers given the outcome of our investigation which found the tapes were most likely disposed of,"" Sullivan said in the video clip. 
""In these cases, we balanced the need to alert customers without unnecessarily alarming them.""
Sullivan said the investigation found no evidence the data had been compromised or accessed by third parties.
""I want to assure our customers that we have taken the steps necessary to protect their information and we apologize for any concern this incident may cause.""
The revelation comes at a tough time for the bank which just this week was criticized by its main regulator for allowing money laundering to flourish.
The Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulatory Authority (APRA) hit CBA with an extra A$1 billion ($753 million) capital requirement and reported a ""widespread sense of complacency"" within the organization.
The Australian government's top finance minister, Treasurer Scott Morrison, even called for more heads to roll at the bank. 

Earlier this week, Australia's largest-listed wealth manager, AMP Ltd (AX:AMP), announced the resignations of its chairwoman and legal counsel and cut directors' fees in response to revelations of misconduct at an independent judicial inquiry.

(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (N:MET) reported an 8 percent rise in adjusted first-quarter profit on Wednesday, boosted by U.S. tax reforms, as well as volume growth in Asia and better results in auto and catastrophe businesses.
The U.S. insurer reported adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.36 per share, compared to $1.3 billion, or $1.20 per share in the same period of 2017. 
Analysts were expecting a quarterly profit of $1.17 per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable.
MetLife shares rose 2.3 percent to $46.10 in afterhours trading.
The insurer's adjusted profit strips out the effect of wild swings in derivatives values, which hurt MetLife's results last year. The gap between its net income and adjusted profit has narrowed, which shows that the company has been taking the right steps to reduce exposure to market volatility, MetLife Chief Executive Officer Steven Kandarian said in a statement.
MetLife has been working to regain investor confidence after two financial reporting errors for 2017. On Tuesday, it said Treasurer John McCallion would take over as chief financial officer from John Hele, who is retiring.

Two other large U.S. insurers, American International Group Inc (N:AIG) and  Prudential  Financial Inc (N:PRU) also reported results on Wednesday afternoon. AIG's profit fell 21 percent due to higher catastrophe claims and weaker investment income, while Prudential (LON:PRU) got a profit boost from its annuities business.

BOSTON (Reuters) - LPL Financial Holdings has reached a $26 million settlement with state securities regulators resolving claims that the U.S. broker-dealer was negligent in supervising employees and preventing the sale of unregistered securities to customers.
The settlement was announced on Wednesday by state securities regulators in Massachusetts and Alabama, who said the deal will also ensure that LPL buys back securities that were illegally sold to investors.
""Because of the states' combined efforts, thousands of investors will benefit and be given the right to have their money returned plus interest,"" Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin said in a statement.
The settlement followed an investigation led by regulators in Massachusetts and Alabama that covered conduct they said took place over the past 12 years.
The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), which established a task force to probe LPL, said investigators found it failed to maintain adequate systems to supervise employees and prevent the sale of unregistered securities.
LPL Financial, the largest U.S. independent broker-dealer by revenue, said it will pay a $499,000 fine to each of the 52 U.S. states and territories if they choose to participate in the deal. California has chosen not to participate, LPL said.
""We take our compliance and risk management obligations seriously and will continue to dedicate resources to this important work moving forward,"" LPL said in a statement.
Under the settlement, customers who were sold unregistered securities since October 2006 will be offered the full amount they paid plus 3 percent interest.
LPL also agreed to a ""top-to-bottom"" review of the integration of new securities products to determine the company's ability to comply with various states' securities registration requirements, NASAA said.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. technology heavyweights like Apple, Amazon and Intel along with Wall Street's biggest banks look like the early winners from Republicans' corporate tax cuts, boosting their bottom lines by more than $11 billion so far, a Reuters analysis of first-quarter earnings showed.
Graphic: Tech and Banks Win Big from Tax Cuts - https://reut.rs/2rfY7Uv
S&P 500 companies on average have slashed their median effective tax rates to 21 percent in the March quarter, down 6 percentage points from a year ago, according to an analysis of 252 earnings reports. That has translated into a nearly $18 billion reduction in income tax provisions in the first quarter, more than half of which accrued to the benefit of the tech and finance industries.
Graphic: FAANG Blunts its Tax Bill - https://reut.rs/2I3okPN
The financial and technology sectors lead others in the size of their profits, and they also reduced their effective tax rates more than others during the most recent quarter. 
In the latest big example, Apple Inc (O:AAPL) on Tuesday reported a $13.8 billion net profit for the March quarter, up $2.8 billion from the year before, with nearly half of that increase resulting from a reduced tax rate. Changes to how overseas profits are treated also allowed it to plow a record amount of cash into stock repurchases.
Companies' tax rates rise and fall over time for a variety of reasons, making it difficult to say how much of the quarter's broad tax-rate decline was a direct results of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by Republican lawmakers in December. 
However, this quarter's drop in average tax rates provisioned by recently reporting S&P 500 companies was dramatic compared with changes in the same quarter in recent years, and many companies attributed their lower tax rates to the fiscal overhaul. The companies in the Thomson Reuters analysis had median tax rates of 27 percent in the first quarter of 2017 and 29 percent in the first quarter of 2016.
Intel (O:INTC) halved its tax rate in the first quarter to 11 percent, primarily because of the tax cuts, reducing the chipmaker's effective tax bill by around $560 million.
Amazon.com's (O:AMZN) tax rate declined by 9 percentage points in the March quarter, adding $170 million to its bottom line.
 Morgan Stanley  (N:MS),  Citigroup  (N:C), JPMorgan (N:JPM),  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and Bank of America (N:BAC) trimmed their tax bills by a combined $2 billion in the first quarter, compared to what they would have set aside using last year's tax rates. 
About a third of expected U.S. corporate earnings expansion in the March quarter is a result of the tax cuts, a trend that is likely to continue through 2018, said Patrick Palfrey, an earnings analyst at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). 
""What we're experiencing is a very strong underlying growth trend, which is being driven by revenue and margin growth,"" Palfrey said. ""That's being augmented by the tax change.""
The biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in over 30 years, the new law slashes the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and reshapes how the government taxes multinational corporations.
Its passage pushed Wall Street to record highs, with analysts recently forecasting a 25 percent leap in aggregate S&P 500 earnings in the March quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
S&P 500 information technology companies on average slashed their first-quarter effective tax rates by 9 percentage points, outdone only by the telecommunication group's 10 percent reduction. They are followed by financials, which on average cut their tax rates by 8 percentage points.
Apple cut its effective tax rate to 15 percent in the March quarter from 25 percent a year before.
Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) effective tax rate of 11 percent in the first quarter netted the Google owner an additional $1 billion in net income compared to what it would have earned using its tax rate of 20 percent in the first quarter of 2017. Alphabet attributed its lower tax rate to changes in accounting rules for reporting investments, as well as to the Tax Act.
Twitter (N:TWTR) said that $21 million of its $70 million increase in non-GAAP quarterly net income was due to the tax cut.
Raytheon (N:RTN) cut its tax rate by 10 percentage points in the March quarter, equivalent to $83 million, and the missile maker raised its 2018 earnings forecast in part because of the tax cuts.

 Hershey Co  (N:HSY) cut its adjusted tax rate to 25 percent in the March quarter from over 30 percent the year before, an improvement it attributed to the tax cut.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 10:17PM ET</span>","The price of Musk cutting off analysts? For Tesla, it's $2 billion","By Alexandria Sage and Sonam Rai
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Ducking analysts' questions has a price: $2 billion.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc investors gave a rare rebuke to iconoclastic Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday after he cut off analysts asking about profit potential, sending shares down 5 percent despite promises that production of the troubled Model 3 electric car was on track.
Tesla's future depends on the Model 3 and the company said that it had largely overcome production bottlenecks, with Musk vowing a dramatic turnaround that would reverse losses and generate positive cash flow in just a few months. 
Musk plans to shut down its Fremont, California factory for 10 days in the second quarter but said Tesla will meet the production target of 5,000 Model 3s per day by the end of June, as planned, and will turn a profit in the second half of the year. 
To achieve profitability, Musk will have to reverse what today amounts to a $22,584 pre-tax loss per vehicle built by the Silicon Valley company. Tesla posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss when it announced first-quarter results on Wednesday.
Tesla stock was little changed after the earnings announcement but fell during a conference call, when Musk began cutting analysts' questions short, costing Tesla over $2 billion in market capitalization. 
""These questions are so dry. They're killing me,"" Musk said after an analyst asked what percentage of Tesla 3 reservation holders have started to configure options for their cars, an indicator of how much profit Tesla will be able to wring from the vehicles. Another analyst asked about a capital requirement before being cut off. 
He then took several questions in a row about plans for a self-driving car network and other long-term projects from the host of a YouTube channel focused on investing, praising the questions as not boring. 
(For a graphic on Tesla earnings click http://tmsnrt.rs/2p6EbiR)
5,000 MODEL 3s PER WEEK
Musk's ability to run Tesla is crucial as the company strives to efficiently and profitably build its first vehicle intended to be produced at high volume, the Model 3.
Musk acknowledged error recently in over-automating the Model 3 assembly-line, which has resulted in production delays, but it is still unclear how long and costly it will be to unwind this mistake.
Delayed Model 3 production also comes as a slew of competitors bring new electric vehicle models to market. 
The company stood by a previously announced target of building 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of June.
Tesla's capital expenditures declined in the quarter and the company cut its spending forecasts for 2018, saying it would spend less than $3 billion. Tesla spent $3.4 billion in 2017. (https:// 
Investing.com analyst Clement Thibault said the reduction was noteworthy, ""but in the long run given challenges that lay ahead of Tesla, I don't think it is going to make or break the company.""
Tesla ""is definitely not in a minimizing cost stage,"" Thibault said. 
Free cash flow, a key metric of financial health, widened to negative $1 billion in the first quarter from negative $277 million in the fourth quarter, excluding costs of systems for its solar business. Analysts had not expected so much spending, predicting hundreds of millions of dollars less in so-called cash burn, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Tesla did not break out a cash flow calculation that it had included in previous quarters.
The niche carmaker, which two years ago vowed to build 500,000 vehicles annually in 2018, has attracted legions of fans for its advanced technology and design. But the company rushed its Model 3 to market, making mistakes in manufacturing whose effects are now being felt, and investor skepticism has risen.
Questions over Tesla's finances are top of mind, and many analysts anticipate a capital raise in 2018 despite Musk's statements that it will not be necessary due to profitability and positive cash flow in the third or fourth quarters. 
Tesla said gross margins on the Model 3, which today are slightly negative, would be close to flat in the second quarter and grow to ""highly positive"" in the second half of the year.
Tesla said it produced 2,270 Model 3s per week in the last week of April. It said net reservations for the Model 3, including configured orders not yet delivered, exceeded 450,000 at the end of the first quarter.
Automotive revenue rose only 1 percent from the prior quarter to $2.74 billion.
RECORD LOSS
Tesla reported a record loss of $709.6 million, or $4.19 per share, for the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $330.3 million, or $2.04 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, Tesla had a loss of $3.35 per share. Analysts had expected a loss of $3.58 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company said it ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash after spending $655.7 million in quarterly capital expenses.
The lack of Model 3 revenue has exacerbated Tesla's cash burn as the company continues to spend on its assembly line and prepares for new investments on multiple projects in the pipeline, such as the Model Y crossover and its Gigafactory.

The Model Y is just one of many projects in the pipeline for Tesla, which also launched a Tesla Semi and a new Roadster in recent months.

1052,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 08:34PM ET</span>",Spotify hits wrong note with new customer forecast,"By Eric Auchard and Munsif Vengattil
LONDON/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Spotify Technology SA missed the beat on Wednesday. The streaming music leader fell short of investor hopes that it could turn free music listeners into paying subscribers at a faster clip, and its shares dropped as much as 9 percent.
Shares had run up 3 percent in regular trading ahead of its first report as a public company, and analysts said expectations may have become overblown. They voiced concerns that discounts were eating into the company's average revenue per user. First-quarter revenue also fell shy of analysts' average forecasts.
The Swedish company, which began trading in an unorthodox direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange in April, reported steady growth by most financial measures but failed to deliver the commanding performance that could justify the bullish stock recommendations published in the days ahead of the results.
Spotify said paid subscriptions for the second quarter would range between 79 million and 83 million, which at the midpoint was below Wall Street's consensus forecast of 81.79 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said Spotify appears to be discounting many full-price music subscriptions and extending the length of free-trial plans to convert free, advertising supported users into paying subscribers.
Average revenue per user in the first quarter fell to 4.72 euros, down from around 6.84 euros towards the end of 2015.
""It looks like there may be too many discounts and too high a percentage of premium subs may be in for the cheaper family and student plans,"" Mogharabi said.
Shares of Spotify ran up 14 percent from their first day of trade a month ago, closing at $170 ahead of its first quarter financial report. Afterward, the stock was trading at $155.50, down 8.5 percent at 2245 GMT/6:45 p.m. ET on Wednesday.
Spotify reported first-quarter revenue of 1.139 billion euros ($1.36 billion), up 26 percent from a year earlier, or 37 percent excluding currency effects. 
The revenue was broadly in line with the 1.10 billion euros to 1.15 billion euros the company had forecast but just short of the 1.143 billion euro consensus estimate among 13 analysts.
""Results and guidance are pretty much exactly in line with expectations, but the stock reaction clearly suggests investors were hoping for a little more,"" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said. 
One soft spot was slow growth in North America, Cordwell said, which despite Spotify's global reach could be seen as a gauge for how well it is competing for subscriptions with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Spotify, which launched its streaming music service a decade ago, has enjoyed a surge in subscriber growth only in recent years. Since launching in 2015, Apple Music has grown rapidly to 40 million paid users and 8 million trial users and is looking to overtake Spotify in the lucrative North American market. 
Amazon Music, the No. 3 player in the global streaming music outside China, does not disclose exact figures but reported last week it had ""tens of millions of paid customers"" and that subscriptions grew more than 100 percent in the last six months. 
The Swedish company said it expected revenue for the second quarter of between 1.1 billion and 1.3 billion euros, up 10 percent to 29 percent year on year, including foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding currency effects, Spotify expects revenue growth of 20 percent to 38 percent. 
It projected gross margins of between 24 percent and 26 percent, roughly in line with the 24.9 percent margin it reported in first quarter.
MUSICAL REVIVAL
On Wednesday, Spotify kept its outlook for full year 2018 unchanged, with monthly active users rising to between 198 million and 208 million. 
It posted a first-quarter operating loss of 41 million euros, a sharp improvement from a loss of 139 million euros a year ago. 
Spotify said it had 170 million active monthly users at the end of March, up 30 percent from the year-ago quarter. 
The rising popularity of Spotify's subscription services have led stock market investors to once again prize the music industry after shunning it for more than a decade amid a wave of piracy by users and in the face of major technology shifts.
France’s  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), the owner of Universal Music Group, the world’s biggest music label, said recently it is mulling a stock market listing of its wholly owned music unit.
Tencent Music Entertainment (TME), which attracts three-quarters of China’s booming music-streaming market, has been reported to be eyeing a listing in 2018. TME is controlled by internet giant Tencent and also holds a stake in Spotify.

Revenue from free, advertising-supported services which Spotify uses to woo new listeners to the service in order to eventually convert them to paying members, grew to 102 million euros in the first quarter, up 38 percent, year-over year. Advertising sales are a tenth of what it makes from subscribers.

1054,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 02, 2018 03:31PM ET</span>",A Rare Treasury Yield-Curve Trade Emerges After Fed Decision,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s interest-rate decision sparked a move in the U.S. yield curve that’s been virtually absent of late.
The spread between 5- and 30-year yields widened after the announcement to 33.6 basis points, the highest since April 27. Curve steepening is a rare enough occurrence -- it’s near the flattest levels in more than a decade amid bets on continued gradual Fed rate hikes. But it’s the manner of the steepening that’s striking.
The world’s biggest bond market experiences so-called bull steepening when shorter-term Treasuries rally to a greater extent than their longer-dated counterparts. Indeed, five-year yields fell as much as 1.7 basis points and two-year yields dropped 1.2 basis points. In contrast, 10-year yields were flat and those on the long bond rose.
Traders attributed the move in short-term yields to the Fed being less hawkish than anticipated after its preferred measure of inflation reached its 2 percent target this week for the first time since February 2017.
“If there was an expectation that the statement was going to be more hawkish and that the Fed was going to guide the market to expect three more rate hikes this year, I didn’t see it in the statement,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN)."
1055,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 03:52PM ET</span>","At Milken, Wall Street touts itself as force for good","By Lawrence Delevingne
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (Reuters) - The titans of finance who flock to the annual Milken Institute Global Conference each spring say they believe their quest for profits can also make the world a better place. 
At the Beverly Hills, California, event featuring lavish parties, celebrities and big Wall Street names, speakers argued that chasing returns does not have to come with a social or environmental cost. 
David Petraeus, the retired U.S. general and former CIA director who is now an executive at $168 billion investment firm KKR & Co (N:KKR), cited moral and practical reasons for so-called impact investing to create environmental and social benefits, in an onstage interview on Monday with event organizer and namesake Michael Milken.
“We seriously try to do well while doing good,” Petraeus said.
Clifton Robbins, chief executive of $3.4 billion Blue Harbour Group LP, said ESG factors are integrated into every investment the activist hedge fund firm makes.
“Using ESG is a new paradigm for smart investing,” Robbins told Reuters on Monday night at a party atop the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel. “It reduces risk and improves investment outcomes.”
Social and environmental change through business is a core theme of the Milken confab, which features panels on ethical investing and related topics. 
“The Milken Institute was founded with the belief that finance can be used to overcome global challenges,” said Caitlin MacLean, Milken’s senior director for innovative finance. 
She said solutions to social issues such as financing cures for malaria, renewable power in Southeast Asia or affordable housing in low-income communities all require funding.
Others defended their business more broadly. 
Jonathan Sokoloff, managing partner of $25 billion Leonard Green & Partners, said on a panel on Tuesday that private equity was a “very, very important part of the economy” and offered a “better model” for companies versus public markets.
“We believe our form of governance and running our businesses is superior,” Sokoloff said. 
Like the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Milken’s signature event mixes financiers with government officials, celebrities and non-profit leaders. 
Speakers this year included U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, private equity billionaire Leon Black, U.S. football star Tom Brady and entrepreneur Arianna Huffington. The event was sponsored by firms such as WorldQuant LLC,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group and Guggenheim Partners. 
Attendance hit a record of more than 5,000 attendees. Tickets typically cost between $12,500 and $25,000.
WOOING INVESTORS 
Fund managers and marketers woo prospective investors at poolside cabanas at the Beverly Hilton hotel and private dinners in nearby restaurants and mansions. 
An event on Tuesday night organized by EJF Philanthropies, a hedge fund-linked charity that funds conservation efforts, was held at the home of private equity billionaire Brian Sheth and featured a live cheetah. 
Another on Monday night, hosted by investment firm Orchard Global Asset Management at Mastro’s Steakhouse, featured Senator Bob Corker and U.S. Representative Jeb Hensarling and large investors in private funds. 
Milken’s positive portrayal of finance does not ring true to all. 
“Big investment firms and banks are not helping to create better jobs for most American workers. They're helping the rich get richer,” said Michael Kink, executive director of the Strong Economy For All Coalition, what he termed a ""labor-community economic justice"" group based in New York. 
Milken’s MacLean said that “public funding and philanthropic capital alone can’t bridge the funding gaps to solve global challenges.”
Eric Cantor, the former U.S. House majority leader and now vice chairman of investment bank Moelis & Company, told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference that he has long been drawn to Milken’s focus on capitalism as a force for good, often through partnership with the public sector.

“It’s about how you create an environment for that collaborative effort to end up yielding one of the highest standards of living in the world,” Cantor said.

1056,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",U.S. stock pickers beat benchmarks amid volatility,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The volatility that stopped the bull market in U.S. stocks in its tracks after hitting record highs in January is rewarding stock-picking fund managers. 
Approximately 60 percent of U.S. actively managed large-cap funds are beating their benchmarks for the year to date, the best performance through April for any year since at least 2009, according to research from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). 
So-called growth funds posted the largest outperformance, with an average of 67 percent of funds beating their benchmarks, followed by a 57-percent outperformance rate for value funds and 52 percent for so-called core funds, which blend both value and growth strategies. 
Fund manager investments in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), both of which are up more than 35 percent for the year to date, helped boost the returns of large-cap funds, noted Savita Subramanian, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Overall, the average large-cap fund has gained 0.6 percent for the year, compared with a flat S&P 500, Bank of America Merrill Lynch noted. 
Small-cap fund managers, meanwhile, have underperformed compared with the benchmark Russell 2000, with just 37.4 percent of funds beating the index. 
While the outperformance will reward investors who have remained in actively-managed funds, it may not be enough to stem the tide of dollars flowing into low-cost passive funds, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at New York-based CFRA. 
""It's still going to be a challenge to win back investors and advisors that went toward lower-cost, more consistent index based strategies,"" Rosenbluth said. ""Once you’ve crossed that river, it's hard to come back.""
Funds run by stock pickers would need to post at least a year of strong outperformance to rekindle the interest of advisors who are now more focused on costs, he said. 
Shares of actively-managed fund companies are outperforming for the year to date, as performance gains and the anticipation of higher investor flows boost investor optimism. 

Shares of T Rowe Price Group Inc (NASDAQ:TROW) are up 6.4 percent year-to-date, while shares of BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) - best known for its iShares line of passive exchange traded funds - are up just 1.2 percent.

1061,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 07:05PM ET</span>",Cambridge Analytica and British parent shut down after Facebook scandal,"(Reuters) - Cambridge Analytica, the firm embroiled in a controversy over its handling of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) user data, and its British parent SCL Elections Ltd, are shutting down immediately after suffering a sharp drop in business, the company said on Wednesday.
The company will begin bankruptcy proceedings, it said, after losing clients and facing mounting legal fees resulting from the scandal over reports the company harvested personal data about millions of Facebook users beginning in 2014.
""The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company’s customers and suppliers,"" the statement said.
""As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.""
Allegations of the improper use of data for 87 million Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by President Donald Trump's 2016 U.S. election campaign, has hurt the shares of the world's biggest social network and prompted multiple official investigations in the United States and Europe.
""Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,"" the company's statement said.
The firm is shutting down effective Wednesday and employees have been told to turn in their computers, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier. 
The Cambridge Analytica sign had been removed from the reception area of its London offices on Wednesday. At SCL's Washington, D.C. office, a man declined to answer questions from a Reuters reporter. 
After the announcement, Britain's data regulator said it would continue civil and criminal investigations of the firm and will pursue ""individuals and directors as appropriate"" despite the shutdown.
""We will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded,"" a spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner's Office said in a statement.
Cambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on U.S. elections, with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times reported.
Cambridge Analytica marketed itself as a provider of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.
After Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm’s help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, the Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a ""secret sauce"" it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could.
One unanswered question in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether there was any collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia is whether Russia’s Internet Research Agency or Russian intelligence used data Cambridge Analytica obtained from Facebook or other sources to help target and time messages during the campaign that were anti-Hillary Clinton, pro-Trump and politically and racially divisive.

Bannon was a former vice president of the London-based firm, and Mueller has asked it to provide internal documents about how its data and analyses were used in the Trump campaign, according to sources familiar with the investigation.

(Reuters) - Buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO) has approached  Xerox Corp  (N:XRX) to express interest in a possible acquisition, casting new uncertainty over the U.S. printer company's $6.1 billion sale to Japan's Fujifilm Holdings (T:4901), people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The development marks the latest twist in Xerox's saga. On Tuesday, Xerox said its chief executive, Jeff Jacobson, and most of its board will step down to settle a lawsuit by activist shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason.
Apollo's interest in Xerox has been reinforced by the appointment of John Visentin as the company's new CEO, the sources said. Visentin was previously CEO of Novitex Enterprise Solutions and also chairman of  Presidio Inc  (O:PSDO), two companies in which Apollo invested.
There is no certainty that Apollo's approach will entice Xerox or that it will lead to a deal. Fujifilm has said it will challenge a court order suspending its deal with Xerox, while the new board of the latter reviews it.
The sources asked not to be identified because the approach is confidential. Apollo and Xerox declined to comment, while Fujifilm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Deason declined to comment while Icahn could not be reached for comment.
Xerox shares pared losses on news of Apollo's approach, and were down 5.8 percent at $30.42 on Wednesday afternoon after plunging as much as 8 percent on news of the outcome of Icahn and Deason's legal challenge. Xerox has a market capitalization of $7 billion.
As part of the settlement with Icahn and Deason announced on Tuesday, Xerox said its board of directors would meet immediately to begin evaluating all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including ending or restructuring Xerox’s deal with Fujifilm.
Icahn and Deason had already won a rare court order to temporarily block the deal, which they said undervalued Xerox. A New York judge last week agreed that CEO Jeff Jacobson had been ""hopelessly conflicted"" in negotiating a deal that would put him in charge, since he knew the board was looking to replace him.

Visentin had previously been hired by Icahn to assist in fighting Xerox. He had also been a candidate under consideration by the old board to replace Jacobson as recently as last year, according to court documents.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors backed off domestic stocks for a second straight week, greeting strong earnings with a shrug and fretting about the potential for a downturn, Investment Company Institute (ICI) data showed on Wednesday.
Domestic stock fund demand weakened, with investors pulling $3.8 billion out during the seven days through April 25, according to the trade group.
First-quarter S&P 500 (SPX) earnings are now expected to leap 25 percent over the prior year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, with more than two-thirds of those companies having reported results.
Nearly 80 percent of the companies have beaten expectations, the most on records dating to 1994.
 Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) analysts led by Jonathan Golub said this kind of earnings growth is unheard of during the later stages of an economic recovery. U.S. stocks have been rising for the better part of a decade.
Yet concerns about economic growth peaking, rising inflation and interest rates and a flattening yield curve are weighing on stocks, along with the potential for greater regulation of technology companies.
""While each issue has merit, we believe investors are under-estimating the market's potential upside, and over-estimating risks,"" the analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday.
Investors continued to turn to international equities and debt markets for relative safety despite the risk that stalling growth and rising rates could wreak havoc on those assets, too. 
The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) inched through the 3 percent level for the first time in four years on April 24, pushing bond prices down, and on the same day  Caterpillar  Inc's (N:CAT) strong earnings were overshadowed by comments by an executive for the world's largest heavy equipment maker that the profits are ""the high watermark for the year."" 
International-focused equity funds gathered $2.9 billion during the most recent week, marking nearly 17 months without withdrawals. Bond funds took in $2.3 billion, a tenth straight week netting cash, ICI said.
The following table shows estimated ICI flows for mutual funds and ETFs (all figures in million of dollars):

1086,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",South Africa says U.S. decision not to grant steel tariff exemption could hurt jobs,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's trade department and labor unions said on Wednesday the U.S decision not to grant Pretoria an exemption from steel and aluminum tariffs could speed up job losses in manufacturing and mining.
Countries including Canada, Mexico, Australia and Brazil were exempt from the tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, proclaimed by U.S President Donald Trump in March.
South African exports of aluminum products are annually about 1.6 percent of total U.S aluminum imports.
The trade department said on Tuesday it was disappointed and concerned that South Africa was not granted an exemption from the duties and described the U.S. decision as ""unfair"".
""It is important to note that some of the exempted countries are the biggest exporters of steel and aluminum to the United States,"" the department said. 
The Federation of Unions of South Africa (FEDUSA) said in a statement that the decision ""will only accelerate job losses in the manufacturing and mining industries"" - key pillars of the economy of Africa's most industrialized country.
South Africa's scope to invest in infrastructure has been curbed by weak public finances due to sluggish economic growth, revenue shortfalls and costly bailouts of state-owned companies.
Job cuts are a thorny issue in South Africa, which is faced with near record unemployment of about 27 percent and subdued growth in mining and manufacturing.

MONTREAL/PARIS (Reuters) -  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and Airbus SE (PA:AIR) named new leaders for the CSeries jetliner program on Wednesday, in a further step towards finalizing a deal for the European planemaker to take control of the Canadian project, according to memos seen by Reuters.
Airbus agreed last year to take control of the program for a symbolic Canadian dollar after the small, lightweight jetliner failed to win enough buyers and ran over-budget.
Philippe Balducchi, head of performance management for Airbus Commercial Aircraft, will be chief executive of the joint entity controlled by Airbus with six executives from each side, according to memos to staff of both companies. 
Balducchi, who is well-known to aerospace analysts after a stint running investor relations at Europe's largest aerospace group, reiterated the deal should close by mid-year.
""This is good news because there is a lot of appetite for this remarkable aircraft in the market,"" he wrote in one of the memos.
Airbus and Bombardier both declined to comment.
The companies have said Airbus' global sales network and greater bargaining power with suppliers should boost sales and lower the CSeries' manufacturing costs. 
Montreal-based Bombardier's stock rose 1.8 percent in late-afternoon trading, breaking a three-day losing streak.
Sources familiar with the matter have said the companies have an internal target of closing the deal by the end of May after winning final regulatory approvals. 
Bombardier is also due to announce quarterly earnings and hold its annual general meeting on Thursday. 
In an effort to reassure Quebec's roughly 2,000 CSeries workers, Balducchi reiterated the partnership would remain headquartered in the Montreal area and that the 110-to-130-seat jet would continue to be built there for global customers.
A separate facility in Alabama, alongside an existing Airbus plant, will be used for deliveries to U.S. buyers.
In other appointments, Airbus troubleshooter David Dufrenois was named head of CSeries sales with the task of winning over more airlines to the plane, which Airbus once saw as a threat to its smallest models but which it now regards as complementary.
The Airbus sales executive led a team focused on stabilizing sales of the A380 superjumbo and handled key accounts such as Qatar Airways, one of the industry's most demanding buyers. 
Rob Dewar, a Bombardier vice president seen by many as instrumental to the CSeries, will oversee support and engineering, according to one of the memos.
The CSeries deal leaves Quebec's flagship industrial group with an aerospace business focused on regional jets and turboprops, as well as business jets and trains.

In one memo, Bombardier CEO Alain Bellemare said Commercial Aircraft President Fred Cromer - one of a number of former leasing executives originally hired to keep the CSeries afloat - will continue to lead its regional aircraft business.

1092,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>",Southwest jet makes emergency stop in Cleveland with cracked window,"By Gina Cherelus and Alana Wise
(Reuters) - A Newark, New Jersey-bound Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) flight made an emergency landing in Cleveland on Wednesday after a window pane cracked in flight, airline officials and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said.
No one was injured in the incident, which came two weeks after an engine on a Southwest 737 ripped apart in flight and shattered a window, killing a female passenger in the first U.S. airline passenger fatality since 2009.
The cause of Wednesday's crack in one of the window's multiple panes was not immediately known.
The flight, Southwest 957, was traveling to Newark Liberty International Airport from Chicago Midway International Airport with 76 passengers on board. The crew diverted the  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737-700 to Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport at about 11 a.m. EDT to inspect a layer of a windowpane, said Southwest spokesman Brian Parrish. 
""The aircraft has been taken out of service for maintenance review,"" Parrish said.
FAA spokesman Tony Molinaro, who confirmed no one was hurt, said the organization was investigating the incident.
Wednesday's incident is damaging more to Southwest's public perception than evidence of any systemic issue, Teal Group Fleet analyst Richard Aboulafia said. The airline said in its first- quarter earnings report it is bracing for a decline in bookings following the April engine blowout.
""It’s unfortunate only from an optics and image standpoint,"" Aboulafia said. ""Windows are made by window manufacturers. Nothing to do with technology that's unique to the 737 or to Southwest."" 
The FAA on Tuesday ordered additional inspections of fan blades in hundreds of additional engines similar to the one that failed in the deadly Southwest accident on April 17.
Southwest has said it planned to complete ultrasonic inspections on all fan blades on the some 700 planes in its fleet with the CFM56-7B engines, the model involved in last month's blowout, over the next two weeks, meeting the FAA's August deadline by mid-May.

1094,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2018 12:32PM ET</span>",The myth of outliving your retirement savings,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO - (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)
When Doug Anderson retired as an electrician at the end of 2016, he worried would run out of money. So he put himself on a miserly spending plan.
A financial planner disagreed, however, and assured Anderson that his pension and savings would be plenty for a lifetime. In fact, the planner told Anderson to give himself a break and have some fun.
In response, Anderson, 67, and his wife Pam, 65, took three driving vacations last year from their suburban St. Paul, Minnesota home. Anderson also treated himself to a new – but used – Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck.
“It’s beautiful,” said Anderson, who rarely indulged himself while working and raising six children. “I roll down the window, stick my arm out, play retro music and turn back the clock 40 years.” 
Most retirement research points to an impending retirement crisis for about half of Americans who save too little. But a new study suggests that behavior like Anderson’s makes the outlook far less dire. Because people worry about outlasting their savings, most adjust by living humbly – often overly so. Consequently, they make even modest savings last for years longer than expected by researchers.
While some people do run out of money, a person with less than $500,000 in savings, on average, spends just about a quarter of it during the first 20 years of retirement, according to a study by Sudipto Banerjee of the Employee Benefit Research Institute. 
One-third actually end up with a nest egg larger than they had when they left their jobs, the study says. Even people who had only $32,000 shortly after leaving the workforce had about $24,000 left some two decades after retiring. 
Rational behavior defies the assumption in many studies that people exhaust their savings and live in crisis, Banerjee said. He used government data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study to track retirees born between 1931 and 1941 with assets ranging from stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate and CDs to savings and checking accounts. Individual homes were excluded, although people with homes and pensions stretched their savings the furthest.
“People don’t know how long they are going to live,"" said Lori Lucas, the president and chief executive of the Employee Benefit Research Institute. ""They may also be afraid of facing catastrophic healthcare costs if they need to stay in a long-term care facility for a prolonged period.”
Those uncertainties are valid, yet many people overdo frugality, said Brett Anderson, the financial planner who urged Doug Anderson to treat himself a little. (The two men are not related.)
“I have a lot of clients who are very well off financially and live in trailers in Florida,” said the Hudson, Wisconsin financial planner. “They are quiet millionaires.”
The EBRI study found conservative spending among every income group. 
“People don’t want to touch their nest eggs,” said financial planner Anderson. “They feel fine spending interest or income from their investments but are reluctant to touch anything else.”
FINANCIAL RESTRAINT
In the EBRI study, those with the most savings - a median of $857,450 shortly after retiring - still had $756,300 two decades later. The decrease amounts to just 11.8 percent of the original sum.
The largest drop in retirement nest eggs, 24.4 percent, was among those with the least savings, or a median of $29,975. 
Frugal behavior is consistent with research led by Anna Rappaport for the Society of Actuaries. She and her team found that most people do not plan for retirement or know what they should spend, but they adapt - even when shocked by high dental bills or a roof repair. 
What can devastate financially are divorce, caring for a mentally or physically ill adult child who cannot work, and long-term care expenses, according to the Society's research.
Still, debilitating healthcare costs are far more rare than people fear, according to the EBRI research. Half of retirees face no nursing home expenses since Medicare covers short recoveries after hospital stays and Medicaid can help when resources run out. 
The medical annual out-of-pocket spending for 90 percent of retirees is just $2,000, and the big nursing home costs over $87,000 hit only 10 percent of people living longer than 95, according to the EBRI study.

1097,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 01:02PM ET</span>","Tobacco refundings erode high-yield muni debt, squeeze investors","By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A series of big tobacco bond refundings is reshaping the U.S. municipal junk bond market, taking what has been a high-yielding staple and slowly turning it investment grade.
The change means that investors are increasingly struggling to find the same high yields in comparable securities, a problem compounded by even more investors flowing into the asset class.
""One of the largest sectors in the high-yield universe is shrinking,"" said William Black, senior portfolio manager at City National Rochdale in Chicago.
The specialized bonds stem from a 1998 settlement with cigarette makers, which agreed to make annual payments to U.S. states to cover medical costs of sick smokers.
Over the intervening years, at least 21 states and territories, and separately some cities, securitized that stream of money by selling municipal bonds backed by the expected payments.
Since the start of 2016, states and cities have refunded more than $6.2 billion of their old tobacco bonds, according to Thomson Reuters data. Some of the deals are transforming junk-rated debt into investment-grade assets and squeezing high-yield investors. 
When that money is returned to investors in a tobacco refunding, it is harder for them to find similar places to put it back to work. 
""Mutual funds, along with the ETFs... are looking at the likelihood of seeing cash backing into the portfolio when these bonds are called away and not having a lot of choices for replacement,"" said James Colby, who manages muni ETFs for VanEck.
In Colby's custom high-yield reference index, the weight for tobacco is 15.25 percent, down from 20.70 in January 2016. The shrinkage is a direct result of tobacco refundings, he said.
Tobacco bonds comprised 15.5 percent of the S&P Municipal Bond High Yield Index at start of 2016 but have now fallen to 14.4 percent, a 7 percent decline.
Compounding the crunch is strong demand for high yield muni funds, with investors pouring money in for eight straight weeks and causing more people to chase after fewer tobacco bonds. 
Flows into high-yield muni bond funds have been positive every year since 2014, with $7.5 billion of inflows last year alone, according to data from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters unit.
Those investors are likely chasing yield. The S&P Municipal Bond Tobacco Index returned 8.40 percent over the past year, compared with just 3.17 percent for the broader high yield index and 1.64 percent for the overall AMT-free national muni bond index.

PHOENIX FROM THE ASHES
In 2007, issuers sold $16.9 billion of tobacco bonds altogether, the biggest year of issuance on record, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Most bonds are callable after a decade, so some of these deals are coming back for reworking since last year's 10-year anniversary.
Another $10.4 billion was issued in 2005 and 2006, adding to the pile of tobacco debt now being refunded.

The same firm - Jefferies LLC - has underwritten every tobacco deal since 2016. Jefferies declined to comment. 
Over the years, many tobacco bonds have been downgraded as more smokers than anticipated quit. That is because revenues to the states from the 1998 settlement are based on the volume of cigarettes shipped.
But now, the ratings are moving back up as old bonds get reworked. 
The high ratings have mostly been driven by new cash flow structures and, in some cases, higher payments from the tobacco companies after the resolution of legal disputes, S&P structured finance analyst Christine Dalton told Reuters.
New Jersey refunded $3.15 billion of tobacco bonds in April, exchanging speculative 'B' rated debt for investment-grade bonds. The deal will generate $162 million in present value savings for the state, said New Jersey Treasury spokeswoman Jennifer Sciortino.
The state could use the cash. The second-lowest-rated U.S. state, New Jersey needs nearly $1.6 billion of tax hikes to cover its spending needs next fiscal year, Governor Phil Murphy has said.
States can benefit from using one-time revenues - like from a refunding - for one-time expenses.

""If there's money on the ground, you can't blame someone for bending over to pick it up,"" said S&P public finance analyst David Hitchcock.

WILMINGTON, Del./NEW YORK (Reuters) - German healthcare group Fresenius (DE:FREG) alleged it uncovered ""blatant fraud at the very top level"" of U.S. generic drugmaker  Akorn  Inc (O:AKRX) after Fresenius agreed to acquire the company for $4.75 billion, according to a court filing made public late on Tuesday.
Fresenius abandoned the merger agreement last month, and Akorn has sued in Delaware Court of Chancery to try to hold Fresenius to the deal. 
The court scheduled the trial to begin on July 9.
Shares of Akorn slid nearly 15 percent on Wednesday to end at $12.55 per share. The stock price has plummeted from more than $30 in February after Fresenius said it was investigating data integrity at Akorn, and warned it could end their merger agreement.
Fresenius officially abandoned the $34-per-share deal for Akorn in April.
Akorn spokeswoman Jennifer Bowles said the company categorically disagreed with the allegations and intended to enforce the merger agreement.
The drugmaker will ask a Delaware judge at a hearing on Tuesday to fast-track its lawsuit and schedule a trial as soon as next month, according to court documents. 
Fresenius wants the trial to be held in January.
Akorn said in its lawsuit last month that Fresenius uncovered data integrity problems that are common in the generic drug industry and is seizing on them to try to back out of a deal it soured on for financial reasons.
But Fresenius alleged that an Akorn executive vice president for quality assurance, whose name was redacted from the court filing, knowingly directed the submission of fraudulent testing data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The fabricated data concerned Akorn's application to market the antibiotic azithromycin, and Fresenius alleged the fraudulent scheme began in 2012.
Fresenius also alleged that ""the same scheme has infected"" at least five other Akorn products.
In the court filing, Fresenius said its investigation revealed ""blatant fraud at the very top level of Akorn's executive team, stunning evidence of blatant and pervasive data integrity violations.""
Akorn has said in court documents it investigated the possible submission of falsified data and fired an executive who was involved.
""Critically, azithromycin and the five other drug products in question either have never been marketed or are not currently being marketed and were never forecasted to form a material portion of Akorn's future earnings,"" the company said in one of the documents.
Akorn's performance has been worse-than-expected since the deal was announced, due to increasing competition and price erosion in the U.S. for generic drugs. It alleges that Fresenius got cold feet because it believes it is now overpaying for the deal.
The company has had other issues as well. 

Its largest shareholder, John Kapoor, stepped down as chairman of Akorn in October after he was arrested on charges that he participated in a scheme to bribe doctors at a different company he founded - opioid maker  Insys Therapeutics Inc  (O:INSY).

SEOUL/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - South Korean prosecutors are looking into U.S. activist fund Elliott Management to see whether it violated disclosure rules, local media reported on Wednesday, a claim the hedge fund said was leaked to the press after it began a legal dispute with South Korea over a controversial 2015 merger of two Samsung (KS:005930) affiliates. 
Yonhap News Agency said the investigation was in relation to Elliott's 2015 purchase of shares in Samsung C&T Corp (KS:028260), citing prosecutors.
Elliott said in a statement that it was concerned ""details of a confidential and long-dormant investigation were suddenly leaked to the press just hours after Elliott confirmed that it is seeking compensation relating to the unlawful intervention by the former administration and the National Pension Service in the merger of Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries.""
The U.S. fund has said it was seeking to negotiate with South Korea regarding compensation for its damages from the merger. It has begun a legal dispute with the South Korean government over the 2015 tie-up, a South Korean government official said on Tuesday.
Elliott has challenged the country's top two family-run conglomerates, most recently Hyundai Motor Group, over better corporate governance and returns to shareholders.
In 2015, the activist fund took on Samsung, South Korea's largest family-run conglomerate. It narrowly failed to block an $8 billion merger between Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries, which it argued was unfair. 
The deal later became the center of a corruption scandal that led to the arrests of former President Park Geun-hye and the heir to the Samsung empire, Jay Y. Lee last year.
Elliott held about 7 percent of shares in Samsung C&T at the time. 
Yonhap added that South Korean prosecutors had notified the fund's officials of a plan to interview them, but cited a prosecution official as saying it might be difficult to question them as they are outside South Korea.
The Seoul prosecutors' office did not answer calls from Reuters outside regular business hours.
Elliott added in a statement that ""Elliott used swaps lawfully and in a manner consistent with Korean law,"" and that South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service chose not to file any enforcement action.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sovereign investors are helping fuel billion-dollar funding rounds for emerging-market tech startups, where companies and their backers are fighting for first-mover advantage in the digital space. 
The aim is to find firms that can replicate the models of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in the United States - companies that will dominate a young, tech-savvy market. 
Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) have the capital to feed this trend – and the patience to wait.
Instead of exposing themselves to a stock market listing, companies simply return to private backers in ever-bigger funding rounds, building war chests to pick off their rivals.
To April 24 this year, SWFs participated in 15 venture capital mega-deals, worth some $10.9 billion, compared with 22 deals worth just $9.75 billion in all of 2017, according to funding database PitchBook. 
Asian venture capital funding rounds worth $100 million or more reached a total $20.7 billion to April 21, data from research firm Preqin showed. That easily outstripped those in the United States, worth $8.9 billion, and in Europe, worth $1.7 billion.(Value of venture capital megadeals by region: https://reut.rs/2JHL84N)
Asia is attractive because it has fewer established or entrenched companies, said Jeff Schlapinski, head of research at EMPEA, a trade association for private capital in emerging markets: ""In the U.S., you have to go up against Amazon, or Facebook or Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)."" 
According to Preqin, 14 of 2017's largest 20 venture capital deals took place in Asia, mainly China and India. Among them were a $4 billion mega-funding round for China's ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing, backed by Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Capital and Japan's SoftBank Group (T:9984). 
Singapore's sovereign investors Temasek and GIC have also made a splash. Last October, GIC took part in a $4 billion round for Meituan-Dianping, China's largest online services provider. Temasek invested in a $1.5 billion February funding round for Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek. 
One driver is Asia's expanding middle class, with near universal access to smart devices and technology. ""Significant consumers with capital have never been reachable more easily and affordably,"" said Chris Schroeder, founder of Next Billion Ventures, a firm focused on emerging market hi-tech businesses. 
CONSOLIDATION 
Given the competition for this market, the canniest investors are now seeking ways to consolidate their holdings.
""There comes a time when investors look at the really fierce competition between companies and can see better prospects if the companies were to merge or combine their efforts,"" said EMPEA's Schlapinski.
In April, the Financial Times reported that SoftBank planned to move more than $20 billion of its ride-hailing stakes in Uber, Didi Chuxing, India's Ola and Singapore's Grab into the $93 billion Vision Fund. 
This tech-focused joint venture with Saudi's Public Investment Fund (PIF) has also just led a $1.9 billion funding round for Chinese truck-hailing service Manbang.
Ride-hailing is hotly fought over in Asia. Didi Chuxing absorbed Uber's China operations in August 2016, and Uber's Southeast Asia business was sold to Grab in March after a costly battle. 
China's saturated bike-sharing market has also been consolidating, with Meituan-Dianping buying Mobike for $2.7 billion in April.
The involvement of SWFs allows early stage venture capital investors a way to exit without listing. But their sheer scale means conventional players have to raise ever-bigger funds to compete, or risk getting squeezed out of the market.
""SWFs are running valuations up because they enter with more money. That's a problem when there is more money than startups,"" said Javier Capape, a director at the Sovereign Wealth Lab research centre in Madrid. 
""The industry is saturated with capital right now,"" agreed Felice Egidio, Preqin's head of venture capital products. ""But all this accessibility to 'loose capital' is slowing down the process of the potential exit … eventually there has got to be some sort of market correction.""
Success is still determined by how these companies fare in an initial public offering. Didi Chuxing is reportedly in talks about floating this year at a valuation of up to $80 billion. Meituan-Dianping is also said to be eyeing a listing. 
But Uber looks unlikely to list this year after numerous problems. And if companies don't list, each additional prospect becomes harder for SWF deal origination teams to sell to their investment committee. 

""Everyone is in the boat, but we need to see the boat reach the harbor,"" said Markus Massi, a senior partner at The Boston Consulting Group. ""You want to see if the initial investments pay off, and IPOs are needed to confirm the trend. If you have several delays, then risk appetite will be reduced.""

1114,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 10:52AM ET</span>",Buffett draws them in even as Berkshire comes up short,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - He thinks of himself as a teacher, and to many he is an icon. But to Wall Street, Warren Buffett is something quite different.
A disappointment.
Tens of thousands of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) shareholders and fans may think otherwise as they flock to Omaha, Nebraska, this weekend to see Buffett, 87, and his longtime partner and fellow billionaire Charlie Munger, 94.
The weekend will celebrate their long-term success running a conglomerate, now with 90-some businesses overseen on a daily basis by two potential Buffett successors, newly-installed Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain.
But recent results, relative to what analysts were counting on, were of a sort that might make chief executives at other companies hang their heads.
Berkshire's operating profit, excluding investments and derivatives, has fallen short of Wall Street forecasts for eight consecutive quarters, while its cash stake swelled to $116 billion because Buffett could not find enough worth buying.
In contrast, just 21 percent of Standard & Poor's 500 (SPX) companies typically miss forecasts in any given quarter, while 64 percent beat forecasts.
Berkshire has a chance to break its streak on Saturday morning when it is scheduled to report first-quarter results.
""Obviously, the quarterly results matter, but I care year-to-year about what they're doing,"" said Paul Lountzis, founder of Lountzis Asset Management LLC in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, who has been to more than 20 meetings and is attending this weekend.
""Though you may be upset with all the cash they have, if there is a challenge across the world, or liquidity dries up, he's going to step in and take advantage,"" he added, referring to Buffett.
CHALLENGING TO ANALYZE
Predicting results can be hard because Berkshire's tentacles spread far.
Its products and services include car insurance (Geico), mobile homes (Clayton), wind power (Berkshire Hathaway Energy), cowboy boots (Justin Brands), chocolate (See's), helium balloon inflators (Western Enterprises) and electronic sow feeding systems (perhaps unsurprisingly, PigTek).
""Berkshire Hathaway is a challenging company to analyze,"" and ""does not manage its results to meet Street expectations,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Jay Gelb wrote last week.
Insurance underwriting has dragged on recent results, and Berkshire last year paid out billions of dollars for hurricane losses.
But a tailwind from an improving U.S. economy boosted shipments on the BNSF railroad, and bolstered Berkshire's building materials and consumer businesses. 
Gelb expects operating profit to rise 45 percent in 2018. That could help Berkshire's stock price, which closed on Tuesday about 10 percent below its peak on Jan. 29.
Questions about Berkshire will likely comprise a majority of the roughly 60 questions that Buffett and Munger will field over five hours at Saturday's annual shareholder meeting.
""There's always something to learn,"" said Brandon Taylor, managing partner of Taylor Hoffman Wealth Management in Richmond, Virginia, attending his sixth meeting this year. ""Knowledge compounds over time, and the more I expose myself to investors who are better than me, the better off I will be.""
BLING
Berkshire sent out slightly more tickets to this year's extravaganza than in 2015, when an estimated 42,000 celebrated Buffett's 50th year at the helm. A couple of million may watch Buffett and Munger online this year via Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Finance.
As usual there will also be events across Omaha, including investing conferences and shareholder shopping at Berkshire-owned businesses.
At the jeweler Borsheim's, for example, silver pens bearing Buffett's signature fetch $14, while a 1.93-carat argyle pink diamond can be yours for the bargain price of $1,046,750 (normally $1.57 million).
But the meeting remains the highlight.
It may give Buffett and Munger a chance to address progress on Berkshire's joint venture with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) to lower employee healthcare costs, or the scandals hurting the stock price and reputation of  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), one of Berkshire's biggest investments.
Buffett and Munger will likely also get questions about matters outside their comfort zones, such as bitcoin, or perhaps dysfunction in Washington.
While Buffett is a Democrat and Munger a Republican, both are equal-opportunity critics of shortsightedness and stupidity.

The meeting is ""a rejuvenation of all the investment values and principles that Warren and Charlie impart,"" Lountzis said.

Demand as measured in freight tonne kilometers rose 1.7 percent in March compared with the year-earlier period, which is 5 percentage points less than February's growth rate and the lowest in 22 months, IATA said.
All regions except Latin America reported year-on-year declines in growth in March, the association said.
Available capacity growth fell to 4.4 percent in March compared with 6.3 percent in February. That was the first time in 20 months that annual capacity rose faster than demand.
The outlook for air freight in 2018 nonetheless remains optimistic, IATA Chief Executive Alexandre de Juniac said, with demand expected to grow by 4 to 5 percent, though higher oil prices and patchy economic growth were clear headwinds.

""The biggest damage could be political. The implementation of protectionist measures would be an own-goal for all involved, especially the U.S. and China,"" he said.

Here are the key figures: 
The company also announced a $100 billion share buyback in addition to boosting its dividend by 16% to $0.73 per share.
While sales of Apple's iPhone did not deliver a big upside surprise, nor did they fall through the floor, as some worried they might.
""This is the first cycle we've had where the top-of-the-line iPhone model has also been the most popular,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said on a conference call with analysts on Tuesday.
The $1,000 iPhone X — Apple's most expensive iPhone ever — was the best-selling phone ""every week"" during the quarter, Cook said. The comments come amid investor worries, fueled by negative press reports, that Apple's high-priced flagship model was not selling well.
Although Cook would not provide specific sales figures for the iPhone X, he stressed that the performance should be viewed as a sign of strength regardless of the details.
""The team wins the Super Bowl, you want them to win by a few more points, but it's a Super Bowl winner, and it's how we feel about it,"" Cook said during the call.
Apple also raised its guidance for the third quarter to between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion, a range with a midpoint comfortably above the $51.6 billion average analyst forecast. In recent weeks, ""whisper numbers"" among some investors event anticipated that fiscal Q3 revenue could come in below $50 billion, according to a note by GBH Insights analyst Dan Ives, following Apple's results.
""This guidance number was much better than feared and will be a ""major relief"" for the stock,"" Ives wrote.
Shares of Apple have declined 1.6% since the beginning of 2018. "
1123,By Business Insider,"<span>May 02, 2018 09:58AM ET</span>","Snapchat users hate the redesign so much, it could have turned away millions of users"," The Snapchat app redesign not only was a critical flop, it now seems to be costing the company users.
The number of daily active users (DAU) of Snapchat barely budged in the first quarter from the holiday period. Worse, DAUs fell toward the end of the period; at the end of March, there were fewer people using Snapchat on a daily basis than for the quarter as a whole.
In a statement, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel attributed comapny's problems in building the Snapchat user base to the February redesign, which moved certain features around and changed the ordering of posts.
""A change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption,"" Spiegel said on a conference call with investors and analysts in which he discussed the company's  disappointing quarterly report. He also said that the company will be tweaking the design to find a compromise that users will be happier with.
On average, Snapchat had 191 million DAUs in the first quarter, up just 4 million, or 2%, from 187 million in the fourth quarter. That growth rate was less than half of what the company posted in the holiday period, when its DAUs grew by 8.9 million from the third quarter, or a 5% clip.
Had Snapchat continued growing at the rate it posted in the holiday period, it would have added more than 9 million users in the first quarter, instead of just 4 million. So, the redesign likely cost it millions of users — even before the March fall-off. The 2% growth sequential growth rate was the slowest Snap has posted since it became a public company a year ago.
But things were even worse at the end of the quarter. In March, Snapchat's DAUs were between 187 million and 191 million, company officials said. But they declined to say exactly how many users the app had that month or whether that number was below what the app saw in December, the end of the previous quarter.
Users have  responded largely negatively to the redesign, but the changes are having a particular effect on usage of the Android version of its app, company officials said. That version is based on older code that tends to break whenever it is modified, Spiegel said on the call. The company is in the process of rebuilding the app from the ground-up, he said.
""We still have a lot of work to do to optimize the new design, especially for our Android users,"" Spiegel said.
Snap reported its user totals as part of its quarterly report. The  company's revenue for the period fell well shy of expectations, which sent its stock plummeting over 15% in after-hours trading."
1124,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Apple shares rise after sales quell iPhone worries,"(Reuters) - Shares of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) rose 3 percent on Wednesday after the company's quarterly report and current-quarter iPhone sales forecast calmed investor nerves about a potential slowdown in sales of its flagship product.
Shares in the Cupertino, California firm had fallen 5 percent, or more than $40 billion in market value, in the two weeks before the report, thanks largely to a soft outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TW:2330) which was read as pointing to weak demand for iPhones.
Yet while investors were bracing for weak smartphone sales, Apple sold 52.2 million iPhones, just shy of analysts' estimate of 52.3 million.
At least four brokerages raised their price targets for Apple stock. Of 43 analysts covering, 29 have a ""buy"" or higher rating and 14 on ""hold"". No one has a ""sell"" rating.
""iPhone unit sales were better than feared with our recently lowered estimates, and management highlighted consistent results in every geography with the iPhone X the top selling iPhone each week of the quarter,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley said.
Two other analysts estimated Apple would sell about 40 million iPhones in the current quarter, based on Apple's June quarter revenue forecast of $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion and shares in Apple parts suppliers were also broadly higher. 
Shares of AMS (S:AMS), which provides the facial recognition technology used in Apple's iPhones, rose as much as 8 percent on Wednesday morning.
Those in Cirrus Logic (O:CRUS), Skyworks Solutions (O:SWKS), Lumentum Holdings (O:LITE), Broadcom (O:AVGO) and Qualcomm (O:QCOM) were all gainers. 
""While forecasted iPhone shipments of 39 million units is lower than our 42 million estimate a month ago, it's far better than our 34 million estimate which reflected the weaker June quarter outlook from suppliers like TSMC and AMS,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Katy Huberty said.
The $999 iPhone X, which features an edge-to-edge display and facial recognition technology to unlock the phone, has been plagued by supply bottlenecks and concerns about weak sales since it went on sale in November in the United States.
While Apple's iPhone sales were marginally lower than consensus forecasts, its quarterly results still beat Wall Street targets, helped by a $9.1 billion revenue contribution from Apple's services business.
""Services sales growth of 31 percent Y/Y was robust this quarter, and well above expectations, reflecting broad strength across Apple's offerings, including App Store, Apple Music, iCloud and Apple Pay,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Sherri Scribner said.
Apple also promised to hike its dividend by 16 percent and to buyback $100 billion worth of additional stock, which analysts said would create a floor for shares.
After a solid quarter that quashed most concerns about a slowdown, eyes will now turn to the next generation of iPhones to be launched in September.
""With our belief Apple will launch an iPhone X plus type combined with new improved features for the current sized iPhone X product, we believe Apple's iPhone franchise will extend strong sales of higher-priced iPhones through C2019,"" Walkley said. 

Apple shares were trading at $175.60 on Wednesday morning.

1125,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: UPS weighs strategy to deliver bulky goods to boost growth,"By Eric M. Johnson
(Reuters) -  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) is in talks with at least one U.S. trucking firm to launch an in-home delivery service for large, heavy goods such as couches and treadmills, as the world's largest package deliverer looks to cash in on one the fastest growing segments of online retail.
UPS and its rival FedEx Corp (N:FDX) currently deliver parcels up to 150 pounds (68.04 kg) in weight to a person's door step, and neither carries packages into a person's home or handles so-called ""white glove"" services such as product assembly or installation.
UPS told Reuters it is now eyeing the furniture delivery business - one of the fastest-growing segments of online retail - with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN),  Wayfair Inc  (N:W) and other e-commerce companies competing for market share against chains like Crate and Barrel and big-box stores.
A source familiar with the matter said UPS is in talks to hire trucking company Werner Enterprises (O:WERN) to help it compete in this area, potentially by the end of the year. Werner launched its “final-mile” service in 2016, and has been building it out over the last year. Details of a potential partnership remain unclear given the early stages of the discussions, the source added. 
Werner declined to comment on the matter, and UPS would not identify who it is in talks with.
Final-mile delivery is a market that Transport Futures economist Noel Perry said could grow to about $12 billion over the next decade, from about $3.7 billion today, thanks in large part to a growing appetite from younger consumers to buy everything from BBQ grills and mattresses to dining room tables online.
“Outsourcing to a trucking firm would allow UPS to enter into the final-mile business without committing its own capital up front to expand its fleet or acquire end-of-line, final-mile infrastructure such as terminals,” R.W. Baird analyst Ben Hartford said. 
That could be welcome news to UPS investors waiting on Chief Executive David Abney's promise to deliver higher margins by pumping billions of dollars into network upgrades and expansions. 
When asked about the strategy with bulky goods in an interview with Reuters, UPS Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber said the company has decided it can't ignore the rising demand for in-home deliveries of furniture, mattresses, and treadmills, and was evaluating different ways to handle the larger cargo.
“You got bigger products moving through networks across the globe,” said Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber. “What we have to do is try and figure out the right way to get them in the right network as we move forward.”
Barber did not confirm talks with any specific company, and said that UPS has not made a final decision “because you have to balance it with our Express network, our labor constraints and our strategy going forward.” 
Other trucking players include Schneider National (N:SNDR),  Ryder System Inc  (N:R), Seko Logistics, and J.B. Hunt, which have expanded final-mile capabilities organically or through partnerships and acquisitions in recent years, hoping to lure major retailers with their scale.
Schneider and  XPO Logistics  (N:XPO), the largest provider of final-mile bulky deliveries in North America, told Reuters they had not met with UPS to discuss handling final-mile deliveries. J.B. Hunt and Ryder declined to comment. Seko did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
As it is now, most of the major trucking and logistics firms in this final-mile bulky goods business hire regional contract-carriers – and there are hundreds nationwide – to haul products from warehouses to living rooms across the country.
If UPS moves forward, it would give UPS’ retail customers including Wayfair, Amazon.com, Walmart Inc (N:WMT), IKEA AB and  Target  Corp (N:TGT) a ""big and heavy option"" in their online shipping portals so consumers can receive shipments across the country, the source said. 
It could also set up UPS to hit its goal of being a one-stop shipping partner for retailers while also solving the problem of sofa-sized boxes unexpectedly showing up in trailers they pick up from retailer warehouses and take to parcel sorting hubs. 
UPS has worked for years to limit the sizes of unwieldy - or “non-conveyable” - items as it invests to speed up its package-sorting operation. It charges big premiums to handle the freight. 
UPS main rival FedEx said in March the expansion of its Memphis hub will include an area for oversized shipments and announced it bought UK-based deliverer P2P Mailing Limited. But a company spokesman said FedEx does not yet do in-home heavy goods deliveries in the United States.
BULKY RISKS
Entering the bulk goods delivery business adds new complexities and risks compared to traditional parcel delivery.
For example, hauling a dresser to an upstairs bedroom and assembling it is a more intricate and physically demanding affair than dropping off a pallet at a warehouse's loading dock. XPO Logistics’ Chief Information Officer Mario Harik said in an interview it was training drivers on etiquette and how to use mobile devices to log deliveries and customer complaints for large or heavy deliveries. 
Truckers can charge more for ""white glove"" services - which include varying degrees of installation, product assembly, and repairs - but the margins are often no better than other types of deliveries because stiff competition for new business has held down the prices carriers can charge retailers. 
But deliverers are hoping they can hike prices and boost margins as they increase delivery “density,” or the number of deliveries they make in a region on a given day, said Hartford, the R.W. Baird analyst. 
Heavy goods deliveries through UPS would likely include two workers willing to spend 20 minutes in a home, versus more complex installation and repairs, the source said.

UPS declined to discuss the growth potential, but the source familiar with the strategy said UPS was looking initially for a trucking partner that could make or manage as many as “tens of thousands” of deliveries daily.

Founded by Mouton in 1995, PSG has enjoyed success by betting on high-growth companies challenging entrenched actors in finance, private education and hospitals in the post-apartheid economy.
""I have recently been diagnosed with an early form of dementia,"" the 70-year old Mouton said in an letter to shareholders on Tuesday.

""After consultation with my senior colleagues, we feel that I still have a contribution to make as PSG Group's non-executive chairman.""
One its biggest plays is Capitec (J:CPIJ), a financial startup whose inroads and stock market outperformance against South Africa's big four banks have led to Mouton being compared to U.S. investor Warren Buffett.
Shares in PSG, which have risen almost 10-fold since 2011, were down about 1 percent at 222.90 rand as of 1156 GMT, lagging a slightly higher JSE Top-40 index (JTOPI).

(Reuters) - Shares of  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) sank as much as 22 percent to the lowest since its 2017 flotation on Wednesday, after first quarter numbers showed it losing confidence among users and advertisers due to a widely-panned redesign of Snapchat.
The messaging app, known for its disappearing messages and ghost logo, started its first major redesign in November and followed up with several more updates this year.
But the company is facing ire from users who say the changes are unnecessary and make the platform harder to use. A petition on change.org that urged the company to remove the update garnered more than 1.2 million signatures.
The results release knocked another $4 billion off the value of the company, now down a total of $23 billion from its high point a day after its stock market launch last March.
""It is not clear to us why the app redesign - the first product Snap ever tested at scale - was rolled out broadly, and we are even less clear on why it hasn't been more aggressively rolled back already,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Lloyd Walmsley said.
Company executives acknowledged that the new design hurt results but said they were sticking with the plan, aimed at broadening the app's popularity with users and advertisers. 
""The redesign created a lot of new opportunities, and we look forward to continuing our efforts to refine and improve Snapchat,"" Snap's 27-year-old chief executive, Evan Spiegel, said on a conference call with analysts on Tuesday.
Some analysts drew a stark comparison with  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), which has also redesigned its platform without much backlash.
Facebook, whose photo-sharing platform Instagram directly rivals Snapchat, last week reported a surprisingly strong 63 percent rise in profit and an increase in users, with no sign that business was hurt by a scandal over the mishandling of personal data.
At least 13 brokerages cut their price targets on the stock. MoffettNathanson was the most bearish with a price target of $7. The stock is currently trading at $11.66.
Snapchat's daily active users rose to 191 million in the quarter ended March 31, falling short of expectations of 194.15 million.
Snap has also moved toward a software-based auction system for selling ads that made it cheaper and easier to buy ads on Snapchat, but hurts revenue on the short term.
The company's revenue of $230.7 million also missed estimates of $244.5 million. 
While Snap can turn things around with its core base of users, Snap is a ""show me"" story to advertisers and investors, and has to move fast to change the narrative, particularly given its cash burn levels, Walmsley said.
Snap said its cash burn fell 13 percent from the previous quarter to $222 million.

1131,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 02, 2018 09:01AM ET</span>","U.S. Lifts Debt Sales as Deficit Grows, Plans 2-Month Bills","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Treasury Department will boost the amount of long-term debt it sells to $73 billion this quarter as President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to finance budget deficits set to widen further because of tax cuts and higher spending.
In its quarterly refunding announcement on Wednesday, the department again lifted the auction sizes of coupon-bearing and floating-rate debt after doing so last quarter for the first time since 2009. It again left inflation-linked security sizes unchanged. Treasury also announced plans to issue a new two-month bill later in 2018.
After keeping borrowing relatively stable in recent years, the Treasury announcement highlights the Trump administration’s need to sell debt to help pay the government’s bills as the deficit swells and the Federal Reserve allows maturing securities on its $4.4 trillion balance sheet to roll off gradually. The possible new bill maturity comes after a deluge of sales over the first quarter was partly to blame for money-market rates rising sharply.
The Treasury will sell $31 billion in three-year notes on May 8, versus $30 billion it sold last month and $26 billion in February, according to a statement released in Washington. The government increased to $25 billion the sale of 10-year notes, from $24 billion last quarter, and the 30-year bonds to $17 billion from $16 billion, also to be auctioned next week. The sales will raise new cash of $33.9 billion.
In the statement, the Treasury said it plans over the coming quarter to boost auction-sizes of other maturities.
$27 Billion
The department will notch higher sales of two- and three-year note auctions by $1 billion per month over the quarter, compared with monthly rises over the past quarter of $2 billion. It will also boost five-, seven-, 10-, and 30-year note sales by $1 billion starting in May and lift floating rate notes by $1 billion in May. The changes will result in an additional $27 billion of new issuance.
Treasury plans to conduct small-value buyback this month, it said, adding details will come later. The department said the buyback shouldn’t be seen as a change in policy.
The U.S. budget deficit widened to $600 billion halfway through the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, as spending increased at three times the pace of revenue growth in the October-to-March period, according to Treasury figures released last month.
Tax reductions and higher spending approved by Congress and Trump are expected to push the budget shortfall to $804 billion in the current fiscal year, from $665 billion in fiscal 2017, and then surpass $1 trillion by 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Quarterly Record
The U.S. set a first-quarter record, by borrowing a net $488 billion, or $47 billion more than previously estimated, the Treasury said Monday in a quarterly announcement on its borrowing needs. Still, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has indicated he’s unconcerned about the bond market’s ability to absorb rising government debt.
Earlier this week, bond dealers meeting with Treasury officials indicated that foreign demand for Treasuries “remained robust,” according to minutes from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee released Wednesday. That assessment echoed comments Mnuchin made on Monday.
“It’s a very large, robust market -- it’s the most liquid market in the world, and there is a lot of supply,” he said in the interview. “But I think the market can easily handle it.”
A recent report from the International Monetary Fund showed that the U.S.’s debt load by 2023 will be worse that the fiscal position of Italy, the perennial poor man of the Group of Seven industrial nations.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) defended its plan to move its headquarters to the Netherlands at what could be its last London annual general meeting on Wednesday, saying the decision had nothing to do with protectionism or Dutch takeover rules. 
Unilever Chairman Marijn Dekkers repeated that the choice of the Netherlands, announced in March, was aimed at strategic flexibility rather than protectionism. 
If the maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream had a protective mindset for incorporating in the Netherlands, it would not have sought to cancel existing Dutch preference shares that allowed certain shareholders a greater voice than others, Dekkers said. 
He said that decision illustrated that Unilever was not chasing protectionism.
Despite having had a dual-headed Anglo-Dutch structure for 88 years, Dekkers said the structure was a hindrance in a fast-changing retail and consumer environment.
Shareholders are expected to vote on the matter around the end of the third quarter, with the move expected towards the end of the year. If completed, next year's annual meeting would take place in the Netherlands. 
Dekkers emphasized that Britain remains very important for the company, which will have two of its business units based in London and will continue to spend $1 billion a year in resources in the country.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 10:29AM ET</span>","GM to provide loans to Korean unit, state-run bank to receive shares: sources","By Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors' (N:GM) planned $3.6 billion cash infusion to rescue its South Korean business will be in the form of loans, while Korea Development Bank (KDB) will receive preference shares for its $750 million investment in GM Korea, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The Detroit carmaker and state-run KDB agreed last week on $7.15 billion of investment, including a $2.8 billion debt-for-equity swap for existing loans GM Korea owed to its parent.
The rescue package comes after GM Korea decided against filing for bankruptcy when it won concessions on pay, bonuses and benefits from its labor union in a tentative deal reached last week.
GM has been struggling to turn around the debt-laden unit, which has been hit by GM's exit from Europe, where it used to export many of its cars.
Its Korean business has announced plans to close one of its four South Korean plants and axe 2,600 workers.
For years GM resisted calls from South Korean officials to cut interest rates it was charging on loans to its loss-making South Korean unit, according to three sources and documents seen by Reuters.
However, it is unclear whether interest rates on GM's new loans will be lower than those on the existing debt. 
Part of GM's new loans - $800 million - will be converted into preferred stock later, sources told Reuters on Wednesday. 
The preference shares could be converted into common stock at a later date, the sources said. 
Both GM Korea and KDB declined to comment.
""GM Korea needs to pay for the cost of its voluntary redundancy program, which will be covered by fresh loans from GM,"" one of the sources said, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of matter.
The deal, which is expected to be finalised after a due diligence in early May, will not see any change in the current shareholding structure.
The U.S. automaker owns 77 percent of GM Korea, while KDB holds 17 percent and China's SAIC Motor Corp (SS:600104) controls the remaining 6 percent.
Under the preliminary deal with GM, the state-run Korean bank regains the veto power that allows it to block the carmaker's sale of more than 20 percent of its assets, a KDB official has said. Its veto had expired last October.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks briefly rose but returned to negative territory on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged in its policy announcement.
The Federal Open Market Committee unanimously decided to keep its lending rate in a target range of between 1.50 percent and 1.75 percent. It expressed a confident economic outlook, saying activity had expanded at a moderate rate and that inflation was close to its 2 percent target. The Fed is expected to increase rates in June.
U.S. stocks moved higher immediately after the Fed's announcement. The Dow and S&P 500 gave up their gains later in the session.
Investors focused on the Fed's description of its inflation target as ""symmetric,"" which they said signaled the Fed's willingness to stick to its projected pace of interest rate increases even if the rate of inflation were to move slightly beyond 2 percent.
""The market is not making a big move because this is basically as anticipated,"" said Steven Violin, senior vice president and portfolio manager of F.L. Putnam Investment Management Company in Wellesley, Massachusetts. ""The ability to tolerate a bit of an overshoot on inflation, perhaps there is a dovish tilt, but there is no dramatic change in policy here.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 22.86 points, or 0.09 percent, to 24,076.19, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 3.05 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,651.75 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 17.08 points, or 0.24 percent, to 7,147.79.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) rose 5.0 percent after it late Tuesday posted resilient iPhone sales in the face of waning global demand and promised $100 billion in additional stock buybacks. Optics firm  Lumentum Holdings Inc  (O:LITE), an Apple supplier, also climbed 10.3 percent after reporting quarterly results earlier on Wednesday. Mastercard Inc (N:MA) rose 3.4 percent after it reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, boosted by higher consumer spending on credit and debit cards. On the other end of the spectrum was  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP), whose shares plunged 21.6 percent after the Snapchat owner fell short of Wall Street forecasts for revenue and regular users. Biotechnology stocks also took a hit as shares of  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD) dropped 7.3 percent after the company reported a lower quarterly profit on falling sales of its flagship hepatitis C drugs. Shares of insurers MetLife Inc (N:MET), American International Group (N:AIG) and Prudential Financial Inc (N:PRU) declined after disability insurance provider  Unum Group  (N:UNM) reported a lower-than-expected profit. Unum shares fell 16.6 percent.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.74-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 20 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 76 new highs and 40 new lows.

(Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp's (N:CHK) quarterly profit exceeded analysts' estimates on Wednesday, as it produced more oil and natural gas at higher prices while continuing to lower costs, pulling shares in the company around 3 percent higher.
Chesapeake's production rose nearly 5 percent to 554,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), while its number of gross wells supplying to the market dropped 25 percent.
The Oklahoma-based company's average realized oil price rose 10 percent to $56.89 per barrel in the quarter, while its natural gas price rose nearly 16 percent. 
That was in line with the trend among U.S. producers this quarter, who have all benefited from a roughly one-third rise in prices of U.S. light crude (CLc1) compared to a year ago.
But the company also said a 4 percent fall in how much it pays to gather, process and transport its oil and natural gas had led to a reduction in overall costs per barrel on a combined basis.
""Our margin improvement, while aided by increases in commodity indices, was primarily driven by strong oil production and a lower cost structure,"" Chesapeake Chief Executive Officer Doug Lawler said in a statement. 
Chesapeake has been facing pressure from investors to increase production on minimal spending, and has cut costs and jobs to manage a balance sheet saddled with nearly $10 billion in debt. 
In Wednesday's statement, the company also reaffirmed its 2018 spending target.
Excluding items, Chesapeake earned 34 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 27 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Net income available to shareholders rose to $268 million, or 29 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $75 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier.

Shares of the company were up 3.4 percent at $3.08 in premarket.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 09:05AM ET</span>",Ghosts of tantrums past trigger first emerging market outflows since 2016: IIF,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The recent run up in the dollar and global borrowing costs has led to the first monthly outflow of foreign money from poorer ""emerging"" economies since 2016, estimates compiled by the Institute of International Finance show.
A new IIF report said the rising pressure from the dollar and bond yields has exhumed ""the ghost of tantrums past"" and caused a $0.5 billion outflow when combining figures from EM stocks funds and bond funds.
It was referring to the ""taper tantrum"" of 2013 when the U.S. Federal Reserve first hinted that it was looked to wind in the stimulus used to combat the financial crisis.
The April retrenchment was mostly concentrated in Asia, with combined debt and equity outflows amounting to some $7.8 billion. In contrast, foreign demand for Latin American securities was robust at about $6.8 billion.
""The rise of 10-year U.S. Treasury yields -- in tandem with a stronger dollar -- have been the key drivers of this downturn,"" the authors of the IIF study said.
""Indeed, foreign investors have withdrawn more than $5.5 billion from EM debt markets since April 16, a slightly faster pace than that seen during the taper tantrum in May 2013.""
After a fast start to the year, net capital inflows to emerging markets which are a broader measure of cross-border flows, amounted to $77 billion in the first three months of 2018 which was still the largest net gain in four years.
For now though the tide has turned. The dollar has surged over three percent in two weeks and U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) - a major driver of global borrowing costs - have broken above three percent for the first time in four years.
That has caused familiar jitters about the mountain of dollar-denominated debt that has been issued in the developing world in recent years. 
They have borrowed at vastly cheaper rates by using dollars, but the rise in the U.S. currency now makes the repayments more costly unless they have been hedged.
The Bank for International Settlements this week said that a record 22 percent surge in debt sales last year pushed up the annual growth in EM dollar debt 10 percent to $3.7 trillion.

1160,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 07:01AM ET</span>","Fund manager Mobius, ex-Franklin colleagues, launch new firm","By Claire Milhench
LONDON (Reuters) - Veteran emerging markets fund manager Mark Mobius has teamed up with two former colleagues from U.S. asset manager Franklin Templeton to launch investment firm Mobius Capital Partners.
Carlos Hardenberg, who was lead manager for the flagship Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust, and Greg Konieczny, former manager of Romanian investment fund Fondul Proprietatea, which is managed by Franklin Templeton, will work with Mobius on a triumvirate investment committee.
The three will focus on companies where they can drive performance by raising corporate governance through active engagement, they said at the firm's official launch in London on Wednesday.
The aim is to raise some $1 billion in about two to three years to invest in China, India, Latin America and other emerging and frontier markets. 
Mobius, 81, who is regarded as a pioneer of emerging market investing, left Franklin Templeton earlier this year after over 30 years with the firm. But he said he wasn't ready to retire.
""I love what I'm doing, it didn't make sense to be really retired. It's no fun to be sitting around,"" he said, adding the aim with the new firm was to go ""back to basics"". 
Konieczny, who has a record of successful engagement with companies from his time at Fondul Proprietatea, said there would be an action plan for how each company's governance could be improved. 
""The best way to do this is through partnering with those companies and, from our experience, it delivers the best results in a relatively short period of time,"" he said, adding this could also boost a company's environmental and social ratings. 
The aim is to launch a Luxembourg-based fund in June that will invest in 25-30 emerging and frontier market companies, initially targeting high-net-worth individuals via private banks and family offices.
Hardenberg said the fund would take fairly large stakes in companies, which might be in trouble or have fairly low ratings in terms of their governance and transparency. 
He cited fintech, robotics, healthcare, e-commerce and education as potentially rich hunting grounds. 
""We still see a lot of opportunities in those segments,"" he said. ""One of the reasons those very solid, very well-run companies are trading at discounts is because there is a general perception the risks are higher because of poorer governance and lack of transparency.""
He added the timing was good because emerging markets overall remain fairly attractively valued, trading at a discount of about 20-25 percent to developed markets. 
Although the intention is to avoid the traditional ""sin"" stocks, such as tobacco, Mobius said he wouldn't rule out investing in a listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco, depending on how the board was set up: ""Yes, if the conditions are right."" 

The three are currently hiring portfolio managers and analysts with an expertise in environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing. The aim is to build a team of about nine, including themselves by the end of the year, with a small office in Hong Kong also expected to open before the year-end.

Future Meat Technologies focuses on producing fat and muscle cells that are the core building blocks of meat, and is one of several firms working on technology to match rising demand for meat without adding more pressure on land from livestock.
The firm's founder and chief scientist, Yaakov Nahmias, said cultured meat typically had a production price of about $10,000 per kg but so far his company had reduced that to $800/kg and had ""a clear roadmap to $5-$10/kg by 2020.""
Tyson's venture capital arm has supported the Jerusalem-based startup by co-leading $2.2 million in seed investment.
""We continue to invest significantly in our traditional meat business but also believe in exploring additional opportunities for growth that give consumers more choices,"" said Justin Whitmore, Tyson's executive vice president for corporate strategy.
In December, Tyson raised its stake in plant-based protein maker Beyond Meat.
Demand for meat is expected to double between 2000 and 2050, when the earth's population is set to surpass 9 billion, and proponents of growing meat in the lab say it is the only way to meet such demand without destroying the environment.
A study by Oxford University and the University of Amsterdam estimated that cultured meat would produce 96 percent less greenhouse gas, consume 82 to 96 percent less water and virtually eliminate land requirements needed to raise livestock.

1164,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 08:18AM ET</span>",Exclusive: UTC set to win EU approval for $23 billion Rockwell Collins deal - sources,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. aerospace and industrial company United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) is set to win EU approval for the largest aerospace deal in history - a $23 billion bid for avionics maker Rockwell Collins (N:COL), people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The deal, announced in September last year, would create a new player in the top echelon of suppliers to Boeing (N:BA), Airbus (PA:AIR), Bombardier (TO:BBDb) and other plane makers.
The takeover would give UTC, maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines, more leverage to resist pressure from plane makers seeking price cuts.
Rockwell Collins' software capability would also give UTC an edge in data crunching that allows airlines to spot problems in engines and other components before they fail.
UTC has offered to sell assets to address the European Commission's concerns, the people said, declining to provide details. Analysts had said the deal could face a bumpier road in the EU than in the United States because of the merged company's size and market power.
The EU competition enforcer, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by May 4, and UTC declined to comment.
UTC cleared a hurdle last month after key client Boeing said it had provided consent to the deal after raising initial concerns. Analysts said the combined company could make more than 50 percent of the systems content on a Boeing 787 aircraft by dollar value.
A source close to Airbus had told Reuters it had concerns about the merger. Problems at Pratt & Whitney have delayed European aircraft deliveries, and Airbus has publicly warned UTC to focus on delivering jet engines on time.

Rockwell Collins' (N:COL) businesses are in avionics, seats and plane interiors. This is the second engines-to-seating supplier deal after French jet engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) acquired seat maker Zodiac Aerospace  last year.

Flying has gotten cheaper across the board in recent years, but Delta is beating its major U.S. rivals at retaining a premium on tickets sold to bigger-spending business travelers. The highest 10 percent of one-way Delta fares started at $521 last year, down 12 percent from 2014, according to ICF Inc., which crunched the numbers for Bloomberg. United Continental Holdings Inc.’s fares in that category fell 16 percent, while comparable ticket prices at American Airlines Group Inc. dropped 21 percent.
“Since Delta controls more business revenue than American or United, that gives them fewer seats that face really low-cost competition and their fares are diluted less than American or United,” said Ben Baldanza, former chief executive of Spirit Airlines Inc.
Given the payoff, all the carriers are chasing the prosperous by lavishing perks on them. Delta equipped its new Airbus SE A350 international planes with private suites in the business-class cabin, each with a sliding door. United is rolling out its Polaris-brand international business cabins with lie-flat seats and direct access to the aisle, while American added sit-down dining in its lounges for people holding first-class international and transcontinental tickets.
Fares have been falling due to increased capacity along with the growth of discount carriers; lower fuel prices, which have started to rise again, also played a role. U.S. airlines threw their restraint “out the window” in 2015 and tripled their previous U.S. growth rate by adding seats at about a 5 percent clip, said Austin Horowitz, an aviation consultant for ICF.
Not surprisingly, Delta has been trouncing rivals financially. Its operating profit margin was half again as much as at United and American last year. One reason: Delta has less direct competition from deep discounters like Spirit. Delta also controls 70 percent or more of the market at hubs in Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis and Salt Lake City, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) research. So, it “owns” the lucrative business travel at its hubs more than its rivals do, said Baldanza.

1174,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 06:18AM ET</span>",Nestle settles months-long pricing scrap with European retailers,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss food group Nestle (S:NESN) has clinched an agreement with European retailers to settle a months-long pricing row and get its products back on sale, the world's biggest packaged food maker said on Wednesday. 
""We are pleased that a balanced agreement has been reached and that Nestle products will soon be back on the shelves of the six members of the European retail alliance AgeCore,"" a company spokesman said, confirming a report by Germany's Lebensmittelzeitung.
Nestle, whose brands include KitKat chocolates and Thomy sauces, has for months faced off with AgeCore, a Geneva-based group representing six European retailers.
The group, which included Germany's Edeka and Switzerland's Coop, had boycotted Nestle products as they sought better supply terms.
An Edeka spokesman confirmed the settlement but said details of the accord were confidential. ""We are switching back to normal operations with Nestle,"" he added. 
Edeka, Germany's largest supermarket group, had last month recommended its stores expand the boycott of some Nestle products, escalating the pricing row that broke out in September.
Switzerland's Coop had also broadened its boycott, banishing more Nestle products from its stores.
Coop said on Wednesday it would pass on results of the negotiated deal to customers as it puts Nestle products back on sale in the days ahead.
Coop would launch a two-week sale from mid-May offering up to 30 percent discounts on more than 500 Nestle products such as Nescafe instant coffee, Smarties sweets and Moevenpick ice-cream.
Another such Nestle brands promotion was planned for the months ahead, it said.
The dispute was the latest outward sign of tension between European retailers and suppliers at a time of changing consumer tastes and new online competition.
Nestle, under the leadership of new Chief Executive Mark Schneider, last year posted its weakest annual sales growth in at least two decades, which has prompted shareholder pressure to boost revenue and profit margins.
Its first-quarter sales growth was driven almost entirely by volume, illustrating how hard it is for consumer products makers to raise prices in a competitive retail environment.

Nestle shares were down 1.2 percent by midday, while the Stoxx European retail sector index (SX3P) was down 0.4 percent.

1184,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 04:02AM ET</span>","StanChart speeds along road to recovery, but long way to go","HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  Plc (L:STAN) beat expectations with a 20 percent rise in first quarter pre-tax profit on Wednesday, but disappointing income showed the long road ahead for its returns to hit targets after years of restructuring.
Pre-tax profit for StanChart, which focuses on Asia, Africa and the Middle East, rose to $1.26 billion in the quarter to the end of March, from $1.05 billion in the same period a year ago, helped by improvements in asset quality. 
However revenues -- closely watched by investors who want to see growth driven by income rather than lower impairments -- fell short of market expectations at $3.9 billion, despite being the bank's best since the second quarter of 2015. 
This underscores the challenge for StanChart in meeting its already modest targets. 
""Overall the key disappointment will be that the strong income start flagged at the full year hasn't persisted,"" said Richard Smith, analyst at KBW in London.
The first-quarter profit jump follows some early signs of success including a return to dividend payments, for StanChart, which has undergone a sweeping restructuring under the leadership of Chief Executive Bill Winters since 2015.
StanChart shares rose 1 percent in London by 0745 GMT, echoing earlier gains in the lender's Hong Kong-listed shares.
StanChart in February unveiled a new medium-term goal of an 8 percent return on equity, as it recovers from a restructuring that saw the key profitability metric fall into the negative. It has not announced the timetable for achieving the goal.
NO SHORTCUTS
Achieving the target will involve improving income across all of the bank's main business lines, with the first quarter showing mixed results.
While income for its private banking business climbed 23 percent from the same first-quarter period a year ago, albeit off a low base, income in the key financial markets trading business rose only 2 percent.
That compares with record profits for the quarter posted by U.S. investment banks, which reaped bumper trading profits in the first two months of the year as investors reacted to volatility across stock, bond, currency and commodity markets.
StanChart posted an annualized return on equity of 7.6 percent in the March quarter, compared to 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2017. 
""There are no shortcuts but we are gathering momentum and gaining in confidence,"" Finance Director Andy Halford told reporters on a conference call on Wednesday.
StanChart did show continued signs of improving its balance of bad loans, with net impairment on financial assets in the quarter 29 percent lower than in the previous period.

Losses from bad debts had plagued StanChart in the recent past, but the bank has since tightened limits on who can make decisions about such big loans and decreased internal limits for exposure to a single client.

1190,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 03:12AM ET</span>",New Zealand asks banks whether tainted by Australian misconduct,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand financial authorities have met with the country's biggest banks seeking assurances they are not engaged in the sort of misconduct exposed at their Australian parent banks by a powerful judicial inquiry.
The Royal Commission, as the Australian inquiry is called, has been a publicity disaster for Australia's major lenders, all of which own New Zealand banks, turning out revelations of widespread corporate malfeasance since it began in February.
Among other discoveries, Australia's largest listed wealth manager, AMP Ltd (AX:AMP), was found to have charged customers for advice it never provided, then deceived the corporate regulator, while the country's biggest mortgage lender, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), charged fees to dead clients.
""To date we haven't seen any evidence of systemic abuses along the lines of the Australian industry, but as we've said to the New Zealand banks, we can't afford to be complacent,"" Financial Markets Authority (FMA) Chief Executive Rob Everett told Radio New Zealand on Wednesday.
""We've asked them to provide assurances to us ... that they have scrubbed their business models, and that they have a basis for being confident that these issues don't exist here.""
A deadline was not set and the FMA expects it will be weeks before the banks reply, Radio New Zealand reported.
If they fail to cooperate ""then they'll see more of us in court"", Everett said.
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) operates a New Zealand subsidiary, as does Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), while Commonwealth Bank owns New Zealand's ASB Bank and the National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) owns Bank of New Zealand.
The New Zealand heads of those banks met with the FMA, Reserve Bank officials and the country's banking ombudsman on Monday evening, ANZ's New Zealand spokesman Stefan Herrick said in a statement.
""Confidence in the financial services sector is important so we're very happy to cooperate with the regulators on their inquiry,"" he said.
ASB said banking operations and products are ""simpler"" in New Zealand, that it has an independent board and has a ""different culture"" to Commonwealth Bank's, which was roundly criticized on Tuesday by Australia's prudential regulator.
""However, there are also similarities and therefore we will be working with our regulators to demonstrate why the issues raised in Australia do not apply here or, where we can learn from the Royal Commission,"" it said in a statement.
None of the other banks had an immediate reply to Reuters' requests for comment.
Australia's Royal Commission was convened after years of financial-sector scandals including rate-rigging and alleged money-laundering.
""That just hasn't happened here,"" Westpac's New Zealand Chief Executive Officer and New Zealand Banking Association chair David McLean told Radio New Zealand.
ANZ Bank, Westpac and ASB agreed during 2014 and 2015 to pay a total of NZ$24 million ($17 million) in compensation after admitting to engaging in misleading conduct over the sale of interest rate swaps to New Zealand farmers.
ANZ New Zealand Chief Executive David Hisco said there were ""no systemic issues"" and his bank welcomed the scrutiny.
""We're not seeing or hearing the stuff that's over there,"" he said in an interview with Radio New Zealand.

1194,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Two U.S. coal miners see growth amid sector's gloom,"By Richard Valdmanis
(Reuters) - U.S. electric utilities are expected to shut hundreds more of their coal-fired power generators in the coming years, extending a long trend away from coal and toward natural gas that has cast a pall over the mining industry.
But not every U.S. coal company sees a bleak future. 
Ramaco Resources (O:METC), which produces coal for steel mills, and Consol Energy (N:CEIX), which supplies coal to larger power plants, have ramped up investments even as the industry shrinks.
President Donald Trump has promised to revive the coal sector by stripping away burdensome regulation. But the two companies say their confidence stems more from market forces than any policy. Their bullish bets illustrate how pockets of profitable growth can survive in troubled industries facing almost certain decline.
Ramaco, for example, expects global demand for metallurgical coal to rise in step with economic growth, despite the slump in U.S. demand for the type of coal used in electric power generators.
And Consol says it has found a way to turn the rapid decline of coal-fired power into a strength: It has cultivated a clientele that owns big generators that are not expected to shut down anytime soon - making them likely to take over business from rivals that do close.
""We can sell every ounce of coal we can produce,"" said David Khani, Consol’s Chief Financial Officer. ""This isn’t true for everyone.""
Consol, which mines thermal coal for power plants in Pennsylvania, boosted capital spending last year by 50 percent to $81.4 million, and it aims to bump that to $125 million in 2018, according to its filings.
Ramaco, meanwhile, more than tripled capital expenditures in 2017 to $75 million, making it one of the few coal producers investing in new U.S. mines. The company went public in February 2017 at a tough time for the industry.
Those spending increases far outpace the broader sector.
Overall, the U.S. coal industry increased capital spending in 2017 by about 27 percent, according to a Reuters analysis of filings from publicly-traded miners - a rebound from years of steep declines, targeted mainly at sustaining operations rather than expanding. Many individual coal firms have cut back capital spending.
""They’re spending as much as they need to, to maintain production,"" said analyst John Bridges of JP Morgan.
U.S. coal production is expected to dip 6 percent in 2018 to 738 million tons, down from 1.17 billion tons a decade ago, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
NEW MINES
Ramaco's spending reflects its opening of five new coal mines in the past twelve months in West Virginia, Virginia and Pennsylvania, said Randall Atkins, Ramaco’s executive chairman. 
The company expects to produce more than 2 million tons of coal in 2018 from less than 600,000 in 2017. 
The company said the downturn in the U.S. thermal coal industry has little to do with its business. It and other metallurgical coal producers are enjoying robust demand from steel producers around the globe.
""Met coal is a proxy for steel, which is in turn a proxy for a nation’s GDP,"" Atkins said. ""The world finds itself economically in a good place.""
He said Trump’s steel tariffs could shift some of the demand for metallurgical coal to the domestic market, but that foreign demand for U.S. exports also remains strong.
Ramaco's share price has been volatile since launching last year. It is trading at about $6.80, up from about $4 late last year after strong earnings estimates. But that's only about half of its share price last year, in part because one of its new mining projects was delayed.
LEMONADE FROM LEMONS
Most miners producing coal for electricity are getting battered, meanwhile, by cheap natural gas and increasingly stringent pollution controls.
Consol is betting it can generate hefty profits from a smart play on the downturn. It plans to serve ""very large, retrofitted coal plants that compete well against natgas and which are going to be running at a higher capacity as other units are retired,” said CFO Khani. 
Those plants are currently running at only about 70 percent capacity, he said, providing room for growth. 
The EIA predicts that coal-fired generators that remain open could operate above 70 percent capacity for decades as other aging plants close. Industry-wide, plants are using less than 60 percent of their capacity now.
Consol - whose shares are up to about $31 a share from about $22 late last year - supplies East Coast power generating companies including Dominion (N:D), Southern (N:SO), Duke (N:DUK) and DTE (N:DTE).
Both Consol and Ramaco applaud the Trump administration’s pro-coal stance, but their reasons for optimism lie elsewhere.

""There has been no game-changing legislation that would allow for increasing domestic demand for U.S. coal,"" said Ramaco’s Atkins.

China’s Manufacturing sector unexpectedly picked up in April, a private survey showed.
Overnight, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) made headlines after it reported a 16% jump in its second quarter revenue, while profit came in at $2.73 a share, beating estimates of $2.64. The company’s shares rose 3% following the results after being under pressured in recent weeks amid concerns on demand for its flagship iPhone X.
In Asia, China’s manufacturing sector was in focus as the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ index (PMI) unexpectedly climbed to 51.1 in April, compared to the general consensus of 50.9.
Output quickened slightly, the survey showed, but a decline in export received more focus as it adds to the concerns of China’s dependence on domestic demand.
The Shanghai Composite fell 0.4%, while the Shenzhen Component slipped 0.1% by 1:19AM ET (05:19 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also traded 0.7% lower.
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is scheduled to meet with a U.S. trade delegation in Beijing later in the week to discuss “issues of mutual concern”, according to China’s state television.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 0.3%. The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 52.5 in April from 50.9 in March, data showed.
However, the survey also indicated business confidence fell as companies struggle to hire workers amid a labor shortage.
Japanese automaker  Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.  (T:7201)’s shares fell as much as 1.8% after the company said its deliveries in April unexpectedly declined 28%.
Elsewhere, South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.4%, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.6%.
New Zealand’s unemployment rate fell to 4.4% from 4.5% in the previous three months, recording a fresh nine-year low but in line with analysts’ forecasts.
Looking ahead, investors’ attention is likely to focus on the Federal Reserve policy meeting later in the day. The U.S. payrolls report is due later this week."
1196,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2018 02:43AM ET</span>","Trade rows spell gain, and pain, for U.S. grain exporters","By Karl Plume and P.J. Huffstutter
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Global grain marketers have seized upon trade tensions between the United States and several of its top export markets, including China, to turn around struggling trading units following one of the toughest years ever for the industry. 
After five years of bumper harvests worldwide that depressed crop prices, trading margins are on the rebound. For Archer Daniels Midland Co, market volatility from the trade disputes, as well as a drought in South America, helped its trading unit report the best first-quarter performance in four years on Tuesday.
ADM and its rivals make money buying, selling, storing and processing crops. With networks of elevators, mills and processing plants around the world, the companies can capitalize on shortages in some geographies and surpluses in others. 
Taking advantage of market gyrations could be a salve for ADM and its rivals Bunge Ltd and Cargill Inc (CARG.UL), as they cope with the risks to exports posed by the wave of trade protectionism, analysts said.
""Longer-term, open and free trade is important for the global grain companies, but the near term uncertainty that the trade issues are causing are creating merchandising opportunities,"" said Farha Aslam, food and agribusiness analyst with Stephens Inc.
The company's trading unit represents a fraction of ADM's overall business. Following a recent restructure, its origination unit, which includes its trading business, earned $45 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing about 6 percent of the group's operating profit for the quarter.
ADM Chief Executive Juan Luciano remained cautious on the future. 
""We continue to closely monitor trade developments both in terms of NAFTA, as well as U.S.-China developments that seem to evolve almost on a daily basis,"" Luciano said during an earnings day conference call, referring to negotiations over revising the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Growing trade disputes are disrupting the agricultural supply chain worldwide, from corn buyers in Mexico shifting purchases to Brazil, to ships carrying U.S. sorghum exports turning around after China slapped on hefty tariffs.
Overall, the United States exported $138 billion in agricultural products in 2017, according to U.S. Census data. 
ADM rival Bunge is scheduled to report first quarter results on Wednesday, and a change in the fortunes of its trading unit could help it fend off potential suitors. Bunge has been the subject of takeover talk from  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) and ADM. 
Bunge warned investors in February that abundant global supplies made it tough to turn a profit on its core business. 
Bunge does not disclose specific figures for its trading operation, which is a part of the larger agribusiness unit that also includes oilseeds and grain processing. In its fourth quarter results, it said margins for grains trading were ""under pressure.""

Just a year ago, ADM was cutting costs and consolidating operations as it struggled with poor earnings. It now expects ""significantly improved"" results for its wider grain trading operations in the second half, boosted by dry weather affecting crops in Brazil and Argentina, it said on Tuesday.

Tesla's Semi, its first electric heavy duty truck, is ""substantially"" similar to Nikola's design, Nikola Motor said in a court filing.
Salt Lake City, Utah-based Nikola claims it was issued six design patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office between February and April 2018 for its wrap windshield, mid-entry door, fuselage, fender, side cladding and the overall design of the Nikola One.
""Nikola estimates its harm from Tesla's infringement to be in excess of $2 billion,"" it said in the filing.
A Tesla spokesman rejected the claims.
""It's patently obvious there is no merit to this lawsuit,"" a Tesla spokesman told Reuters in an email.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk unveiled the Tesla Semi, its electric heavy duty truck, in November. The company has not given much details of the Semi, but has said that the truck would begin production in 2019.

LONDON (Reuters) - Forecast-beating results from the world's biggest company, Apple, lifted tech shares on Wednesday, putting Wall Street on track for a firmer session despite some trepidation over a Fed meeting later in the day.
Expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will signal more policy tightening ahead kept investors wary of big market moves, especially after currency markets were roiled this week by the dollar's surge to 3 1/2-month highs against a basket of currencies.
But the dollar edged back down after Tuesday's 0.7 percent rise, allowing world stocks to rise after two days of losses, especially following Apple's 4 percent after-market gains.
The world's biggest company by market capitalization beat profit and revenue expectations in the first quarter, thanks to robust iPhone sales, and it announced a $100 billion share buyback.
Germany-listed Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) jumped 5.7 percent and the New York-listed stock was 3.6 percent higher in pre-market trade.
""The headline news from Apple on iPhone sales has been taken well and there's a relief bounce today across Apple supply chain names which had been hit in recent weeks,"" said Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities.
The results lifted Europe's tech index 1.2 percent to a six-week high, led by an 8 percent surge in shares in AMS, provider of the facial recognition technology used in iPhones.
Chipmakers STMicroelectronics, Infineon, BE Semiconductor and ASML also gained 1.1 to 3.8 percent, enjoying the positive mood on the sector.
U.S. equity futures signaled the S&P500 would open 0.2 percent higher. Futures for the Nasdaq tech benchmark were half a percent higher. 
Tech gains were less marked in Asia, where markets in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong all closed weaker. Campling said the Apple results had raised some ""red flags"", including high inventory levels and a lower average selling price for its handsets.
""It's a strange thing to do, to increase inventory so sharply. There will be more questions about 'where do we go from here',"" he said.
That uncertainty about future profits, alongside the possibility of higher U.S. interest rates, is weighing on other sectors too, even though S&P500 companies posted 10 percent earnings growth in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters.
Oil and metals prices near multi-year highs are a major concern, leaving market players wondering if ""perhaps this is as good as it's going to get,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore.
FED 
U.S. 10-year yields hovered just below recent four-year highs above 3 percent. German yields, dragged to six-week highs by the U.S. bond selloff, stood just below those levels.
The Fed is likely to announce at 1800 GMT that it is holding interest rates steady. But it will probably encourage expectations of a rate increase in June. 
Those expectations were strengthened after a survey on Tuesday suggested inflationary pressures were building.
A hawkish-sounding Fed could further boost the dollar, which has roared higher in recent weeks erasing its year-to-date losses versus a basket of currencies. The gains came amid signs the Fed will be the only major central bank to raise rates in the coming months. 
""It is this concern around inflation and the robustness of the U.S. economy that is likely to dominate when the Fed concludes its meeting,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in London. 
    ""It will offer policymakers a decent opportunity to critique the health of the U.S. economy.""
In contrast to the United States, rate rise expectations elsewhere have receded after disappointing economic data.
Expectations of a Bank of England rate rise this month have virtually been priced out. The European Central Bank and central banks in Japan, Switzerland and Sweden have all hinted that policy tightening remains some way off.
Fresh data confirmed that expectation for the euro zone, showing first-quarter growth at 0.4 percent, below the 0.7 percent quarterly increases seen in the past three quarters.
HSBC analysts said the data showed the euro zone was experiencing ""a slowdown not a slump"" but they added that with inflation staying weak, ""there is every reason for the ECB to maintain a dovish stance for the time being"".

The euro was flat, staying just off 3 1/2-year lows hit to the dollar on Tuesday.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Shares in Samsung BioLogics Co Ltd (KS:207940) tumbled nearly 20 percent on Wednesday, losing almost $6 billion in value in their biggest daily intra-day fall, after South Korea's financial watchdog provisionally decided it had breached an accounting rule.
The Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) said on Tuesday it had given preliminary notice to contract biotech drug manufacturer Samsung BioLogics, an affiliate of technology giant Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), and its auditors of measures it could take concerning the provisional breach.
Samsung BioLogics said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it would prove its books were sound.
But its shares fell as much as 19.8 percent to their lowest since late January, before paring losses to trade down 14.5 percent. Even then, it was Samsung BioLogics' biggest intra-day drop since its listing in late 2016. The benchmark KOSPI (KS11) was down 0.3 percent.
The FSS said it had begun an investigation into the company as an activist group questioned last year whether the company had breached accounting rules to inflate its net profit before its listing.
The country's top financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission, will convene meetings to deliberate on the matter before announcing final measures.
Samsung BioLogics reported a 1.9 trillion won ($1.77 billion) net profit in 2015, compared to a roughly 28 billion won net loss in 2014 and a 62.4 billion won net loss in 2013.
However, the net profit was not a prerequisite for Samsung BioLogics to list in 2016, as the Korea Exchange had instituted new rules allowing companies with growth potential to list despite a net loss, said Seo Keun-hee, analyst at KB Securities.
Shares in Samsung C&T Corp (KS:028260), which held a 43 percent stake in Samsung BioLogics as of end-2017, also fell more than 5 percent. Shares of Samsung Elec, which owned a 31.5 percent stake in Samsung BioLogics as of end-2017, were on a trading halt on Wednesday ahead of a stock split.

NEW YORK/TOKYO (Reuters) -  Xerox Corp  (N:XRX) said its CEO and most of its board will step down to settle a suit by activist shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, handing over to new management which will reconsider a contentious deal with Fujifilm Holdings (T:4901).
The move is a triumph for Icahn and Deason, who together hold 15 percent of Xerox. They had criticized the $6.1 billion deal to combine the U.S. printer and copier maker into Fuji Xerox, an existing joint venture with the Japanese company.
The two had already won a rare court order to temporarily block the deal, which they said undervalued Xerox. A New York judge last week agreed that CEO Jeff Jacobson had been ""hopelessly conflicted"" in negotiating a deal that would put him in charge, since he knew the board was looking to replace him.
""We believe Friday's decision and this agreement mark a watershed moment for corporate governance generally and for Xerox specifically,"" Icahn said in a statement.
In addition to Jacobson, six others of the 10-member board will be replaced by members backed by Icahn and Deason, while the two shareholders will withdraw their proxy fight as part of the settlement.
Fujifilm, which saw its shares drop 5.5 percent in Tokyo after news of the ouster, said it planned to file an objection with a court over the settlement. 
It will also appeal last week's court ruling, it said in a statement, adding that Xerox's new board had an obligation to comply with agreements in January.
In a complex deal, Fuji Xerox would buy back Fujifilm's 75 percent stake in their joint venture before Fujifilm would then purchase 50.1 percent of new Xerox shares. Ultimately, Fujifilm would take control of Xerox, whose brand became synonymous with photocopying.
SUPPOSED PARTNER
Xerox said the new board will meet to reevaluate its joint venture deal with Fujifilm, including terminating its relationship with the company. 
Keith Cozza, CEO of Icahn Enterprises, will become Xerox's chairman while John Visentin, who had previously led Novitex Enterprise Solutions, will become CEO.
Visentin had previously been hired by Icahn to assist him in fighting Xerox. He had also been a candidate under consideration by the old board to replace Jacobson as recently as last year, according to court documents.
Xerox said it decided to settle given the risks and uncertainty of prolonged litigation. The settlement did not resolve the activists' claims against Fujifilm, which the shareholders have criticized for aiding previous Xerox management.
The Fuji Xerox joint venture, 75 percent owned by Fujifilm and 25 percent by Xerox, has struggled with slow demand for office photocopying products. 
As more businesses go paperless, Fujifilm has looked elsewhere for growth, expanding in biotechnology and healthcare. 
Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan, said Fujifilm's deal with Xerox was ""not forward-looking"" anyway, and its resources would be better spent focusing on the new areas.
""I think they might be better off putting their energies into the medical business,"" he said. 
Shares in Xerox were flat in after-hours trading, giving the U.S. company a market value of about $8.2 billion.
Fujifilm's market capitalization stood at 2.12 trillion yen ($19.31 billion) at market close on Wednesday.

1201,By Investing.com,"<span>May 01, 2018 09:23PM ET</span>",Asian Stocks Mixed; Apple Led Rally in Tech Shares ,"Investing.com – Asian equities were mixed in morning trade on Wednesday as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) led rally in technology shares after reporting strong earnings, while several key markets in Asia resumed trading after holidays.
Apple reported a 16% jump in its second quarter revenue, while profit came in at $2.73 a share, beating estimates of $2.64. The company’s shares rose 3% following the results after being under pressured in recent weeks amid concerns on demand for its flagship iPhone X.
Meanwhile, the dollar pulled back after recording its biggest jump in more than a week earlier in the day. The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies last stood at 92.20, down 0.08% at 9:23PM ET (01:23 GMT).
In Asia, The Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2% in morning trade. The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 52.5 in April from 50.9 in March, data showed.
""Following successive months of softening output growth through February and March, Japan's service sector started the second quarter by gathering some momentum,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Panelists noted that increased competition and rising labor shortages may impact output potential over the coming 12 months.""
However, the survey also indicated business confidence fell as companies struggle to hire workers amid a labor shortage.
Japanese automaker  Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.  (T:7201) made headlines after the company said its deliveries in April unexpectedly declined 28%. Nissan's shares fell as much as 1.8% following the announcement on Wednesday.
Elsewhere, South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.4%, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 and Singapore’s STI Index gained 0.5% and 0.7% respectively.
Looking ahead, investors’ attention is likely to focus on the Federal Reserve meeting later in the day for signals on whether the Fed would raise interest rates another three times this year. The U.S. payrolls report is due later this week."
1202,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 09:01PM ET</span>",Gabelli's new fund sees pets as pick of the litter for investors,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
(Reuters) - A potential new U.S. fund could help investors profit from their devotion to cats, dogs and other house pets. 
The company run by investor Mario Gabelli is hatching plans to invest a forthcoming fund in ""any"" sector that ""supports the well-being of pets and pet parents,"" according to offering documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The SEC on Tuesday approved a request by Nasdaq Inc that would let the exchange bring the ""Gabelli Pet Parent Fund - Companion Pets, Their Parents, and The Ecosystems"" to market quickly.
The proposed fund's managers from the GAMCO Investors Inc Gabelli Funds unit will have wide latitude to invest in stocks of firms that make pharmaceuticals, toys and exercise equipment for four-legged animals, birds, fish and other critters.
Thomas Kwan, chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based Harvest Global Investments Ltd, told the Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit last year that people in China, whose population is 1.4 billion, are taking care of pets better, and will buy more from companies making products such as pet food than they once did.
Some analysts think companies focused on the pet market could be poised to turn in stronger growth than their rivals as consumers spend more money on their animals, for instance trading up and buying higher-quality organic dog food.
That potential spurred two big acquisitions this year in the processed foods market with J. M. Smucker Co buying Rachael Ray Nutrish dog food maker Ainsworth Pet Nutrition for about $1.9 billion last month and Cheerios cereal maker  General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS) buying Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc for nearly $8 billion in February.
Overall, U.S. consumers spent $70 billion on pets in 2017, up four percent from the prior year, with additional increases expected in 2018, according to the American Pet Products Association Inc, a trade group.

1203,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 01, 2018 08:30PM ET</span>",Nissan's Shock Sales Plunge Jolts U.S. Market Equilibrium,"(Bloomberg) -- Nissan Motor Co.’s U.S. sales plunged last month, shocking some analysts and dragging on what was otherwise a strong April for auto demand.
The Japanese automaker’s deliveries declined 28 percent in April, with almost every model in the Nissan and Infiniti lineups falling. Nissan shares fell as much as 1.8 percent in Tokyo trading Wednesday. While Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV beat analysts’ estimates, their shares reversed gains after Nissan’s report.
“Our eyes are bugging out here,” Michelle Krebs, senior analyst for researcher Autotrader, said of the Nissan’s numbers. “They’ve been very heavy with rental-car sales and rich incentives. It looks like they’re pulling back.”
Automakers were going to have a difficult time reporting sales gains in April due to a quirk of the calendar. There were two fewer selling days -- which excludes Sundays and holidays -- last month than a year ago. So while almost all major carmakers posted declining deliveries, as analysts expected, the annualized sales rate accelerated to 17.1 million, according to researcher Autodata Corp.
Calculating the annualized sales pace, which topped last April’s 17 million, is becoming more difficult. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). announced last month that it would report U.S. sales only on a quarterly basis, complicating efforts to gauge the health of the world’s most lucrative auto market.
Altima, Rogue Slump
Sales of the Altima sedan, usually Nissan’s top car, dropped by almost half compared with a year ago. And the company’s leading sport utility vehicle, the Rogue, dropped 15 percent. While deliveries to both retail and fleet customers declined, the automaker expects that its results will improve when the new Kicks crossover and redesigned Altima reach dealers, spokesman Chris Keeffe said.
“We were on track for a fairly healthy SAAR,” or seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales, in the low 17-million range, said Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist for researcher Cox Automotive. “But Nissan threw a big monkey wrench in that.”
GM’s U.S. sales fell 2.5 percent to 3 percent in April, according to people familiar with the matter. The result, shared by people who asked not to be identified because the information is private, is in line with analysts’ average estimate for a 2.9 percent decline.
GM’s shares declined 1.4 percent, while Ford and Fiat Chrysler’s closed little changed.
Trucks, SUVs Gain
Consumers are making a mad dash to SUVs and trucks across the industry, with every major automaker reporting declining passenger-car sales. Toyota Motor Corp.’s Camry and Honda Motor Co.’s Accord, which often vie for the title of best-selling U.S. sedan, declined 5 percent and 19 percent, respectively.
Even with gasoline prices rising each of the last two months to the highest since November 2014, the mass migration from cars continues unabated.
“This is not going to derail the shift to SUVs,” said Mark Wakefield, head of the auto practice at consultant AlixPartners. “Consumers haven’t seen it go up enough or fast enough to start making big changes. The crossover has become the new sedan.”
Ford sales dropped less than expected as the F-Series pickup line gained. The only Ford or Lincoln car that U.S. consumers bought more of in April compared with a year ago was the GT -- a $400,000 supercar -- highlighting why the second-largest U.S. automaker is shifting investment toward pickups and SUVs and abandoning sedans for the North American market.
Jeep carried Fiat Chrysler to a surprise gain in total deliveries, with the all-SUV brand’s sales climbing 20 percent. The Compass has been a major source of strength for the brand lately because of easy year-over-year comparisons -- the compact model was just trickling into showrooms at this time in 2017.

1205,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 06:50PM ET</span>",Tax activists slam U.S. reporting exemption for defense firms,"By Amanda Becker
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tax activists this week criticized a U.S. government move to exempt large defense contractors from a financial disclosure rule meant to fight international tax dodging, saying the need for a national security exemption was unproven.
The Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency (FACT) Coalition's criticism came after the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service sided in late March with defense contractors that had asked the agencies for the exemption.
The new rule, part of a global tax accountability push that the United States has largely supported, requires U.S.-based multinational corporations with revenues exceeding $850 million to report revenue annually on a country-by-country basis.
The disclosure is meant to give tax authorities a clearer idea of a company's business commitments in specific countries, especially low-tax nations where multinationals often funnel revenues to minimize their tax liabilities.
But defense contractors, represented by both the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) and the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), argued that the reporting rule would also result in disclosure of other information.
""We are concerned that militarily sensitive information would be contained in or extractable from country-by-country reports envisioned by the proposed rule, particularly with respect to reporting on personnel, sales, and tangible assets in each country,"" the AIA said in a March 2016 letter to the IRS.
AIA's members include contractors such as General Dynamics Corp. (N:GD),  Lockheed Martin  Corp. (N:LMT),  Northrop Grumman  Corp. (N:NOC),  Raytheon Co . (N:RTN) and  Boeing Co . (N:BA) 
Treasury and the IRS sided with the contractors and exempted entities with more than 50 percent of annual revenue derived from contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense or other U.S. intelligence or security agencies.
The IRS said in a March 30 notice that they had sought input on a possible national security exemption when crafting the original rule. Subsequent consultations with the Defense Department and Treasury prompted the exemption, the IRS said.
But, in a letter this week to the Treasury, the FACT Coalition, which represents 100 groups including organizations on tax fairness, government ethics and international poverty, said the agencies had provided no ""reasoned analysis justifying creation of the national security exception.""
""The notice's creation of an immediate national security exception to the (country-by-country) reporting requirement is arbitrary and capricious,"" the FACT Coalition wrote in the April 30 letter. 
The IRS could not immediately be reached for comment on the FACT letter. The Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The country-by-country IRS rule was intended to align with 2015 recommendations from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international group of advanced economies that has been working to curb corporate tax dodging.
The FACT letter said the IRS failed to acknowledge that the Defense Department, when crafting the original rule, had said that country-by-country revenue information ""generally does not pose a national security concern.""

1206,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",A dark hour for traders as rare outage crippled Canada stock markets,"By John Tilak and Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - For about an hour and 11 minutes last Friday afternoon, traders in Canada's biggest stock exchanges were left in the dark, as the stock market operator battled with a hardware failure. 
Those 71 minutes are an eternity for traders, some of whom had no access to critical data, market participants said. At the time, Toronto Stock Exchange operator TMX Group Ltd (TO:X) said only that it was experiencing trading issues on all its exchange platforms, and it eventually said it would shut down trading earlier than usual that day.
TMX, which later blamed the market outage on a hardware failure, rectified the issue and trading resumed on Monday. 
Now, market experts are questioning whether TMX communicated swiftly enough on Friday about the shutdown that occurred more than two hours before the usual close of trading. The episode has also exposed retail investors' heavy reliance on TMX for market data, which weighed on their ability to execute trades.
""If there was a smaller time window between TMX saying they have a problem and confirming they were not going to open, that would have been better,"" Chris Sparrow, director of trading analytics at LiquidMetrix and a former member of the Market Structure Advisory Committee at the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), said on Tuesday.
""There are a lot of calls to action,"" he added. ""I would be surprised if the regulators are not currently investigating this.""
The Ontario Securities Commission said it was in contact with TMX. ""We will examine the results of the TMX internal review, and will consider any next steps from an oversight perspective given our systems requirements for marketplace operations,"" OSC spokeswoman Carolyn Shaw-Rimmington said on Monday.
The trading glitch, which caused Canada's worst stock exchange outage in a decade, highlights the contrast between the Canadian markets and other developed markets. 
TMX Chief Executive Lou Eccleston told Reuters on Monday TMX got to work immediately and needed to first diagnose the problem and also ensure that data was not compromised. ""So we thought it was a better move for the markets, a more prudent decision for the markets to resume orderly trading,"" he said.
On Tuesday, TMX spokesman Shane Quinn said the exchanges' clients and other stakeholders appreciated TMX's handling of the incident and ""the timeliness and transparency of our communications.""
Lorne Steinberg, president of Lorne Steinberg Wealth Management Inc, said an outage for TMX exchanges should immediately trigger their closure for the day in order to level the playing field for all.
""It is fairer to all investors because all the information gets disseminated, no one has to wonder 'Is it going to start trading again later in the day or not?' and then everyone knows it will open again,"" he added.
In an email TMX sent to clients over the weekend and seen by Reuters, the timeline of Friday afternoon's events is laid out. About 10 minutes into the blackout that started at 1:37 p.m. on the Montreal exchange and 1:39 p.m. on the other three TMX-controlled exchanges in Toronto, the operator notified clients and admitted that external participants had no access to order entry for all TSX Equity Markets.
""As well, no market data was being disseminated,"" the email said. Finally at 2:50 p.m., TMX issued an alert saying trading would be shut for the rest of the day. But it was only an hour later, at 3:54 p.m., that the exchange sent out another message informing members about how the final so-called board lot traded prices would be determined.
Eccleston, who joined TMX as CEO in November 2014, said in the Reuters interview that the outage was an ""unprecedented event.""
In the United States and other developed markets, investors tend to quickly switch to other platforms in the event of trading disruptions. But Friday's events showed that a seamless transition did not take place in Canada.
Data from NEO Exchange, a rival to TMX, showed that total trading volume in Canadian stock exchanges fell by about 60 percent between the start of the outage and the time the exchange announced an early shutdown. But once TMX announced that its platform had shut down, trading shifted to the rival platforms, resulting in a sharp increase of the trading volumes in the dying minutes. 
A flawed software rollout at the New York Stock Exchange in July 2015 led to a trading outage of nearly four hours on the biggest U.S. stock exchange. But at the time there were 11 U.S. stock exchanges, along with more than 40 private trading venues, where trading continued, so the trading of NYSE-listed stocks was uninterrupted.
While trading on Canadian stock exchanges resumed on Monday after Friday's disruption, some investors and traders warned that a repeat of the incident could dent TMX's credibility and encourage market participants to look at rival trading venues.

""It happens and it will happen again,"" said Jos Schmitt, CEO of the Aequitas NEO Exchange. ""When the incident happens, the exchange experiencing the issue should through its communication channels declare a timeout and all your orders are canceled. And that moment, everyone will know and everyone will have certainty.""

1207,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 01, 2018 06:31PM ET</span>",Apple's $22.8 Billion in Executed Repurchases Set Another Record,"(Bloomberg) -- The $22.8 billion that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). showered on shareholders in the form of buybacks from January through March is a record, according to a tally by Standard & Poor’s.
Not that it’s anything new for the iPhone maker. Of the 20 biggest quarterly repurchases every carried out by U.S. companies, nine were by Apple. The company’s repurchases in the period exceed the current market value of more than 270 firms in the S&P 500, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Apple boosted its dividends from 63 to 73 cents a quarter, or $2.92 a year, implying an annual payout of $14.8 billion. That tops the $13.9 billion by  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) as the largest by any publicly traded U.S. company, Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P, said in a note. Apple has decreased its shares by a fifth over the past four years as it increased its per-share earnings.
The stock is up 3.4 percent in post-market trading. The options market implies a 5.2 percent advance in the shares a day after the earnings report.
“It’s a great thing in the fact that they’re giving that capital back to shareholders in the way of a buyback and reducing those numbers of shares is just going to spread those earnings,” said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, which owns about 250,000 shares of Apple for its clients. “That’s what I love to see in making an investment.”

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Tuesday reported resilient iPhone sales in the face of waning global demand and promised $100 billion in additional stock buybacks, reassuring investors that its decade-old smartphone invention had life in it yet.
Apple's quarterly results topped Wall Street forecasts, which dropped ahead of the report on growing concern over the iPhone. The Cupertino, California-based company also was more optimistic about the current quarter than most financial analysts, driving shares up 3.6 percent to $175.25 after hours.
Suppliers around the globe had warned of smartphone weakness, playing into fears that the company known for popularizing personal computers, tablets and smartphones had become too reliant on the iPhone. 
Sales of 52.2 million iPhones against a Wall Street target of 52.3 million was a comfort and up from 50.7 million last year, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Apple bought $23.5 billion of stock in the March quarter, and said it planned to hike its dividend 16 percent, compared with a 10.5 percent increase last year. Analysts believe the heavy emphasis on buybacks will bolster share prices, but some investors wished Apple had found different uses for the cash. 
""I'd hoped for more on the dividend side or maybe a strategic investment,"" said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel. ""I assume Apple can't find a strategic investment at the current prices that will move the needle for them. The $100 billion buyback is good for right now but it's not exactly looking to the future.""
The cash Apple earmarked for stock buybacks is about twice the $50 billion market capitalization of electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Apple posted revenue for its March quarter of $61.1 billion, up from $52.9 billion last year. Wall Street expected $60.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Average selling prices for iPhones were $728, compared with Wall Street expectations of $742. The figure is up more than 10 percent from $655 a year ago, suggesting Apple's iPhone X, which starts at $999, has helped boost prices.
Analysts had feared the high price was muting demand for the iPhone X, but Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said it was the most popular iPhone model every week in the March quarter.
""This is the first cycle that we've ever had where the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular,"" Cook said during the company's earnings call. 
""It's one of those things like when a team wins the Super Bowl, maybe you want them to win by a few more points. But it's a Super Bowl winner and that's how we feel about it.""
The iPhone X has shaped up to be ""a good, not a great product. There was a time prior to its introduction that investors expected it to be a great product,"" said Thomas Forte, an analyst with D.A. Davidson Companies. 
""Now that we know it is a good product, as investors have lowered expectations, that is enough, in my view, for shares to go higher from current levels.""
Positive iPhone news boosted shares of chip suppliers.
Skyworks Solutions Inc rose 2.9 percent, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc was up 2 percent, while Cirrus Logic gained 4.3 percent.
Apple also predicted revenue of $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion in the June quarter, ahead of the $51.6 billion Wall Street expected as of Monday evening, and the share repurchases in the March quarter drove Apple's cash net of debt down slightly to $145 billion. 
""We are returning the cash to investors as we have promised,"" Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters in an interview.
Profits were $2.73 per share versus expectations of $2.68 per share, as of Monday, and up from $2.10 a year ago.
Apple's services business, which includes Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, posted $9.1 billion in revenue compared with expectations of $8.3 billion. Heading into earnings, investors were hopeful that growth in that segment could help offset the cooling global smartphone market.
Julie Ask, an analyst with Forrester, said Apple's services segment results were positive but warned that Apple needed to continue to boost subscriptions on its platforms, which reached 270 million users in the March quarter and includes people who subscribe to third-party apps on the iPhone as well as Apple's own services like iCloud.
""Apps are carrying most (services revenue) right now, but Apple needs to get to a place where it's mostly subscriptions and monthly fees and not just one-off downloads,"" Ask said.
Apple traditionally updates its share buyback and dividend program each spring, and the $100 billion it added this year compares with an increase of $50 billion last year. (Graphic: Apple Buys Back Shares - https://reut.rs/2JIjkgo)
In February, Apple said it planned to draw down its excess cash, although Cook had downplayed the possibility of a special dividend.
But investors have had concerns around Apple because of brewing trade tensions with China.
Greater China sales rose 21 percent from a year earlier, Apple's best growth rate there in 10 quarters, to $13.0 billion. While there has not yet been a tariff on devices such as Apple's iPhone, Cook traveled last week to Washington to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House to discuss trade matters. 
""China only wins if the U.S. wins and the U.S. only wins if China wins,"" Cook said on the call, when asked about a possible trade war. ""I'm a big believer that the two countries together can both win and grow the pie, not just allocate it differently,"" he said. 
Apple has been emphasizing its contributions to the U.S. economy in recent months, outlining a $30 billion U.S. spending plan and highlighting the tens of billions of dollars it spends each year with U.S.-based suppliers.

In recent months, Apple has been emphasizing the size of its overall user base, which includes used iPhones, rather than focusing strictly on new device sales, a sign of the increasing importance of making money off users without selling them new hardware.

1222,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 08:15PM ET</span>",Snap shares sink 16 percent as redesign weighs on results,"By Lisa Richwine and Munsif Vengattil
(Reuters) -  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) fell short of Wall Street forecasts for revenue and regular users on Tuesday after a redesign of its Snapchat messaging app turned off some long-time fans and advertisers, sending its shares tumbling 16 percent.
Revenue growth will likely slow substantially in the second quarter, the company said, showing it still faces an uphill battle after an app overhaul meant to fend off bigger rival  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) as it adds Snapchat-like features.
The number of daily active users on Snapchat, crucial for generating advertising revenue, rose to 191 million in the quarter ended March 31, short of consensus expectations of 194.15 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The figure was 15 percent higher than a year earlier, compared with growth of 18 percent in the previous quarter. 
Snap shares plunged 16.5 percent to $11.77 in after-hours trading, extending a slide in the stock since February. Shares had surged 48 percent on Feb. 7, to $20.75, topping Snap's IPO price of $17 for the first time in months, on hopes that the redesign was working. The stocks has mostly fallen since.
""The redesign didn't just make users unhappy, it also made advertisers more concerned,"" said eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson. ""That’s not a good position to be in."" 
On the plus side, Williamson said, ""Snapchat loyalists are highly engaged, using the app multiple times per day. And Snapchat's ad formats are still among the most creative.""
For the quarter ended in March, total revenue rose 54 percent from the same period a year earlier to $230.7 million in what was Snap's fifth quarterly earnings as a public company. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $244.5 million.
Company executives acknowledged that the new design hurt results but said they were sticking with the plan to keep content from friends separate from other publishers. The approach will propel growth in the long run, they said.
""The redesign lays the foundation for the future of both our communication products and our media platform, and we look forward to doubling down on both,"" Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said on a conference call with analysts.
""As we have mentioned on our past two earnings calls, a change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption.""
The redesign was meant to draw in a broader audience, but sparked criticism from users including celebrities Kylie Jenner and Chrissy Teigen. The changes also created some ""apprehension"" among advertisers, Spiegel said.
Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan said the bad publicity surrounding the redesign made some advertisers rethink their use of Snapchat.
""When there is a lot of negative news in the press every day, it does give people pause,"" Khan said, saying that Snapchat will counter that by providing better measurements of return on investment.
User growth at the company's disappearing-message app has repeatedly fallen short of Wall Street's expectations since its heavily hyped initial public offering in March last year.
The Venice, California-based firm posted a net loss of $385.8 million, or 30 cents per share, compared with a loss of $2.21 billion, or $2.31 per share, a year earlier.

Snap's adjusted loss per share of 17 cents was in line with analyst expectations.

1223,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 06:32PM ET</span>",T-Mobile's quarterly revenue beats estimates,"By Sheila Dang and Shariq Khan
(Reuters) - U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS), which is buying smaller rival Sprint Corp (N:S), topped Wall Street estimates for revenue on Tuesday as it added more phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill.
T-Mobile and Sprint announced on Sunday they had agreed to an all-stock $26 billion deal, which the companies say they expect will hold up against regulatory scrutiny because it will create thousands of American jobs and better prepare them to create the next-generation wireless network.
T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere said during the post-earnings conference call with analysts that he had meetings with the Securities Exchange Commission on Tuesday that went ""extremely well,"" and added he would respect the regulatory review process.
Shares of the company rose 2 percent in after-market trading on Tuesday.
T-Mobile added 617,000 phone subscribers who pay a bill in the quarter ended March 31, down from an addition of 798,000 subscribers a year earlier.
The company attributed the decline partly due to the late arrival during the quarter of the Samsung (KS:005930) Galaxy S9, since new smartphone launches have historically driven new customer additions. 
Connected devices like the Apple (O:AAPL) Watch helped raise postpaid net customer additions, and T-Mobile President Mike Stewart called the Apple Watch ""a nice surprise hit"" during the earnings call. 
The company's revenue rose to $10.46 billion from $9.61 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $10.35 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Net income fell to $671 million, or 78 cents a share, during the quarter, down 4 percent from $698 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier.
Analysts had expected net income of 71 cents per share.
A deal between T-Mobile and Sprint will help T-Mobile boost its financials by creating a company with 127 million customers, making it a more formidable competitor to the top two wireless players,  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) and AT&T Inc (N:T).
Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said in a research note that the coming regulatory decision on the proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger could affect approval for the T-Mobile and Sprint tie-up. 

Both carriers' foreign ownership could also complicate the approval process, Yong wrote.

1224,By Investing.com,"<span>May 01, 2018 04:17PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. FOMC Decision in Focus
The Federal Open Committee Market (FOMC) two-day meeting got underway on Tuesday, and will conclude Wednesday with an interest rate decision and the release of a monetary policy statement at 2:00 PM ET.
According to investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool, more than 90% of traders expect the Federal Reserve to leave rates unchanged.
While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates, it is likely to reaffirm its expectations for further growth and inflation in the near term, paving the way for ongoing gradual rate hikes, Stifel said.
The Federal Reserve, however, is widely expected to hike rates at its next meeting in June, when it is slated to provide its updated Economic Summary of Projects, which includes estimates on future growth, inflation and rate hikes.
“We expect the Fed to next hike rates at its June meeting, with little change in the ‘dots’ and forecasts. We continue to look for a total of three hikes this year, followed by a pause, and two additional hikes in 2019 where we think the hiking cycle ends,” Morgan Stanley said.
Both the 10Y US Treasury yield and dollar rose sharply on Tuesday ahead of the FOMC decision, as the latter turned positive for the year.
2. Traders Fret Prospect of Second Straight Weekly Build in US Crude Supplies
Inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday is expected to show a second-straight weekly build in U.S. crude stockpiles.
Analysts forecast crude inventories fell by about 0.739 million barrels in the week ended April 27.
Weekly U.S. production figures are also expected to garner added investor attention after the EIA reported Monday U.S. oil production rose to a record 10.264 million barrels a day in February.
Crude settled sharply lower on Tuesday as investor attention shifted to the prospect of a second weekly build in U.S. crude supplies despite uncertainty over whether US President Donald Trump would preserve the Iran nuclear deal.
Crude oil futures settled 1.93% lower at $67.25 a barrel.
3. Apple to Spark Nasdaq Rally?
Shares of Apple rose more than 4% in after hours trade on Tuesday, after the tech giant reported fiscal second quarter earnings and revenue that beat expectations but sold fewer iPhones than expected.
The tech giant posted earnings of $2.73 share on $61.1 billion in revenue against analysts’ expectations for earnings of $2.70 per share on $60.82 billion in revenue.
Apple eased investor fears of poor iPhone X sales performance as Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement that ""customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each week in the March quarter.""
The average selling prices of its handset was $728 missing estimates of $742, while services revenue were up 21% to $9.2bn, easily beating analysts’ forecasts.
Apple sold 52.2 million iPhones, which was short of the 52.54 million iPhone sales expected.
As was widely reported, Apple announced a $100 billion share buyback and boosted its dividend by 16% to $0.73.
Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed at $169.10, up 2.32%."

1226,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Incoming BASF boss rules out DowDuPont-style break-up,"By Ludwig Burger and Patricia Weiss
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The incoming boss of BASF (DE:BASFn) has thrown his weight behind the chemical titan's contentious strategy of keeping divergent businesses folded into one company, at a time when its major rivals such as DowDuPont are breaking themselves up.
The comments from Martin Brudermueller, who will take over as CEO on Friday, provide clarity on a key strategic issue that is dividing investors, in marked contrast to predecessor Kurt Bock who would not be drawn on which path he favored. 
The German group has grown from a 19th century indigo dye workshop to a diversified juggernaut worth $95 billion. It is the only major Western chemicals player banking on an integrated value chain - which it dubs ""Verbund"" - where a company owns businesses throughout the production process. 
""We often hear the Verbund getting criticized for being too rigid. That's not true,"" said 56-year-old Brudermueller. 
""If you have everything under one roof, you can coordinate things much better, that is the sense in which we will develop it further. You wouldn't normally want to sell attractive businesses that are growing,"" he told Reuters and other reporters in remarks released late on Tuesday. 
At its Ludwigshafen headquarters and at five other hubs abroad, BASF runs close-knit networks of chemical reactors that churn out products as diverse as basic commodities, coatings, vitamins, drug ingredients and engineering plastics.
Bock, when asked in February whether BASF would continue to have diverse businesses under one roof or was considering other options, said the company might learn from what rivals did but did not say which path he favored.
Both strategies have potential advantages; break-ups can create more focused individual companies and allow stronger units to attract investors unshackled from weaker ones, while an integrated model can reduce costs.
U.S. rival DowDuPont (N:DWDP) is planning to break up into a Materials Science division that relies on in-house basic petrochemicals plants and a Specialty Products unit selling more differentiated and complex materials. A third spin-off will focus on agriculture.
In other recent separation deals in the industry, Bayer (DE:BAYGn) spun off its Covestro plastics unit and is now selling down the shares, Air Products spun-off specialty chemicals unit Versum (N:VSM) and coatings group  Akzo Nobel  (AS:AKZO) is selling its specialty chemicals division. 
SHAREHOLDERS SPLIT
BASF competes with DowDuPont in areas such as pesticides, engineering plastics, nutrition, insulation foams and petrochemicals. Its rival's three-way split will restore BASF's position as the world's largest chemical maker but some investors and analysts would rather see it lose that crown.
Patrick Jahnke, portfolio manager at Deka Investments, which owns BASF stock, said he favored the firm selling its upstream petrochemical assets, saying the benefits of physical proximity to downstream operations could be shared with a new owner.
""You can sell the assets but the factory remains in place,"" Jahnke said. ""There are many who would pay a high price (for upstream BASF assets). Private equity would run the business with higher debt and optimized for cash flows and would arrive at a better profitability,"" he added.
Upstream refers to basic petrochemicals, and downstream to more complex specialty chemicals.
A portfolio manager at a top 20 BASF shareholder, who declined to be named as they are not authorized to comment publicly on the investment, also saw the merits of a break-up.
""Downstream, speciality chems could work separately,"" the manager said. ""To de-clutter and reduce complexity ... tends to increase multiples and returns, but German companies are not well known for it.""
BASF has said that sharing logistics, excess energy and by-products within its chemical complexes saves it more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) per year.
There are also supporters of the integrated approach among BASF's shareholders. 
Arne Rautenberg, of Union Investment, said there was still a lot of value in the model.
""The results this year wouldn't have been good without the basic chemicals assets,"" he said. Any move to separating them from the rest ""would very much surprise me and I wouldn't be excited"", he added. 
TALE OF TWO SECTORS
BASF has been a tale of two sectors over the past year.
Supply bottlenecks at rivals and strong industrial demand have flung BASF's basic chemicals business into a surprise upward cycle. Meanwhile, margins of its more complex, specialty products, the group's designated growth drivers, have been squeezed by higher raw materials prices. 
""If upstream strength dissipates and the downstream margin struggles continue, then we think investor focus will turn to portfolio questions,"" HSBC analyst Sriharsha Pappu said in a recent research note.
If allowed to strike out on their own, BASF units making construction chemicals, coatings and catalytic converters could bolster their earnings and fetch better trading multiples on the stock market, the HSBC analyst said. 
Brudermueller, a BASF veteran, is currently chief technology officer and deputy CEO at the firm, which is due to report first-quarter results on Friday. He said that his focus would be on new technologies after taking over from CEO Bock, who by contrast had been the company's finance chief before taking the helm and has a background in business administration. 
The CEO-designate cited cathode materials for car batteries as one area of focus, and also using BASF's new supercomputer to speed up discovery of new compounds.

""The fact that I have a background in technology and science will result in us having a change in perspective,"" he said, adding that he would provide an update on BASF's strategy towards the end of the year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Slow revenue growth and challenges from the recent U.S. tax reform are hurting many U.S. states' credit quality, said global investment management firm Conning on Tuesday as it issued a negative outlook for the sector for the rest of 2018.
Revenues are largely trending below expenditures and U.S. gross domestic product, leading to shrinking reserves for many governments, Conning said in its ""State of the States"" report.
Based on several economic indicators, general fund operations and business activity, the highest-rated states are Utah, Colorado, Idaho, Texas and Washington. The lowest-ranked are Connecticut, New Mexico, Illinois, Mississippi and Kentucky. 
Northeastern states were the least creditworthy while Southeastern and Western states have strong economic growth.
""We believe that above-average economic activity foreshadows
credit upgrades and better relative bond performance,"" the report said.
California, the largest debt issuer of any state, showed the most improvement, thanks to a 7 percent revenue increase in 2017 and healthy reserves, Conning said.
Conning's last report in October also showed an overall lag in revenues, but U.S. tax reform passed in December poses new problems to state credit quality, he said.
New federal tax rules cap state and local tax deductions at $10,000 for individuals, disproportionately hitting residents of high-tax states, the report said. 
""States with high income and property taxes risk losing even more higher-income residents to lower-taxed states,"" said Paul Mansour, head of municipal credit research at Conning.
Tax law changes could force high-tax states, including New York and New Jersey, to lower taxes to keep residents, but states with lower taxes could get additional income tax revenue, the report said.
Other fiscal challenges include the rising cost of pensions, Medicaid and other fixed costs, which have led to cutbacks in new project spending and debt offerings. This would boost states' creditworthiness, Conning said.
""States have done a good job at holding off from issuing debt unless there is a revenue source behind it, displaying good governance and fiscal discipline,"" Conning said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Signs of fading growth momentum across Europe have come as bad news to equity investors hoping for a repeat of 2017's bumper returns, but many say they're not ready to throw in the towel yet on companies that are still delivering strong earnings.
European equities were in high favor last year. The region had overcome the 2012 sovereign debt crisis and was finally seeing an economic boom - complete with its own hashtag, #Euroboom. 
Some of that enthusiasm has waned since. European stocks still failed to match Wall Street gains, rising just 1.3 percent this year, after surging 10 percent in 2017 (STOXXE). 
More ominously, a string of economic data has raised doubts that corporate profits will keep rising. That has knocked the index 4.2 percent off January highs and some $19 billion has fled euro equity funds in the past seven weeks, data from EPFR shows. 
Funds' allocations to euro zone equities dropped to a 13-month low in April, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), which says ""overweight"" positions have slipped to 34 percent versus 58 percent last October.
Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management, is among those disillusioned with the market.
""If Europe didn't do well last year, when is it going to perform?"" said Gardiner, who recommends neutral positioning on continental Europe.
His disappointment is perhaps understandable.
After picking up strongly most of last year, IHS Markit's flash PMI survey - a key euro zone manufacturing activity gauge -- dropped to 14-month lows of 55.2. Business confidence in Germany, the bloc's growth engine, fell this month to the lowest in over a year.
In a sign analysts were unprepared for such a slowdown, Citi's economic surprise indicator for the euro zone has fallen to its lowest since June 2012 <.CESIEUR>.
If data due on Wednesday shows first-quarter economic growth decelerating significantly from the previous three months, that could be a crucial negative signal for the market, bears say. 
KEEPING THE KETTLE ON THE BOIL
Not so fast.
Some investors are sticking to their guns - they say economic indicators' decline from the supercharged levels of last year was to be expected.
""It was kind of too good to be true in that you had PMIs in Europe near 60, which was great and you were thrilled with it and you would take it but ... you just didn't really feel all that comfortable with it,"" said Daniel Morris, senior investment strategist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management. 
""The higher you go the further you fall, so I think it's made the decline since seem worse than in fact it really is,"" said Morris, who remains ""overweight"" on Europe. 
Another investor, Chris Dyer, director of global equity at Eaton Vance, is keeping European equities as his largest ""overweight"" within global portfolios, noting that the indicators had hit multi-decade highs last year.
""It's hard to keep the kettle on the boil for that long, so I'm not too concerned about it coming off,"" Dyer said.
The reason for clinging on, investors say, is their belief that regional companies will still deliver robust profits. In 2017, European firms enjoyed their first year of earnings growth in seven years and MSCI Europe should deliver earnings growth of 7.5 percent this year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
This pales in comparison with the 19.8 percent predicted for the S&P 500, but U.S. earnings are widely seen as boosted by hefty tax cuts.
In the first quarter, MSCI Europe earnings are expected to grow 0.6 percent from Q1 2017 in euro terms - which translates to a healthy 12.1 percent in dollar terms, as the euro appreciated sharply in the first quarter. 
Finally, the euro zone's newfound political stability is also reassuring investors, after populist, euro skeptic parties largely failed to make much headway. 
The best example of that optimism may be Italy. Italian stocks are among the best performers globally, gaining 9.7 percent year-to-date, led by banking stocks that are well positioned to benefit from growth. That's despite the likelihood of fresh elections after an inconclusive vote in March.

""The fact that Europe is on a sounder footing and that growth seems to be relatively well-underpinned ... we're pretty comfortable with that,"" said Alistair Wittet, manager of the Comgest Growth Europe ex UK fund.

1243,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",Debt funds lever up as fund financing grows,"By Max Bower
(LPC) - The size of fund financing loans is increasing along with banks’ exposure to the US$400bn market as managers raise ever-larger funds, but the wall of cash pouring into the sector is also encouraging smaller debt funds to leverage portfolios to maintain returns. 
Up to 50 banks are now competing to offer subscription lines of up to €2bn to support multi-billion dollar private equity funds, but fund financing specialists are also seeing rising demand for Net Asset Value (NAV) lines from smaller debt funds, including direct lenders, CLOs and real estate funds.
Fund financing is one of the fastest growing areas of the syndicated loan market as it supports the booming institutional buyside. Two thirds of managers now use fund lines, according to a recent eVestment report.
But the market is opaque and deal structures are becoming more sophisticated and complex as more banks compete aggressively for business.
“Structures have changed and become more complex as business have got more complex. This gives borrowers some power,” a banker said.
Subscription lines make up around 80% of the fund financing market and are typically used by private equity firms to cover the gap between calling for LP investors’ commitments and receiving funds. They are based on investors’ credit profiles and do not add leverage.
Net Asset Value lines are based on the value of assets in funds’ portfolios and do add leverage which helps to boost returns. General Partners (GP) lines are secured against fund management fees. 
Hybrid lines, which combine subscription lines and NAV lines, are being hailed as the future of fund financing, but are growing slowly as they are complex and difficult to execute in practice. 
“There’s been a lot of talk of hybrid lines,” said Ben Griffiths, global head of fund financing at MUFG, citing the mixture of expertise from banks and complex documentation as hindering its growth.
‘DEEP WATERS’
NAV lines are becoming more popular with smaller debt funds, according to Gavin Rees, head of global fund banking at Silicon Valley Bank. Funds are turning to leverage to maintain returns as yields have sunk across the capital markets.
Demand for NAV lines increased noticeably in the first quarter, according to Phil Lovett, head of leveraged finance UK at Silicon Valley Bank.
“There’s a need for leverage at the debt fund level because managers have over-promised on returns to their end investors.” Lovett said.
Using the facilities can increase returns to up to 10%, compared to 6%-8% on an unlevered funds, Brent Humphries, president at AB Private Credit Investors said.
Lenders are more comfortable giving additional leverage to debt funds, as the assets that they invest in are more liquid than private equity commitments, but not all market observers are sanguine.
“These are very deep waters,” a London-based head of leveraged finance said. “All signed deals look good on paper and no one goes into them thinking they’ll lose money, but there will be a lot of pain ahead.”
NO DEFAULT
Although the fund financing market has had no defaults to date on subscription lines, the growing size of deals and more aggressive terms are requiring lenders to read the fine print of the legal documents more carefully, and look at the bigger picture. 
Banks deal with fund financing in several different departments, which can make aggregating exposure difficult, and even potentially problematic in a severe downturn.
“Fund financing usually sits in the fund-related products division, but often the expertise required sits in different parts of the bank,” the first banker said.
As subscription lines effectively bridge LP investors’ commitments, any possible funding exceptions need also need increasingly careful consideration. Side letters can allow LP investors, including high net worth individuals, pension and insurance funds and sovereign wealth funds, to potentially avoid funding.
“There are more most favoured nation clauses today in side letters which can increase the risk of LPs being able to walk away from fund commitments in extreme circumstances – this increases the need to review and understand the side-letters which appear to be getting more complex,” said Lee Doyle, global head of bank industry at Ashurst in London.
Some sovereign wealth funds have sovereign immunity that could allow them not to be called on funding commitments which provide security for subscription lines and some US State public pension funds can also be exempt, which is prompting lenders to do more intensive due diligence. 
“When you see funds with fewer LPs, and especially with single investor sovereign wealth funds, due to the lack of diversity there could inherently be more risk,” Doyle added. “In Europe there is certainly more due diligence done on LPs and the contractual arrangements than two years ago.”
Although there is a high reputation risk for LPs not to lend, some banks were burned in the last crisis and still will not lend against sovereign wealth fund commitments or high net worth individual commitments, the first banker said.

“I know of a few family offices that said to their GP ‘don’t hit me for my funding commitment now’ during the last financial crisis,” another banker said.

1253,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 04:02PM ET</span>",Cold snap for U.S. April auto sales instead of spring thaw,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - Most major automakers on Tuesday posted lower new U.S. vehicle sales for April as consumer demand continued to weaken and competition intensified following a lengthy boom for the industry.
According to Autodata, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales for April hit 17.15 million units compared with 17.04 million a year ago. That was in line with an April SAAR of 17.1 million units expected by analysts polled by Reuters.
Auto sales have been on a bit of a roller coaster ride this year, with a weak performance in February followed by a jump in sales for some automakers in March.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) reported a 4.7-percent decline in sales compared to April 2017, with retail sales to consumers down 2.6 percent. The No. 2 U.S. automaker said sales of its best-selling F-Series pickup trucks were up 3.5 percent, but SUV and passenger car sales were down 4.6 percent and 15 percent respectively. 
For years, U.S. consumers have been shifting away from traditional passenger cars in favor of larger and more comfortable pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers. 
Ford last week outlined a plan to cut costs and boost profit margins that includes dropping traditional sedan models in North America.
But the number of new models vying for a share of the SUV market is growing faster than demand, threatening the fat profits automakers have enjoyed.
""That is a very competitive part of the market ... with so many new entries,"" Ford's U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve said of the SUV segment on a conference call with analysts and reporters.
Last year, U.S. auto sales fell 2 percent after hitting a record high of 17.55 million units in 2016. Sales are expected to fall further in 2018 as higher interest rates push up monthly car payments. Also, millions of nearly new vehicles will return to the market this year after coming off lease, providing a lower-cost alternative for consumers.
""With a plateauing market, you are going to get some bumpiness,"" Ford's LaNeve said. 
Nissan Motor Co Ltd's (T:7201) sales hit quite a bump, plunging 28 percent in April. The Japanese automaker's passenger car sales dropped nearly 35 percent and SUV and truck sales were down 23.1 percent. Even sales of the company's popular SUV crossover model Rogue were down almost 15 percent.
""April was an extremely challenging month with intense competition in the U.S. market,"" Nissan said in a statement. The company said declining retail sales and a ""pullback on fleet volume contributed to lower performance."" 
No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co (N:GM) announced last month that it would no longer report monthly sales and instead will just post sales on a quarterly basis. Industry estimates showed GM posting sales anywhere from flat to down 8 percent for April. 
Ford said on Tuesday it will continue to post monthly sales.
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) was alone among the top sellers in the U.S. market, posting an overall sales increase of 5 percent in April. But retail sales to consumers were down 1 percent while lower-margin fleet sales to rental car companies and government agencies were up 5 percent.
FCA's popular Jeep brand hit a record for April. But sales of FCA's Ram pickup truck were down 9 percent, though retail sales of the lucrative truck were up 3 percent.
FCA said last week when it reported first-quarter results that it had encountered problems ramping up production of the new RAM 1500 pickup truck at its U.S. Sterling Heights plant.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) posted a 4.7 percent decline in sales for April, with a 1.5 percent increase in SUV and pickup truck sales offset by a 12.7 percent drop in passenger car sales. 
Sales of Toyota's recently revamped flagship Camry sedan were down 5 percent.
Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) said its April sales declined 9.2 percent, with a car sales off 14.4 percent and pickup trucks and SUVs down 3.9 percent. 
Honda's all-new version of its flagship Accord sedan plunged 19.3 percent.
 Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) said its sales were down 11 percent versus April 2017.

In afternoon trading, Ford and FCA shares were flat, while GM was down 54 cents or 1.5 percent at $36.20.

1256,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 12:54PM ET</span>",UK territories ordered to open up about secretive companies,"By Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain agreed on Tuesday to order its overseas territories such as the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands to make secretive company ownership information public by the end of 2020 to try to tackle corruption and tax avoidance.
The move was hailed as a major victory by campaigners in the fight against tax avoidance and money laundering.
""This is the news we have been waiting for,"" said Simon Kirkland, a campaigner at Christian Aid. ""This is a major step forward in the fight against the tax avoidance, evasion and corruption that costs developing countries so dearly."" 
Overseas territories and crown dependencies have come under increasing pressure to reveal who is behind anonymously owned companies, with campaign groups saying such secrecy aids money laundering, tax evasion and corrupt diversion of public funds from developing economies.
Several politicians in the ruling Conservative party teamed up with opposition Labour lawmakers to back the changes, which were first pushed by former Prime Minister David Cameron, but resisted by the overseas territories.
Many of these territories have large financial services sectors because they levy low taxes and ownership of businesses lacks transparency.
Despite repeated calls for more openness, British crown dependencies and overseas territories are only required to reveal information on the true owners of offshore companies to law enforcement bodies, and then only if asked.
Alan Duncan, a junior foreign office minister, told parliament the government would support an amendment brought by two Members of Parliament calling for a central register of company ownership in these territories as lawmakers debated an amendment on an anti-money laundering law.
Britain has been trying to clamp down on tax evasion and corrupt flows of money through its large financial services sector, but has faced resistance from some of its overseas territories because the secrecy and low taxes are what makes their finance sectors attractive. 
Margaret Hodge, the opposition Labour Member of Parliament who introduced the amendment, said it would help prevent tax evasion and disrupt the activities of criminals and militant groups. 
""It will stop them exploiting our secret regime, hiding their toxic wealth and laundering money into the legitimate system, often for nefarious purposes,"" she said. 
""With open registers we will then know who owns what and where, and we will be able to see where the money flows, and then we will better equipped to root out dirty money and deal with the issues that arise from that.""
RUSSIAN MONEY? 
Naomi Hirst, a spokeswoman for the Global Witness anti-corruption Non-Governmental Organization, said the move comes after four similar amendments submitted before parliament in the past have failed. 
She added the poisoning of a former Russian double agent in England in March had probably pressured the government to tackle the web of offshore shell companies used to invest in Britain.
Seven times the amount of money from Russia has flowed to British overseas territories rather than directly into Britain over the last decade, she said.
""This has really fired up imaginations and pointed out to even the most squeamish of politicians concerned about Russian's role in the world that they need to look at this,"" she said. 

The amendment does not apply to the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, because parliament does not have the right to impose its will on them.

The company said sales in North America were flat, but the company's international business saw revenue soar 27% year-over-year.

(Reuters) - U.S. insurer MetLife Inc (N:MET) said on Tuesday John Hele has retired as chief financial officer and will be succeeded by the company's treasurer John McCallion.
McCallion, 44, takes over as CFO on Tuesday, a day before MetLife is to report first-quarter 2018 earnings. Hele, 59, is expected to stay at MetLife as senior adviser until September.
In 2017 MetLife disclosed two key financial reporting errors, including payments it failed to make to pensioners whom it could not locate after taking over their plans from private companies.
MetLife cut Hele's total 2017 compensation by 6.4 percent, to $5.3 million from $5.7 million, a change that reflected the insurer's ""performance in managing financial matters, including material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting,"" the company said in an April 26 proxy statement..
A MetLife spokesman declined to comment on whether the errors had spurred Hele's retirement. He had been with the company for nearly 10 years.
""I want to thank John Hele for his service as CFO and for bringing a sharper focus on the true economics of the business we write,"" MetLife Chief Executive Steven Kandarian said in a statement.
In March, MetLife said it uncovered a reserve miscalculation for a Japanese annuity product during a review it launched in late 2017 and completed early this year.
McCallion joined MetLife in July, 2006. He has served as head of investor relations and CFO for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, among other roles. McCallion has also worked at the insurance audit practice of PwC.

MetLife, also on Tuesday, named Stephen Gauster as Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Gauster joined the company in 2016.

1281,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 08:33AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Hasbro to acquire Power Rangers, other franchises from Saban: sources","By Jessica Toonkel
(Reuters) - Toy maker  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS) has agreed to acquire children's entertainment and merchandising franchises, including the characters of the superhero TV show Power Rangers, from Saban Entertainment for around $520 million in cash and stock, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The deal comes as Hasbro, the world's largest toy maker whose stable of franchises includes ""My Little Pony,"" ""Monopoly"" and ""The Transformers,"" seeks to reverse its losses following the bankruptcy last year of U.S. toy retailer Toys R Us.
In addition to making toys and action figures, Hasbro profits from such franchises through the production of movies and TV series, allowing it to diversify its revenue beyond retail sales.
A deal between Hasbro and Saban Entertainment, the owner of the Power Rangers franchise, could be announced as early as Tuesday, the sources said. The agreement also includes franchises such as Luna Petunia and Popples, the sources added.
The sources asked not to be identified ahead of an official announcement. Hasbro and Saban Entertainment did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Launched as the “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers” live-action TV show in 1993, the franchise was created by Haim Saban, owner of Saban Entertainment.
The TV series gave rise to a line of action figures and other merchandise, plus three movies, including 'Saban’s Power Rangers' last year. The 2017 film, distributed by  Lions Gate Entertainment Corp  (N:LGFa), sold $142 million worth of tickets worldwide.
Earlier this year, Hasbro and Saban signed a deal for the toy maker to design, produce and bring to market a wide variety of toys and role-play items inspired by Power Rangers.
Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based Hasbro has taken several steps to boost its presence in the entertainment business as a way to fuel toy sales.
The company operates Hasbro Studios, which produces TV shows such as the upcoming Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) series, “Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters.”
The toy industry's traditional players have been undone in recent years by a shift toward thousands of rival, smaller producers selling on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other e-commerce sites, as well as kids' preference for electronic games over physical toys.
Last week, Hasbro reported a net loss attributable to the company of $112.5 million, or 90 cents per share, in the first quarter ended April 1, compared with a profit of $68.6 million, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier.
In 2014, Hasbro held merger discussions with DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc, the studio behind “Shrek,” but DreamWorks was subsequently bought by Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA).
Last year, the toymaker also held talks to acquire U.S. movie studio and entertainment company Lions Gate, but those negotiations broke down over price, sources said at the time.

Hasbro has been seeking scale, and has attempted unsuccessfully to merge with peer  Mattel Inc  (O:MAT) over the years, most recently in 2017. Mattel added to a sense of crisis in the toy sector by appointing its fourth chief executive in three years last week.

1282,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 08:52AM ET</span>","RBS to cut 792 jobs, close 162 branches in Williams & Glyn cull","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) is to cut around 792 jobs and shutter 162 branches following a review of its branch network in England and Wales, the state-backed lender said on Tuesday.
RBS, which is more than 70 percent owned by the British taxpayer following a 2007 bailout, said the redundancies and closures were necessary because many of its branches were too close to one another - within 0.6 and 2.5 miles - and because changing consumer behaviors have seen footfall numbers plummet. 
""We realise this is difficult news for our colleagues and we are doing everything we can to support those affected. We will ensure compulsory redundancies are kept to an absolute minimum,"" the bank said in a statement. 
The cuts follow the closure of 259 branches announced in December last year, which resulted in 680 job losses, and similar moves by Britain's biggest mortgage lender Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY). 
The two banks have cut around 3,600 jobs since December in a bid to cut costs and digitise their operations in the face of the increasing popularity of financial technology firms and online and telephone banking. 
Employee union Unite criticized the planned closures and cuts, which follow the failed spin off of RBS's Williams & Glyn brand in 2016. 
The union said close to 60 percent of Williams & Glyn branches would be closed in what Unite said represented ""shambolically poor management"" of the business. 
""Ending years of speculation Royal Bank of Scotland has effectively turned its back on the Williams and Glyn customers and staff,"" National Officer Rob MacGregor said, adding the move will deprive customers of access to full banking facilities. 
RBS's announcement to axe branches in December had already prompted fierce criticism from campaigners and lawmakers, forcing the bank to postpone some closures in Scotland.
The first closures, of 109 branches, will occur in late July and August 2018, with another 53 branches to close in November.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 edged higher on Tuesday after comments from a Trump administration official on trade with China and the Mexican economy minister on the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement provided cause for optimism.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said his country would respond to U.S. proposals on rules for automobiles under NAFTA next week and that a deal is likely if negotiators show enough creativity and flexibility.
Earlier, stocks came off the day's lows after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he did not desire to change China's economic system but wanted to limit the damage it causes to the United States and encourage more foreign competition.
The encouraging news on trade balanced concerns of inflation, which sent stocks lower at the start of the session.
""There is a certain level of fear that has seeped into this market,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""But there are positive outlooks out there on trade.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 64.1 points, or 0.27 percent, to 24,099.05, the S&P 500 gained 6.75 points, or 0.25 percent, to 2,654.8 and the Nasdaq Composite added 64.44 points, or 0.91 percent, to 7,130.70.
Despite Tuesday's slight gains, investors say they remain concerned about cost warnings from companies, even as the current earnings season, now past the halfway mark, has produced the strongest profit growth in seven years.
Data from the Institute for Supply Management indicated a jump in raw material costs for U.S. companies, in part due to the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports imposed by the Trump administration. It also showed that U.S. factory activity slowed for a second straight month in April.
Oil prices are near their highest levels since 2014, though they dropped more than 1 percent on Tuesday as the dollar remained near a four-month high. [O/R]
""The red flags are everywhere,"" said Jim Awad, senior managing director of Hartland & Co in New York. ""We're finally getting the inflation that to date has been so elusive.""
Rising costs have stoked fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates more times than expected this year. The U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to release its policy statement on Wednesday at the close of a two-day meeting. It is expected to keep interest rates steady but will likely encourage expectations that it will hike rates in June.
Shares of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) fell 3.3 percent, the greatest percentage decline on the Dow, after the company posted its biggest miss on quarterly revenue in a year as demand for key drugs fell short of estimates.

Match shares tumbled 22.1 percent while IAC shares sank 17.8 percent. Facebook shares rose 1.1 percent.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.43-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

(Reuters) - Drugmaker Merck & Co (N:MRK) reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit on Tuesday, helped by a more than 150 percent rise in sales of cancer drug Keytruda.
Merck is increasingly reliant on the blockbuster medicine, which is positioned to become the leading player in a new generation of oncology treatments and rival Bristol-Myers Squibb's (N:BMY) Opdivo.
Both drugs harness the body's immune system to recognize and fight cancer cells, but last month's survival data from trials of the treatments gave Keytruda an edge over Opdivo, according to industry experts.
Keytruda raked in sales of $1.46 billion in the quarter, ahead of $1.40 billion estimated by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Revenue from the drug accounted for nearly 15 percent of Merck's total sales, helped by its expanded approval to treat various forms of cancer.
Sales of Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo surged 34 percent to $1.51 billion in the latest quarter. 
Merck raised its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings to between $4.16 and $4.28 per share from between $4.08 and $4.23 per share estimated previously.
Net income fell 52.5 percent to $736 million, or 27 cents per share, hurt by a $1.4 billion charge related to a collaboration with Eisai Co Ltd, the company said.(Merck Keytruda sales: https://reut.rs/2jicYcr)
Excluding items, Merck earned $1.05 per share, ahead of analysts' estimates of $1 per share . Revenue rose 6.4 percent to $10.04 billion, but missed estimates of $10.11 billion.

Merck's shares rose 1.1 percent to $59.50 before the bell.

1293,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 12:15PM ET</span>",Pfizer first-quarter results miss estimates as key drug sales fall short,"By Bill Berkrot
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) on Tuesday reported lower-than-expected first-quarter revenue as demand for some key drugs and international sales fell short of estimates, sparking a 5.1 percent drop in shares of the largest U.S. drugmaker.
The company, which is exploring a sale of its consumer healthcare business but has seen potential suitors drop out, said it has not received an acceptable offer at this time.
""If we can't get value, we'll retain it and invest in it,"" Chief Executive Officer Ian Read told analysts. A final decision is still expected this year.
Read, whose previous attempts at huge acquisitions of AstraZeneca (L:AZN) and Allergan (N:AGN) were thwarted, said the company does not need a megamerger to drive future growth.
""I don't see that we need a transformative deal or see one at an appropriate value,"" Read said, adding that drugs in development and newer medicines will be able to drive future growth.
He said the company has 15 potential blockbuster medicines in the pipeline that could be launched by 2022.
Pfizer also sees opportunities to significantly expand sales of prostate cancer drug Xtandi for treating less advanced patients, and arthritis drug Xeljanz for ulcerative colitis. U.S. regulatory decisions on the expanded uses are expected later this year. 
Pfizer posted adjusted earnings of 77 cents per share that topped analysts' average expectations by 4 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, on lower taxes and cost of goods sold. It did not raise its full-year earnings or revenue forecasts.
Despite strong growth, sales of oral rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz and blockbuster breast cancer treatment Ibrance missed expectations largely due to inventory stocking issues but are likely to rebound, analysts said.
Injected arthritis drug Enbrel was hit by competition from cheaper biosimilars outside the United States. Vaccines and other older drugs, such as Lyrica, Premarin and Celebrex all fell short of analysts' estimates.
Ibrance sales rose 37.4 percent to $933 million, while analysts looked for $956.6 million. Xeljanz sales totaled $326 million, missing the Wall Street outlook by about $72 million.
Total revenue rose 1 percent to $12.91 billion, while analysts expected $13.13 billion.
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said he expected stronger international sales, given favorable foreign exchange rates.
""If you remove the FX tailwind it would have been a much more substantial miss,"" he said, adding that it was disappointing Pfizer did not raise its 2018 forecasts after rivals, such as Merck & Co (N:MRK) and AbbVie (N:ABBV), raised their outlooks after reporting first-quarter results.
Pfizer still expects adjusted full-year earnings of $2.90 to $3.00 per share on revenue of $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion.
Net profit rose to $3.56 billion, or 59 cents per share, for the quarter, from $3.12 billion, or 51 cents, a year earlier.

Pfizer shares fell $1.87 to $34.74.

LONDON (Reuters) - Trafigura has tripled the size of its management committee, bolstering the position of CEO Jeremy Weir while also giving more responsibility to the next generation of potential leaders, the Swiss commodities trader said on Tuesday.
The nine-person committee will oversee day-to-day trading, commercial and operational functions as well as investments, according to an internal memo sent by Weir and seen by Reuters.
It replaces the previous three person executive committee, which was comprised of the CEO, chief operating officer and global head of oil trading. Weir will also take on the role of executive chairman.
As well as Weir, the committee will include Chief Financial Officer Christophe Salmon, Chief Operating Officer Mike Wainwright, the co-heads of market risk Ben Luckock and Rob Gillon, the head of mergers and acquisitions Jesus Fernandez, plus the heads of Trafigura's key trading divisions. 
These are the global head of oil trading Jose Larocca, the global head of refined metals and concentrates Amin Zahir and the global head of coal and iron ore Julien Rolland.
Rob Gillon is also a board member of Trafigura's down and midstream arm Puma Energy. Trafigura holds a 49.6 percent stake in Puma. 

""The change marks a further step in the development of Trafigura Group's governance. It formalises the role of a wider management group in supporting the Executive Chairman, and gives additional responsibility to members of the next generation of Trafigura leaders,"" a Trafigura spokesman said.

1298,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 09:31AM ET</span>",Britain to rule on Murdoch's Sky bid by June 13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's media secretary Matt Hancock will give his verdict on Rupert Murdoch's 18-month pursuit of Sky (L:SKYB) by June 13, potentially paving the way for the mogul's Fox to take on Comcast in the battle for the British TV group. 
Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) agreed a deal to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own in December 2016 but the takeover has been repeatedly held up by politicians and regulators who fear it will give Murdoch too much influence in Britain. 
Fox has offered a string of undertakings designed to protect the editorial independence of Sky's News division but in February both sides were stunned when U.S. media group Comcast (O:CMCSA) made a rival offer. 
Comcast has since made that a formal $31 billion bid.
""My decision will be on whether the merger operates or may be expected to operate against the public interest, taking into account the specified public interest considerations of media plurality and genuine commitment to broadcasting standards,"" Hancock said.
Fox's bid for Sky has been complicated by its more recent agreement to sell many of its TV and film assets to Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), including its stake in Sky, for $52 billion.
Hancock said he would deliver his final verdict to parliament. He said however that having given his verdict, he would consider any further undertakings that may be made by Fox and offer the industry the chance to give their verdict. 
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been investigating whether the deal will give Murdoch, who owns the Times and Sun newspapers, too much influence in Britain's news media. It sent its assessment to Hancock on Tuesday, giving him 30 working days to assess the deal.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) multi-hundred billion cash stockpile and stalling growth in services such as iCloud present an opportunity and a concern that some investors hope will be addressed in the company's quarterly earnings report on Tuesday.
The iPhone is by far the biggest product from Apple, accounting for more than 60 percent of its revenue last year, but Chief Executive Tim Cook and other executives have targeted services as a path to growth.
Disappointing forecasts from the iPhone supply chain have lowered expectations for unit sales.
Analysts such as Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi estimate as few as 51 million handsets were sold in the fiscal second quarter, versus Wall Street expectations of 54 million phones, versus 50.7 million in the year-ago period. Overall, Wall Street has lowered its expectations for iPhone revenue from $39.7 billion on April 17 to $39.2 billion, according to an average of estimates from 17 analysts by Thomson Reuters.
Sacconaghi expects the iPhone business to dominate discussions of the results, but some investors think a better question is whether Apple can deliver on its plan to ramp up services revenue from Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store.
""When people asked what Apple's next big product was, we kept saying it was services for several years, but then last quarter it stalled. Apple is like an A student with a bad report card. We're not going to throw them out of the house just yet, but we want to see that number pick back up,"" said Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners.
Miller, an Apple investor, wants Apple to use some of its cash to boost share repurchases and reinvest some in the services business. In February, Apple said that segment grew 18 percent to $8.4 billion, missing analyst expectations of $8.6 billion and down slightly from $8.5 billion the quarter before.
Wall Street expects $8.4 billion in services revenue this quarter, according to a Thomson Reuters average of 17 analyst estimates.
Tom Plumb, founder of Wisconsin Capital Management and an Apple shareholder, said Apple should seek out recurring revenue in areas such as financial services. Apple could use the cash to bolster its Apple Pay product by buying a company like  American Express  Co (N:AXP) or making other investments to make consistent revenue off transactions.
""They're seeing the maturing of this technology cycle. I'm afraid their mentality is, 'Oh, we need another big product and cycle with opportunities like this one,'"" Plumb said. ""But what they really need is a recurring revenue model to participate in all these changes around the world.""
Hal Eddins, chief economist at Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said that many of the massive acquisition targets often tossed around as possibilities for Apple, such as Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) or Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), do not make sense from a valuation standpoint. This is because Apple would be paying a premium relative to its own price-earnings ratio, which sits below overall market averages, he noted.
His request: an increase in Apple's dividend, which lags those of other tech firms such as  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) or Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO).

Sales at number two ranked Sainsbury's rose 0.2 percent, while Asda, owned by Walmart (N:WMT), saw growth of 1.4 percent, Kantar Worldpanel said.
Both Sainsbury's and Asda dropped market share compared to a year ago - down 0.3 percentage points and 0.1 percentage points respectively, Kantar said.
Current market leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO) posted sales growth of 2.1 percent while sales at fourth-placed Morrisons (L:MRW) were up 2.2 percent. Market share for both was flat at 27.6 percent and 10.5 percent respectively.

1311,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 01, 2018 03:01AM ET</span>",Mnuchin Says U.S. Isn't Looking to Put Rusal Out of Business,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. isn’t seeking to put Russian aluminum giant United Co. Rusal (HK:0486) out of business by sanctioning the company, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, but its majority owner Oleg Deripaska must reduce his stake to less than 50 percent.
“The first aspect would be that he sells down below 50 percent,” Mnuchin told Bloomberg TV in an interview on Monday in Los Angeles, calling discussions with the company about avoiding U.S. sanctions “encouraging.”
“Our objective was not to put Rusal out of business and that’s why we extended the license,” Mnuchin said.
The U.S. announced sanctions April 6 against Rusal, targeting Deripaska under a law that ordered the Trump administration to punish Russia for its alleged meddling in the 2016 election. Deripaska was identified in a January Treasury report as a so-called Russian oligarch close to the country’s president, Vladimir Putin.
Rusal has applied to be delisted from the U.S. sanctions and last week the Treasury Department for the first time described a path for the company to escape the penalties. Deripaska has agreed “in principle” to cut his stake in London-based En+ Group Plc, the holding company through which he controls Rusal.
Treasury also extended the deadline for companies to wind-down dealings with Rusal by almost five months to October. The move sparked a plunge in aluminum prices as traders speculated that supply disruptions could ease. Washington’s clarification follows two weeks of chaos in global metals markets following the announcement of the sanctions.
Deripaska’s name has surfaced in the U.S. investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election over his business ties to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Deripaska controls Rusal through a shareholder agreement with others including  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc and Viktor Vekselberg, who is also under sanctions.
Deripaska has been said to plan on keeping control of Rusal, which is battling for survival in the face of the U.S. sanctions. Any resistance from the billionaire to relinquishing control sets up the prospect of a standoff between Rusal and the U.S. The European aluminum industry has warned there will be further chaos if the situation isn’t resolved before a wind down period expires.
Despite Mnuchin’s conciliatory tone, sanctions experts have warned that negotiations between the Treasury and Rusal could take some time.
""This will take several iterations,"" said Brian O’Toole, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who previously worked in the Treasury’s sanctions unit, pointing to a 2016 sanctions case involving the sale of Panamanian newspapers that took more than a year to resolve.

CEO Mike Coupe was waiting in a studio when cameras caught him singing the song from the musical 42nd Street in footage that was later released by British broadcaster  ITV  (LON:ITV).
""We're in the money, the sky is sunny. Let's lend it, spend it, send it rolling along,"" he sings before sipping his coffee.

1313,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 08:54AM ET</span>","Dollar goes positive for year, iPhone answers calling","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar broke into positive territory for the year and bond yields were creeping higher again on Tuesday, as the recent rise in oil prices fuelled bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will flag more interest rate hikes this week.
May Day holidays across Asia and Europe meant trading was thinner than usual, though there was more than enough news flow to keep those that were open occupied.
There was some optimism after U.S. President Donald Trump extended steel and aluminium tariff exemptions for Europe, Canada and Mexico for another month.
But there was cause for caution too: Disappointing British manufacturing and consumer lending figures added to Europe's recent run of poor data, worries about Iran's nuclear deal simmered in oil markets, and Wall Street was waiting for Apple's results following recent whispers of weak iPhone demand. (N)
The dollar made most of the running, though, as it turned positive for 2018 just ahead of a two-day Fed meeting that is expected to pave the way for another two or even three U.S. rate hikes this year.
Dollar bulls in London took advantage of the holiday in most of the rest of Europe to push the currency to almost $1.20 per euro and helped it make good ground against the Swiss franc and the data-dented pound.(Dollar surges vs G10 FX: https://reut.rs/2rcDMiF)
""Provided the Fed conveys a steady-as-she-goes approach and it isn't seen to be back tracking - and there is no reason from the data why it should - the dollar should be consolidating and pushing on from this level,"" said Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) senior currency strategist Neil Mellor.
He added that the key change has been the move of the U.S. Treasury bond yield to 3 percent last week.
It was nudging up at 2.96 percent on Tuesday, which also left the gap between U.S. and German 10-year benchmark bond yields just off its widest level in nearly three decades. [GVD/EUR] The dollar has surged over 3 percent in the last two weeks.
""It has been a bit like a dam bursting,"" Mellor said of the Treasury move.
For Europe's stocks followers, only London's FTSE and Denmark's bourse were open. (EU)
They were both higher though, thanks to the boost to exporters of lower domestic currencies, upbeat results from oil giant  BP  (LON:BP) and relief that Trump hadn't pushed ahead with his steel and aluminium tariffs for now at least.
U.S. stock futures were barely budged ahead of the New York open (N). Overnight in Asia, Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.2 percent while Australian shares hit seven-week highs as its huge metals sector also breathed easier.
Apple’s quarterly results are due after Wall Street closes and will be a big focus after several weeks of speculation about ebbing smartphone demand based on selective reports from companies in its supply chain.
Technology sector results so far – at least from the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Samsung (KS:005930) and SAP – have broadly beaten forecasts for Q1 and the overall aggregate U.S. earnings growth is tracking seven-year highs of almost 25 percent.
""Earnings have been really strong so far, Microsoft and Amazon had a bumper quarter. The only concern has been Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),"" said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities.

1315,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>","China securities regulator imposes fines for false accounting, stock manipulation: Xinhua","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's top securities regulator has fined one firm for illegal disclosure of information, as well as some individuals for market manipulation in cases involving over 70 million yuan ($11.05 million), state news agency Xinhua reported on Tuesday.
The fines are the latest from the China Security Regulatory Commission (CSRC) indicating increased stock market supervision. In mid-March, the regulator imposed a record 5.5 billion yuan fine in a case of stock manipulation.
In the latest cases, the CSRC fined Shenzhen-listed software and hardware maker Geeya Technology Co Ltd (SZ:300028) 600,000 yuan for forging contracts and accounting to inflate 2014 profit by over 80.49 million yuan. It also issued a formal warning and fined managers, including Chairman Zhou Yonghui.
Zhou apologized for the firm's misbehavior during an online news conference held shortly after receiving a CSRC penalty notice.
The CRSC also revealed three cases of stock-price manipulation in 2015.
Feng Zhihao made 18.02 million yuan in profit by manipulating the prices of 10 shares, including Venustech Group Inc (SZ:002439), through multiple trades after false reporting at limit-up and limit-down points, the regulator said.
Meng Xianglong made 16.21 million yuan in profit by disrupting stock prices for Aviation Sanxin Co Ltd (SZ:002163), the regulator said.
The CSRC confiscated the gains and fined Feng and Meng 36.04 million and 32.42 million yuan respectively.
Representatives of neither Feng nor Meng could be reached for comment.
The CSRC imposed a 1.8 million yuan fine on Wen Gaoyongquan, chairman of Hunan Zhongyi Media Co Ltd. It also fined another three people 1.8 million yuan for dispersing incorrect information aimed at raising stock prices.
Hunan Zhongyi Media could not be reached for comment.
The securities watchdog also made a penalty decision for a case of trading with undisclosed information but did not reveal details of the case.

1316,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>",Euro's boom spells corporate gloom for region's exporters,"By Alasdair Pal and Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - A strong euro has helped U.S. companies extend their sales outperformance over Europe to multi-year highs in the first quarter, according to Reuters data - though experts expect the trend to begin to reverse later this year.
Renewed confidence in the European economy and persistent weakness in the dollar have driven the euro up 16 percent against the U.S. currency from the first quarter last year to the end of March 2018.
That means euro zone companies reporting first-quarter earnings for 2018 have seen dollar revenues shrink by roughly a sixth in a year. 
Some 74 percent of companies on the U.S. S&P 500 that have reported in first quarter have beaten analysts' estimates for sales, compared with just 22 percent on Europe's Stoxx 600, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/.
The spread between the two is the highest since I/B/E/S/ began collating comparable data in the first quarter of 2011.
(Graphic: Euro boom hurts continent's exporters - https://reut.rs/2JGfoNp)
Exporting heavyweights  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn),  Renault  (PA:RENA), Continental (DE:CONG) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) have all reported hits to their results from the strong euro in the last week.
Euro zone exporters suffer from a strong currency as they make large chunks of their sales and revenues in foreign currencies, which are then worth less when translated back into euros.
The rising euro also results in higher costs and a pressure to raise prices, potentially making exporters less competitive.
Daimler (DE:DAIGn) said the strong euro would dampen revenue growth this year, while Sanofi said a stronger euro had a negative effect of 8.3 percent on sales in the first quarter. [nL8N1S40Z4]
Euro zone industrials, and consumer cyclicals, sectors dominated by exporters, have been delivering weaker than expected first-quarter revenues, Reuters data shows, with some of the biggest negative earnings surprises.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said currency effects were to blame for a disconnect between earnings growth beats and stocks' performance. 
""We believe this has been a direct consequence of investors' concerns about FX downgrades causing further downside risks to earnings,"" they said. 
Some of the region's biggest drinks makers all said the strong euro would crimp profits.
 Heineken  (AS:HEIN) said the strong euro would wipe 200 million euros ($247 million) off operating profit this year based on current exchange rates. In mid-February, it had put the figure at 190 million euros. [nL8N1RV1JR]
 Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) also increased its estimate of the euro's negative impact, to 200 million from its previous estimate of 180 million, and  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) said foreign exchange movements would knock 17 to 18 million euros off full-year operating profit. [nL8N1RV1PM] [nL8N1RW0TB]
Overall each 10 percent move higher in the euro takes around 6 percent off earnings per share (EPS),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said, and 70 percent of the time the euro has strengthened, euro area equities have underperformed in local terms. 
The strong euro is also part of the rationale for some brokers recommending investors shift from the more cyclical parts of the market to defensives, as cyclical sectors are both more exposed to global growth and to the negative currency effect.
The worst could be over for Euro zone exporters, however.
The biggest upward surge in the euro was in the second quarter last year when French President Emmanuel Macron was elected, and Q2 earnings will thus be compared with a higher euro base a year ago.
In addition, the euro has fallen from its mid-February peak, suggesting the pressure could ease.
Analysts at JP Morgan said while the U.S. is strongly outperforming Europe in terms of sales delivery in the first quarter, ""the worst of the Euro headwind happened in Q1, and in the second half positive sales surprises should shift from the U.S. to (the) Euro area."" 
Some investors were reluctant to make any bets on a reversal of the currency effect, however, arguing the euro alone could not be responsible for the extent of Europe's underperformance of the United States.

""For us it's neither here nor there. Even net of any currency effects European markets have been a bit disappointing in the last year or so,"" said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management.

""We received the notice and are reviewing it,"" the justice ministry official said, declining to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
Elliott is seeking an investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) that allows a company from one country to bring arbitration proceedings directly against the country in which it has invested.
The dispute stems from 2015 when Elliott took on the Samsung Group, Korea's biggest ""chaebol"" family conglomerate, to oppose the $8 billion merger of two Samsung affiliates but lost that battle.
Elliott served the South Korean justice ministry a notice of intent in mid-April seeking arbitration of the dispute, the official said, a step before filing with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, a forum to resolve such cases. 
A South Korean media representative for Elliott had no immediate comment. 
Earlier on Tuesday, the Korea Economic Daily newspaper Elliott argued in its dispute notice that it had suffered investment losses because of the merger.
More recently, the New York-based Elliot set its sights on reforming the Hyundai Motor Group, pressing the South Korean auto giant to adopt a holding company structure and improve returns to shareholders.

Under that pressure Hyundai announced last week a plan to cancel $890 million worth of its own ""treasury"" shares, its first stock cancellation in 14 years.

(Reuters) - Plane maker  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Tuesday it will buy aerospace parts company  KLX Inc  (O:KLXI) for about $3.2 billion in cash to expand its aircraft services business.
The $63-per-share deal gives KLX an enterprise value of $4.25 billion, including about $1 billion of net debt.
The acquisition is contingent upon the successful divestment and separation of KLX's Energy Services Group business, KLX said.
KLX stock has risen about 24 percent since Dec. 22, when the company said it will review strategic alternatives including a potential sale.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said last week its services growth would be complemented by strategic acquisitions.
The plane maker said there will be no change to its 2018 guidance or capital deployment strategy and expects annual cost savings of about $70 million by 2021.
Last year, Boeing launched a global services business which announced deals worth nearly $1 billion in February to capture more of the higher-margin services and spare-parts revenue.
KLX will be part of Boeing Global Services and will be merged with Aviall, Boeing's parts, equipment and services unit.
The combined business will provide a one-stop-shop that will benefit its supply chain and customers, said Stan Deal, chief executive of Boeing Global Services.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) advised KLX on the deal, while Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP was its legal counsel.

The Wall Street Journal reported the deal on Friday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) $10 billion purchase of Walmart's (N:WMT) Asda may pressure UK grocery prices and make the British market less attractive for newer players such as Amazon.com (O:AMZN). 
The  Sainsbury  deal to buy Asda, announced on Monday, comes as retailers on both sides of the Atlantic grapple with heightened competition from the discounters such as Germany's Aldi and Lidl and e-commerce giant Amazon. 
The marriage of Britain's second- and third-largest grocers will not immediately impact Amazon's food offering which remains small in Britain. The biggest impact will come away from the grocery aisle, in the area of general merchandise, where Amazon and Sainsbury's already go head-to-head.
Britons are among the world's most comfortable online shoppers. About 22 percent of non-food purchases are already done online, the highest percentage for any country aside from South Korea, according to Shore Capital analyst Clive Black. He estimates that Amazon has about 40 percent of that market.
""The UK is a very important market in terms of Amazon's international ambitions ... and will remain an important market,"" Black said. ""This proposed merger makes it a little bit more competitive, but I don't think Jeff Bezos will be losing sleep over it."" 
Amazon is Britain's largest online retailer overall, with 30 percent of the market, according to Euromonitor, followed by eBay (O:EBAY) with 11 percent and Sainsbury's with 7 percent. 
ADDING SCALE, REDUCING PRICES
Sainbury's significantly boosted its online presence with the 2016 acquisition of general merchandise chain Argos, which expanded Sainsbury's product line to over 90,000 non-food products from computers to garden furniture to wedding rings.
Argos will get a big boost from the combination with Asda, as Sainsbury's plans to install branches of the chain inside Asda stores. 
The deal will also add scale to Sainsbury's non-food offerings, especially in clothing. Asda's George brand and Sainsbury's Tu brand will together become a larger No. 2 player, by volume. 
The merged Sainsbury and Asda chains will also seek to bolster their online business, using its enlarged footprint of stores and warehouses to deliver products faster and over a wider area. 
Aside from the pricing pressure on suppliers that would come in any retail consolidation, Sainsbury's said it aimed to reduce prices by around 10 percent on everyday items, easing the burden on Britain's shoppers. 
Sainsbury's said about 350 million pounds of the 500 million pounds of synergies it has identified will come from eliminating pricing discrepancies between the two chains. 
AMAZON'S AMBITIONS
Amazon sent shockwaves through the retail industry when it agreed in June 2017 to buy U.S. upscale grocer Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) in a $13.7 billion deal. Since the merger closed in August, Amazon has cut grocery prices, added lockers for picking up online orders in stores and started selling its suite of Echo gadgets in stores, too.
But in Britain, the food market is about 60 percent controlled by the top five players  Tesco , Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrison's (L:MRW) and Aldi [ALDIEI.UL]. 
Amazon is testing AmazonFresh, which offers same-day delivery but its overall share of the market however, remains tiny. 
""Sainsbury's and Asda are very aware of a potential Amazon acquisition in the UK supermarket industry, which is why they are looking for scale in order to safeguard their future,"" said Philip Benton, a consultant at Euromonitor.
 Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Laith Khalaf said the combination of Sainsbury's and Asda, and the pricing pressure that comes from it, could make the UK slightly less attractive for Amazon, but didn't think it would be a deal-breaker. 
""It raises a question mark probably for anyone who is thinking of entering the market,"" Khalaf said. ""We're not entirely sure to what extent Amazon is committed to the UK grocery market, but this may give it pause for thought."" 
He noted however that Amazon's size, scale and profitability allow Amazon to often forego immediate concerns around profitability. 
""They're usually willing to take a hit if they think there's a long-term game they can win,"" he said. 
The deal perhaps ""will amp up the potential of a store strategy"" for Amazon, said Tom Furphy, former vice president of consumables and AmazonFresh, and now chief executive of Consumer Equity Partners. ""But they tend to not be reactive to competition in favor of focusing on their own innovation.”
Investec analysts said the UK was already one of the most consolidated grocery markets in the world, pointing to Tesco's (L:TSCO) acquisition of wholesaler Booker, which closed in March, Co-op's proposed takeover of wholesaler Nisa, and last year's collapse of wholesaler Palmer & Harvey.
If Amazon wanted to buy another UK grocery retailer, the only one it probably could not buy, according to Shore Capital's' Black, would be Sainsbury's, because of the non-food overlap. Tesco would fit well, he said. 
However not everyone predicts Amazon will buy another brick-and-mortar retailer, given its business model revolves predominantly around e-commerce and they will have learned some important lessons already from the purchase of Whole Foods. 
""They got something out of the Whole Foods deal, which gave them a brand, credibility in the food space and knowledge of the food supply chain,"" said investment banker Shaun Browne of Houlihan Lokey. ""I think they will feel that's what they need, and after buying Whole Foods they don't really need the purchase of a Tesco or Sainsbury's.""

Amazon declined to comment, and Walmart did not immediately return a request for comment.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 06:22PM ET</span>",Benefit of Trump tax cuts overshadowed by technology and misplaced policies: Milken conference speakers,"By Liana B. Baker and Anna Irrera
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The windfall gains from the tax cuts passed by the U.S. Congress in December have brought back ""animal spirits"" that encourage risk-taking throughout corporate America, according to some of the participants at the annual Milken Institute Global Conference in California on Monday. 
“Tax reform in the United States has led to, frankly, a number of companies flush with cash and looking for their opportunity to use their balance sheets to affect significant change in their market places as exhibited by two of the big mergers in telecom and energy announced” in the last 24 hours, Robert Smith, founder and CEO of private equity firm Vista Equity Partners, said at a panel discussion.
Late Sunday, T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp said they had agreed to a $26 billion all-stock merger and believed they could win over skeptical U.S. regulators because the merger would create thousands of jobs and help the United States beat China in creating the 5G next generation mobile phone network.
Also on Monday, Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) agreed to buy rival Andeavor for more than $23 billion in the largest-ever tie-up between U.S. oil refiners, giving the combined company a nationwide presence and increased access to growing export markets.
Michael Corbat, the chief executive officer of  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), was also positive about the economic outlook and said the Trump tax cuts have yet to filter through to many businesses.
“The benefits of tax reform aren't yet fully into our economy. Not yet fully appreciated in terms of the intermediate impact they can have,” he said.
U.S. Representative Kevin McCarthy, the leader of the Republican-majority in the House, said the tax cut bill has been a huge boost for Americans. 
""We’ve watched the growth of America expand. People are talking about 3.0 percent growth, we haven’t seen that in quite some time,"" McCarthy said, adding that Americans have received pay raises and bonuses. 
However, rapidly changing technology is providing challenges for many U.S. businesses and may be driving populist political policies which are undermining the business confidence generated by the U.S. tax cuts, conference speakers said.
Jim McCaughan, chief executive officer at Principal Global Investors, said technological advances are resulting in poor job prospects for some of the world’s population, but politicians are in denial about this and are mistakenly blaming immigration and free trade. As result, the onus is on business leaders to re-train workers, he said. 
People “feel angry in part because the reason for their displacement and the lack of good job prospects isn’t the foreigner, the trade, the immigrant, it’s actually technology. And that is why re-skilling is so important"", he said.
One example of the uncertainty created for U.S. business by misplaced policies is President Trump's tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. The exemptions from the tariffs for some countries expire on Tuesday, but it was still not clear on Monday which U.S. allies would get their exemptions renewed.
The uncertainty resulting from technological changes is also making it hard for chief executives to plan ahead, Vista's Smith added.
“It’s pretty reasonable to project a strategy for the next 12 months but frankly when you start talking about three to five years, it gets really murky really fast,"" he said. 
""CEOs are expected to not only understand technologies that didn’t exist one or two years ago but to make strategic decisions as to which investments to make, and the pace of these changes have staggering consequences if you get it wrong,"" he said.
""The CEOs I talk to have never been more excited and never been more paranoid at the same time,"" Smith said.  
Another concern for businesses is rising U.S. interest rates.
Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, warned that Trump’s tax cuts could trigger more interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. “We are coming in the United States to a point where the stimulus and fiscal policy put in place in Washington is colliding with monetary policy.”

Minerd said: “Volatility is going to pick up.”

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 05:31PM ET</span>",VW's Skoda shifts some SUV production to Germany,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) Czech division Skoda said it will shift some production of sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) to Germany to meet growing demand for its models.
Executives at Europe's largest automotive group and its Czech subsidiary have been looking at ways to boost output at Skoda, including building a new factory outside the brand's Czech home, to help it keep up with booming demand, company sources told Reuters in March.
On Monday, Skoda said it will assign some production of its latest Karoq SUV to a Volkswagen (VW) plant in Germany's northwestern town of Osnabrueck starting at the end of this year and in 2019 to meet high demand for the model.
The VW factory in Osnabrueck, which also builds the Porsche Cayenne SUV, will paint and assemble the Skoda Karoq, but the move will only be temporary with the bulk of Karoq production set to remain in the Czech Republic, Skoda said. 
Volume brand Skoda has blossomed under nearly 30 years of VW ownership to become one of the German group's profit drivers, even beating luxury brand Audi's (DE:NSUG) operating margin, thanks to cheap labor and to VW's cost-saving modular platforms. 
Skoda's superior car reviews and profitability repeatedly caused tensions within the VW group as the core namesake brand grapples with costs for the ""Dieselgate"" scandal while pushing painful restructuring involving thousands of job cuts. 

Last year, VW managers and labor representatives were seeking to curb competition from Skoda by moving some of its production to Germany and make the Czech unit pay more for shared technology, sources told Reuters.

1335,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",China's HNA drops bid to buy Scaramucci's SkyBridge due to regulatory hold-up,"By Koh Gui Qing and Julie Zhu
(Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate HNA Group has dropped its bid for most of SkyBridge Capital, a hedge fund investment firm founded by U.S. President Donald Trump's former aide Anthony Scaramucci, as the deal was still stuck with U.S. regulators after more than a year.
Scaramucci, who was White House communications director for 10 days last year, will return to SkyBridge as co-managing partner to focus on strategic planning and marketing efforts, the two companies said in a statement late on Monday.
The deal's termination extends the list of unsuccessful acquisitions by Chinese companies in the United States, at a time when Trump is trying to pressure China's government to be more accommodative on trade issues which he deems uneven.
It also comes as regulators worldwide increase scrutiny of debt-laden HNA after a $50 billion acquisition spree over two years sparked interest in its opaque ownership and use of leverage. The firm has since seen some pending deals collapse.
HNA announced its intention to buy the majority of SkyBridge in January 2017. The terms were never made public.
The two companies aimed to close the deal within six months subject to approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes foreign purchases of U.S. assets to protect national security interests.
In a joint statement, the pair said it was no longer in their interests to pursue the deal as significant time had passed and due to the ""uncertain timing"" of the approval process. 
SkyBridge and HNA Capital, a unit of the financial services-to-aviation conglomerate, now plan to explore the development of a ""mutually beneficial marketing and distribution arrangement"" of SkyBridge's offerings in China.
INCREASED SCRUTINY
CFIUS has been tightening scrutiny of Chinese companies' acquisitions of American companies under the Trump administration, with the HNA-SkyBridge deal becoming latest high-profile victim.
In January, CFIUS rejected Ant Financial's [ANTFIN.UL] application to buy money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc (O:MGI) citing national security concerns.
HNA and SkyBridge in their statement said CFIUS had ""offered a path to approval subject to certain mitigation,"" without elaborating on mitigation measures.
Two people familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter, said CFIUS had declined to accept HNA's application to review the deal.
One of the people said the refusal was because HNA kept changing details of its ownership.
A call to Scaramucci late on Monday New York time was not answered. CFIUS could not be reached outside of regular business hours.
Earlier this year, Reuters reported, citing a person familiar with the matter, that the U.S. government would not approve any investment by HNA until the group provided adequate information on the identity of its shareholders.
In a separate statement, an HNA Group spokesman who declined to be named said the deal failed to close because the companies had withdrawn their request for a CFIUS review.
""This does not mean that CFIUS declined to clear the transaction on national security grounds,"" the spokesman said. 
ACQUISITION SPREE
HNA is currently restructuring operations and selling assets to raise cash, partly to repay debt.
Since the start of 2018, it has agreed to sell over $10 billion worth of real estate in Australia, New York and Hong Kong, along with shares in  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), and  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc (N:HLT).
New Zealand's Overseas Investment Office (OIO) blocked an attempt by the group to buy a vehicle finance firm in part due to doubts about the debt-laden conglomerate's financial stability, documents showed this month.
In July, a $416 million investment in U.S. in-flight services firm Global Eagle Entertainment Inc (O:ENT) was abandoned after failing to clear CFIUS' review process.
HNA's bid for SkyBridge, founded by Scaramucci in 2015, was part of a strategy to build a global asset management business.
SkyBridge had about $10 billion in assets under management or advisement as of February. Its investment offerings include commingled funds of hedge fund products, customised separate account portfolios and hedge fund advisory services.

SkyBridge will continue to be led by current senior management, the statement showed.

A raft of top-tier economic data kicks off the new month as investors look ahead to ISM manufacturing and employment data, while the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) is slated to get its two-day meeting underway.
Economist forecast the U.S. ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index due 10:00 am ET to show a reading of 58.6 for April, slightly lower than the 59.3 reading seen in March. While the ISM Manufacturing Employment Index is expected to show a reading of 57.0.
The FOMC two-day meeting, meanwhile, is slated to get underway ahead of an interest rate decision on Wednesday. Inflation has neared the central bank’s target of 2% in the run up to the interest rate decision. Yet, the central bank is widely expected to leave rates unchanged.
Upbeat inflation, however, failed to support a rebound in U.S. bond yields as the 10Y US Treasury yield remained below 3%.
The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies on Monday, supported by an ongoing slump in both GBP/USD and EUR/USD.
2. API Data to Show a Surprise Build for Second Straight Week?
Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) due Tuesday after data last week showed an unexpected build in U.S. crude stockpiles.
The American Petroleum Institute reported last Tuesday crude oil stockpiles rose by 1.099 million barrels. The Energy Information Administration’s weekly report, however, showed a build of 2.170 million barrels, nearly double the API figure.
Crude oil futures settled higher on Monday but pared some gains heading into settlement despite the growing prospect of new U.S. sanctions against Iran.
3. Apple Earnings Eyed
Shares of Apple closed higher ahead of the release of fiscal second-quarter earnings on Tuesday as investors cheered reports that the iPhone maker is set to announce a bumper share buyback programme.
Sentiment on Apple's earnings , however, remained largely negative after a slew of downgrades from analysts, warning investors that the firm’s flagship Model X iPhone, which fetches prices upwards of $1,000, is set to report subdued performance.
In anticipation of weaker iPhone sales - which makes up the about 62% of group sales - Apple is reportedly set to soften the blow by buying back up to $100 billion of shares.
Apple is expected to report earnings of $2.70 per share on $61.19 billion in revenue.
Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed at $165.26, up 1.81%."

German companies typically ask shareholders to approve the actions of their boards over the previous year at the annual shareholder meetings. Votes against the boards' actions amount to a vote of no confidence but are largely symbolic.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 03:31PM ET</span>",February volatility 'hurricane' upended VIX-linked trading,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The February volatility shock may be receding in the U.S. stock markets' rear-view mirror, but it has dramatically altered VIX-land - the market where traders place bets on volatility via products linked to the VIX, the stock market's so-called ""fear gauge.""
U.S. equity investors spent 2017 cocooned in one of the most tranquil periods in history, with some investors selling volatility via VIX-linked products to pad returns.
The first real spike in volatility in years threw these products into disarray. Some were terminated. Others saw their heft diminished. Overall trading in VIX products fell sharply.
It ""feels lame,"" said Matt Thompson, co-head of Typhon Capital LLC's volatility group in Chicago, who actively trades VIX futures, options and VIX-linked exchange traded products (ETPs). ""Like all the air has been sucked out.""
Over the last month, average daily trading volume in first- and second-month VIX futures, the most active VIX contracts, slumped by nearly a quarter from the six months ahead of February's spike. VIX options volume is down 29 percent. 
""There definitely seems to have been, like, this line between pre- and post-February 5,"" said Thompson.
Growing interest in trading in volatility in recent years gave birth to more than two dozen volatility-linked ETPs aiming to provide exposure to stock market swings. They provided a big boost to VIX futures trading.
Some ETPs were long volatility, gaining in choppier markets, while a clutch of inverse-VIX products benefited from calm.
Since these products either directly held VIX futures or used them for hedging, they boosted open interest, said Vance Harwood, who runs the alternative investment website Six Figure Investing and has studied VIX ETPs extensively. 
In 2017, U.S. stock market volatility fell to a five-decade low and yield-seeking investors rushed to sell insurance against stock market turmoil as a way to boost returns.
This was particularly evident in the short VIX-linked products. Assets under management at two of the largest of these, the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN  and the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (P:SVXY), grew to a record $3.5 billion in January, according to Thomson Reuters data.
THE CHANGING VOL-SCAPE
Traditionally, buy-side positioning in VIX futures had been shaped by investors betting on where volatility would be in future months. The rush of money into XIV and SVXY changed that.
""There was a misunderstanding in the market that trading in XIV and SVXY was because people wanted to be short volatility,"" said Stuart John Barton, portfolio manager at Invest In Vol, an investment adviser in Stamford, Connecticut.
In truth, lots of investors were short volatility just to pocket the gain from selling financial insurance, Barton said.
Lincoln Edwards, head of Austin-based Houndstooth Capital Management, likened it to selling insurance on beach-front property. It is easy money as long as conditions remain calm.
""The average Joe saw there's money to be made in this, didn't fully understand the risks and started selling insurance. A hurricane came along and now they are out of business,"" he said.
The ""hurricane"" hit Feb. 5 when U.S. stocks fell 4 percent and the VIX rocketed 20.01 points, its largest one-day move ever. 
Given the VIX's low level beforehand, the percentage gain in the futures was huge - 96 percent. That torpedoed the short-VIX ETPs, which lost nearly all their value in a day, a fate they'd dodged during the VIX's previous big upheaval in 2015 because the index was not nearly so low ahead of time.
The XIV was terminated and the SVXY cut its daily-move parameter from a 1-to-1 inverse relationship with VIX futures to a 1-to-2 target. The number of open VIX futures contracts has plunged 43 percent from late January.
""It absolutely changed the way I think about the space,"" said Houndstooth's Edwards. ""You don't have that market force out there balancing and putting pressure on the short side."" 
The net position for asset managers or institutional players, leveraged funds and other traders, who together are described as the 'buy-side,' has swung to a net long 47,969 contracts, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission positioning data through April 24. 
While that is down from the record high of 73,351 contracts the week before, these players had been net short 21,613 contracts ahead of February's upheaval.

""That market force that has driven volatility for a long period of time has disappeared almost entirely,"" said Stefan Wintner, vice president, Volatility Strategies at Dunn Capital Management.

1341,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 03:01PM ET</span>",JPMorgan Allowed to Deal in Indonesia Bonds After Ban Lifted,"(Bloomberg) -- Indonesia reappointed JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). as a primary dealer of sovereign bonds, more than a year after banning the U.S. bank from doing business with government entities.
The bank was included in a list of 20 banks and securities firms enlisted by the government as primary dealers of bonds, Finance Ministry said in a statement in Jakarta on Monday. JPMorgan’s reinstatement is effective from May 2, the ministry said.
JPMorgan’s reappointment comes amid an exodus by foreign investors from the nation’s stocks and bonds, as a tumbling currency increases the odds of an interest rate hike. President Joko Widodo’s government snapped ties with JPMorgan in January last year after it downgraded the nation’s equities by two notches. While the bank subsequently upgraded Indonesia’s stocks, the government maintained the ban.
“The reappointment of JPMorgan could be a strategy by the government to better attract international investors and to create higher appetite for Indonesian assets during volatile times like this,” said I Made Budhi Purnama Artha, head of treasury at PT Maybank Indonesia. “Before the ban, JPMorgan was one of the players, along with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), with significant market making in the U.S.”
Private Clients
The return of JPMorgan as a dealer of bonds may also open doors for it to be appointed as an underwriter of sovereign bonds overseas and securities issued by the state-owned enterprises. While the U.S. bank missed out on being part of the government’s fund-raising program for 16 months, it continued to serve its private clients in Indonesia, where it provides investment and commercial banking services.
JPMorgan’s reappointment followed an application made by the bank in February after the one-year ban ended, said Luky Alfirman, director-general for budget financing and risk management at the Finance Ministry. “JPMorgan is now committed to follow all rules,” he said.
The bank believes “a primary dealer license will strengthen our ability to service our clients who invest in Indonesia more effectively,” Li Anne Wong, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan in Singapore, said.
Research Curbs
In the days following the crackdown against JPMorgan, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati’s ministry ordered primary bond dealers to uphold the nation’s interests and maintain relations with the government that are “based on professionalism, integrity and avoiding conflicts of interest.” The move was seen as an attempt to gag critical research as violation of the rule meant underwriters risked losing their dealership licenses.
Indonesia’s rupiah is trading near a 27-month low even after aggressive interventions by the nation’s central bank as investors exit emerging markets amid higher U.S. Treasury yields and a stronger dollar. The rout in the currency has now extended to the nation’s stocks and bonds.
Indonesia’s government is set to borrow a total of 856.5 trillion rupiah ($62 billion) this year with about 80 percent of it likely to be raised through the sale of bonds and sukuks in the local market and the rest from a combination of dollar, euro and samurai bonds overseas, according to finance ministry data.

Trudeau told reporters in Vancouver he was confident the administration of President Donald Trump understood that such tariffs would hurt jobs in the United States as well as Canada.
Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum in March but granted temporary exemptions to Canada and Mexico that run out on May 1. Canada is the biggest supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States.
""We have been discussing this with the U.S. administration and letting them know it would be a very bad idea to disrupt (the) very complex trade between Canada and the United States when it comes to steel and aluminum,"" said Trudeau.
Trump has said the tariffs on Canada and Mexico could be suspended if enough progress is made at negotiations to update the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement. Top-level talks are due to resume on May 7.

""We've made significant progress over the past weeks and we continue to work hard ... there is positive momentum but as we all know, it won't be done until it's done,"" said Trudeau.

1369,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Britain's crime agency to expand probe into HBOS fraud allegations,"By Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's National Crime Agency is expanding a review into fraud allegations at HBOS, part of Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY), that have already led to the jailing of six people in a scam that pushed business owners to hire a costly turnaround consultancy.
The NCA said on Monday it was following up a request from Thames Valley police, who conducted the investigation that led to the original convictions, with a view to a wider investigation into allegations of fraud and money laundering.
A spokesman for Lloyds said the bank welcomed the fresh review and would cooperate fully.
The NCA said its review would look into allegations falling outside the scope of the original investigation, and that it should take six months. 
The NCA also said the allegations included asset stripping, through the use of corrupt consultants as well as allegations of fraud and money laundering. The sums of money involved could be significant, running to many millions, it said.
The Agency said the review would determine whether a full criminal investigation was needed.
The initial investigation and prosecution was completed in January 2017 and related to a scam conducted between 2003 to 2008. HBOS became part of Lloyds during the financial crisis.
Lloyds has unveiled a 100 million pound compensation scheme for victims of the fraud, who had complained the bank reacted too slowly to their complaints.
The six jailed for their involvement in the original scam were sent to prison for a total of 47-and-a-half years, among the toughest sentences handed out for high-profile, white collar fraud in Britain in recent years.
The bankers had asked struggling business owners to employ a turnaround consultancy as a condition for getting a loan and they were then obliged to pay the consultancy high fees for services and, in some cases, hand over ownership.

At 9:39AM ET (13:39GMT), the Dow Jones rose 143 points, or 0.59%, the S&P 500 gained 12 points, or 0.45%, while the Nasdaq Composite traded up 32 points, or 0.44%.
A busy week for earnings, with 145 S&P 500 firms reporting, started off on the right foot Monday. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) saw shares surge 4.7% after the fast-food giant reported a 5.5% increase in global same store sales, easily topping estimates for a 3.9% rise.
A series of multi-billion dollar deals also boosted investor sentiment on Monday. Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) agreed to buy oil refiner Andeavor (NYSE:ANDV) for around $23 billion.
Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) formally announced a merger in a deal worth approximately $26 billion. The all-stock transaction represents a total implied enterprise value of approximately $59 billion for Sprint and approximately $146 billion for the combined company.
Over in the UK, Walmart’s (NYSE:WMT) British unit Asda and Sainsbury’s (LON:SBRY) confirmed they had agreed a £15 billion ($20.6 billion) merger to create Britain's biggest supermarket group by market share, surpassing current leader  Tesco  (LON:TSCO). The sale of Asda marks Walmart’s operational exit from the UK although the U.S. retail giant will maintain a 42% share in the new company.
Meanwhile, consumer spending and inflation data released earlier on Monday matched expectations. Personal spending picked up to a 0.4% gain in March, doubling the rise seen in the previous month.
While inflation data included in the report accelerated, with the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index and PCE deflator rising to 1.9% and 2.0%, respectively, stock markets seemed to take the increase in stride.
Minutes of the prior Fed meeting on March 20-21 showed that policymakers had forecast the move due to soft comparisons in 2017 and that those effects would not “by itself, would not justify a change in the projected path (of monetary policy)”.
The Fed is not expected to make a move on interest rates at the end of its two-policy meeting starting on Tuesday. Markets are currently pricing in the next hike for the June meeting with follow-up increase in September. A third move in December is currently a coin toss.
Still ahead on Monday, the Chicago purchasing managers’ index for April and March pending home sales will be released at 9:45AM ET (13:34GMT) and 10:00AM GMT, respectively."
1381,By Business Insider,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 09:38AM ET</span>","How Goldman Sachs, UBS, and more reacted to Walmart's $10 billion 'Black Swan' deal to sell Asda","LONDON — UK supermarket Sainsbury's on Monday confirmed a surprise deal to buy rival Asda from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in a $10 billion (£7.3 billion) transaction.
Sainsbury's will pay Walmart £2.9 billion ($3.9 billion) in cash and give the retail giant 42% of shares of the combined business under the terms of the deal, valuing Asda at $10 billion (£7.3 billion).
The merger has taken the City largely by surprise. Analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) dubbed it a ""black swan"" deal on Monday, referencing finance professor Nassim Nicholas Taleb theory of unexpected and difficult to predict events in markets.
While the transaction may not have been predicted, analysts have been quick to dissect the terms of the deal and what they mean for participants and the wider market.
Most analysis focuses on the trouble the deal could face with UK competition regulators, what the merger means for Walmart, and how it would affect the UK grocery market.
Here's what Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), UBS, Barclays and more are saying:
Goldman Sachs analyst Rob Joyce and team: ""We estimate Asda represents 6% and 5% of WMT’s global revenue and EBITDA (FY18), respectively, and 23% of its international revenue. We estimate that Asda is the largest piece of WMT’s international portfolio outside of the Americas, and its third largest overall, behind Mexico and Canada.
""We note that though Asda accounts are not presented, Sainsbury states that Asda EBIT for FY17 fell to approximately £720 mn from £845 mn (-15%).""
UBS analyst Daniel Ekstein: ""It's hard to paint this as anything other than positive for shoppers (lower prices, better ranges, more flexible options) and the deal terms look attractive for shareholders too. The proposed merger is expected to generate net synergies of £500m/annum, after having made 'significant price investment' across the combined business (management references c.10% price cuts on KVI's).
""Food retail is a scale industry, where size drives efficiency across the value chain. Market share of the pro-forma combined entity would double to c.31%, leapfrogging current leader  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) at c.28%. Purchase price alignment accounts for £350m of the total synergies, whilst Argos concessions in Asda underpin £75m and reduced opex a further £75m.""
Bernstein's Bruno Monteyne and Brandon Fletcher: ""There is lots of talk of the ""CMA since Tesco/Booker"" assuming that something changed in the way the CMA looks at such deals. We dispute that: the CMA took the only possible conclusion in line with its remit. Therefore local competition, within 10 to 15 minutes' drive time, remains the key driver of store disposals. We think the potential gamble will depend on how the CMA treats discounter stores. In the past they were largely excluded (as being too small and therefore not a comparable one-stop shop).
""57% of Asda stores have large SBRY store within 12.5 mins drive time, leading to ~15% of store disposals. If they can convince CMA to include discounters, then it could be ~8%. This is a bold gamble. This deal could easily unravel acrimoniously if the CMA sticks to its old rules and parameters. At 13% store disposals, the deal would stop being accretive.
""The price of bad execution is huge. Morrisons-Safeway lost 28% of their sales through a combination of store disposals (9%), integration problems and culture clash. Cultures and retail propositions at SBRY & Asda are very different and therefore the execution risk seems much higher than the smooth Ahold-Delhaize merger."""
1382,By Business Insider,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 09:35AM ET</span>",Sprint sinks as regulatory uncertainty weighs on its T-Mobile merger,"Shares of  Sprint fell as much as 12% in early trading Monday amid growing concern the wireless carrier's proposed its merger with T-Mobile in a deal that values the combined company at $146 billion may not pass regulatory scrutiny.
T-Mobile USA CEO John Legere made the announcement by tweeting a seven-minute video breaking down the merger, while also including a link to a website further explaining the combination. Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) owns two-thirds of T-Mobile, and will control the newly formed entity.
The announcement on Sunday marks the culmination of  four years of on-again, off-again discussions between T-Mobile and Sprint — and was the third time the two rivals had tried to merge.
With 127 million customers between them, the two newly teamed companies are expected to compete directly with Verizon— the nation's number one carrier — and second-place AT&T (NYSE:T). That's where the concern comes in. 
For evidence that the deal which will combine the third- and fourth-largest US wireless carriers, is expected to come under serious scrutiny from antitrust regulators that, one need not look further than how fervently the Trump administration has opposed AT&T's proposed mega-acquisition of Time Warner.
In November, the US Department of Justice sued to block AT&T's proposed $84.5 billion takeover of the cable giant. President Trump himself said on the campaign trail in October 2016 that such deals would result in ""too much concentration in the hands of too few,"" and ""deals like this destroy democracy.""
However, Sprint and T-Mobile face a different challenge. While AT&T's proposed merger was a so-called ""vertical"" deal, in that the two firms aren't direct competitors and the new company would be vertically integrated to combined film/TV production with distribution, T-Mobile and Sprint are direct competitors and consumers will have one less competitive choice if the deal goes through.
""I think it's very hard to imagine DOJ just giving this deal a pass, given how much it would increase concentration in key segments of the wireless market,"" Gene Kimmelman, former DOJ official and CEO of Public Knowledge, told Axios.
T-Mobile and Sprint's proposed deal involves T-Mobile exchanging 9.75 Sprint shares per unit of T-Mobile. Deutsche Telekom will own 42% of the combined company, while SoftBank — which controls 85% of Sprint — will own 27%. The remaining 31% will be held by the public.
Sprint's stock has surged 26% since the Wall Street Journal reported on April 10 that the two companies had rekindled merger talks. T-Mobile's stock has risen 8% over the same period.
The all-stock transaction values Sprint at 0.10256 per T-Mobile share, or $6.62 a share, based on T-Mobile's last closing price. That valued Sprint at around $26 billion. T-Mobile had a market value of $55 billion as of Friday's close, and the two companies have roughly $60 billion of combined debt.
Shares of Sprint are up 9% since the beginning of 2018, while T-Mobile is flat year-to-date.

1383,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 09:31AM ET</span>",Corporate America Is Saving Boatloads on Trump Tax-Cut Windfall,"(Bloomberg) -- America’s companies are swimming in cash thanks to the big cut in the corporate tax rate.
The roughly 180 companies in the S&P 500 Index that have reported results saw their effective tax rate drop by 6 percent on average in the first quarter. That saved them a total of almost $13 billion in taxes, an analysis by Bloomberg shows. About a third of that went to 44 financial firms.
What companies are doing with that boatload of money is a bit muddy. Some analysis shows spending on capital expenditures is surging. That would confirm President Donald Trump’s insistence that the cut would boost investment.
But lots of cash is also still going to buybacks that have anchored the U.S. stock market’s unprecedented run since the recession. Many firms also need more dough to pay for increasing labor and transportation costs.
Here are some of the early winners of the tax law, which reduced the federal corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. To measure how much money a company saved, Bloomberg applied the 2017 tax rate to this year’s first-quarter pretax income, and then compared the number to 2018 results.
“We view the passage of U.S. tax reform as an important business driver for companies like ours,” AbbVie Chief Executive Officer Richard Gonzalez said last week in a conference call. “Tax reform is having the intended impact.”

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 01:17PM ET</span>","McDonald's serves up quarterly beat on higher global sales, U.S. spending","By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) blew past analysts' forecasts for profit and revenue on Monday, helped by higher sales in overseas markets and as U.S. customers spent more at its outlets.
Shares of the world's biggest fast food chain by revenue rose more than 5 percent as global same-restaurant sales topped Wall Street forecasts, driven by the strength in mature markets especially the United Kingdom and Germany. The stock was also the top gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI).
The results underscore the success of Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook's multi-year turnaround plan launched in 2015 to refresh McDonald's menus, add more technology to stores and make outlets more welcoming for customers.
New changes also included adding more high-margin ""gourmet"" burgers, which use fresher and more expensive ingredients and cost $6 or $7, and new $1 to $3 value options. 
Same-restaurant sales in its most profitable market, the United States, rose 2.9 percent and topped analysts' expectations on higher average check tallies that was propelled by consumers opting for $1-$3 value menu items, while also adding more expensive burgers.
""The value price menu does bring people in, but people tend to spend more ... people still want a number of key McDonald's items like the Quarter Pounder and the Big Mac,"" Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said.
McDonald's and other fast food chains have been concentrating on drawing customers with cheap options as they battle for a bigger share of a pie that is not growing. 
But a weak initial consumer response to the company's $1-$3 menu prompted McDonald's to offer a 2 for $4 ""mix & match"" deal on breakfast sandwiches to thwart intense competition in the all-day breakfast category, Easterbrook said on a post-earnings analyst call.
Customer visits in the U.S. declined, but rose notably in Japan, France, Australia and Canada leading to an overall traffic rise of 0.8 percent. 
Global sales at stores open at least 13 months rose 5.5 percent, easily topping an average estimate of 3.94 percent. 
""(This) shows the power of the brand ... globally the numbers were outstanding,"" Peter Saleh, an analyst with brokerage BTIG, said. ""The results were very impressive, actually more impressive than we initially had anticipated.""

Excluding items, McDonald's earned $1.79 per share, beating the estimate of $1.67. Revenue fell 9 percent compared to a year ago, as it sold more McDonald's-owned outlets to franchises to cut costs, but beat estimates.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's stock exchange, the world's sixth largest, was back in business on Monday after a hardware glitch abruptly ended trading on Friday and the exchange operator TMX Group (TO:X) said it was working to ensure there will be no repeat of the embarrassing market disruption.
The shutdown was only the second to hit TMX in a decade, but it could potentially encourage investors to explore alternative trading channels, fund managers and traders said.
""It was truly an unprecedented event,"" TMX Chief Executive Lou Eccleston told Reuters in an interview on Monday.
""We understand exactly what happened, so there's no mystery to that,"" he said. ""We've got everything in place, including additional monitoring.""
Eccleston did not identify the maker of the defective hardware, saying only that TMX was working closely with the company to prevent anything like what happened on Friday from recurring.
Trading resumed on Monday at 9:30 a.m. (1330 GMT) after the outage ended Friday's session more than an hour before the official close. The benchmark Canada stock index (GSPTSE) ended down 0.4 percent. TMX shares fell 2.4 percent.
TMX Group, which operates the Toronto Stock Exchange and smaller Canadian trading platforms, said in an email sent to clients over the weekend and seen by Reuters that the outage was caused by a hardware failure in a communications management component. TMX had earlier ruled out a cyber attack.
""An outage like Friday's is very embarrassing for the TMX,"" said Michael Sprung, president of Sprung Investment Management. ""Their focus will have to be on not succumbing to another outage in the near future that would be catastrophic reputationally and would result in a loss of market share to other exchanges,"" he added.
The Ontario Securities Commission has declined to comment on whether it was conducting an investigation of the outage, after saying on Friday that it was in contact with TMX.
""We're in constant contact with the regulators,"" Eccleston said. ""They know everything (that is) going on. They know our action steps,"" he added.
The TSX, which has been buoyed recently by higher oil prices, edged up to a nearly six-week high at the open as financial and industrial shares gained. After a slow start, trading picked up towards the end, with some 202 million shares changing hands, compared with average daily average volume of 195 million shares in April.
""I think it is acting pretty well today,"" said Greg Taylor, portfolio manager at Purpose Investments. ""Month ends are usually the quietest day of the month because a lot of funds are precluded from trading on them,"" he added.
The saving grace for TMX, which has been vying to host Saudi Aramco's mega IPO overseas listing, was that the glitch occurred on a low-volume trading day and on a Friday, giving the operator the weekend to resolve the issue.
""So far everything seems to be going fairly well, no one has said anything about trades failing or the bid-asks aren't in line, so it looks like the open has been pretty good,"" Taylor added.
Jos Schmitt, chief executive of rival operator NEO Exchange, said the market went dark when the outage occurred. ""There is a lack of real-time market data in Canada and Friday's events demonstrate this is a big problem,"" he added.
Outages can inconvenience investors and prove expensive for the exchanges themselves. Many of Canada's blue-chip stocks are also traded on U.S. stock exchanges, however, giving investors another avenue. 
TMX's exchanges in Canada, which also include the Toronto Venture Exchange, TSX Alpha Exchange and the Montreal Exchange, account for about 61 percent of trading, according to official data.
Canada's last major trading outage occurred nearly a decade ago, when a system fault linked to data feeds shut down trading for a full day in December 2008.

""Stuff happens from time to time,"" said Matt Skipp, president of SW8 Asset Management. ""If it happened on an epic down day, it would be far more concerning for professionals.""

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 10:56AM ET</span>","Allergan CEO opposes fundamental shift in strategy, shares dip","By Michael Erman and Manas Mishra
(Reuters) - Allergan Plc's (N:AGN) chief executive on Monday said he was opposed to fundamental changes to the drug company's business strategy, even as its board considers drastic moves like splitting the company, selling off assets or doing deals to turn around a steep drop in its share price.
Botox maker Allergan's shares fell 2.2 percent to $158.42 in early trading on Monday. They have lost more than a third of their value over the last year.
The company announced a strategic review of its business earlier this year. Allergan has hired multiple advisers, CEO Brent Saunders said on a conference call following the company's quarterly earnings. It is considering five options: deploying capital to buy back shares, doing divestitures, splitting the company, making acquisitions, or continuing to operate Allergan as is.
Investors hoping for a major shift in strategy may be disappointed.
""Running the company in large part as it exists today is not only an option, but also the baseline against which all options need to be considered,"" Saunders said on the call, noting that his preliminary view was that a fundamental shift was unnecessary. ""We're not going to execute an activity that doesn't recognize the full inherent value of our assets at Allergan.""
Allergan did not bid for  Shire  Plc (L:SHP) earlier this month, after confirming reports that it considered an offer for the rare-disease treatment specialist.
Saunders said in an interview that large transformational deals are a ""very low priority and a very unlikely outcome"" of the review.
BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED EARNINGS
Allergan reported a better-than-expected first quarter profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast, driven by higher sales of its medical aesthetics products including blockbuster wrinkle treatment Botox.
Sales of Botox, its biggest drug by revenue, jumped 14.5 percent to $817.3 million in the quarter.
The company's aesthetics unit posted a near 30 percent jump in sales.
U.S. Sales of Allergan's eye drug, Restasis, which is expected to face competition from cheaper drugs, fell 17.2 percent. 
The company now expects 2018 adjusted earnings of $15.65 to $16.25 per share, slightly above its previous forecast of $15.25 to $16 per share.
Its net loss was $332.5 million, or 99 cents per share, compared with $2.63 billion, or $7.86 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, Allergan reported a profit of $3.74 per share, topping analysts' average expectation of $3.36, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Total revenue rose 2.8 percent to $3.67 billion, topping analysts' average estimate of $3.59 billion.

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 10:04AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Volkswagen in talks to manage Didi fleet, co-develop self-driving cars","By Aditi Shah and Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), the world's biggest automaker, is in talks to form a joint venture with China's Didi Chuxing to manage part of the ride-hailing company's fleet of cars and help develop ""purpose-built"" vehicles for Didi's services.
As part of the deal between Volkswagen and China's biggest ride-hailing service, expected to be signed early next month, the German automaker will initially manage a fleet of about 100,000 new vehicles for Didi, of which two-thirds will be Volkswagen Group cars, said a senior executive at the carmaker.
Volkswagen will also jointly buy some new cars with Didi to allow the Chinese company to expand its fleet. The two eventually plan to collaborate to design and develop dedicated vehicles, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the details are still private. 
The executive did not give financial details of the deal but said that Volkswagen will get a slice of the revenue once the venture develops. 
The growing popularity of ride-hailing services for commuting and running errands in congested cities such as Beijing and Shanghai is showing early signs of reducing private car ownership. This could have serious consequences for existing carmakers and is forcing companies like Volkswagen to reinvent their businesses and seek out future revenue streams.
""To succeed as a car company in this new ecosystem, we need to know who our customer is, what their journey is and what our strategy should be,"" the executive said. 
He added that this deal will eventually give Volkswagen access to some of Didi's massive trove of data on customer behavior collected through the 3 million rides Didi provides in China each day.
The ultimate goal is the production and use of autonomous cars, the Volkswagen executive said.
RIDING ALONE
Volkswagen's partnership with Didi is the first known project Didi has begun pursuing as part of a broad alliance the Chinese company recently formed with 31 automakers and parts suppliers. 
Didi has said it formed the alliance to collaborate on, among other things, eventually developing cars purpose-built for its services. 
For instance, as many as 80 percent of Didi customers ride alone and don't need a big four-seater car, the Volkswagen executive said.
And current vehicles have engines and other technology that allow them to go as fast as 150 mph (250 kmph). Dedicated ride-sharing vehicles would always travel much slower, so they would not need to be aerodynamic or have a powerful engine. That could allow for fewer seats and more room for luggage.
Didi has also predicted much of its future fleet would be electric. The company has begun working with Chinese carmakers GAC Motor and CHJ Automotive to design electric vehicles, sources have told Reuters. [nL3N1S13XC]
Three Didi officials said the ultimate shape of a new ride-sharing market is still unclear and no one knows what role car manufacturers and Didi itself will play in it.
Open questions for Didi are how to repair, maintain and direct a fleet of autonomous vehicles, one of the officials said. 
""Our understanding right now is that probably automakers don't know 100 percent how to do all that. Didi also doesn't know either,"" the official said.
A spokesperson for Didi said both sides were still working out the details of how the partnership would look.
""Potentially, both parties will focus on building together a fleet operation business, and look into other potential areas such as designing new car models for ride-hailing,"" the spokesperson said.
The Didi officials did not want to be named because they are not authorized to talk to reporters.
After years of resistance and efforts to keep technology-based ride companies at arm's length and vowing never to be like contract manufacturers are to the mobile phone sellers, carmakers are becoming more flexible.
The car industry fears becoming like Taipei-headquartered electronics company Foxconn (TW:2354), which manufactures millions of phones for the likes of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) but only gets a slim share of the profits in return.
This year, automakers like  Fiat  (MI:FCHA), Jaguar Land Rover and Honda Motor (T:7267) entered into an agreement to provide thousands of cars to Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) self-driving unit, Waymo. Last year Volvo (ST:VOLVb) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) said they would supply cars to Uber.
VW'S WAR CHEST
Volkswagen lags its rivals Daimler and BMW (DE:BMWG) in embracing the transformation but has recently stepped up its efforts. 
It has created a war chest of 15 billion euros ($18.2 billion), which it plans to use for investments in ride-hailing, autonomous driving, digitalization, electric mobility and other services in China by 2022.
It has already invested in an artificial intelligence firm called Mobvoi, a car-sharing company Shouqi and a second-hand car buying company. Volkswagen is also in talks to invest in a luxury ride-hailing company and an electric car charging business, the executive said.
Once Volkswagen has access to customer data, it will be able to make better-informed decisions on future businesses and products. 
""We will explore additional business models with Didi,"" the executive said, adding that these may not necessarily be focused only on China. Volkswagen is internally discussing bus and truck sharing.
""We don't need to have all the answers. The money we plan to put into the first phase should help us find some,"" he said.
The executive did not say whether the new cars provided by Volkswagen would be electric, hybrid or gasoline.

1406,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. EPA grants biofuels waiver to billionaire Icahn's oil refinery - sources,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Chris Prentice
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has granted a financial hardship waiver to an oil refinery owned by billionaire Carl Icahn, a former adviser to President Donald Trump, exempting the Oklahoma facility from requirements under a federal biofuels law, according to two industry sources briefed on the matter.
The waiver enables Icahn's  CVR Energy Inc  (N:CVI) to avoid tens of millions of dollars in costs related to the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. The regulation is meant to cut air pollution, reduce petroleum imports and support corn farmers by requiring refiners to mix billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation's gasoline and diesel each year.
The Small Refiners Coalition, which represents companies that operate small refining facilities, said the EPA is required by law to help small refineries struggling with these regulations and that such exemptions are crucial to their financial well-being. It applauded EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt for protecting small refineries, regardless of ownership, from the RFS requirements.
But the exemption for CVR's Wynnewood, Oklahoma plant prompted criticism from a corn state lawmaker and the powerful corn lobby, which has already accused Trump's EPA of overusing the hardship waiver program in a way that hurts demand for ethanol.
""Hundreds of millions - and in some cases billions - of dollars in profits isn't my definition of 'hardship,'"" Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said in statement condemning the CVR waiver. ""President Trump promised to support home-grown biofuels, and Administrator Pruitt is breaking that promise.""
""This one's going to be hard for Pruitt to explain,"" Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council industry group, said in an email.
EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said that the agency does not comment on specific refineries. ""But, what I can tell you is that the criteria used to grant waivers has not changed since previous administrations,"" Bowman added.
CVR spokeswoman Brandee Stephens declined to comment regarding the waiver. Efforts to reach Icahn and his attorney for comment were not successful.
An early supporter of Trump's 2016 presidential run and a key supporter on Wall Street, Icahn had met with Pruitt when Pruitt was being vetted in late 2016 for the EPA administrator job, according to news reports at the time.
Icahn stepped down from his position as special regulatory adviser to the Republican president last August after lawmakers cited potential ethical problems in his dual role as an adviser and an investor.
Icahn is currently under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department for his role in influencing biofuels policy while serving as Trump's adviser. Some U.S. lawmakers have expressed concern that Icahn may have used his presidential access to benefit his investments, a charge Icahn has rejected.
The EPA has said it has granted more than two dozen waivers for 2017 but has declined to name the recipients.
Under Trump's Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, the EPA granted about eight waivers annually. 
Records show CVR had been denied on at least one occasion. The Small Refiners Coalition said the Obama administration had wrongly denied waivers to firms like CVR.
Reuters has reported that Andeavor (N:ANDV), one of America's biggest refining companies, which reported about $1.5 billion in net profit last year, was among the other companies that have received hardship waivers from Trump's EPA for its small refineries.
BLENDING CREDITS
To prove RFS compliance, refiners must earn or purchase tradable blending credits - awarded by the government for each blended gallon of fuel - and hand them in to the EPA yearly.
The EPA has the authority to exempt small refineries of under 75,000 barrels per day from the requirement under the hardship waiver program if they can prove that compliance would cause them ""disproportionate financial hardship.""
With the exemption, CVR would not have to turn over the credits related to the Wynnewood facility for 2017, according to the two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The waiver was granted in recent months but the sources did not say precisely when.
The Trump administration has encouraged small refiners to apply for the hardship waivers. A surge of applications has come to the EPA since a 2017 court ruling that the agency had used too narrow a definition of ""financial hardship"" under Obama.
The waivers have the potential to save companies tens of millions of dollars, by allowing them to avoid blending or paying for credits on the open market and by permitting them to sell any credits they have on hand to others.
CVR has reported a $23 million profit in the biofuels credit market in the first quarter of 2018 due to what it called a lower RFS obligation, an unusual return for a refiner that has no biofuel blending facilities.
The company also said it expects its cost of complying with the RFS requirements to fall to $80 million for the entirety of 2018 from a previous estimate of $200 million, and from roughly $249 million in 2017.

1407,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>","Heavy flows into Saudi to continue, Mideast funds say","By Andrew Torchia
RIYADH (Reuters) - Middle East fund managers intend to pump more money into Saudi Arabian equities in coming months, despite concern about rich valuations, because of Riyadh's expected entry into emerging market indexes next year, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.
Foreign investors turned net sellers of Saudi stocks last week for the first time this year, according to exchange data. The Saudi stock index (TASI) is up 13.8 percent this year, trading at over 16 times corporate earnings - higher than most other emerging markets.
But the monthly poll of 13 leading regional fund managers, conducted over the past week, showed they believe capital inflows into the kingdom are unlikely to slow significantly.
Thirty-eight percent expect to raise allocations to Saudi equities in the next three months and 8 percent to reduce them. In the previous poll, 46 percent expected to increase Saudi allocations and 23 percent to cut them.
Much of the optimism is based on expectations that equity index compiler MSCI will decide in June to upgrade Saudi Arabia to emerging market status, after FTSE Russell decided last month to do so with effect from March 2019.
""The continuing liquidity flows have and are likely to provide strong support to the Saudi market,"" said Sachin Mohindra, portfolio manager at Abu Dhabi's Invest AD.
He predicted the Saudi banking sector, heavily weighted in the market, would benefit from rising interest rates while the kingdom's privatization program, formally launched this month, would attract long-term investors.
Managers also cited strong oil prices, with Brent crude (LCOc1) near $75 a barrel, and the fact that foreigners still own only 5.1 percent of the Saudi market.
""Current foreign ownership of the market is miniscule compared to that of mainstream emerging markets and only a handful of global funds are invested in the market,"" said Vrajesh Bhandari, portfolio manager at Al Mal Capital in Dubai.
The fund flows into Saudi Arabia have come partly at the expense of other markets in the region, particularly those in the United Arab Emirates.
""There was a clear rotation in the past few weeks of fund flows from UAE and towards Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent Qatar. We expect this trend to continue in the coming months,"" said Talal Samhouri, head of asset management at Amwal in Doha.
The latest poll showed managers split on the prospects for UAE stock markets, with 31 percent expecting to raise allocations and the same ratio intending to reduce them.
Just as rich Saudi valuations are one reason for caution in Saudi Arabia, low valuations in the UAE are attractive to some managers.
Major Saudi real estate firm Dar Al Arkan (SE:4300) is trading at more than 28 times earnings over the past 12 months, for example, while Dubai blue chip Emaar Properties (DU:EMAR) is barely above seven times.
Saudi Arabia is the sixth best-performing market in the world, and ""this has been partly at the expense of Dubai, which is languishing down 10 percent this year and is the world’s fifth worst-performing market,"" said Akber Khan, head of asset management at Al Rayan Investment in Doha.
He added, ""Despite a sluggish local economy, a number of blue chips in Dubai now represent extreme value, and patient investors entering at these levels will likely be richly rewarded.""

1408,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 07:01AM ET</span>",Marathon to Buy Andeavor in $23.3 Billion Oil-Refining Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC). agreed to buy rival oil refiner Andeavor for $23.3 billion, in a deal that could create the largest independent fuel maker in the U.S.
The offer, payable in either cash or shares, values Andeavor at about $152.27 a share, the companies said in a statement on Monday. That’s about a 24 percent premium over Friday’s closing price. The Wall Street Journal first reported the acquisition on Sunday.
“This transaction combines two strong, complementary companies to create a leading U.S. refining, marketing, and midstream company, building a platform that is well positioned for long-term growth and shareholder value creation,” Marathon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gary Heminger said in a statement on Monday.
Marathon’s geographic footprint is focused in the U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast, while Andeavor’s refineries and pipelines are in western states. They are among the biggest beneficiaries of the shale boom, as the rapid growth in oil production has given them access to abundant supplies at a discount to global prices. Independent operators also reaped fatter profits from the recent overhaul of the U.S. tax code, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of oil refiners reached an all-time high last week.
The CEO expects annual cost and operating synergies of about $1 billion within the first three years. Given projected cash-flow generation, Marathon’s board also approved share buybacks of $5 billion.
The boards of both companies unanimously approved the deal, which is expected to close in the second half of this year, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.
Greatest Capacity
Findlay, Ohio-based Marathon Petroleum is the third-largest U.S. refiner by market capitalization, valued at about $38.6 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. San Antonio, Texas-based Andeavor, formerly known as  Tesoro  Corp (NYSE:ANDV)., is the fourth-largest, worth $18.7 billion. Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) is the largest U.S. independent refiner, valued at $51.9 billion.
Heminger’s counterpart at Andeavor, Gregory Goff, will become executive vice chairman.
The combined company would also overtake  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO). to become the biggest in terms of U.S.-based oil refining capacity. At almost 2.93 million barrels a day, that’s about 16 percent of the nation’s total, according to Bloomberg calculations using Energy Information Administration data as of Jan. 1, 2017.

1409,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 06:53AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Move Higher at Start to Key Week for Data and Earnings,"Investing.com - U.S. futures pointed to a slightly higher open on Monday as investors looked ahead to a busy week for economic data and earnings.
The blue-chip Dow futures gained 99 points, or 0.40%, by 6:50AM ET (10:50GMT), the S&P 500 futures added 9 points, or 0.32%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 34 points, or 0.50%
After Wall Street ended the past week flat to lower - S&P 500 ended barely changed, while the Dow and the Nasdaq lost 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively - traders looked set to start Monday off to the upside.
The two major focal points on this week’s economic calendar will be on the Fed’s monetary policy decision to be announced on Wednesday along with the publication of the monthly employment report on Friday.
In the first case, the Fed is not expected to make a move on interest rates, though market participants will keep a close eye on the statement for any clues on the central bank’s current outlook for monetary policy. Markets are currently pricing in the next hike for the June meeting with follow-up increase in September. A third move in December is currently a coin toss.
With regard to the employment report, the consensus forecast is that the data will show jobs growth of 185,000, after adding 103,000 positions in March, while the unemployment rate is forecast to dip to 4.0% from 4.1%.
However, most of the focus will likely be on average hourly earnings figures, which are expected to rise 0.2%, following a gain of 0.3% a month earlier. On an annualized basis, wages are forecast to increase 2.7%, the same as the rise seen in March.
Ahead of those two key appointments for the week, investors will likely focus Monday on the publication of personal income and spending for March at 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT), which includes the core personal consumption expenditures inflation data, the Fed's preferred metric for inflation.
In other data out Monday, the Chicago purchasing managers’ index for April and March pending home sales will be released at 9:45AM ET (13:34GMT) and 10:00AM GMT, respectively.
While waiting for the reports, the dollar continued its upward trend against a basket of the other major currencies on Monday. The dollar index climbed 1.37% last week, boosted by rising U.S. yields and the prospect of a faster pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year.
Meanwhile, gold headed lower on Monday as a stronger dollar dampened demand from holders of other currencies and geopolitical concerns eased further, lessening the precious metal’s appeal as a safe haven. South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s spokesmen said on Sunday that North Korea would shut down its main nuclear test site in May. The news came after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un pledged “complete denuclearization” at a meeting with Moon on Friday.
On the earnings front, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and Loews (NYSE:L) were among a handful of earnings to be released on Monday.The week will be busy with 145 S&P 500 firms publishing quarterly reports, although Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will likely steal the spotlight when it reports quarterly earnings after Tuesday's closing bell. The iPhone-maker's stock has been slammed in recent weeks due to worries over slowing phone sales and is now down more than 4% for the year and more than 10% from its all-time high.
In M&A news, Sprint and T-Mobile formally announced a merger in a deal worth approximately $26 billion. The all-stock transaction represents a total implied enterprise value of approximately $59 billion for Sprint and approximately $146 billion for the combined company.
Shares in Sprint (NYSE:S) tumbled more than 11% in premarket trade Monday, while T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) shares were off around 1%.
Over in the UK, Walmart’s (NYSE:WMT) British unit Asda and Sainsbury’s (LON:SBRY) confirmed they had agreed a £15 billion ($20.6 billion) merger to create Britain's biggest supermarket group by market share, surpassing current leader  Tesco  (LON:TSCO). The sale of Asda marks Walmart’s operational exit from the UK although the U.S. retail giant will maintain a 42% share in the new company.
Europe’s major bourses posted slight gains as companies delivered strong earnings figures.
Earlier, Asian markets closed mostly higher although trading was subdued with Japan and China closed for a holiday.
Lastly, in commodities, oil prices slumped around 1% on Monday as markets reacted to yet another rise in U.S. drilling for new production. U.S. drillers added five oil rigs in the week to April 27, bringing the total count to 825, energy services firm Baker Hughes said in its closely followed report on Friday.
That was the highest number since March 2015, underscoring worries that escalating U.S. output could derail OPEC’s efforts to reduce the global supply glut.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sainsbury's is to buy Walmart's Asda for around 7.3 billion pounds ($10 billion) in a bold attempt to overtake long-time leader  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) as Britain's biggest supermarket group by market share.
If it gets regulatory approval, the biggest British deal in the sector for more than a decade will see the second and third-largest food retailers in the country join forces, sparking speculation of further consolidation.
Sainsbury's and Asda aim to generate savings and buying power to better compete with fast-growing discounters, Aldi and Lidl, a bigger Tesco after its recent 4 billion pounds purchase of wholesaler Booker, and the rise of online shopping, particularly the march of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Monday's cash and share deal also provides a potential exit for Walmart (NYSE:WMT), as Asda, which it bought in 1999 for 6.7 billion pounds, has struggled over the last five years.(UK grocers' market share: http://tmsnrt.rs/2cZQkWZ)
Analysts said the deal was a bet that seismic changes in retail would ease any regulatory fears and some speculated that Morrisons and the Co-operative, respectively Britain's No. 4 and No. 6 players, could respond.
""The most aggressive response by Morrisons would be a bid for Sainsbury's,"" Jefferies analyst James Grzinic said.
Although Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it was likely to review the deal, Sainsbury's shares jumped as much as 21 percent, hitting their highest since July 2014, and closed up 14.5 percent. Shares in Tesco and Morrisons closed down 1 and up 1.3 percent respectively.
Sainsbury's said the deal would deliver a double digit rise in earnings by the second full year post-completion, generate synergies of at least 500 million pounds and enable prices to be lowered by about 10 percent on many products.(Britain's biggest supermarket stocks: https://reut.rs/2JFk1qV)
FAST TRACK REQUEST
Walmart will receive 3 billion pounds in cash and a 42 percent stake in the combined business, valuing Asda at 7.3 billion pounds on a debt-free basis. Sainsbury's equity was valued at 6 billion pounds at Friday's close.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe, who used to work for Asda, Chairman David Tyler and finance chief Kevin O'Byrne will retain their positions in the merged company. Asda CEO Roger Burnley, who worked at Sainsbury's for a decade, will continue to run the Asda business, which will retain its brand.
Coupe said ""the world has changed and there is more competition than ever,"" since Morrisons' takeover of Safeway in 2004 - the sector's last mega deal.
""One thing I can say with certainty is that the CMA will not ask us to close stores. The CMA may or may not ask us to sell stores,"" he said, adding they would be sold as trading entities.
Analysts said buyers could be hard to find. ""We see no chance of it getting through the CMA without a major dismemberment of the combined business,"" Peel Hunt analyst Charles Hall said, adding Morrisons was the only viable buyer of a large chunk.
The surprise decision by the CMA to unconditionally clear the Tesco/Booker deal has encouraged Sainsbury's and Asda to believe they could get a viable transaction through and Coupe wants the CMA to fast track to a ""phase 2"" examination so that the deal can be completed in the second half of 2019. 
EXECUTION RISK
Together, Sainsbury's and Asda have around 2,800 stores, more than 330,000 employees and a combined market share of 31.4 percent versus Tesco's 27.6 percent, according to market researcher Kantar Worldpanel. 
The two have different cultures and appeal to different customers, with London-based Sainsbury's strong in own-brand products, and Asda, headquartered in Leeds, northern England, focused on price. There is, however, a significant overlap in Northern Ireland.
Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne pointed to the execution risks, noting Morrisons-Safeway lost 28 percent of their sales through a combination of store sales, integration problems and culture clash when they merged.
Some 350 million pounds of the planned synergies would come from buying savings, and 75 million from putting branches of Sainsbury's general merchandise specialist Argos into Asda stores. Sainsbury's bought Argos in 2016 for 1.1 billion pounds.
After a two-year lock-up period, Walmart is allowed to reduce its stake in the combined group to 29.9 percent, and after four years could exit completely.
Walmart International boss Judith McKenna said the firm, which will take two seats on the board of the combined business, will be a long term partner.
The Qatar Investment Authority, currently the largest shareholder in Sainsbury’s with a 22 per cent stake, said it supported the deal.
A break fee equal to 1 per cent of Sainsbury's market capitalization is payable on both sides.
Sainsbury's also reported its full-year results, showing a first rise in profit in four years and expressed confidence in meeting analysts' profit forecasts for 2018-19.

1414,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 06:02PM ET</span>",U.S. judge mulling compromise decision on AT&T-Time Warner deal,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The judge who will decide if AT&T (NYSE:T) will be allowed to buy movie and TV show maker Time Warner indicated on Monday that he could be considering a decision that wasn't a clear approval or blocking of the $85 billion deal.
In his closing remarks, U.S. Justice Department lawyer Craig Conrath asked for the planned transaction to be stopped. ""Consumers will be worse off and that's why this merger ought to be blocked,"" he said. In the absence of blocking it, Conrath urged the judge to consider a divestiture, or asset sale.
Judge Richard Leon asked about the possibility of imposing a remedy, like saying the deal could go forward if the companies sell a particular asset. Conrath said that if the judge found the deal to be anti-competitive then he could impose a fix or a remedy. 
In his summation, Daniel Petrocelli, speaking for AT&T and Time Warner, argued against any ruling that would, for example, require AT&T to sell DirecTV, which has more than 20 million subscribers, in order to purchase Time Warner. ""That is an effort to kill the deal,"" he said.
Leon said that he would likely have a decision on June 12.
The judge's decision will guide dealmakers on how aggressive they can be with 'vertical mergers', where one company buys another in the same industry but operating at a different point in the supply chain. Regulators approve the vast majority of vertical deals.
'FAILURE OF PROOF' 
In his closing remarks, Petrocelli argued that the government had failed to prove that the merger was illegal because they had not shown that it would lead to higher prices.
""We have a complete failure of proof,"" he said at one point. He argued that the deal would mean half a billion dollars per year in price decreases for pay TV subscribers. 
He also criticized a report by economist Carl Shapiro, who has testified that the deal would cost consumers more money because AT&T would have the incentive to withhold Time Warner content like CNN or March Madness basketball from pay TV rivals, both pricey cable companies and cheaper online startups.
And Petrocelli argued that an arbitration offer given by AT&T would take away much of the power to raise prices. In hopes of preventing a court fight, AT&T proposed that for seven years it would submit to third-party arbitration any disagreement with distributors over the pricing for Time Warner's networks and promise not to black out programming during arbitration.
In his final argument, the Justice Department's Conrath told the court that AT&T's Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, who said it was ""absurd"" that they would withhold content from competitors, also wrote an email to Time Warner's chief executive Jeff Bewkes to complain after Time Warner took a stake in Hulu, a cheaper online competitor.
""'It's hard to imagine how it won't impact all of our relationships,'"" Conrath quoted Stephenson as writing.
Referring to DirecTV, Conrath said that AT&T ""wanted to preserve that 'cash cow' for as long as they can."" DirecTV lost 187,000 traditional U.S. video customers in the first quarter of 2018.
Two key witnesses at the trial were Stephenson and Bewkes, who is retiring if the transaction goes through. Both were present for the closing arguments, and Stephenson shook Petrocelli's hand during a break after his summation.
The two executives argued in the trial that marrying AT&T's granular information about customers with Time Warner's ability to create compelling video would allow the merged company to advertise more effectively, giving it a fighting chance to compete with internet advertising titans like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 05:25AM ET</span>",WPP's Read reviewing structure as results boost shares,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Mark Read, tasked with running WPP (L:WPP) after the sudden exit of founder Martin Sorrell, said he would look at restructuring the world's biggest advertising group but ruled out a break up.
Digital boss Read, appointed joint chief operating officer alongside acquisitions specialist Andrew Scott, said on Monday the company had the tools to respond in an industry facing lower customer spending and technological upheaval.
Quarterly sales were not as bad as feared, boosting WPP shares as much as 9 percent and easing some of the investor pressure on the owner of ad agencies JWT and Ogilvy & Mather.
Analysts have speculated that WPP could sell its underperforming market research arm Kantar as an initial step to start to unwind the empire built up by Sorrell over more than three decades.
Scott said the group would definitely look at disposing some minority assets it holds. 
Read, who was previously on the board for nine years, was speaking as the group reported first-quarter trading figures. Organic net sales slipped only 0.1 percent -- compared with a 1 percent drop that analysts had forecast.
The share jump meant the WPP stock was on course for its best single gain ever and has now regained the losses it incurred when it announced Sorrell's departure on April 14. 
""We are not complacent about what we need to do and we recognize that we need to get the top-line growing more quickly,"" Read told Reuters in an interview. 
""There are structural shifts in the industry and we need to have more of a structural response, (but) we are an industry in structural change, not structural decline.""
WPP, which provides advertising, data and market research to the likes of Ford,  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) and  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) through its 200,000 staff in 112 countries, has been rocked this month by the departure of its founder who launched the company 33 years ago.
HARD ACT TO FOLLOW
Sorrell, who built the company from a two-man outfit in 1985 to dominate the industry, will be a hard act to follow after he never missed a quarterly results session and used them as a platform to discuss everything from advertising trends to geopolitical events. 
Sorrell, 73, quit after an allegation of personal misconduct. WPP did not give any details of the allegation and Sorrell denied the charges.
Investors, and the board, are likely to assess how Read and Scott deal with the presentation to financial analysts on Monday, compared with the smooth Sorrell.
WPP has trailed its peers Omnicom (N:OMC), Publicis (PA:PUBP) and IPG (N:IPG) in terms of growth rates in the last year as it was particularly hit by the lower spending from consumer goods groups such as Unilever and P&G.
It has said it does not expect to grow in 2018, a position it reiterated on Monday. 
The weak performance, combined with the upheaval sparked by the growth of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), has prompted some analysts to question whether WPP should be broken up or at least sell some underperforming divisions such as its market research arm Kantar.
Read declined to comment on a report in the Financial Times that said private equity group CVC had approached WPP about a potential sale of Kantar Media but he said that division needed to do better. 
He added however: ""Even within Kantar it's mainly the custom parts of the business (that is struggling), other parts of the business are doing well."" The custom parts refer to projects carried out for individual clients. 
His comments could point towards a more nuanced approach to the restructuring, selling off bits of assets but not dumping whole divisions within the group.
NO TIMETABLE 
Read, who is seen as a front runner for the CEO job, said it did not make sense to break up WPP but that he and Scott were reviewing all options and will present them to Executive Chairman Roberto Quarta. 
He said there was no timetable for the process. 
""Roberto has asked Andrew and I to look at the strategy and come back as quickly as we can to the board with recommendations,"" he said. 
The trading update is likely to ease some of the pressure on the group. 
The results were boosted by an improved performance in Britain and Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa & Middle East and Central & Eastern Europe. 
""Mark Read and Andrew Scott are providing the stability and leadership WPP requires, but there is no standing still,"" Quarta said. 
""They have my and the board's full backing to review the strategy, to come back to us with recommendations, and to move forward decisively to implement our vision for the group.""

1422,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>","ADIA eyes renewable technologies, long-term returns improve in 2017","By Saeed Azhar and Tom Arnold
DUBAI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), the world's third-biggest sovereign wealth fund, said it may invest more in renewable energy, as climate change fears prompt fund managers even in the oil-rich Middle East to look beyond fossil fuels.
""The world's energy industry is in the early stages of a fundamental shift from fossil fuels to a more sustainable reliance on a range of renewable technologies,"" ADIA said in its 2017 annual review on Monday.
The ADIA's comments show how global sovereign funds are waking up to growing calls from governments to address climate change and to build a low-carbon society in the future.
Two years ago ADIA invested in Greenko Energy Holdings, one of India's renewable energy companies, with Singapore's GIC.
ADIA manages the reserves of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, part of the United Arab Emirates and which produces about 3 percent of the world's oil output.
The fund manages $828 billion in assets, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, making it the world's third- largest sovereign wealth fund.
Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund said earlier this year it will step up its assessment of the risks posed by climate change to its investments in power producers, oil firms and basic materials companies.[nL8N1QH2NK]
ADIA said it conducted a review last year of climate change and its potential impact, in order to assess how markets and governments could respond to this impending transition.
Overall, ADIA's latest review showed that its long-term returns improved in 2017, helped by rising equity markets.
In U.S. dollar terms, the 20-year and 30-year annualized rates of return for the ADIA portfolio were 6.5 percent and 7 percent, respectively.
This compared to 20-year and 30-year annualized rates of return of 6.2 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively, in 2016.
ADIA said 55 percent of assets are managed by external managers.
PRIVATE EQUITY REORGANIZATION
ADIA also said it completed a reorganization of its private equity department last year with a move from a product-focus to regional teams focusing on five industry sectors: financial services, healthcare, industrials, technology and consumer.
During the year, a new head of Asia-Pacific was appointed in addition to sector heads for financial services, healthcare and industrials. Recruiting for the technology and consumer sectors has started, it added.
Late in 2017, the department purchased a significant minority stake in KKR India Financial Services, an alternative credit provider.
This year, the department will continue to deploy capital in line with its strategy of increasing its sector-led investment activity, with a focus on evaluating structured equity opportunities, defensive industries and other private-asset investments, ADIA said.
However, it warned current valuation levels and increasing competition for deals amongst market participants suggests that the industry might enter a period of lower returns than those experienced in recent years.

The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2018, Kingdom Holding said in a statement. Kingdom has a 5.7 percent stake in  Accor  SA.
AccorHotels said earlier it had agreed to buy rival Movenpick Hotels & Resorts for 560 million Swiss francs ($567 million), in a deal which Accor said would boost its earnings and marks the latest example of the French group's ambitious takeover strategy.
Founded in 1973 in Switzerland, Movenpick Hotels & Resorts operates in 27 countries with 84 hotels, and has a strong presence in Europe and the Middle East.
Earlier this year, Kingdom sold its stake in the Four Seasons Hotel in Beirut for around $100-115 million including debt, sources had told Reuters.
Prince Alwaleed, the kingdom's most recognized business figure, was freed on Jan. 27 after being held at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel for three months on the orders of his cousin Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of an anti-corruption crackdown.
Alwaleed, a nephew of Saudi King Salman, is closely watched in international markets because of investments in companies such as  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and Twitter (N:TWTR).

1425,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 01:31AM ET</span>","T-Mobile, Sprint CEOs Turn From Bitter Rivals to Kindred Spirits","(Bloomberg) -- There seemed no love lost between Marcelo Claure and John Legere, a pair of chief executives who sniped at each other incessantly -- on Twitter, at public events, even in ads. But behind the scenes, the two telecoms moguls were bonding around a common cause.
The fruits of that relationship became apparent this weekend, when T-Mobile US Inc. agreed to acquire Sprint Corp. for $26.5 billion. Just months after a previous attempt collapsed under regulatory concerns, Legere and Claure have again driven the No. 3 and No. 4 American carriers together, realizing neither alone can outgun  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ). and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T). in the coming era of blazing-fast fifth-generation wireless.
The deal follows years of back and forth between Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), the German company that controls T-Mobile, and SoftBank Group Corp., Sprint’s Japanese owner. But it was only in the past month or so that Claure really intensified his lobbying, calling SoftBank Chairman Masayoshi Son several times a week to reinforce the urgency of an alliance to take on the industry leaders, according to people familiar with the matter. Legere meanwhile worked on convincing Deutsche to come back to the table, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing the details.
China is now racing ahead on 5G research and investment and the sense was that the Trump administration, distrustful of the Asian power, would be more inclined to green-light a deal than its predecessor, the people said. The market dynamics were also changing: Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA). was steadily gaining broadband users while other cable operators hovered on the margins. With Legere on board -- the two CEOs had begun meeting in person and speaking regularly by phone -- the scene was set for the largest telecoms merger in years.
“We share a common vision on how the network will be built and we realized we need each other to be mega-successful,’’ Claure said in an interview over the weekend. “We can’t build a 5G network without T-Mobile and T-Mobile can’t build it without Sprint.”
The new corporation certainly carries a lot more financial heft -- crucial if it’s to remain competitive in costly 5G infrastructure development. Operating as T-Mobile, it would have about $74 billion in annual revenue and 70 million wireless subscribers. That’s within shooting distance of Verizon’s $88 billion in 2017 wireless revenue and 111 million subscribers, and AT&T’s $71 billion and 78 million.
Under terms of the deal, Deutsche Telekom will end up with a 42 percent ownership stake while SoftBank will have 27 percent. T-Mobile’s Mike Sievert will be president and chief operating officer. The German company’s chairman, Tim Hoettges, will serve in that role at the combined company while Legere becomes CEO, and the board will include Claure and Son.
But it’s Claure and Legere that proved pivotal to resuscitating a deal: the two men had grown increasingly certain they shared the same vision of 5G as the future, the people familiar with the matter said.
“In some fashion the kernel of the thought of why these companies should come together never left either of us,” Legere said in an interview. “This time around I think the realization started with Marcelo and it was more 5G driven.’’
It remains far from certain however if Washington will green-light the deal -- the third time that Son has tried to bring the companies together. Previous negotiations broke down also because the two sides couldn’t agree on control of the combined entity, people familiar with the matter said at the time. They’d dashed a plan to merge as far back as 2014 after meeting resistance in Washington. Regulators said then that four major competitors in wireless fosters more choice, price competition and innovation -- which proved to be largely true.
Sprint and T-Mobile will try to convince regulators that new entrants such as Comcast mean more competition, not less. Claure told analysts on a conference call that Comcast was now adding more wireless users on a net basis than AT&T and Verizon -- combined. The two carriers will thus argue a combination will spur bigger investments in 5G and put pressure on larger rivals, even if the consumer benefits aren’t immediately obvious.
“If Trump wants to see national 5G and the investment with it, then I think the administration can spin a story to support this,” said Chris Lane, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
For Sprint, which hasn’t had a profitable year in more than a decade, the merger is a bailout. The company is four years into a go-for-broke turnaround effort launched when Claure took over and started slashing prices to stop customer losses. And growth at T-Mobile -- one of the more remarkable industry success stories of the past decade -- is slowing.
“This deal is a great example of what we will see more of in the telecoms space. If you look at the capex that will be required as a result of 5G build-out, you need to create more economies of scale,” Steve Krouskos, Ernst & Young’s Global Vice Chairman of Transaction Advisory Services, told Bloomberg Television. “This particular deal will create a strong third player in the U.S. market.”

1426,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 05:16PM ET</span>",Marathon to become top U.S. refiner with $23 billion Andeavor buy,"By John Benny
(Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp (N:MPC) agreed to buy rival Andeavor (N:ANDV) for more than $23 billion in a deal creating one of the largest global refiners that will benefit from access to booming U.S. shale fields and growing U.S. fuel export markets.
The United States has become the world's top fuel exporter, shipping more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline and diesel. Refiners have capitalized on booming output from shale fields in Texas and North Dakota and are building out export terminals and processing facilities.
Buying Andeavor gives Marathon more exposure to the booming U.S. shale oil sector, thanks to Andeavor's existing logistics and terminal operations in Texas and North Dakota shale regions. Rising output from the Permian Basin, the largest oilfield in the United States, has driven the nation's crude production to an all-time record above 10.5 million bpd.
""The combination of the two companies allows us to go after and find ways to create a bigger presence in the Permian,"" said Marathon Chief Executive Gary Heminger, who will lead the combined companies.
The company would be able to process 3.1 million bpd of crude oil into gasoline, diesel and other fuels. That falls short of global giants  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and China's Sinopec (SS:600028), but would be more than majors  BP  Plc (L:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), and leapfrogs  Valero Energy  Corp (N:VLO) to become the largest U.S. refiner, according to company figures.
U.S. motorists consume more fuel than any other country in the world and overall demand nationwide hit a record 9.3 million bpd in 2017. 
Operations that have capacity to refine light crude produced in shale fields such as Andeavor, will be better positioned to take advantage of the production boom. Both North Dakota's Bakken and Texas shale regions primarily produce light, sweet crude oil. 
The deal also gives Marathon a line into fast-growing Mexican fuel markets. Andeavor is expanding its network of filling stations in the country. Mexico's dilapidated refineries cannot meet the growing population's demand for gasoline and other products.
U.S. fuel exports to Mexico rose to 1.4 million bpd as of January, up more than 85 percent from two years ago.
The deal values Andeavor, formerly known as  Tesoro , at about $152 per share, or about 24 percent more than Friday's closing price of $122.38. 
""We view this as pretty full value for Andeavor,"" Scotia Howard Weil analysts said in a note. ""Not many saw this one coming.""
MARATHON SHARES DOWN, ANDEAVOR UP
Shares of Ohio-based Marathon lost $6.52, or 8 percent, to close at $74.91 a share. It also missed Wall Street forecasts for quarterly profit by a wide margin on Monday as expenses rose. 
Shares of Andeavor, based in San Antonio, closed up 13 percent at $138.32. 
Including Andeavor's debt, Marathon is paying $35.6 billion to hold 66 percent of a combined company worth some $58 billion at Friday's close. 
Andeavor operates 10 refineries in the United States, largely in the western part of the country. It has pipeline, trucking and terminal operations in the Permian and in the Bakken region, the second-most prolific state for oil production in the country after Texas. (To see an image from the handout by the companies, click here: https://reut.rs/2JFgc58) 
""This creates one coast-to-coast, border-to-border refining and marketing company that seems well balanced with a pretty broad footprint,"" said Garfield Miller, CEO of Aegis Energy Advisors. 
Marathon's six refineries are largely in the Midwest, with one located in Texas City, Texas. The Midwest region has reduced its reliance on crude oil from the Gulf Coast in recent years, pulling more of its barrels from Canada and North Dakota. Now, it is producing more products than it needs and has looked to export markets for additional opportunity. 
Analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt said they expected the location of the two companies' operations to allow them to avoid antitrust hurdles. 
Combining the companies' logistics subsidiaries will not happen immediately, Marathon CEO Gary Heminger said on a conference call following the transaction. He referred to that combination as a ""day two issue.""
Andeavor is expanding a retail network of motor fuel stations in the Mexican states of Baja California and Sonora under its ARCO brand. 
U.S. Gulf Coast refiners are becoming more integrated in the region's energy industry, filling shortages created by underinvestment in refining across Latin America. 
""There's no question the new company has greater resource capability going forward into Mexico,"" Andeavor CEO Gregory Goff said on a conference call with analysts.
The companies did not spell out Goff's role, but the Andeavor executive said he would likely be involved in operations and technology. Shares traded at about $13 apiece when Goff took the helm at Andeavor in 2010 and have risen nearly ten-fold in the past eight years. 

The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year.

Japan’s market was closed on Monday, Tuesday and Friday this week for Golden Week while China shut Monday and Tuesday.
The official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 51.4 in April, compared to 51.5 in March and the general consensus of 51.3.
The figure is still well above the 50-point mark that suggests expanding business conditions in China, although the softer numbers hinted a loss of momentum in the country’s economy following recent trade disputes with the U.S.
Meanwhile, the official services PMI rose to 54.8 in April from 54.6 in March. The composite PMI that covers both manufacturing and services activities came in at 54.1 in April, versus March's 54.
Discussions between South and North Korea were in focus earlier in the day as South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s spokesmen said on Sunday that North Korea would shut down its main nuclear test site in May.
The news came after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un pledged “complete denuclearization” at a meeting with Moon on Friday.
Kim told Moon that he “isn’t the type of person” to use nuclear weapons, reports on Sunday said. Kim is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in the coming weeks.
The KOSPI traded higher following the development and was 0.8% higher by 1:20AM ET (05:20 GMT).
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index extended its gains from the morning and jumped 1.6% in afternoon trade. PetroChina (HK:0857) profit rose 78% in the first quarter as the country’s largest oil and gas producer benefited from a rally in crude prices, according to an earnings statement. Meanwhile, United Company Rusal (HK:0486) surged 5.1% as Oleg Deripaska reduced his stake in EN+, the largest shareholder in Rusal, to below 50%, He will also resign from the sanctioned firm's board, a regulatory filing in London said.
Down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.6%. The Aussie dollar received modest support from the China PMI data, while traders now turn their attention to the upcoming RBA policy meeting on Tuesday.

1428,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 01:26AM ET</span>",U.S. fast-food price war flares as consumer spending softens,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Cheap fast-food ""dollar"" deals surged in the United States during the first quarter, marking a major shift in strategy as a cool-down in consumer spending sent restaurant chains scrambling for customers.
So-called ""value"" offers have been part of the U.S. fast-food landscape since 2002, when McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) debuted its popular Dollar Menu and gave the industry a reliable recipe for driving traffic.
McDonald's and other major chains deemphasized such deals in recent years, choosing instead to invest in food quality improvements to bolster competitiveness with more upscale brands like  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG) and Chick-fil-A.
Dollar deals roared back in the first three months of this year, when economists estimate consumer spending growth braked to below a 1.5 percent rate. That would be the slowest pace in nearly five years and follows the prior quarter's robust 4 percent growth rate. 
Value menu traffic was up 10 percent for the first three months of 2018, while value menu sales chalked up a 13 percent gain, NPD Group analyst Bonnie Riggs told Reuters.
The results lifted value menu traffic 1 percent for the fiscal year ended March 2018, reversing three consecutive years of declines, according to NPD. 
""It's clear that major restaurant chain operators are pulling out all of the stops to get consumers to visit this year,"" said Riggs, author of a new report titled ""Value Wars 2.0: The Value Menu Strikes Back.""
Restaurants across the spectrum have been battling for a bigger slice of a pie that is not growing. Total U.S. restaurant traffic was flat in calendar 2017.
Yum Brand Inc's (N:YUM) Taco Bell, known for its low-priced food and ""Dollar Cravings"" value menu, appears to have an edge in the latest price war.
It sold a record 53 million orders of its new $1 Nacho Fries in five weeks during the first quarter, contributing to outsized value menu sales gains, NPD said. 
Taco Bell declined comment, citing the quiet period ahead of Yum Brands' financial report on Wednesday.
McDonald's, seeking to win back customers lost after it abandoned its popular but profit-squeezing Dollar Menu in 2013, in January jumped back in with the launch of a $1, $2, $3 value menu.
That menu includes $1 any size soft drinks and cheeseburgers, $2 small espresso drinks and Bacon McDouble hamburgers, and $3 Happy Meals and classic chicken sandwiches. 
Consumer response was initially muted, prompting some McDonald's restaurants to offer a 2 for $4 ""mix & match"" deal on breakfast sandwiches such as the sausage McMuffin with egg. 
McDonald's, scheduled to report quarterly results on Monday, declined to comment. 
Meanwhile, some McDonald's restaurant operators worry about getting lost in a blizzard of competing deals. 
""In 2002 we were one of the few chains discounting ... Today we are just part of the discounting noise,"" one McDonald's restaurant operator was quoted as saying in the latest McDonald's Franchisee Survey from Kalinowski Equity Research.
The fast-food value wars are contributing to an increasingly challenging operating environment, Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (O:DNKN) CEO Nigel Travis told investors last week. 
Dunkin' Donuts franchisees, who were slow to warm to value deals, this month are responding with offers for $2 egg and cheese Wake-up Wraps, $3 egg and cheese English muffin breakfast sandwiches and $5 egg, cheese and bacon breakfast croissants.
Some investors worry that the dollar deals - including the $1 any size drinks and $2 small McCafe drinks from McDonald's - are siphoning business from  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX), which last week posted its second consecutive quarter with no U.S. traffic growth. 

Starbucks, for its part, is adding specials to woo ""occasional"" customers who visit one to five times per month.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares extended gains on Monday as tensions in the Korean Peninsula eased and first-quarter earnings shone, although some investors were cautious about the outlook amid the backdrop of a simmering U.S.-China trade dispute.
Spread-betters pointed to a strong start for European shares with FTSE futures (FFIc1) up 0.2 percent. E-Minis for the S&P 500 (ESc1) gained 0.3 percent while Dow futures (1YMc1) added 0.3 percent.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) climbed 1 percent, adding to a similar rise on Friday. The index is now poised for a modest rise this month after two consecutive losses.
South Korea's KOSPI index (KS11) jumped 0.8 percent and is set to end April more than 2.5 percent higher following record profits from tech giant Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and after a spectacularly successful inter-Korean summit. 
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (HSI) climbed 1.6 percent, Australia's benchmark index (AXJO) rose 0.5 percent while New Zealand shares <.NZ50> gave up early losses to be up 0.9 percent.
Liquidity was low on Monday with Japan, China and India on holiday and much of Asia closed on Tuesday.
Overall, stocks continue to be supported by strong first quarter corporate earnings. More than half of Wall Street's S&P 500 (SPX) companies have reported and 79.4 percent have beaten consensus estimates. 
But investors have grown increasingly jittery with the U.S. Federal Reserve signaling faster rate rises this year and the European Central Bank seen likely to end its generous bond-buying program soon.
""The key question for 2018 remains to what extent can the benign environment persist?"" said Jacob Mitchell, Chief Investment Officer of Australian investment boutique Antipodes which has A$7 billion in assets under management.
Global shares had a dream run in 2017 helped by the first synchronous world growth in decades coupled with easy monetary policies in most of the developed world.
""We believe the unusually favorable goldilocks combination of accelerating growth and tepid inflation experienced in 2017 will not repeat,"" Mitchell added.
""Instead, normalization of interest rate policy will likely upset the rhythm with more volatile and less forgiving markets.""
Indeed, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index is almost flat so far in 2018 compared with a more than 13 percent jump in the same period last year.
GEOPOLITICS
Investors will turn their focus to a torrent of data from the United States this week including consumer spending later in the day, the Fed's policy decision on Wednesday, and a jobs report on Friday.
Separately, a delegation of U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and President Donald Trump's top economic and trade advisers - Larry Kudlow, Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro are all expected in China later this week for trade negotiations.
The U.S.-China relationship had turned sour earlier this year when Trump announced stiff tariffs on some Chinese imports, setting off a tit-for-tat response from Beijing.
Political tensions in the Korean Peninsula are also showing signs of easing, following a historic summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korea's Moon Jae-in last week at which they vowed ""complete denuclearization"". 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that he told Kim that the North Korea leader would have to agree to take ""irreversible"" steps toward abandoning nuclear weapons if he was to reach a deal with Trump.

The pound was last buying $1.3778 , after falling 0.9 percent on Friday when disappointing economic growth data challenged expectations the Bank of England would raise rates in May. A couple of weeks ago it had been as high as $1.4377.
""The GDP print missed the already-lowered-expectations and May quickly repriced to around a 25 percent chance of a hike,"" wrote analysts at Citi in a note. 
""We do not expect a hike next month and expect a more dovish meeting than is currently anticipated.""
The U.S. dollar was barely changed after retreating on Friday, with its index against six major peers at 91.54 (DXY).
The euro also trod water at $1.2128 (EUR=), while the dollar inched up on the yen to 109.18  though it has had a tough time trying to break resistance at 109.50.
Oil prices eased from recent highs with Brent crude futures (LCOc1) off 45 cents at $74.19 a barrel, while U.S. crude (CLc1) lost 28 cents to $67.82.

(Reuters) - China's Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) said it will sell a majority stake in its financial services business for about $1.9 billion to a consortium led by TPG Capital Management LP (TPG.UL) and  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) LP, as it seeks funding to take on established fintech firms in China.
The investment will give Baidu the heft it needs to narrow the lead that rivals  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd have taken in financial services, and help Baidu's push to seek revenue streams outside its core internet search business.
The deal comes at a time when China's government is tightening regulations on the loans market to rein in shadow banking and push banks to cut bad debt.
Baidu's Financial Services Group (Baidu FSG) runs payment system Baidu Wallet, an online credit service and an online wealth management platform. It owns several small financial licenses such as a third-party payment license and a fund sales license.
Baidu will be left with a roughly 42 percent stake in the unit, renamed Du Xiaoman Financial, which will operate independently of Baidu. The rest of Du Xiaoman will be owned by the consortium that includes Taikang Group and ABC International Holdings Ltd, Baidu said.
Guang Zhu, senior vice president at Baidu and general manager of the current financial services business, will become chief executive of Du Xiaoman, Baidu said in a statement late on Sunday.
""In the coming age of FinTech, Du Xiaoman will leverage the technological capabilities of Baidu AI to partner with financial institutions and provide technology-driven, trustworthy financial services to consumers in China,"" Zhu said, referring to artificial intelligence.
Reuters reported in January that the Chinese search engine provider was seeking new investors for its wholly owned finance unit, in an up to $2 billion deal.
In a separate statement, TPG said, together with its co-investors, it would invest around $1 billion in the deal, which it expected to close in two to three months.
Baidu FSG, launched in 2015, had a loan balance of 28 billion yuan ($4.42 billion) at the end of 2017.

1432,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2018 09:31PM ET</span>","Goldman, Hedge Funds Drawn Into Noble Group's Legal Battles","(Bloomberg) -- Noble Group Ltd.’s dissident shareholder Goldilocks Investment Co. listed a raft of hedge funds and banks, including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), as defendants in its legal battle against the commodity trader, as the fund presses on with a bid to stop its debt-for-equity swap.
Goldilocks last week initiated legal action in Singapore’s High Court against Noble, seeking to halt the restructure and block any attempt to move the trader’s main interests to the U.K. According to a court summons seen by Bloomberg, the Abu Dhabi-based fund listed Noble and its directors as defendants, as well as the hedge funds and banks that it says are the creditors supporting the planned rescue.
The defendants include Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC, Deutsche Bank AG, ING Bank NV, as well as Taconic Capital Advisors LP, Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP, Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC, Strategic Value Partners LLC, BFAM Partners (Hong Kong) Ltd., Varde Partners Asia Pte, Arkkan Capital Management Ltd., Cowell & Lee Advisors Ltd. and Attestor Capital LLP.
After years of crisis marked by billions in losses and a default, Noble’s battle for survival has descended into legal fights and public sparring between the company, its creditors and Goldilocks, which is fighting the rescue, saying it’s unfair on shareholders. Houlihan Lokey Inc., which is acting for the ad hoc group of creditors backing the proposal, has said the deal is only viable option.
Founder’s Support
At present, more than 80 percent of senior creditors support the deal, which will see about half of the $3.4 billion debt burden written off, as does top shareholder and founder Richard Elman. Under the proposal, existing shareholders would get 15 percent in a new company, which Goldilocks says is too small. It’s also raised concerns about the company’s management and their actions in recent months as the rescue plan has come together.
In a separate case heard on Friday, the court approved Goldilocks’ request for an injunction to stop Noble from holding its annual general meeting, scheduled for April 30, but didn’t restrain the company from holding future special general meetings. Noble said it plans to go ahead with such a meeting on Monday to approve the disposal of a ship.
Representatives from ING, Taconic, Davidson Kempner, Varde, Strategic Value, Attestor and Cowell & Lee were yet to respond to requests for comment, some of which were made outside usual business hours. Deutsche Bank, Goldman, BFAM, Arkkan and Och-Ziff declined to comment. Nobody answered calls to Houlihan Lokey’s media advisers in Asia and an external representative for Noble couldn’t immediately comment.
The claims by Goldilocks “are an intentional attempt to obfuscate, delay, derail and/or prevent the implementation of the restructuring,” Noble said in a statement on Thursday. “The company and its directors will vigorously defend each of the claims and, at the appropriate time, seek costs orders.”
Last week, creditors backing the restructure warned time is fast running out to get the deal through, saying it’s the sole option to save the trader. Houlihan Lokey hasn’t identified the members of the ad hoc group it represents.
Noble Group’s shares in Singapore capped another weekly loss before being suspended on Friday after the court’s decision on the AGM. On Monday trade restarted, and the stock opened unchanged at 8.7 Singapore cents.
The cases are Goldilocks Investment Co. vs Noble Group Ltd. HC/OS 480/2018 and HC/OS 481/2018.

1433,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2018 07:50PM ET</span>",Canada stock market shutdown pushes investors to explore options,"By John Tilak and Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - A rare outage at Canada's major stock exchanges could dent the credibility of operator TMX Group Ltd (TO:X) and encourage investors to explore alternative trading channels, fund managers and traders told Reuters.
Canada's stock market suffered a partial shutdown on Friday, forcing TMX to halt trading more than an hour early. TMX has since said the exchanges will resume trading on Monday after ""internal technical issues"" were resolved.
The outage sent investors to TMX competitors and exchanges in New York that listed Canadian companies, traders said. Some of Canada's biggest companies - including the likes of  Suncor Energy  (TO:SU) (N:SU),  Enbridge  Inc (TO:ENB) (N:ENB) and Barrick Gold (TO:ABX) (N:ABX) - are listed both in Toronto and New York. 
While the shutdown occurred on a low-volume trading day, it highlighted the technological challenges faced by exchanges such as TMX, and the risks to reputation that come with them.
""It is not a good thing for the exchange or the investors. It is lost business for TMX and lost credibility. It makes investors look elsewhere,"" said David Cockfield, portfolio manager at Northland Wealth Management. 
Cockfield said he expects traders to take defensive steps: ""They will say, 'Maybe I better establish alternative trading routes. If the TMX goes down on me again, I don't want to be caught twice.'"" 
TMX's exchanges in Canada, which include the Toronto Stock Exchange, Toronto Venture Exchange, TSX Alpha Exchange and the Montreal Exchange, account for about 61 percent of trading on the world's sixth-largest stock market, according to official data.
'DATA DARK AGES'
Some traders and fund managers said it was still too early to assess the full extent of the damage from Friday's outage.
Jos Schmitt, chief executive of NEO Exchange, said no one wins from a shutdown.
""It is bad for the Canadian markets' reputation overall,"" Schmitt told Reuters, adding that he was concerned about what he saw as complacency over a lack of real-time market data.
""We need to solve the real industry-wide issues and we encourage the Canadian Securities Administrators to address these issues and help bring us out of the data dark ages,"" Schmitt said.
TMX said on Saturday that the disruption was caused by a ""hardware failure in a central storage appliance of the trading system"", and noted it was not the result of a hack.
Asked for additional comment on Sunday, a TMX spokeswoman referred to the company's statement on Saturday. 
""It puts people on heightened alert,"" said Diana Avigdor, head of trading and portfolio manager at Barometer Capital Management. ""The TMX has to manage damage by being very straightforward and clear with what backup systems they will have going forward.""
Canada's stock market last suffered a major outage nearly a decade ago, when a system fault linked to data feeds shut down trading for a full day in December 2008, including on the small-cap TSX Venture Exchange.
Most of the trading volume on Friday was transferred to other markets, such as Chi-X, Pure Trading and MATCHNow, as well as to inter-listed stocks in the United States, said Peggy Bowie, senior trader at Manulife Asset Management.
Representatives for ChiX, Pure Trading and MATCHNow were not immediately available, or could not be reached, for comment on Sunday.
When asked on Friday whether the regulator was conducting an investigation into the outage, the Ontario Securities Commission said only that it was in contact with TMX. The OSC declined to comment on Sunday.

In Saturday's statement, TMX chief executive Lou Eccleston apologized to clients and said the company was committed ""to applying the lessons learned from this incident to help us prevent such issues from recurring in the future.""

1434,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2018 07:31PM ET</span>",Here Are the Stocks to Watch After Two Koreas Agree to End War,"(Bloomberg) -- If you’re trying to figure out how it’s all going to play out on the South Korean stock market on Monday after Kim Jong Un’s historic call for peace, don’t worry, we’ve got the list for you.
South Korea’s Kospi index was closed before the North Korean leader and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to finally end a seven-decade war this year, and pursue the “complete denuclearization” of the Korean Peninsula. On Sunday, Kim promised to close his main nuclear weapons test site in May.
It all sounds very promising for the South Korean stock market Monday. The benchmark equity index has been trading at a substantial valuation discount compared with its peers mainly due to worries about political risk and corporate governance. And strategists and fund managers have said in the past that the Kospi index could surge if the political risk is removed.
Aside from the Kospi index in general, here are the stocks to watch:
Land-Mine Removal
Shares of South Korean companies specializing in land-mine removal equipment surged last week, as investors bet that the inter-Korean summit on Friday would reduce tensions along one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world.
Stocks that may move include Firstec Co., a developer of mine-clearing robots, and Welcron Co., a maker of clothes for mine-clearance operation.
Thaad Missile 
With an agreement to end the war and Kim’s promise to denuclearize, there may not be a need to deploy the U.S.-built Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) system. China, which saw this missile system as a threat, had enforced painful economic measures against South Korea like ordering travel agencies to stop selling tour packages to South Korea.
Consumer and tourism-related stocks that depend on revenues from Chinese tourists could see a bump Monday: AmorePacific Corp., LG Household & Health Care Ltd, Korea Kolmar Co., Hotel Shilla Co., Hana Tour Service Inc.
Korean airlines, including Asiana Airlines Inc., Korean Air Lines Co. and Jeju Air Co., are also standing to gain from a likely influx of visitors from China.

1435,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2018 07:45PM ET</span>",Hong Kong scrambles for talent in battle for Nasdaq's biotech crown,"By Julie Zhu and Alun David John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - When Hong Kong unveiled plans last year to encourage biotech companies to list in the city by loosening listing rules, the financial industry and investors cheered.
Hong Kong was an obvious financing center for a growing number of Chinese companies developing new drugs. But as the new rules come into effect Monday, at least one problem has become evident: Hong Kong's limited expertise in the biotech field.
Biotech companies without revenues, let alone profits, will now be allowed to apply for listings in the city under the new rules. Some 10 companies - mostly Chinese, including the Temasek-backed Innovent Biologics and Shanghai Henlius Biotech - are already planning floats and some have dropped U.S. IPO plans in favor of listing closer to home.
The result however is a scramble for experts in a city whose financiers have limited experience with science. 
Just 3 percent of all Hong Kong-listed stocks, by capitalization, come from so-called ""new economy"" sectors - tech as well as biotech - according to a report last year by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HK:0388), the bourse operator. 
That compared with 60 percent for Nasdaq and 47 percent for the New York Stock Exchange.
Several bankers, investors and industry executives estimated that the city currently had fewer than 20 experienced biotech and biopharma bankers.
""It's not easy to hire the right professionals,"" said Kevin Xie, head of healthcare and co-founder of China Renaissance, a boutique investment bank. ""There's a limited pool globally who truly understand the industry."" 
Leading investment banks are touting their ability to transfer bankers from the United States to plug gaps in Hong Kong. But lacking local licenses, those seconded to Hong Kong can only advise their colleagues, not work on deals themselves.
Li Hang, head of Greater China equity capital markets at CLSA, said: ""We really need sector specialist bankers to run biotech deals, otherwise everybody will say we don't know how to do the due diligence.""
Difficulties around talent go beyond the banks. Charles Li, chief executive of HKEX, said last month that it was tough to hire biotech professionals. ""All financial institutions in town have been seeking such talent,"" he said.
Nonetheless, Li said Tuesday, when announcing the finalised rules, that HKEX had found a dozen experts, primarily scientists or employees of pharmaceutical companies, to serve on a board advising a listing committee that approves each IPO application. 
CHINA RISING
Hong Kong's appeal to would-be IPOs rests largely on its familiarity with Chinese firms, its convenient timezone for mainland executives and its new rules.
""On Nasdaq, the main investors for biotech stocks are mainly U.S. funds, but, in Hong Kong, we can better tap Chinese and Asian investors as we are closer to them,"" said Yang Dajun, chairman of Ascentage Pharma, a Chinese biotech company.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts forecast that China's biologics industry will double in size to $52 billion by 2021 compared with a global growth rate of 60 percent. Biologics are the products produced by biotech and biopharma firms.
While U.S. companies have been the largest capital-raisers, accounting for 44 percent of industry funds raised through IPOs in the past five years, Chinese groups were next, accounting for a fifth, according to Thomson Reuters data.
All that has sparked interest in Hong Kong. 
Last June, shares in the drug developer Wuxi Biologics (HK:2269) rose 39 percent on their debut and now stand 167 percent higher. 
However, industry insiders and market participants warn of risks in the sector, saying that many biotechs are reliant on a handful of early-stage new drugs, making them vulnerable if one fails. 
Mary Leung, the CFA Institute's Asia Pacific head of advocacy, questioned the ability of average investors to evaluate such companies. 
""Given how long it will take for pre-revenue companies to demonstrate whether they are successful, for retail investors, it's almost like investing in bitcoin,"" she said. 
This is a particular issue for Hong Kong, where retail investors often expect to be protected by regulators. Until now, the city's rules have been strict, requiring three years of profitability, or a certain level of cashflow, before any company can apply to list. 
About 20 percent of daily trading in Hong Kong is undertaken by small-time investors, compared with about 2 percent in New York.
""Will we have the courage to stay with it because 30 to 40 percent of these biotech companies will fail and they may crash spectacularly?"" Ken Hitchner, Asia-Pacific chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), said at a conference last month. 

""We will have spectacular successes – we will have future Tencents across tech, across biotech. But there will be front-page headlines of really spectacular implosions and that's the nature of dealing with the bleeding edge of innovation.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's largest-listed wealth manager AMP announced the resignations of its chairwoman and legal counsel on Monday, and slashed its directors' fees by a quarter as it races to stem the fallout from damaging revelations of misconduct at the firm.
The exits follow disclosures at a judicial inquiry into the country's financial sector that AMP misled many customers and deceived the corporate regulator. The scandal has already caused the early departure of CEO Craig Meller, who was due to leave by year end, and analysts expect more heads will roll.
Chairwoman Catherine Brenner and group General Counsel Brian Salter will depart immediately, AMP said in a statement.
Mike Wilkins, a former independent director who has been named both interim chairman and CEO, said the evidence given to the government-backed Royal Commission is ""being treated extremely seriously by the board"".
""Appropriate steps are being taken to address the issues raised, and remediating our customers is being given utmost priority,"" he said.
AMP, which is also staring at a possible class action, has seen around A$2.2 billion ($1.7 billion) wiped off its market capitalization over the past two weeks in the wake of the revelations. It was valued at A$11.6 billion at Friday's close.
The inquiry was told that advisers at AMP misappropriated funds of thousands of clients over the last decade by charging them without providing advice, and that it had repeatedly lied to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). 
Counsel assisting the inquiry said on Friday that AMP had breached provisions of the Corporations Act that carry criminal sanctions.
Brenner, Salter and Meller were singled out by the inquiry as part of a group of senior executives that allegedly modified a report by law firm Clayton Utz and submitted it to the regulator in late 2017 as ""external and independent"".
Their intention was to limit the report's findings about the involvement of AMP's senior executives in misappropriating customer fees, the inquiry heard.
AMP said in its statement that Brenner, Meller and the other directors ""did not act inappropriately in relation to the preparation of the Clayton Utz report"".
The statement did not comment on Salter's behavior.
REMUNERATION CONSEQUENCES
The company said it would make a formal submission in response to the allegations raised at the commission by May 4.
The ""employment and remuneration consequences"" for individuals who were responsible for charging fraudulent fees will be determined once an external employment review is completed, which is expected shortly, it said.
AMP added that it would slash fees for board directors by 25 percent for the rest of 2018 as a recognition of the ""collective governance accountability for the issues raised in the Royal Commission and for their impact on the reputation of AMP"".
AMP has already started searching for a new CEO, and will fast track the selection of a new chair to ""help ensure stability and further strengthen governance"", Wilkins said.
David Ellis, an analyst at Morningstar, said it was likely more executives and board members would leave in coming weeks.
""All bets are off,"" Ellis said. ""With a new CEO and a new board, the future strategy could be completely different."" 
AMP is currently staring at a possible shareholder class action, with litigation financier IMF Bentham Ltd saying it plans to fund one against the wealth manager regarding alleged misconduct as revealed by the commission.
An AMP spokeswoman declined to comment on the proposed class action.
The Royal Commission is just a couple of months into what is expected to be a year-long investigation. The inquiry will be able to make wide-ranging recommendations including legislative changes and on criminal or civil prosecutions.

The acquisition will deepen Prologis' presence in high-growth markets including Southern California, the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, New Jersey, Seattle and South Florida, the companies said in a statement.
DCT shareholders will receive 1.02 Prologis shares for every DCT share they own. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter and is subject to the approval of DCT stockholders, among other customary conditions, they said.
The board of directors of both companies unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to create near-term savings of about $80 million, the statement said.
The deal is the largest for Prologis since it merged with AMB Property Corp in 2011 in an $8.7 billion transaction.

Prologis owned or managed more than 3,200 properties worldwide as of Dec. 31 and leased facilities to about 5,000 customers, the largest being Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) followed by DHL. Seventy percent of its business is U.S. based.

Foreign portfolio funds have been flooding into the kingdom ahead of Riyadh's expected inclusion in global emerging market indexes next year. In the week through April 19, foreigners bought a net $384 million of equities, a record sum.
In the week through last Thursday, however, foreigners were net sellers to the tune of $48 million, the data showed. They bought $313 million and sold $361 million.
Propelled by inflows of funds, the Saudi stock index (TASI) has jumped 13.8 percent this year, meaning it is trading at more than 16 times corporate earnings for the past 12 months; MSCI's emerging market index (MSCIEF) is below 15 times.
Sunday's data showed heavy net selling of stocks last week, at a ratio of more than two to one, by foreigners investing in Saudi stocks indirectly through swap agreements.

But qualified foreign institutions which invest directly remained net buyers, suggesting newly licensed institutions that are only now entering Saudi Arabia are continuing to build up their portfolios.

1440,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2018 03:36PM ET</span>","Walmart attempts international turnaround with UK, India tie-ups","By Nandita Bose
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc's (N:WMT) urgency to stem market share losses to rivals around the world is driving it to partner with local players in the UK and India, even as it scales back in some other markets like Brazil.
The world's largest retailer is in talks to merge its UK arm ASDA with J  Sainsbury  Plc (L:SBRY) in which it will hold a minority stake. Walmart is also looking to acquire a majority stake in India's leading online retailer Flipkart for $10 billion to $12 billion after years of underperformance there.
The moves underscore Walmart's renewed focus on catching up with competitors, ranging from grocer Aldi Inc to Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), in key international markets. The retailer’s underperforming international business contributed less than a quarter to its total revenue of $500.3 billion in fiscal 2018. 
""Walmart has simply been too slow to react when it comes to their overseas business,"" said Burt Flickinger, managing director, Strategic Resource Group. ""They have finally started taking corrective action and are now dedicating their resources to where they think they can grow,"" he said.
It also marks a shift in Walmart's traditional approach of building a business on its own.
""Walmart is clearly moving away from trying to crack tough foreign markets by itself to striking partnerships because it realizes that is the fastest way to bridge the gap with competitors,"" said Laura Kennedy, vice president, retail sales and shopper practice at Kantar Consulting.
A Walmart spokesman declined to comment on the negotiations in the UK and India. 
Overall, sales from Walmart International, which runs about 6,300 stores globally, stood at $118.07 billion in the fiscal year ended 2018, down nearly 14 percent from $136.5 billion in 2014. This was in large part due to adverse currency movements, which hurt the money repatriated from its foreign arms, but also because of a series of missteps in major markets around the world. In an effort to fix its international performance, Walmart in January appointed Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna to run its international unit and has indicated it will focus on its core North American markets and growth markets like China and India.
Walmart's international woes have been exacerbated by slow decision-making over the years and even initial talks with India’s Flipkart began as far back as 2016. [https://reut.rs/2HYwFE3]
Walmart initially entered the Indian market in 2007 through a joint venture with India’s Bharti Enterprises, years before Amazon debuted there. That joint venture was called off in 2013 and its presence in India has remained largely static since then, at least in part due to restrictions around foreign investment in physical retail in India. [https://reut.rs/2HBgJbs] [https://reut.rs/2vRkrIC] 
Meanwhile, Amazon jumped in with a less regulated online marketplace offering, retail consultants and investors said. Amazon now holds about 27 percent of India's burgeoning e-commerce market, according to Euromonitor, where Walmart remains a footnote and only operates 21 cash-and-carry wholesale stores in the country that sell to businesses.
Walmart’s slow-footedness means if a deal is announced, Flipkart could be Walmart's largest acquisition to date, potentially at a steep premium to what SoftBank Group (T:9984) paid for a stake in the company less than a year ago. 
INTERNATIONAL BLUNDERS
Walmart's international moves over the years have involved a series of blunders. 
For example, Walmart bet on an unprofitable, second-tier online retailer in China in 2011 and has since been behind  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA). In 2016, Walmart sold its online business in China to pick up a stake in China's no 2 retailer JD.com.
In Brazil, Walmart has struggled to gain traction after a decade, while in the United Kingdom it has been unable to stem market share declines to hard discounters like Aldi Inc and Lidl. 
Now, Walmart is trying to offload a majority stake in its Brazilian operations to private equity firm Advent International. And on Saturday, Sainsbury said it and Walmart's British unit Asda are in talks to create the country's biggest supermarket group. 
Their combination, which some said shows Walmart’s retrenching in the market, would surpass Tesco's (L:TSCO) grocery market share and be worth up to 15 billion pounds ($20.7 billion).
Whether Walmart's latest moves will turn Walmart International into the growth engine it once was remains to be seen, consultants said. For now at least, investors have largely supported the decisions to jumpstart global growth made by Chief Executive Doug McMillon as exemplified by the market reaction to the talks in India.
""In the short term, the Flipkart deal may look pricey, but the markets haven't punished Walmart because investors realize this is probably their best chance to have a fair fight with Amazon in India,"" Ken Murphy, portfolio manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said.

Walmart's shares fell 20 percent from an all-time high in January largely due to concerns around its online performance in the United States. They have, however, risen 27 percent in the past year, outperforming the wider S&P 500 index, which rose 12 percent during the same period.

1441,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2018 03:12PM ET</span>","T-Mobile, Sprint say $26 billion deal would give U.S. tech lead over China","By Greg Roumeliotis, Sheila Dang and Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) and Sprint Corp (N:S) said on Sunday they had agreed to a $26 billion all-stock deal and believed they could win over skeptical regulators because the merger would create thousands of jobs and help the United States beat China to creating the next generation mobile network.
The agreement capped four years of on-and-off talks between the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers, setting the stage for the creation of a company with 127 million customers that will be a more formidable competitor to the top two wireless players,  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) and AT&T Inc (N:T).
U.S. regulators, who have challenged in court AT&T's $85 billion deal to buy U.S. media company  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX), are expected to grill Sprint and T-Mobile on how they will price their combined wireless offerings. 
Verizon has 116 million U.S. wireless customers, according to a spokesman, while AT&T has 93 million branded customers, as of the first quarter.
Their first round of merger talks ended unsuccessfully in 2014 after the administration of then-U.S. President Barack Obama expressed antitrust concerns.
The new deal will create the highest-capacity U.S. network, lower prices, create jobs and improve service in rural areas, said John Legere, the chief executive of T-Mobile and the new head of the proposed combined company.
The combined company, which will be called T-Mobile, will invest $40 billion over the next three years to upgrade its networks to accommodate the next generation 5G wireless technology, which is expected to have the speeds necessary to power drones and self-driving cars, Legere said in a statement.
The companies said during a conference call with analysts that the recent U.S. tax overhaul would have a positive impact, and the combined company would not be a significant taxpayer until 2025.
T-Mobile and Sprint said they expected to complete their deal no later than the first half of 2019, an ambitious goal given the intense U.S. regulatory scrutiny it will be subjected to. T-Mobile will not be liable to pay Sprint a breakup fee should regulators block the deal, according to sources who asked not to be identified because that detail in their contract had not yet been made public.
The companies said they expected U.S. regulators would see the benefits of the deal.
“This isn’t a case of going from four to three wireless companies – there are now at least seven or eight big competitors in this converging market,"" Legere said, referring to cable companies as wireless competitors. Other companies also would be forced to accelerate their investments in the face of a combined T-Mobile-Sprint, the companies added.
A spokeswoman for Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai declined to comment on Sunday on the proposed merger. The FCC will decide whether to grant the deal regulatory approval if it is in the “public interest,” the spokeswoman added.
CTIA, a trade organization that represents the U.S. wireless communications industry, ranks the United States behind China and South Korea in 5G readiness. The Chinese government launched a plan targeting 5G deployment by 2020, with three carriers committed to the timeline.
Legere said the deal would likely lead to lower prices from AT&T and Verizon, as well as Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA).
AT&T declined to comment. Comcast could not immediately be reached for comment.
Verizon declined to comment on prices but said it remained committed to building a 5G network. 
DEAL BREAKTHROUGH
The breakthrough in the companies' negotiations, first reported by Reuters on Thursday, came after T-Mobile majority-owner Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn) and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), which controls Sprint, agreed on a structure that would allow Deutsche Telekom to continue to consolidate the combined company, which will have a market value of over $80 billion, on its books.
Deutsche Telekom will own 42 percent of the combined company, and will control the board of the combined company, nominating nine of the 14 directors. Legere will also serve as a director. 
The implied equity valuation for Sprint is $6.62 per share based on T-Mobile's closing share price on Friday. Sprint shares closed on Friday at $6.50.
The all-stock transaction is at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 T-Mobile shares for each Sprint share, or the equivalent of 9.75 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile US share.
Tokyo-based SoftBank and Deutsche Telekom will sign a voting rights agreement that will give Deutsche Telekom access to voting rights for a total of 69 percent of T-Mobile shares.
The second round of talks between Sprint and T-Mobile ended in November over valuation disagreements.
Since then, Sprint's shares lost about a fifth of their value amid questions about how the company can compete effectively under the weight of its long-term debt of more than $32 billion.
T-Mobile's market capitalization is $54.7 billion, while Sprint is valued by the deal at $26 billion.
INVESTING IN 5G TECHNOLOGY
Even though Sprint's customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by discounting. Analysts say that without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market.
T-Mobile has fared better than Sprint, even if it remains a distant third to Verizon and AT&T. It has managed to score sustained market-share gains, as innovative offerings, improving network performance and good customer service attract new customers, according to Moody’s Investors Service Inc.
T-Mobile became the first major U.S. carrier to eliminate two-year contracts, a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has also badgered rivals with its unlimited data plans.
Both Sprint and T-Mobile are far behind Verizon and AT&T in upgrading their network to accommodate next generation 5G wireless technology. Even after their merger, the combined company's budget to invest in 5G will be smaller than that of Verizon or AT&T.
Sprint and T-Mobile hope the deal will give them more firepower to participate in auction for spectrum to develop 5G. They plan to participate in a spectrum auction in late autumn and will request a waiver if the merger prevents the companies from participating.

PJT Partners, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Evercore served as advisers for T-Mobile. The Raine Group, J.P. Morgan and Centerview Partners LLC advised Sprint.

The appointments, which bring in more international experience, come as the Saudi government plans to float around 5 percent of Aramco in an initial public offering (IPO) - the world's largest - later this year or early 2019. 
Saudi Arabian Minister of Finance Mohammed al-Jadaan and Minister of Economy and Planning Mohammed al-Tuwaijri were appointed as members of the board of directors, Aramco said in a statement.

Other new members also include Peter Cella, former president & CEO of  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) Phillips Chemical Co. LP, and Andrew Liveris, director of DowDuPont Inc, and the CEO of the  Dow Chemical  Company (NYSE:DOW). Liveris's appointment is effective as of July 1, Aramco said.
The five new members of Aramco's board will join six returning members including Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who is also Aramco's chairman, and Amin Nasser, Aramco's CEO. Minister of State Ibrahim al-Assaf and Managing Director of the government-owned Public Investment Fund (PIF) Yasir al-Rumayyan also remain on the board. 
The outgoing board members are Majid Al-Moneef, advisor to the Saudi Royal Court; Khaled al-Sultan, Rector of King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals; and Peter Woicke, former managing director of the World Bank and former vice president of the International Finance Corporation.
Appointment decisions to the new 11-member board of directors are made by the Saudi government. 
FIRST WOMAN ON BOARD
Elsenhans was named by Forbes as one of the world's most powerful women in 2008. Prior to her role at Sunoco, Elsenhans was the executive vice president of global manufacturing for Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), where she worked for more than 28 years.
She also served on Baker Hughes's board of directors from 2012 to July 2017 and sits on the board of GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK).
Only a handful of Saudi women are appointed to the board of major Saudi companies but that is slowly changing in the conservative kingdom, where women are subject to a male guardianship system which in many cases restricts their opportunities to work. 
Last year, the Saudi Stock Exchange appointed Sarah Al-Suhaimi, as its first female chair. She was the first woman to chair a major government financial institution in the kingdom. 
In 2004, Lubna Olayan became the first woman to be elected to the board of Saudi Hollandi Bank, now called Alawwal Bank (SE:1040). In 2006, Lubna was one of four new appointments by PIF to the board of Ma’aden (SE:1211), the Gulf’s largest miner.

The Olayan family controls one of Saudi Arabia’s largest conglomerates.

1449,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2018 01:33AM ET</span>",China eases restrictions on foreign ownership of securities ventures,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's securities regulator has released new guidelines for foreign investment in Chinese security joint ventures in which it eased some restrictions and launched an application process for more foreign ownership.
The consultation period for the new rules that began in March is now over and the final regulations have been officially released for immediate implementation, the regulator said in an announcement on its website late on Saturday.
During the review, restrictions limiting single foreign investors to a 30 percent stake in securities ventures, either directly or via a partner, were removed, according to the state-backed China Securities newspaper.
Foreign bankers had expressed concern over this particular restriction, saying it might have required Western banks to include a third partner in deals which might stymie broadening international participation in China's domestic securities markets.
Foreign firms that wish to make changes to their equity ownership in local securities joint ventures or that wish to establish a new joint venture can now apply to the regulator, it said in a question-and-answer published online.
The move is one part of China's pledge to ease foreign ownership curbs to allow major international banks to bolster their presence in the securities business – from underwriting to trading - in the world's second-largest economy.
Previously, Western banks could only own up to 49 percent of their Chinese securities joint ventures. That lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration. 
The regulator also said that applications for owning up to 51 percent of local fund management companies are already being accepted, though added that this was unrelated to the changes in securities guidelines.
It was unclear from the statement whether such applications are currently being accepted for all different types of Chinese fund management companies.
Peter Alexander, director of Z-Ben Advisors, a Shanghai-based consultancy, said that Chinese policy makers have been signaling that the fund management policy change would come for over year, but global managers may not be prepared.

""What we have is only a move in policy. There is now the commercial task of actually buying a controlling stake and that task will neither be easy nor cheap,"" he said.

The lawsuit, filed last week in Nevada state court, charges that Jorgen Nielsen, a former artistic director at the Wynn Las Vegas salon, made “false and defamatory” statements to the Wall Street Journal and ABC News, according to the report. 
Reuters was not able to reach Nielsen for comment. 
The Wall Street Journal reported that Nielsen said he was unaware of the lawsuit and had declined to further comment. 
The sexual misconduct allegations against Wynn surfaced in a January Wall Street Journal article. Nielsen was one of the sources the newspaper identified by name.
Reuters has not independently verified the allegations against Wynn. 

Wynn, 76, has denied the accusations as ""preposterous."" The billionaire divested himself of his entire 11.8 percent stake in Wynn Resorts in March.

TMX Group Ltd (TO:X), which operates the Toronto Stock Exchange and smaller Canadian trading platforms, said it had fixed the error. 
""All systems are ready for the start of business on Monday,"" TMX said in a statement. 
The outage drew concern from investors and financial institutions in Canada and around the globe because such shutdowns are relatively rare. When technical glitches occur, exchanges typically quickly switch over to back-up systems to prevent interruptions in trading.
In this case, a failure in a central storage appliance linked to both primary and redundant systems prevented fail over procedures from engaging, TMX said in its statement. 
The company replaced a defective storage module, verified the integrity of data of all impacted databases and conducted a successful start-up validation of the entire trading system, TMX said.
The statement did not identify the vendor of the equipment that failed, though it said the outage was not the result of a cyber attack.

Canada's last major trading outage occurred nearly a decade ago, when a system fault linked to data feeds shut down trading for a full day in 2008, including on the small-cap TSX Venture Exchange.

Washington has introduced a number of sanctions, including restrictions on financing for Russian companies over Moscow's role in Ukraine's crisis and alleged meddling in the U.S. 2016 presidential election. 
RIA news agency cited Igor Artemyev, head of Russia's anti-monopoly body (FAS), as saying the regulator would quickly start talks with Schlumberger, the largest oilfield services company by revenue.
""We (will) immediately start the talks with Schlumberger and hope that we are moving to the final stretch,"" he was quoted by RIA as saying after a Russian government meeting on foreign investments.
The FAS said later on Saturday that the government investment commission had decided to extend the time frame for examining the deal, but it was not immediately clear how long that could take.
Schlumberger had initially planned to buy 51 percent in EDC, but decided to scale down its bid. The deal has faced difficulties as relations between Russia and the United States have deteriorated.
This is a second attempt by Schlumberger to acquire Russia's leading oilfield services provider. In 2015, Schlumberger agreed to buy 45.65 percent of EDC for $1.7 billion, but the deal fell through after the FAS repeatedly postponed its approval. Later that year, EDC delisted its shares on the London Stock Exchange.

For Schlumberger, the investment would mean access to the Russian oil market, one of the world's largest, at a time of rising crude prices.

1453,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2018 02:57PM ET</span>","Sainsbury's, Walmart's Asda to create UK supermarket powerhouse","By James Davey and Ben Martin
LONDON (Reuters) - Sainsbury's and Walmart's Asda are in talks to create Britain's biggest supermarket group, a combination which would surpass Tesco's grocery market share and be worth up to 15 billion pounds ($20.7 billion).
Sainsbury's confirmed on Saturday that it and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the world's largest retailer, were in advanced discussions regarding a combination of the Sainsbury's and Asda businesses, the UK's No. 2 and 3 UK grocers. It said they will make a further announcement at 0600 GMT on Monday.
Britain's big grocers, including No. 4 player Morrisons, have been losing share to German discounters Aldi and Lidl and must also deal with growing demand for internet grocery shopping and the march of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Sainsbury's gave no details of the deal's structure but a source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters the holding company of the combined group would retain the Sainsbury's name. Sainsbury's Chief Executive Mike Coupe, who used to work for Asda, would lead it, the source said.
The source described the planned deal -- which would consolidate a brutally competitive UK food market while helping Walmart address its underperforming UK arm through greater buying power -- as a ""merger"".
Three sources with knowledge of the situation said Walmart would take a minority stake in the combined business. Two said Walmart would be the biggest shareholder, with a stake of around 40 percent.
The Qatar Investment Authority, which has tried to buy Sainsbury’s in the past, is currently the supermarket group’s biggest shareholder with a 22 percent stake. The deal would probably dilute that holding.
Sainsbury's invited media and analysts to presentations scheduled for Monday, indicating a done deal.
Walmart declined to comment. Asda did not respond to requests for comment.
Sky News, which first reported the news, said the deal could be worth over 10 billion pounds.
One of the sources who spoke to Reuters said the combined company would have an enterprise value, including debt, of around 15 billion pounds and would remain listed in London.
Sainsbury's shares closed on Friday at 269 pence, giving the company an equity value of 6 billion pounds.
The deal would be the largest in the UK supermarket sector since Morrisons acquired the Safeway business in 2004.
PROFIT DECLINE
Sainsbury's has reported three straight years of profit decline, and is forecast to report a fourth on Wednesday. Asda has seen two years of falls.
Asda, which Walmart bought in 1999 for 6.7 billion pounds, is one of the retail giant's largest and worst-performing international businesses. Analysts reckon Asda was hurt the most by the rise of the discounters, which eroded its traditional price advantage.
""Asda doesn't have discount and it doesn't have convenience. This (deal) provides a potential solution for Walmart to deliver a more profitable Asda in the long run,"" said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.
In recent years Walmart has shifted its traditional approach from building overseas businesses itself to partnering with local players, for example in China.
In January, Walmart appointed Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna to run its international unit with a remit that included fixing its UK operations. McKenna is a Briton and a veteran of Asda, where she served as both COO and finance chief.
Roger Burnley, who took over as Asda CEO in January, is a former Sainsbury's executive, working under Coupe. One of the sources said he would stay at the combined group.
 Tesco  (LON:TSCO) last month moved to strengthen its grip on the UK food sector, completing the 4 billion-pound purchase of wholesaler Booker. In 2016 Sainsbury's purchased general merchandise retailer Argos for 1.1 billion pounds.
Sainsbury's and the similarly-sized Asda would overtake Tesco with a combined market share of 31.4 percent versus Tesco's 27.6 percent, according to the latest data from market researcher Kantar Worldpanel.
Asda stores would continue to trade under their own brand, separate from the more upmarket Sainsbury's, the sources said.
REGULATORY HURDLES
A major uncertainty surrounding any combination would be whether the move secures approval from Britain's competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), given that the deal would effectively create a duopoly.
However, the CMA's surprise unconditional waving through of Tesco's Booker deal may have changed the regulatory landscape. 
""It's going to be a really big test of the CMA's understanding of the market and whether it believes that this deal is in the consumer's interest,"" said Shore Capital's Black.

""It's hard to believe it would not require considerable store disposals and there aren't many buyers out there.""

The prestigious Academy has become embroiled in allegations of sexual misconduct by the husband of one of its members and is reeling over the admission that the names of some prize-winners - the subject of intense speculation and on which many people place bets - were leaked in advance.
""The Swedish Academy wants to inform that Sara Stridsberg told the academy on April 27 that she wishes to leave her duties as a member,"" the committee said in a statement, giving no further details. 
Earlier this month, Academy chief Sara Danius stepped down and four other members also announced their withdrawal from the board in the wake of the controversy.
Arcane rules that make appointments for life have so far meant that the 18 members have not been able to technically resign. But Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf said last week he would change the rules, making it possible to bring in new members.
The crisis enveloping the Nobel literature prize body has sparked speculation in media that the prize could be canceled this year. The committee's selections fascinate and often baffle literature lovers the world over.
The 2016 award to American folk singer and troubadour Bob Dylan sharply divided opinion over whether a popular musician should be given an award that had been largely the domain of novelists and playwrights.

The financial crimes unit of the Swedish police said on Friday it had begun an investigation into the Swedish Academy, but gave no further information.

SANYA, China (Reuters) - China's Fosun International Ltd (HK:0656) on Saturday launched its Atlantis Sanya luxury resort in a $1.74 billion bet that the sail-shaped development will become an icon in Hainan - China's Hawaii - and a beacon to both domestic and foreign tourists. 
The conglomerate's 11 billion yuan ($1.74 billion) investment in China's southernmost province is in line with the central government's desire to further boost tourism in Hainan, already popular among Chinese holidaymakers.
Fosun, co-founded by Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang, has been one of the country's most acquisitive overseas dealmakers.
But like peers including Dalian Wanda Group and HNA Group, Fosun - China's largest privately held conglomerate - has faced increased scrutiny by Beijing for debt-fuelled, big-ticket foreign deals and is now pursuing a development path more closely aligned with Beijing's priorities.
Tourism is viewed as key to China's shift towards a more consumption-driven model of economic growth from an investment and export-led one. Beijing aims to raise the country's tourism market revenue to 7 trillion yuan by 2020, from 5.3 trillion yuan last year.
Hainan, one of China's top holiday destinations, has sought to internationalise its tourism sector since 2010 after winning approval from the central government to develop international tourism. But only 1.1 million out of 67 million visitors came from abroad in 2017.
Located on Haitang Bay, one of the major bays in Sanya and known for its 22-kilometre strip of white, sandy beaches, Atlantis Sanya was inspired by Dubai's Atlantis, The Palm. The integrated resort offers hotel suites with views of underwater marine life, as well as a water park and a shopping mall.
The resort, owned by Fosun and managed by Kerzner International [KZL.UL], occupies an area of 540,000 square metres - equal to 66 soccer pitches - and has 1,314 guest rooms. 
""Atlantis Sanya is not only a forerunner of the supply-side reform of the tourism industry, but is also becoming a new landmark of Hainan tourism,"" Xu Zhenling, vice mayor of Sanya said at a news conference on Saturday ahead of the resort's grand opening scheduled for the evening.
She said the resort will also raise Hainan's profile overseas, as the island province - China's largest economic development zone - seeks to further open up its economy and focus on developing modern tourism, services and high-technology industries.
Plans to build China's first Atlantis resort in Hainan, the third in the world, were first unveiled in 2013.
The resort adds to a broad portfolio owned by Fosun Tourism and Culture Group, a key profit growth driver for the conglomerate, which also owns the French Club Med holiday company and a stake in Canadian theatrical production company Cirque du Soleil.

(Reuters) - Fujifilm Holdings Corp's (T:4901) merger with U.S. firm  Xerox Corp  (N:XRX) was temporarily blocked on Friday following a court ruling, handing its activist investors a win after they sued to stop the deal.
The ruling reopened nominations to Xerox's board on Friday after investor Darwin Deason filed a lawsuit against the company last month opposing the deal and asking to add his own nominees to the board.
The preliminary injunction came a day after the companies reopened deal talks on their $6.1-billion merger. They are discussing a higher price after Xerox, under pressure from top investors, asked to renegotiate the terms.
Judge Barry Ostrager of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, granted the injunctions, saying Xerox Chief Executive Officer Jeff Jacobson sought to conclude the deal even though he was advised to end negotiations.
""The facts abduced at the evidentiary hearing clearly show that Jacobson, having been told on Nov. 10 that the Board was actively seeking a new CEO to replace him, was hopelessly conflicted during his negotiation of a strategic acquisition transaction that would result in a combined entity of which he would be CEO,"" the decision said.
The proposed merger is opposed by Deason and Carl Icahn, two of Xerox's top shareholders, who have said the agreement dramatically undervalues Xerox.
Fujifilm said it would consider all options, including whether to appeal against the decision.
""We disagree with and are disappointed by the judge's ruling,"" the Japanese firm said in a statement. 
""We strongly believe that all Xerox shareholders should be able to decide for themselves the operational, financial, and strategic merits of the transaction.
Xerox said it disagrees with the ruling and ""will immediately appeal the court's decision"".
""The company strongly believes that its shareholders should be allowed to exercise their right to vote on the transaction and decide for themselves,"" the company said.
It added that it believes a combination with Fuji Xerox is the best path forward to create value for shareholders.
""The Xerox board undertook a rigorous process to reach its decision to approve the proposed transaction, including a comprehensive review of the company's strategic and financial alternatives, as well as potential transaction structures in its negotiations with Fujifilm over a 10-month period.""
Deason said in a statement that he is ""grateful the court acted to protect the shareholders of Xerox.""
In February, Deason asked a court to block the merger with Fujifilm Holdings, arguing the U.S. photocopier maker's board had failed shareholders by approving a deal that undervalues the company.
Icahn and Deason, who own a combined 15 percent of the U.S. printer and copier maker, have called the deal structure ""tortured"" and ""convoluted"".

Law firm King & Spalding represents Deason while Paul Weiss represents Xerox.

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 10:28PM ET</span>",Nasdaq asks regulators to let companies decide where they trade,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc has asked regulators to allow it to give small companies a choice of trading on a single U.S. stock exchange, rather than all 13 of them, in an effort to make it easier for buyers and sellers of the stocks to find each other.
Currently, regardless of where a stock is listed, it can be traded across exchanges. While that fragmented model works well for high-volume stocks, promoting competition and price discovery, it does not have the same effect on less liquid stocks, which become harder to trade, Nasdaq said.
""Nasdaq believes that consolidating displayed liquidity for smaller companies onto a single trading venue would help those companies and their investors by facilitating capital formation and improving investors' ability to source liquidity,"" it said in an April 25 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
In October, the U.S. Treasury Department endorsed the idea of letting companies decide how many stock exchanges their shares trade on as part of a broader regulatory review.
But the president of Nasdaq rival Cboe Global Markets Inc cautioned last week at an SEC roundtable that giving exchanges a monopoly on trading certain stocks could lead to higher market data and exchange connectivity fees, due to the absence of competition.
The move could also create a single point of failure. Currently, if a glitch at one stock exchange prevents trading in certain stocks, those stocks can still trade on other exchanges, as happened on the NYSE on Wednesday in stocks including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.
On the positive side, the change would potentially reduce complexity and increase market stability efficiency, while making it easier for brokers to ensure they are getting the best prices for their clients.
Under Nasdaq's proposal, the new rule would apply to companies with an initial market capitalization of less than $700 million, or with a continued market capitalization of $2 billion or less; have an initial average daily trading volume of 100,000 shares or less; and have a bid price greater than $1.
There are 789 Nasdaq-listed companies with less than $700 million in market capitalization that would qualify based on trading volume and share price, Nasdaq said. 

The move would make it easier for the exchange to offer new financial incentives or market models, such as periodic auctions, for those names, which could encourage more trading, it added.

1464,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 04:22PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com – Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week
1. Tech Earnings, Bond Yields Take Centre Stage 
The busiest week of the U.S. corporate earnings season was upstaged somewhat by a surge in bond yields, which sparked investor concerns.
The 10Y US Treasury yield rose to a more than four-year high above 3% this week before retreating, raising investor questions about whether a rotation of some portfolio positions from equities to bonds would be warranted.
But stunning quarterly earnings from some of the mega cap tech names supported sentiment as Amazon, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) topped estimates.
Amazon was the pick of bunch, delivering a blowout earnings report, which beat on both the top and bottom lines. A slew of analysts upgraded their outlook on Amazon as the tech giant confirmed it would raise the price of its prime membership.
Shares of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) hit an all-time intraday high of $1,638.10 on Friday but retreated to closed at $1,572.62, up 3.60%, amid a broader stock market selloff as investors mulled softer first-quarter economic growth.
The Commerce Department Friday released its preliminary reading of first-quarter gross domestic product showing the U.S. economy expanded at a 2.3% annual rate as consumer spending slumped.
The NASDAQ closed roughly flat for the week at 7,119.80.
2. Crude Oil Prices Snap 2-Week Winning Streak
Crude oil prices settled lower on Friday, snapping a two-week winning streak but sentiment on oil prices remained mostly positive amid renewed investor expectations the U.S. is set to pull out of the Iranian nuclear deal.
If Trump does scrap the deal, it could lead to the re-imposition of secondary sanctions on Iran, pressuring countries to cut their purchases of Iranian crude, denting global supplies.
“We so not see the deal surviving past summer given the constellation of domestic and foreign forces aligned against it,” RBC said on Friday.
U.S. weekly crude supply totals also surprised investors after the Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday an unexpected build in crude supplies.
Yet, that was offset somewhat by a sharp uptick in crude exports to 2.331 million barrels last week, up more than 30% from 1.749 million barrels the prior week.
On Friday U.S. crude futures fell 9 cents higher at 68.10.
3. Dollar Extends Rally
The dollar picked up from where it left off last week, posting a second weekly win buoyed by rising bond yields and steep declines in both the pound and euro.
The U.S. 10Y treasury yield rose to a more than four year high this week above a key 3% level as traders bet that both inflation and economic growth would continue to warrant further rate hikes.
GBP/USD declined sharply on Friday to a low of $1.3748 as the pair recorded its second weekly loss in a row after UK GDP unexpectedly slumped in the first quarter.
Weakness in EUR/USD came on the back of European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's somewhat mixed message on the Eurozone economy on Thursday.
Draghi admitted that the pace of the Eurozone recovery had moderated broadly across all countries but reaffirmed his confidence that inflation would eventually hit the bank’s target.
The dollar traded roughly flat against a basket of major currencies on Friday.
4. Gold Prices Struggle to Recover
Gold prices rose on Friday but ultimately added to last week’s losses as sharp rallies in both the dollar and bond yields limited upside momentum.
Easing geopolitical uncertainty also kept a lid on a possible recovery in gold prices amid signs of progress toward peace talks on the Korean peninsula and improving U.S.-China relations.
The leaders of North and South Korea on Friday pledged to an end the Korean War and complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula as they met for a historic one-day summit.
5. Bitcoin: Return of the Hodlers?
Bitcoin was set to post its third weekly rise in a row for the first time since December as weakness seen during the week attracted a wave of buying pressure amid improved sentiment on cryptos.
Bitcoin rose to highs of $9,761 on Wednesday before retreating to a low of $8,656 as some suggested that the move close to $10,000 triggered technical resistance - trading levels that attract sellers.
Upbeat sentiment on bitcoin comes amid easing regulatory worries and the end of “tax selling,” leading some to suggest the Bitcoin rally is far from over.
“After fighting regulation headwinds and tax selling, the path of least resistance is higher, and I believe the sector still has much more upside in the long run,” President of Blue Line Futures Baruch told CNBC earlier this week.
Some crypto observers pointed to the rally in lesser known “altcoins” as a sign of renewed demand for cryptocurrencies.
EOS/USD, an altcoin linked to an innovative platform for decentralized applications, surged 56.75% over the past seven days, surpassing Litecoin as the fifth most valuable cypto by market cap.
Over the past seven days, Bitcoin rose 7.09% on the Bitfinex exchange, Ethereum rose 12.50%, while Ripple XRP fell 4.73% on the Poloniex exchange."
1465,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 09:32PM ET</span>","Canada stock markets, abruptly shut by technical issue, to resume on Monday","By Julie Gordon and John Tilak
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's stock market, the world's sixth-largest, abruptly shut down on Friday after an outage cut market participants off the main exchanges but will resume trading on Monday after resolving ""internal technical issues,"" the exchange operator said. 
TMX Group Ltd, which operates the main Toronto Stock Exchange and smaller trading platforms around Canada, said in a series of Tweets that all users had been ""equally impacted and are unable to connect to our exchanges"" and it decided to shut down markets for the remainder of the day. 
The operator said it had identified the issue, was working to fix it and trading would resume at its regular hour on Monday. 
The outage was not due to ""a hack,"" a Toronto Stock Exchange spokesman said. 
Shutdowns are rare occurrences because exchanges typically have back-up systems that quickly come online when there is a technical failure.
The TSX' last major outage occurred nearly a decade ago, when a system fault linked to data feeds shut down trading for a full day in 2008, including on the small-cap TSX Venture Exchange.
""In true Canadian fashion, most traders declared ‘beer o'clock' when they saw that the TMX was closed,"" said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments. ""It certainly appears to be a technical glitch but there does not seem to be a lot of information about exactly what caused it.""
The TMX, which has been vying to host Saudi Aramco's IPO overseas listing and exploring partnerships with bourses around the world, declined to elaborate on the nature of the technical issues.
The Ontario Securities Commission said it was in contact with the TMX, adding: ""We continue to monitor and watch the situation closely.""
""The remarkable thing is that outages don’t happen more frequently. These are big and complicated systems. They trade a remarkable volume of shares,” said Bryan Routledge, a Carnegie Mellon University professor and financial technology expert.
Outages can inconvenience investors and also prove expensive for the exchanges themselves. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, last month fined Intercontinental Exchange Inc’s New York Stock Exchange and two affiliate exchanges a total of $14 million for multiple regulatory failures related to disruptive market events.
The U.S.-listed shares of several Canada-based firms continued trading even as their Toronto-listed securities were idled by the outage. Blackberry (TO:BB) Ltd’s NYSE-listed shares, for example, were still trading hours after the company’s TSX-listed shares last traded at 1:38 p.m. EDT (1738 GMT).
""There should be failsafe backup systems that kick in right away,"" said Norman Levine, managing director at CFA Portfolio Management. ""Nobody needs to get in on a specific date but sometimes people need to get out. If you had to get out today it could have been an issue."" Toronto-based TMX first flagged the issue on Twitter shortly after 2 p.m. EDT, updating numerous times through the hour to say the issues were persisting and that an investigation was underway. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX Composite Index, the main Canadian index, was up 0.2 percent at 15,688.93 before the issues began. The market operates between 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. EDT. ""It is fatal for them (TMX) for today,"" said Peggy Bowie, senior trader at Manulife Asset Management. ""Orders have been shifted to other markets and my understanding is everybody will use the last board lot traded, regardless of where it has been traded, for the close."" The TMX said it would provide a complete list of closing prices later on Friday. 

Closing prices for Friday's truncated session will be determined by the final so-called ""board lot"" traded price, which refers to trades of at least a certain size. For stocks priced at least $1 a share, a board lot is 100 shares or more. Penny stock board lots have minimal sizes of 500 or 1,000 shares. TMX operates numerous Canadian exchanges, including the small-cap Venture Exchange, the TSX Alpha Exchange, as well as the Montreal Exchange, which trades derivatives, options and futures. TMX exchanges account for the bulk of Canadian securities trading.

1467,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 05:46PM ET</span>",Passenger sues Southwest Airlines over fatal engine explosion,"By Alana Wise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawsuit against Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) has been filed by a passenger who was flying on last week's flight 1380, in which an engine exploded and one person was killed.
The lawsuit claims that since the accident, the passenger, Lilia Chavez, has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression and other personal injuries. 
The lawsuit was filed on Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
Dallas-based Southwest has been under intense scrutiny in the days since a CFM56-7B engine on one of its Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-700 jets blew apart during an April 17 flight, shattering a plane window and flinging shrapnel.
Passenger Jennifer Riordan, one of 149 people aboard, was killed. The incident has raised concerns about the safety of similar engines.
Regulators at the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating.
""Our focus remains on working with the NTSB to support their investigation,"" Southwest said on Friday. ""We can't comment on any pending litigation. The safety and security of our employees and customers is our highest priority at all times."" 
Also named in the Thursday suit are France's  Safran  S.A. (PA:SAF),  General Electric  Aviation (N:GE) and CFM International, the manufacturers behind the engine that broke apart. CFM is a transatlantic joint-venture co-owned by GE and Safran.
The suit claims that Southwest and the engine makers had ""placed profits and business"" over passenger safety and continued to operate the engine ""even when there was confirmation that an unsafe condition existed.""
A Southwest flight in August 2016 with the same type of CFM56-7B engine made an emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated and debris ripped a hole above the left wing.
After the incident, European regulators gave airlines nine months to check the engines. U.S. regulators were still were considering what to do after proposing some checks.
""Despite knowing of the dangerous condition of the subject aircraft's engine, the defendants risked the lives of more than a hundred innocent passengers,"" including Chavez, the filing reads. 
A representative for GE did not return a request for comment. Safran could not immediately be reached.
The incident marked the first fatality on a U.S. commercial passenger airline since 2009.

Southwest shares closed up 0.4 percent. They have lost 18.2 percent year to date.

1469,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 09:34PM ET</span>","Rising costs, inflation on radar as U.S. earnings season unfolds","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fresh worries about rising costs and inflation face U.S. stock investors looking toward the coming week and the next leg of the first-quarter earnings period.
In the latest week, the busiest for first-quarter reports, several companies warned about or cited higher costs.
 Caterpillar  (N:CAT) said it was worried about higher prices for steel it needs for manufacturing. Alphabet (O:GOOGL) said margins were squeezed by rising costs related to marketing and acquiring streaming rights for YouTube's new TV service, while Procter & Gamble (N:PG) cited higher commodities and transportation costs.
Shares of all three companies declined even though their quarterly earnings were mostly strong. 
Investors will be alert for more signs of rising costs next week, which brings results from several big consumer names like Kellogg (N:K) and market-cap leader Apple (O:AAPL). Also on tap will be a Federal Reserve meeting, the April jobs report and data on wages and inflation.
The first quarter was the first reporting period since U.S. President Donald Trump in March imposed a duty on imports of steel and aluminum. Prices for those and other commodities have risen sharply, with U.S. crude oil (CLc1) up 7.5 percent in the first quarter. 
""The wind was at the backs of these companies for a long time. Now it's sort of turned. Input costs are up for most people,"" said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. 
""How are companies able to handle that, and what are they able to do to offset it? Those are the kinds of things investors will look at.""
Higher input costs squeeze profits for companies. Compounding these worries, the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries , a benchmark for rates, this week hit 3 percent for the first time in more than four years, requiring more cash to service company debt.
To be sure, estimated S&P 500 profit growth for the first quarter has risen since the start of the reporting period and is now on track to rise 24.6 percent, the strongest year-over-year growth since the fourth quarter of 2010, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is thanks largely to changes in the U.S. tax law that slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.
Some companies have had surprisingly strong results, like Facebook (O:FB), whose stock jumped 9.1 percent and helped support a rally in the market Thursday after its results. 
""Worries around corporate earnings are to what degree you're starting to see those input costs chip away at margins,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. So far, ""earnings growth is being produced by well above-trend levels of revenue."" S&P quarterly revenue growth is forecast at 8.1 percent.
But if cost and inflation worries undermine investor sentiment further, it could throw another obstacle in the U.S. stock market's attempt to reclaim record highs.
The S&P 500 (SPX) is flat since April 13, when JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) kicked off the earnings season, and the index is down about 7 percent from its Jan. 26 record high.
Among other consumer names expected to report next week are Clorox (N:CLX) and Kraft Heinz (O:KHC). 
The consumer staples sector has the second-weakest estimated profit growth after real estate for the quarter, at 12.1 percent, based on Thomson Reuters data.
The S&P consumer staples index (SPLRCS), down about 11.3 percent since Dec. 31, is the weakest sector in the S&P 500 so far this year.
A government report Friday said U.S. labor costs increased more than expected in the first quarter, and wages and salaries recorded their biggest gain since 2007. This may draw attention to average hourly earnings and other data in next Friday's U.S. jobs report.

""Companies are talking more about wages. I think they know (wage pressures) are around the corner,"" said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

1470,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 02:31PM ET</span>",Better battery packaging on planes overlooks other safety concerns: airlines,"By Allison Lampert and Jamie Freed
MONTREAL/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - New global packaging standards expected in late 2018 will allow lithium-ion batteries back into passenger plane cargo holds, pending design and regulatory approval, but some airlines say the new rule overlooks other safety concerns.
It will reverse a 2016 suspension due to fire risks, but some airlines argue that packaging alone will not fully protect against cargo battery fires because battery shipments are sometimes mislabeled. Airlines and battery makers want jet designs to factor in better cargo fire-safety measures. 
Carriers interviewed by Reuters described finding packages of mislabeled lithium-ion batteries, often by shippers trying to avert the ban. Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department, the regulator of the world's busiest air cargo hub, flagged cases of battery packages mislabeled in manifests as clothes, shoes and toys in a 2017 notice to airlines. 
It is not clear how many mislabeled battery packages are transported by air, or discovered, but carriers fear it could continue as some shippers try to avoid the anticipated higher costs of proper packaging. 
""The sheer number of batteries produced is growing and is measured in the billions,"" said Association of Asia Pacific Airlines Director-General Andrew Herdman. ""There is a problem with false declaration or non-declaration of such items.""
Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) conducts random checks to ensure packages are properly labeled, but it can't ""catch everyone,"" Rick Howell, general manager group safety and security, said at a recent Montreal safety conference.
That's why Howell and others are also calling for new jet models to include better cargo fire safety protections since planes were designed before the battery threat.
""Cargo holds of modern planes are lined with materials and equipped with fire suppression systems that aren't designed to contain a lithium ion battery fire,"" a spokeswoman for Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) said.
In January, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration identified at least 191 ""events"" involving lithium batteries producing smoke, fire, extreme heat or explosions in the air or at airports around the world since 1991.
While there have been no reported passenger deaths due to a battery fire, lithium-ion batteries were a contributing factor in the crash of an Asiana Airlines Inc (KS:020560) flight that killed the two pilots of a Boeing 747 freighter in 2011, according to a report by Korea's Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board.  The source of the fire that led to the crash was not determined, but the batteries were a factor because they were so flammable, the report said.
Both Boeing and Airbus (PA:AIR) said that they are working with industry to improve aviation safety and already meet or surpass standards.
U.S.-based PRBA, the rechargeable battery association, supports ""robust"" and ""cost-effective"" packaging standards but also believes planemakers should factor into their designs ""that large volumes of dangerous goods are transported by air,"" director George Kerchner said. 
New models such as Boeing's (N:BA) proposed mid-market jet could include modern fire-resistant materials as added protection, airlines said.
Aviation working groups are weighing new standards to improve cargo safety, but talks are at an early stage, Rudy Quevedo, the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) director of safety, said.
Modernizing planes would deliver an extra line of defense against fires but add costs to an industry already investing heavily in safety.
But airplane design alone is not the most effective way to prevent potential lithium-ion cargo hold battery fires, the FAA believes. 

""Operations, hazardous materials and airplane design have to work as a system, with each element contributing to safety, but no one element providing all the mitigations,"" a FAA spokesman said.

1471,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>","Deutsche Bank likely to axe 1,000 U.S. investment bank jobs: source","FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is expected to cut around 1,000 jobs or 10 percent of its workforce in the United States, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday, as the German lender scales back its global investment banking ambitions.
The bank has already axed 400 U.S.-based employees this week - of which around three quarters worked in its trading business and the rest in corporate finance, according to a second source who is a senior U.S.-based Deutsche Bank official. 
""I can tell you that the people who make money here will continue to get paid and be supported, because Deutsche Bank needs the revenue,"" the banker said. ""The challenge now is to keep our people.""
Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
On Thursday, the bank announced that it would make ""significant"" cuts at its investment bank, scaling back its corporate finance operations in the United States and Asia, U.S. government bond trading, and equities.
It did not provide specific numbers or a timeframe.
""We do not see increased fluctuation in the core areas of the bank,"" the bank said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Friday. ""Europe is the region in which we want to expand our market position. Here we want to grow and gain market share. Especially in Europe, we are the first choice for many investment bankers.""
The credit ratings agency Moody's on Friday changed its outlook to ""negative"" on some of its Deutsche Bank ratings. The ouster of CEO John Cryan, his replacement with Christian Sewing, and changes in focus at the lender ""highlight the strategic turmoil,"" Moody's said.
""It is not clear how management will create an investment bank more focused on European clients that can compete effectively against more diversified global peers, while also earning acceptable returns,"" the agency said.
A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the change in Moody's rating outlook.
The bank's shares fell 3.4 percent on Friday.  Credit Suisse  analysts said they had cut their estimates for Deutsche Bank's revenue in 2020 by 20 percent.
Credit ratings agency Standard & Poors, which had placed the bank on ""credit watch"" after the abrupt CEO change earlier this month, said late on Thursday that the bank's new direction ""lacks the specificity that we need to assess the credibility of this adjusted approach.""
Deutsche Bank's investment banking unit has been losing market share in recent years. In Europe so far this year, the bank has a 4 percent market share in investment banking fees, down from 6 percent of the market in 2013, according to ThomsonReuters data. Its ranking fell from second to sixth place. 
In the United States during that same period, Deutsche's share of fees dropped to 3.3 percent from 4.9 percent. It ranks ninth, behind all the Wall Street power houses but also European rivals such as  Barclays  (L:BARC) and Credit Suisse (S:CSGN). 

A large Deutsche investor called on the bank's leadership to explain its plans. ""Deutsche Bank must quickly create clarity so that business doesn't evaporate,"" the person said.

1472,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",German defense ministry says military budget plan 'unsatisfactory',"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German defense ministry is unhappy with what it views as an unsatisfactory military budget, and will have to postpone at least one major international weapons program unless more funds are added for 2019, ministry sources said on Friday.
The ministry negotiated a better-than-expected increase in military spending in 2019, but more funding would still be needed to plug continuing shortages in German military equipment after 25 years of declining spending, the sources said.
The new proposed budget would add 2.5 billion euros more than previously planned to the 2019 budget, and the budget would rise steadily from 39 billion euros this year to 42.2 billion euros in 2022, but that was not enough, the sources said. 
""That represents a significant increase, but is unsatisfactory when measured against the enormous pent-up needs for modernization,"" said one source.
""We achieved a lot for the Bundeswehr (German military) after difficult negotiations, but not everything. The Bundeswehr wants to and must rapidly close the gaps that exist after 25 years of underfunding in procurement,"" the official said.
Germany sharply curtailed military spending after the end of the Cold War, but began boosting spending again after Russia's annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014. 
Reports by the ministry and parliament this year raised concerns that missing spare parts and quality defects had curtailed the readiness of Germany's submarines, warplanes and some other key weapons.
The ministry said the minister had ordered that funds should be prioritized to pay for digitalization and personal equipment for soldiers, but that meant that at least one planned major international weapons program would have to be postponed unless additional funds were added to the 2019 budget.
No additional details were immediately available. Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet is due to debate the budget plans at a cabinet meeting next Wednesday.
Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen and French Defense Minister Florence Parly on Thursday signed documents to move forward on joint development and procurement of a new combat jet and other programs.
Germany is also due to kick off several major procurement programs for new heavy-lift helicopters and warships. 
The defense ministry said the finance ministry would cover some 875 million euros in added costs triggered by a recent wage agreement for soldiers and other public sector workers, but gaps remained in the modernization budget.
A government source said defense spending as a percentage of economic output would rise to 1.3 percent in 2019 but fall after that as long as budget agreements remain the same and current economic forecasts prove true.
That means it will be well below the 2 percent quota demanded by the military alliance and could add another layer of complication to talks between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Trump on Friday in Washington.
Ministry sources said the new budget plan would result in a reduction of development spending as a percentage of GDP from 0.5 percent to 0.47 percent, despite a firm commitment in the coalition agreement between conservatives and Social Democrats to boost development spending to 0.7 percent of GDP, in line with commitments made to the United Nations.
""The Development Ministry and the Defense Ministry expect that this gap will be closed in line with the contract as part of further budgetary processes,"" the source said.
The coalition agreement also calls for any additional funds made available for development to be matched equally for the defense budget, the source added.

1474,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 01:44PM ET</span>",GM CEO Barra’s pay dipped slightly to $22 million in 2017,"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co’s (N:GM) top executive, Mary Barra, was paid just under $22 million in 2017, slightly less than the previous year, according to the automaker’s proxy statement released on Friday.
Barra’s total compensation package was valued at $21,958,048, about $625,000 less than the $22,582,059 package she received in 2016. Barra, GM’s chairman and chief executive officer, was paid $28,588,663 in 2015.
Barra's pay package included a salary of $2.1 million; stock awards worth $10.74 million; options worth $3.25 million, and a performance award worth $4.96 million. 
GM said its board of directors last year set stricter performance targets for its top executives, in noting that performance awards generally were lower in 2017. 
The automaker on Thursday reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, but investors disappointed by the automaker's lower pretax profit sent its shares down more than 2 percent. 
GM shares were down 1 percent at $37.87 on Friday afternoon.
Barra remained GM’s highest-paid executive. President Dan Ammann last year was paid $9,258,318, compared with $10,223,984 in 2016 and $11,800,077 in 2015.
Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens received $7,101,039. Executive Vice President Mark Reuss, who heads global product development, purchasing and supply chain, was paid $7,726,508, and Executive Vice President Alan Batey, who heads North American operations, was paid $5,975,128.
GM also awarded $6,888,039 to Karl-Thomas Neumann, former president of GM’s European operations, the bulk of which were sold to French automaker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) last year.
The company’s annual shareholders meeting is scheduled for June 12 at GM headquarters in Detroit.

There are three outside shareholder proposals: To make the chairman an independent board member; permitting shareholders to act by written consent; and requesting that GM publish a report on the sustainability of its future vehicles. GM management has recommended that shareholders vote against all three proposals.

1477,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",WPP digital boss Read prepares to step into Sorrell's shoes for first quarter results,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - WPP's digital boss Mark Read will get the chance to stake his claim to the top job at the world's biggest advertising company when he helps to present its first set of results without founder Martin Sorrell on Monday.
Sorrell, who built a two-man business into one of Britain's biggest companies with operations in 112 countries, never missed a quarterly results presentation and routinely appeared on TV and radio shows to discuss everything from advertising trends to global economic events and politics.
He stood down two weeks ago after the board opened an investigation into allegations of personal misconduct, sparking a hunt for a replacement after 33 years and at a time when the company is facing challenges on every front. 
Sorrell denied the allegations and the company has said they will not be made public. 
Read is seen as the leading internal candidate to become chief executive after he spent almost nine years on the WPP (LON:WPP) board from 2006 to 2015. He has also worked on strategy, acquisitions and digital operations since he wrote to Sorrell and secured a job in 1989. 
On Monday, he will join his co-chief operating officer Andrew Scott, Finance Director Paul Richardson and Executive Chairman Roberto Quarta in presenting the first-quarter results, while Read will also speak to the media. 
""I've spent as much time as possible speaking to our people and clients,"" Read wrote in a memo to staff last week. ""There's universal admiration for Martin's achievements, and sadness about his departure. 
""At the same time, there's a huge amount of support and goodwill for the company, and no shortage of confidence about the future.""
The company will consider internal and external candidates.
Whoever takes over the top job will face a difficult task, however, after the group published in March its weakest results since the financial crash due to lower spending from consumer goods groups like  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) and P&G and competition from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
It forecast no growth in net sales in 2018 and analysts are expecting a first-quarter figure of down 1 percent or worse.
""Despite the change of CEO, other things are unlikely to change at WPP near term,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note. ""We expect WPP to stay with its guidance which is for organic flat net sales growth in 2018 and a flat underlying margin in constant currency.""
The sudden departure of Sorrell has also sparked speculation as to whether the holding group can remain in its current form of employing 200,000 people in more than 400 agencies now that clients want a more joined-up offering. 
Read told colleagues he did not believe breaking the business up made sense. ""In a world where clients need faster, more agile, integrated solutions, we need to get closer together, not further apart,"" he said.

WPP is the last of the big four advertising agencies to update the market after Omnicom (N:OMC), Publicis (PA:PUBP) and IPG (N:IPG) all reported strong first-quarter results.

1491,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 07:08PM ET</span>","T-Mobile, Sprint finalizing merger terms: sources","By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) and Sprint Corp (N:S) are finalizing terms as they seek to sign a merger by Monday that could value Sprint at around $26 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The combined company, with more than 127 million customers, would have added clout to challenge industry leaders  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) and AT&T Inc (N:T) in the race to expand offerings in next-generation 5G wireless technology.
T-Mobile majority-owner Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) will own a little over 40 percent of the combined company, but will have voting control so it can consolidate the company on its books, the sources said. The sources requested anonymity to discuss the confidential negotiations.
Sprint shares ended up 8.3 percent at $6.50 on the news first reported by Reuters, close to where the deal values the company based on the implied stock exchange ratio tied to T-Mobile's shares. T-Mobile shares rose 0.6 percent to $64.52, giving the company a market capitalization of $55 billion.
T-Mobile and Sprint are aiming to announce the deal on Sunday, though the timing could change, the sources said. Talks between Deutsche Telekom and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), Sprint's controlling shareholder, could still end unsuccessfully at the last minute, the sources added.
Deutsche Telekom owns more than 63 percent of T-Mobile, while SoftBank owns 84.7 percent of Sprint.
Sprint, T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank did not respond to requests for comment.
The companies came close to a merger deal in November before SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son pulled out of the talks at the last minute over valuation disagreements. Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges left the door open by saying, ""You always meet twice in life.""
Even though Sprint's customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by discounting. Analysts have said that without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market.
T-Mobile, under CEO John Legere, has fared better than Sprint, even if it remains a distant third to Verizon and AT&T. It has scored sustained market share gains, as innovative offerings, improving network performance and good customer service attract new customers, according to Moody's Investors Service Inc.
T-Mobile became the first major U.S. carrier to eliminate two-year contracts, a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has also unsettled rivals with its unlimited data plans.
Regulatory hurdles could also block to the deal. Sprint and T-Mobile's first round of merger talks ended in 2014 after U.S. President Barack Obama's administration expressed antitrust concerns about it.
AT&T agreed to acquire U.S. media company  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX) in October 2016 for $85 billion. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued to block the deal over concerns about the companies' pricing power in the media market. AT&T and Time Warner are defending their proposed merger in court.

The U.S. government has also opened a probe into alleged coordination by AT&T, Verizon Communications and a telecommunications standards organization to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers, a person briefed on the matter said last week. This signals U.S. regulators' growing concern about consumer prices.

BOSTON (Reuters) -  Wynn Resorts Ltd  (O:WYNN) on Friday proposed renaming a planned $2.5 billion casino in Massachusetts following allegations that founder Steve Wynn routinely subjected women who worked for him to unwanted sexual advances.
Wynn Chief Executive Matt Maddox at a meeting before the Massachusetts Gaming Commission in Boston formally proposed renaming the Wynn Boston Harbor project ""Encore Boston Harbor.""
""This company is not about a man,"" Maddox said.
The announcement came at a hearing in which the five-member panel considered the Las Vegas-based company's request to remove Wynn's name from its state casino license after he divested his ownership interests in Wynn Resorts.
State regulators have been conducting a review related to sexual misconduct allegations involving Wynn, the long-time face of the company who resigned as CEO in February following a report by the Wall Street Journal.
The newspaper said former and current company staff members it interviewed accused Wynn of creating a hostile work environment for women and of regularly pressuring employees to perform sex acts.
Reuters has not independently verified the allegations. 
Wynn, 76, has denied the accusations as ""preposterous."" The billionaire divested himself of his entire 11.8 percent stake in Wynn Resorts in March.
At Friday's meeting, Maddox - who took over as CEO in February - detailed steps Wynn Resorts had taken to distance itself from its founder and adjust its corporate culture, including by adding three women to its board of directors.
""We are taking these issues very seriously,"" he said.
Commissioners at the hearing sought to understand what if any ties Wynn still has to company to determine whether he should be removed as ""qualifier"" for the purposes of its 2014 casino license.
Qualifiers, who must pass a state background check, can include top executives and shareholders as well people with close business associations with a licensee.
Brian Kelly, a lawyer for Wynn, in a letter made public earlier this month contended that the commission should no longer consider his client part of the project in Everett, Massachusetts. 
The casino is scheduled to open in 2019.
Asked on Friday about the planned casino's renaming, Kelly said in a statement: ""Mr. Wynn is no longer a shareholder or executive of the company and it is entirely up to the company as to what the casino is called in the future.""

Prosecutors had alleged the running of the bank had been secretly influenced by two groups of core shareholders led by Giovanni Bazoli, honorary chairman of bank  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), and Emilio Zanetti, who are both among those sent to trial.
The bank itself must also stand trial, which is due to start on July 25.
UBI, which in the past has said it had always acted correctly, had no immediate comment.
The shareholder groups are suspected of having unduly influenced the outcome of the 2013 annual general meeting by collecting proxy votes without having previously informed market watchdog Consob and the Bank of Italy.

1498,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 10:56AM ET</span>",JP Morgan AM says 10-year bond bear market has begun,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Global bonds are in the early stages of what will be a decade-long bear market as a removal of post-crisis stimulus by the world's major central banks pushes yields higher, a top investor told Reuters.
But Bob Michele, who heads global fixed income for JP Morgan's investment arm, said higher bond yields would not lead to a stronger dollar because of concerns that promised U.S. fiscal stimulus measures imply more government borrowing. 
""I think we're in the early stages of a bond bear market,"" Michele, who oversees some $500 billion of assets under management, said in an interview.
He said the rise in borrowing costs will not be uniform and will be ""populated by periodic rallies"", but that generally speaking the market has entered a 10-year trend towards higher interest rates. 
""I think we have lived in an era where central banks have distorted yields and they have done it for so long that there's a group of people who are starting the business who don't know anything other than distorted yields,"" he added. 
Led by the U.S. Federal Reserve, central banks have begun withdrawing the extraordinary stimulus they pumped into their economies following the global financial crisis a decade ago, boosting asset prices as they flooded global markets with cash. 
The value of central bank asset purchases have shrunk to about a quarter of the size of what they were a year ago and by JP Morgan Asset Management's estimates, central bank expansion will turn into contraction in the fourth quarter of this year. 
""That becomes more problematic for the markets to digest,"" said Michele, the asset manager's chief investment officer for commodities, currencies and rates.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) rose above a key psychological level of 3 percent this week, peaking at 3.04 percent on Wednesday on concerns about rising inflation and growing borrowing by the U.S. government.
A Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) index measuring the performance of U.S. Treasury debt has weakened 2.4 percent so far this year after gaining by more than 22 percent between Jan. 1, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data.
While yields have since fallen back below 3 percent, they are still holding near more than four-year highs and have climbed over 60 basis points this year. 
The rise has been equally eye-catching at the shorter end of the curve, causing the spread between two-year and 10-year debt, a proxy for market expectations of how the economy will perform over that time-frame, to tighten to less than 50 basis points.
As the U.S. Federal Reserve has stayed on course in raising interest rates -- JP Morgan expects three more rate hikes this year -- concerns have grown that the yield curve may invert, signaling a U.S. recession.

""I think the market is right in that as the Fed is raising rates, they won't stop until there is a slowdown, and by then it will be too late because of the lag in monetary policy and they'll have triggered the next recession,"" Michele said.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) 20 percent hike in the cost of Prime membership should deliver more than $1 billion in extra revenue this year and cover any ""rational"" hike in United States Postal Service delivery fees, Wall Street analysts said on Friday.
President Donald Trump has been laying into the Seattle-based online shopping firm in recent weeks for what he says is a deal with publicly-owned USPS which effectively lumps much of the cost of thousands of daily deliveries onto U.S. taxpayers.
Trump has said that if USPS raised parcel rates, Amazon would face $2.6 billion in extra cost, although equity analysts who follow billionaire Jeff Bezos' company estimate a much lower number and say the deal may actually be keeping USPS afloat.
Several said that Thursday's move by the company to raise Prime fees to $119 a year from $99 starting June 16 would not faze many of Prime's estimated 60-65 million U.S. members. 
""The incremental $20 membership fee could result in an incremental $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of revenue which should more than offset any rational USPS price increase,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Lloyd Walmsley said.
Shares of the company were up 7.4 percent to a record high of $1630 in premarket trading on Friday as investors lauded another blockbuster quarter that delivered profits of $1.6 billion and revenue of $51 billion. 
""Amazon delivered a humongous quarter, with faster growth and higher profitability than Street projections and followed up with a one-two punch by announcing it was raising annual Prime membership fee,"" Deutsche Bank Lloyd Walmsley said.
The 20 percent hike was the second time Amazon had increased its Prime subscription fee since the launch of the service in 2005.
The service, crucial in driving purchases of both goods and digital media on Amazon, gives members free delivery, access to movies and original series through Prime Video, on-demand music streaming and free books on Prime Reading.
That appears to put it on a collision course with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the streaming market - but analysts say Bezos is more interested in how the appeal of the service props up his retail empire. 
Amazon disclosed last week it now has more than 100 million Amazon Prime members globally and commentators said it would likely raise prices outside of the United States as well.

""So far there is no word on international price hikes but with the expansion of shipping services and content worldwide, it wouldn't be unreasonable to see them,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed nearly flat on Friday as inflation worries and struggling technology and energy stocks were offset by an advance in the consumer discretionary sector led by Amazon.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq eked out small gains while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged into negative territory by the end of the session.
All three major U.S. indexes were down for the week at the end of a choppy session, ending two-week winning streaks.
""There's a ton of cross-currents going on in the market right now and consequently you get trading days like this where the market can't seem to make up its mind what it wants to do,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.
Growth in the U.S. economy slowed in the first quarter as consumer spending grew at its weakest pace in nearly five years, according to the Commerce Department. But a jump in wages and lower tax rates suggested the setback could be temporary.
The U.S. Treasuries yield curve flattened as the growth data renewed bets that the Federal Reserve would continue hiking benchmark U.S. interest rates to keep inflation in check.
Wages and salaries increased at their fastest pace in 11 years, according to a report from the Labor Department, adding to inflation jitters.
As companies warn of higher costs eroding margins, markets have fluctuated as investors focus on guidance in the face of the strongest quarterly profit growth in seven years.
""You've got investors grappling with a new environment of volatility and how to handle that,"" said Carlson. ""That means a market like we have now, kind of manic-depressive, passive-aggressive."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 11.15 points, or 0.05 percent, to 24,311.19, the S&P 500 gained 2.97 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,669.91 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.12 points, or 0.02 percent, to 7,119.80.
More than half of the S&P 500 companies have reported first-quarter earnings already, 79.4 percent of which have beat consensus estimates. Analysts now expect first-quarter earnings growth of 24.6 percent, more than double expectations at the beginning of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) led the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, helping them close in positive territory as the online retailer's shares rose 3.6 percent on the heels of a blockbuster earnings report. Brokerage firms have begun to value the company in excess of $1 trillion.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was up 1.7 percent as the technology bellwether beat first-quarter expectations and grew its cloud computing services.
Following a profit miss,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) weighed on the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, falling 3.8 percent.
Sprint jumped 8.3 percent following a Reuters report that the wireless carrier and rival T-Mobile were finalizing terms of a merger.
Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the defensive telecom and real estate sectors posting the biggest percentage gains, at 1.75 percent and 1.32 percent respectively.
The Exxon drop pulled the energy index down 1.2 percent, the biggest percentage loser.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.42-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and seven new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 60 new highs and 57 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.13 billion shares, compared to the 6.62 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

1516,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 07:32AM ET</span>",Pound Outlook Fades as Traders Slash Bets on May BOE Hike,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s back to the drawing board for pound bulls.
Money markets have slashed bets on the Bank of England raising borrowing costs when it meets in two weeks, with the odds for an increase collapsing to 20 percent from above 50 percent on Thursday. That led the pound to fall 1.2 percent, with MUFG and Mizuho Bank Ltd. planning to cut their sterling forecasts after expecting a continued rally this year.
Sterling investors were primed for disappointment after a run of soft economic data and words of caution from BOE Governor Mark Carney last week, yet Friday’s 0.1 percent growth figure for the first quarter was below all survey estimates. The pound’s drop this week has taken the shine off a rally in 2018 based on reduced Brexit concerns and expectations for continued monetary policy tightening.
“May is likely off the agenda now for the Bank of England,” said Neil Jones, head of hedge fund sales at Mizuho. “The pound is selling off hard. A 0.1 percent reading that goes beyond the bad weather suggests the slowdown is more structural.”
Jones, who had expected the pound to climb to $1.45 this year, said it should trade down to the $1.35 area now. Lee Hardman, a strategist at MUFG who saw the pound at $1.44 by the end of the second quarter, said the bank’s forecast will be lowered in an update next week.
The pound fell 1.2 percent to an eight-week low of $1.3757. Any break of early March lows at $1.3712 would be significant on a technical basis, according to Ned Rumpeltin, the European head of foreign-exchange strategy at TD Bank. Gilts rallied, with the yieldon 10-year government bonds falling five basis points to 1.45 percent.
Money markets have pushed back full pricing for the next BOE interest-rate hike to December. Traders will next be watching comments from Carney and fellow BOE policy maker Andy Haldane, both due to speak later on Friday, ahead of the bank’s May 10 meeting.
“It is difficult to hold on to a May hike after the scale of weakness in the GDP report even if we doubt that it is a true reflection of the underlying health of the economy,” said Hardman. “As we can see already, it has killed the pound’s upward momentum in the near-term. On top of that the latest Brexit developments over the Irish border and customs unions have become less supportive for the pound.”

BERN (Reuters) - A switch to so-called sovereign money risks plunging Switzerland into ""great uncertainty"", Swiss National Bank (SNB) Chairman Thomas Jordan said on Friday, ahead of a June 10 referendum on the issue.
The sovereign money initiative aims to bar commercial banks from creating money electronically and reserve for the SNB the sole right to create money in Switzerland. The proposal will be put to voters under the country's system of direct democracy.
The SNB, the Swiss parliament and the government oppose the scheme, which would make Switzerland a guinea pig for a new financial system that has never been tried elsewhere.
""Switching to an untested sovereign money regime would radically transform Switzerland's tried-and-tested financial framework,"" Jordan told the SNB's annual general meeting.
""Given the lack of empirical data and comparable systems worldwide, such a transformation risks plunging Switzerland into a period of great uncertainty,"" he said.
Supporters of the initiative, who have gathered the 100,000 signatures needed to trigger a vote, say their proposals will make the Swiss banking system more secure and less complicated.
A Tamedia poll published on Friday showed 42 percent of voters back the initiative and 45 percent are against.
Campaigners said the SNB should not tell people how to vote.
""The SNB can give their expertise when the proposals are being discussed, but now that we are in the campaigning phase they should be strictly neutral,"" said Martin Alder, an economist and member of the sovereign money campaign.
He accused Jordan of abusing his position in the debate, and said he should resign if he wanted to campaign.
""The SNB has been in the forefront of the campaign against our proposal, but it is for the people to decide the issues. The SNB should refrain from campaigning for one side or the other.""

Jordan countered by saying the SNB had a duty to comment on issues which directly affected the central bank and the Swiss financial system.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Two out of Japan's three big power utilities projected a decline in electricity sales in the new business year as new entrants continue to grab market share following liberalization of the 8 trillion yen ($73 billion) retail power market two years ago. 
Japan's former 10 power monopolies have barely recovered from the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, the resultant high fuel costs after most reactors were shut and costly safety upgrades. They now face an exodus of customers with Japan's retail market thrown open to hundreds of firms.
Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) (T:9501), Kansai Electric Power (T:9503) and Chubu Electric Power (T:9503) have lost some 5.7 million retail power customers who have switched to new electricity providers since the sector was fully liberalised in April 2016.
Though the power utilitiies are trying to offset the losses by winning new customers outside their home turf, they are having a hard time halting the decline in overall power sales.
Top-ranked Tepco projected group power sales to fall 2.9 percent in 2018/19, after posting a 1.4 percent drop in the year ended March 31.
""The competition in the (Tokyo) Metropolitan area is very severe,"" Tepco Holdings President Tomoaki Kobayakawa told reporters when asked about the decline in power sales. 
Kansai Electric posted a steep 5.1 percent decline in power sales in 2017/18 but did not make projections for the new year. Chubu Electric was the only one among the top three power utilities to post a 0.9 percent gain in group power sales in 2017/18, but projected a 1.8 percent decline in the new business year.
The three utilities this week posted higher recurring profits in the year ended March 31 due to higher energy prices, but the decline in power sales has been weighing on profit. 
Reiji Ogino, senior analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities, has said that though the power utilities do not report details about the adverse impact on earnings from the customer losses, the impact should not be minimal. 
To offset declining power sales, many of Japanese power utilities have entered the 2.4 trillion yen retail city gas market that were opened up for competition a year ago and selling power outside their home turfs.

SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's expanding business of selling space on its site to merchants helped it double profits on Thursday, and some see the move as a step toward taking advertising dollars from Google and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). 
With $2 billion or less of advertising revenue, Amazon is dwarfed by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Facebook, often called an internet duopoly, but it is growing fast, may be outselling ads on  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and Snapchat, and it has advantages that other contenders lack.
Amazon has users' purchase data and knows what shoppers need, said Jason Damata, founder of Fabric Media, which advises companies on marketing and business strategy.
Google knows what people are searching for, while Facebook only knows “what you want your friends to think you like,” Damata said.
Some of his clients began directing their ad budgets to get customers to buy their products on Amazon, Damata said, and saw sales jump as a result.
Amazon does not break out ad sales alone. It says advertising sales are the majority of its ""other"" section, which hit $2.0 billion in the first quarter. After adjusting for accounting changes, that is a 72 percent increase from a year earlier, Amazon said.
Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky called the ad sales business ""a multibillion dollar program and growing very quickly."" Advertisers of all sizes were interested in sponsored product ads ""to drive brand awareness, discovery or hopefully, purchase,"" he said.
Internet research firm eMarketer last October forecast Amazon would hit $3.19 billion in net U.S. digital ad revenues by 2019, or 3.0 percent of digital ad spending. 
Established advertising firms also have taken notice. Martin Sorrell, the founder of the world's largest advertising company WPP (LON:WPP), who stepped down in mid-April, last month saw Amazon in ""head-to-head"" competition with Google and Facebook. Sorrell added that WPP had directed $200 million of its clients' ad budgets to Amazon in 2017 and predicted that number would rise to $300 million this year.

""Amazon is coming over the hill. Amazon certainly poses a big threat on search and advertising,"" he said, adding that its voice assistant, Alexa, would make it an even stronger competitor.

Growth in organic sales slowed in the first quarter from the previous quarter, even as the company spent more on advertising and invested in price to spur demand for its products that range from Brite dishwashers and Palmolive shower gel.
The world's largest toothpaste maker spent nearly 13 percent more on advertising this quarter over the prior quarter, while it cut prices between 0.5 percent and 2.5 percent in Europe and North America.
Organic sales, which exclude benefits from acquisitions and divestitures, rose 1.5 percent as the company saw no growth in volumes in developing markets.
""The first quarter was a challenging one as category growth remained soft in many markets around the world,"" Chief Executive Officer Ian Cook said in a statement.
Sales in Latin America, the company's biggest market, rose just 0.5 percent to $929 million, hit by a slump in demand in Mexico.
But demand rose in North America and Europe, on the back of price cuts, helping Colgate's net sales rise 6.4 percent to $4 billion, just in-line with the average analyst estimate of $4.02 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""Today's results show that Colgate, despite its competency as global consumer products leader, remains vulnerable to macroeconomic uncertainty in addition to what we think is an increasingly sophisticated set of local competitors,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog said.
Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) earlier this month also posted organic sales growth that disappointed Wall Street, mainly because of pricing pressures in an environment where retailers are cutting back on costs.
Still, Colgate's stock has outperformed peers. While the S&P 500 Household Products <.SPLRCPROD> index has fallen more than 18 percent in this year, Colgate shares are down 12 percent. In comparison, P&G's shares are down 21 percent.
Net income rose to $634 million, or 72 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $570 million, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding certain items, the company earned 74 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 72 cents.

Shares of the New York-based company fell 3.6 percent to $64.20 before the bell on Thursday, set to hit a fifteen-month low.

1528,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>","From Volkswagen to Bunge, concession holders in Brazil face hefty bill","By Bruno Federowski and Leonardo Goy
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Companies from Brazilian state oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA to commodities giant Louis Dreyfus Company and German car giant Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) could face hefty bills after Brazil's Supreme Court this month allowed local governments to charge property taxes to operators of public concessions.
The ruling settled an 18-year old spat between Petrobras (SA:PETR4), as the state-controlled oil company is known, and the city of Santos, home of Brazil's busiest container port.
Even though Petrobras does not own the terminal, and only operates it under a concession, the court ruled that it was liable to pay tax on the property.
Now Santos is demanding the oil giant and other terminal operators pay an estimated 300 million reais ($85.5 million) in back taxes and foot an annual tax bill that could total 13 million reais a year.
""This will have ramifications throughout Brazil,"" Santos mayor Paulo Barbosa told Reuters in an interview. ""Any port city - every city that is home to any concessions - may now charge property taxes on them.""
Property taxes in Brazil are set at the city level and usually hover around 1.5 percent of property values.
Santos could become the first of many regional governments to seek redress from operators of everything from ports and highways to airports as a slower-than-expected economic recovery in Latin America's largest economy has made authorities desperate for tax revenues.
Though the annual value of tax payments going forward may be small, at an annual average of around 200,000 reais ($57,136) per terminal in Santos, the city government wants to collect back taxes stretch back to 2000, when the suit was first filed.
The Supreme Court, by stating its ruling was generally applicable, has opened the door for other cities to follow suit, though there is still legal uncertainty over how far back unpaid taxes can be claimed.
Venilton Tadini, head of Brazil's association of infrastructure operators, said he expects local governments, which have seen tax collection slump due to the weak economy, to rush at the opportunity of raising revenues.
The association for highway operators said in a statement that local governments have already contacted ""several"" of its members to charge property taxes on toll roads, roadways and even catwalks.
An unexpected tax bill could deal a blow to a wide range of companies, including not only listed Brazilian firms such as toll-road operator CCR SA (SA:CCRO3) and rail firm Rumo SA (SA:RAIL3), but also foreign behemoths such as commodities traders  Bunge  (N:BG) and Louis Dreyfus Company and car manufacturer Volkswagen, which operate port terminals in Brazil.
Representatives for the companies and the government declined to comment.
RENEGOTIATIONS
With margins on many of the contracts tight, the ruling could trigger renegotiations to offset the new taxes by increasing federal payments to concession operators or by allowing them to raise their tariffs more than currently forecast.
This could pose a fresh obstacle to the federal government's efforts to curb a mounting fiscal deficit, while also elevating the notoriously high logistical costs for companies operating in Brazil.
""Either the federal government transfers money to local governments or prices will have to change. Margins are far too tight,"" said José Di Bella Filho, the head of the port terminals association.
Charging property taxes on public concessions could also threaten future auctions of public services, the association said.
This would add fresh difficulties to government efforts to join forces with the private sector to renew the nation's ageing infrastructure, a flagship initiative of President Michel Temer, who is considering whether to seek reelection in October.
Temer's administration undertook a string of infrastructure auctions after he took office in 2016, following the impeachment of his predecessor Dilma Rousseff, seeking to tap newfound demand for Brazilian assets.
A government source involved in concessions, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject, said the Supreme Court decision generated legal uncertainty that could drive investors away from future auctions.
That could be a heavy blow to Brazil's economic prospects. In a February survey, OECD singled out infrastructure investments as crucial to boosting Brazil's economic growth.
""Almost all areas of infrastructure are characterized by quality shortcomings and bottlenecks,"" the report said. ""Brazilian companies suffer from high costs of transport and logistics, which reduce the profitability of many otherwise viable investment projects.""

The blue-chip Dow futures fell 79 points, or 0.32%, by 6:52AM ET (10:52GMT), the S&P 500 futures lost 5 points, or 0.18%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures gained 14 points, or 0.20%
Gains in the Nasdaq were expected on Friday after stellar results were reported after the prior day’s close.
Shares of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) rallied around 7% to in pre-market trade on Friday, after the e-commerce giant posted earnings that beat on both the top and bottom line.
Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also gained nearly 4% in pre-market trade on Friday after the computer giant also topped consensus expectations.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) also delivered and saw shares jump more than 5% pre-market after reporting the biggest-ever quarterly jump in its data center business.
 Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) will be among other firms releasing quarterly earnings before Friday’s opening bell.
With nearly 50% of S&P 500 firms having released their reports, more than 70% of those have beat on both the top and bottom line and the first quarter is showing the best rates of growth in sales and profit in any quarter since 2010.
On the economic front, investors looked ahead to the preliminary reading of first-quarter U.S. growth due at 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT) Friday to gauge if the world's largest economy is strong enough to withstand multiple rate hikes in the coming months.
The report is expected to show growth in the January-March period slowing from an annual rate of 2.9% to 2.0%, as consumer spending is forecast to have slowed sharply from the last quarter.
Despite the expected slowdown, the data is unlikely to make much impact on Fed policymakers given the expected boost over the coming months from the Trump administration tax cuts.
However, central banks are closely watching growth figures for signs of a global slowdown. The U.S. data will arrive after the UK registered its slowest growth in five years earlier on Friday, while the French economy also slowed more than expected to its lowest level since the third quarter of 2016.
Markets are largely expecting the Federal Reserve to stand pat on policy when it meets next week. The lack of changes would follow similar decisions by both the Bank of Japan earlier on Friday and the European Central Bank on Thursday.
In other data to be released stateside on Friday, the University of Michigan will publish its revision of consumer sentiment for April at 10:00AM ET (14:00GMT). A slight uptick to 98.0 from the initial reading of 97.8 is the consensus forecast.
While waiting for the economic data, the dollar extended gains against major rivals and, on track for a weekly rise of around 1.7%, was celebrating its best week since November 2016.
On the geopolitical front, American traders will rise on Friday to the news of a historic peace agreement between North and South Korea. In a joint declaration, both leaders confirmed the common goal of realizing, through complete denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and declared that “there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula and thus a new era of peace has begun”.
Elsewhere, European stocks headed for a fifth straight week of gains as well-received earnings from Spanish banks and a recovery in tech shares buoyed sentiment.
Earlier, Asian stocks closed higher as investors celebrated a rebound in tech stocks while markets in Seoul were underpinned by optimism as leaders of North and South Korea held their first summit in over a decade.
Meanwhile, oil was trading lower on Friday as investors waited for the weekly installment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday at 1:00PM ET (17:00GMT). The report will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand after data last week showed the number of U.S. oil rigs rose for the third straight week, driving worries that rising U.S. output could potentially derail OPEC's effort to end a supply glut"

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's largest listed wealth manager AMP (AX:AMP) engaged in ""unconscionable"" conduct and the country's biggest banks also broke laws when providing financial advice, a powerful judicial inquiry said in its preliminary findings on Friday.
They were announced by Rowena Orr, a barrister assisting the year-long inquiry into financial sector misconduct. Her remarks ended the second round of the inquiry, which focused on financial advice.
The Royal Commission, as the judicial inquiry is called, has been a political embarrassment for the government and a severe setback for Australia's major lenders and AMP, which have come under share price pressure as a result of revelations of serious wrongdoing.
The second set of hearings, which began two weeks ago, was told that over the last decade advisers at AMP had misappropriated funds of thousands of clients by charging them without providing advice and that Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) had continued to charge some client accounts even after they had died.
The inquiry also heard that for many years Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) have not had adequate controls to ensure its advisers were complying with the law, and that some National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) advisers had engaged in dishonest and illegal conduct such as misappropriation of client funds.
Under questioning, bank executives have admitted to many of the instances of misconduct, but they will also have the opportunity to respond to Friday's preliminary findings.
Persons guilty of breaching some of the sections of the Corporations Act mentioned by Orr in her findings face criminal penalties, according to lawyers. 
Orr said on Friday that CBA as well as AMP, which is facing calls for the immediate resignation of its board over the misconduct, also breached a number of sections of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Act.
""It is open to the Commissioner (leading the inquiry) to find that this conduct was attributable, at least in part, to the culture and governance practices within AMP,"" Orr said, adding that the conduct by CBA was due to its remuneration practices and inherent conflict of interests in its businesses. 
Orr said the inquiry would consider whether the regulatory culture in the financial advice industry contributed to the misconduct and what changes where needed to correct it.
""Can financial advisers effectively manage the conflicts of interests associated with providing advice as a representative of an institution that also manufactures financial products? Is it necessary to enforce the separation of products and advice?"" she said.
The banks, AMP and the corporate regulator will have one week to respond to the preliminary findings and to submit their opinions of whether the industry needs to be radically restructured to fix the wrongdoings.
The inquiry's final recommendations could lead to criminal or civil prosecutions as well as greater regulation on the financial sector.
The effectiveness of the Australian corporate regulator in enforcing the law was also scrutinised.
Louise Macauley, who heads the financial advisers unit at ASIC, told the inquiry earlier on Friday that the regulator had not used its powers to impose bans sufficiently to deal with the egregious conduct exposed by the inquiry.
The regulator also said that in the last decade, it had not brought a single civil court action against a company for failing to act in the best interest of customers, as required by law.
Macauley told the inquiry that in the last five years ASIC, which is tasked with enforcing corporate laws and overseeing the operating licenses of financial services companies, had only temporarily suspended two company license for legal breaches.

Last week, the government vowed to double prison terms for financial crimes, dramatically increase penalties and ramp up the investigative powers of the corporate regulator.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) still has work ahead after making good progress towards achieving targets set for a three-year turnaround, Chairman Urs Rohner told the group's annual general meeting on Friday.
""Quite clearly, we still have plenty of work to do,"" Rohner told shareholders. ""But the fact remains, ladies and gentlemen, that we are well on track to achieve the goals we have set ourselves, even if some people originally expressed doubts about this.""
Credit Suisse this week delivered its best quarterly results since Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam in 2016 launched his restructuring plan for Switzerland's second-biggest bank, driven by its wealth management business.
Key to higher future earnings will be the bank's wind-down of its so-called Strategic Resolution Unit, a huge source of losses which is selling out of non-core businesses. 
Credit Suisse on Wednesday confirmed the wind-down's completion by the end of this year and reiterated its cost-saving target of above 4.2 billion Swiss francs ($4.24 billion).
Speaking to the need to drive efficiency, Rohner said the bank intends to lean on technological innovation to reduce costs and increase its ability to identify compliance risks.
""We are streamlining our operating activities, improving our compliance processes, and making substantial investments in new technologies,"" said Rohner, who has been chairman since 2011.
""We have hired a group of creative minds in Silicon Valley, whose task it is to develop ideas with the potential to transform banking in the future.""
The industry should not close its eyes to the possibility that digital innovation will transform banking, even if competition from so-called fintech startups hasn't been disruptive so far, he said. He expected the financial sector's profitability to improve over the next few years.

1539,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 06:39AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Rusal to change board in bid to persuade U.S. to lift sanctions-sources,"By Polina Devitt and Dmitry Zhdannikov
MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Russia's Rusal will overhaul its board and management in the hope the United States will remove the aluminum firm from a sanctions list so it can restart shipments to its customers around the world, two sources told Reuters.
The sources, familiar with the developments but who asked not to be identified because they are not allowed to speak publicly, said Rusal would soon appoint a fully independent board that in turn would install a new management team.
""Rusal is in touch with U.S. authorities and hopes the measure will be enough for them to be removed from the sanctions list,"" one of the sources said. Rusal declined to comment.
The United States this month imposed sanctions against billionaire Oleg Deripaska and the eight companies in which he is a large shareholder, including Rusal, in response to what the United States called ""malign activities"" by Russia.
By adding Deripaska's businesses to its Specially Designated Nationals blacklist – the first time Washington had done so with a publicly listed Russian firm - the United States effectively choked off their access to the international financial system.
Rusal, the largest part of Deripaska's empire and the world's second-biggest aluminum producer, has seen customers stop buying its aluminum and creditors scramble to offload debt. 
Hong Kong-listed Rusal lost almost 60 percent of its share value after the introduction of sanctions, while aluminum and alumina prices soared, hitting businesses around the world, including in the United States.
Earlier this week, the United States moved to ease some of the measures against Rusal, saying it did not want to hit companies around the globe and that it could remove Rusal from the list if Deripaska ceded control.
The two sources added that Rusal hoped Deripaska could keep his stake in the firm at the current 48 percent under any arrangement with U.S. authorities.
""Forty-eight percent is not a controlling stake of 50 percent, which under the U.S. rules triggers the sanctions,"" one of the sources said.
The source added that Rusal was still not shipping to customers around the world as it awaited guidance from U.S. authorities.
""Rusal needs clarity from OFAC before it can resume those shipments,"" the source said, referring to the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury, which enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals.

Aluminium prices in London fell nearly 2 percent on the news to a low of $2,237 per tonne.

1542,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 08:04AM ET</span>","From Disney to Dior, Norway wealth fund challenges CEO pay","By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - Executive pay is firmly in the crosshairs of Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund as it puts its votes to work at some of the more than 9,000 companies it is invested in.
The world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, built on Norway's oil revenues, has become a more active shareholder in recent years and since 2017 has called for changes including the scrapping of long-term incentive plans and simpler and more transparent packages.
So far in this year's annual general meeting season, data shows the fund voted against a stock option plan for Tesla (O:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, which would potentially be worth $2.6 billion to the electric carmaker's founder.. 
It has also voted against the pay of  Disney  (N:DIS) CEO Bob Iger,  Christian Dior  (PA:DIOR) CEO Sydney Toledano,  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) CEO Carlos Tavares,  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) CEO Xavier Huilliard and  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine.
The fund's chief executive Yngve Slyngstad said that transparency remains a sticking point on pay.
""It is the transparency and that is quite often linked to the simplicity,"" Slyngstad told Reuters on the sidelines of an earnings presentation on Friday.
""If you get to a situation where we have a possibility to voice our opinion on pay, it has to be reasonably well defined in advance -- what kind of pay package it will lead to.""
The main way to influence was to determine the pay of incoming CEOs, rather than existing ones since their compensation has already been agreed, he said, adding that change could take five to 10 years.
He declined to speak about individual companies except for engineering firm The  Weir Group  (L:WEIR), which the fund praised this month for being willing to ""challenge conventional thinking on remuneration"" by being simple and transparent.
""The Weir Group has led by example to a different degree than others and were very clear in the way they were doing it. We wanted to highlight them,"" said Slyngstad. 
""We have not outlined any other companies that we would want to do the same for in advance. We are watching."" 
The fund is also against CEOs doubling up as chairmen and has voted against the elections of Bank of America (N:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, L'Oreal (PA:OREP) CEO Jean-Paul Agon and Walt Disney (N:DIS) CEO Bob Iger on their respective boards.
It is also against board members being elected as a group as it cannot then have a say on individual members. This season it therefore voted against the reelections of the boards of both Sweden's  Alfa Laval  (ST:ALFA) and Atlas Copco (ST:ATCOa).
NEGATIVE RETURN
The fund posted its first loss in two years in the first quarter, primarily due to falling stock markets, and Slyngstad told an earnings presentation that rising protectionism could impact the fund's equity investments as the top 100 world multinationals account for 20 percent of its equity portfolio.
""Any changes to the global supply chain, or tariffs that will hit the global supply chain, will of course be quite important for this fund ... Any action that reduces world growth will usually affect earnings and will affect pricing of the companies we are invested in,"" Slyngstad told reporters. 
Some 66.2 percent of the fund's assets were held in stocks at the end of the first quarter, 31.2 percent in fixed income and 2.6 percent in real estate. 
The fund's return was minus 1.5 percent in the quarter, slightly better than its own benchmark but lagging the positive return of 3.5 percent in the last quarter of 2017.
The most negative contributions were Nestle (S:NESN), Facebook (O:FB) and  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC). Nestle was the fund's third-largest equity holding at the end of the quarter, worth 46 billion crowns, fund data showed. 
Investments in Amazon (O:AMZN), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Netflix (O:NFLX) made the most positive contribution.
The Norwegian government withdrew 11 billion crowns during the first quarter to pay for public expenses, compared with 61 billion crowns for the whole of 2017.

LONDON (Reuters) - Well-received results from Spanish banks and a recovery among tech stocks buoyed European shares in early trading on Friday, setting them up for their fifth week of gains in a row.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was up 0.1 percent by 0903 GMT and on track for its longest winning streak in terms of weekly gains since last September, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) rose 0.7 percent. 
This week banks have been a key focus, with results from Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) and Caixabank (MC:CABK) sending their shares 2 percent and 0.5 percent higher. Both lenders beat profit forecasts thanks to strength in their overseas markets.
However, Britain's RBS (L:RBS) was a laggard, reversing early gains to trade 2 percent lower after a concerns over a pending fine from the U.S. Department of Justice eclipsed its first-quarter update.
RBS was among the biggest fallers on the European banking index (SX7P), which declined 0.5 percent.
Elsewhere industrials performed well as shares in St Gobain (PA:SGOB) popped 3 percent higher after the French construction materials group confirmed its 2018 financial outlook.
Satellite firm SES (PA:SESFd) was the biggest gainer, up more than 10 percent after beating first-quarter expectations on the back of strong growth in its networks division.
However, Electrolux (ST:ELUXb) fell the most on the STOXX, its shares down 11 percent on a surprise drop in first-quarter core operating profit and a warning on raw material costs. 
The earnings season has taken the focus from broader issues such as global trade and geopolitics, which rattled markets in March, while concerns over rising bond yields have also been put on the back burner for now. 
""We've been able to focus much more the earnings season and underlying trends,"" Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said, adding that companies can be more cautious in the first quarter.
""I know markets are very short-term and we do just move from quarter to quarter, but people will remember at the back-end of the year if you upgraded guidance and you've got to revise it down again,"" van Dulken said.
""It's not a good look."" 
So far around a quarter of companies in the MSCI EMU index have given first quarter updates. Nearly 60 percent have either beat or met analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. Earnings growth is clocking in at over 15 percent for the quarter, in dollar terms. 

Tech stocks also helped fuel gains as the sector (SX8P) continued to recover from recent negative sentiment, following well-received results from tech giant Facebook (O:FB), Amazon (O:AMZN), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and U.S. chipmakers.

1546,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 03:10AM ET</span>","China's Hollywood romance sours amid trade war, debt fears","By Pei Li and Adam Jourdan
QINGDAO, China (Reuters) - When Dalian Wanda, the Chinese conglomerate, announced in 2013 that it would build an $8 billion film studio in China to lure U.S. film producers, it did so with Hollywood flash.
Stars like Nicole Kidman and John Travolta were on hand as the company's chairman, Wang Jianlin, boldly announced that the new studio in the east coast city of Qingdao would help make China a ""global cultural powerhouse"".
Five years later, the Oriental Movie Metropolis is set to open its doors but the mutual courtship between China and Hollywood is looking less rosy.
Walking the red carpet at the Qingdao studio launch Saturday will be Chinese comic actor Huang Bo – a big name locally – while Hollywood A-listers are expected to stay away.
Wang's own ambitions are also looking more modest. Wanda last year sold its interest in the studio to a Chinese rival, maintaining just a management role in the venture, whose fortunes look increasingly unclear as the American film industry sours on China.
A handful of U.S.-China film ventures have fallen apart over cultural clashes, financing deals have collapsed, and Hollywood's share of the local market has lost ground to a surge of popular, and often patriotic-minded, local film productions.
A trade war between Beijing and Washington is also looming. Negotiations over improved market access for U.S. producers via China's strict quota system and a larger slice of profits have stalled, according to industry insiders. Reports earlier this year had suggested China was ready to open up the market.
""Everybody is waiting to see, but I don't think the quota on imported movies will be lifted,"" said Zhang Haoyue, a Hollywood studio sales executive who previously worked as an import manager for China Film Group, the state-backed film giant.
SLATE DEALS
A series of high-profile deals and financing agreements have also hit snags.
Wang, the Wanda chairman, last year saw his $1 billion bid for the U.S. company Dick Clark Productions Inc fall though after its owner, Eldridge Industries, said the Chinese company failed to honor contractual obligations.
Wang controls the U.S. cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc and Legendary Entertainment, a U.S. studio.
China's Huahua Media and the state-backed Shanghai Film Group in November scrapped a $1 billion agreement to co-finance a slate of films from Paramount Pictures. In February, NBCUniversal sold out of Oriental DreamWorks, its much-hyped joint venture between China Media Capital and Universal's DreamWorks Animation.
Industry sources said Huahua had encountered liquidity problems amid a Chinese crackdown on ""irrational"" overseas deals and its domestic partners had also pulled out of the deal.
""For a while everybody was going to China,"" thinking that Chinese investors just wanted to ""meet celebrities, be exposed to Hollywood,"" said Ben Waisbren, a U.S. film producer and president of LSC Film Corp.
Waisbren said Hollywood had looked to Chinese investors to offload some financing risk, but many realized making a return in film wasn't so easy.
""Somebody in China said, 'these deals don't make any sense ... and we don't want to look stupid because we don't want Hollywood to look at us as dumb money,'"" said Waisbren.
Wanda sold off the Qingdao studio to a rival property developer, Sunac China Holdings Ltd, amid a sweeping sell-down of assets to raise funds. Wanda retains management control of the complex.
TINSELTOWN
China is also tightening its grip on its film market. A recent regulatory reshuffle handed control over censorship and approvals to the Communist Party's powerful publicity department last month. 
China's quota system allows 34 imported movies, while overseas producers get a 25 percent share of box office takings - less than in other international markets. Since 2016 a handful more have been allowed in via a ""cultural exchange"" channel.
U.S. film industry insiders said that Chinese regulators were increasingly protecting local films and saving the best release dates around holidays for local movies.
Foreign producers and distributors would also sometimes get approvals shortly before release dates, limiting the time for marketing.
""I don't think the Communist Party and Chinese government are interested in having more American content in China,"" said Robert Cain, president of Pacific Bridge Pictures, which provides financial and strategic services to the film industry.
""I don't think the U.S. has very much bargaining leverage right now.""
BOX OFFICE
Hollywood blockbusters once ruled in China, but are losing steam. North American movies have taken around a quarter of the box office in China so far this year, down from over 45 percent in 2016, according to data from the box office tracker EntGroup.
This shift could hit Wanda's Qingdao studio, which had hoped to benefit from soaring demand from overseas producers looking to add China elements to their films to help boost box office takings in China.
Last year, a movie about a Chinese hero beating western mercenaries in Africa broke China's box-office record, while Hollywood offerings like ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" failed to ignite when released in China earlier this year.
Hollywood films that focus on action figures or superheroes no longer provide a magic formula in China, said Kevin Niu, a U.S.-based producer who worked on the horror movie ""Abattoir"".
""Chinese audiences seem to enjoy content that has strong family and community value, or content that depicts themselves or their dream life-style,"" he said.
With the aid of Hollywood know-how and bigger budgets, local movies, once ridiculed for weak special effects and storylines, are gaining momentum as they find ways to play on these domestic themes and improve production quality.
""Made in China might not be entirely respected, but it's getting better every month,"" said Chris Bremble, chief executive of Base FX, a China-based visual effects and animation company.
Bremble said Chinese cinemagoers were willing to splash out on tickets for domestic films now because they look increasingly like big international movies.

""Chinese cinema will soon be looking more like Hollywood cinema, which is spectacle driven, very commercial focused motion pictures,"" he said.

""We have costs under control and are making good progress on raising productivity,"" brand finance chief Arno Antlitz said on Friday. ""We will continue this course rigorously in the next months.""
Europe's largest automotive group had reported on Thursday that negative effects of 300 million euros ($363.18 million) from adopting new accounting standards caused operating profit to drop 3.6 percent in the first quarter.
Without the changes, earnings came in slightly above last year's 4.37 billion euros.
Profitability at the VW brand slid to 4.4 percent from 4.6 percent on advance costs for its electric-car program and spending on new combustion models.
The VW brand last year introduced four all-new models in the fast-growing sport-utility vehicle (SUV) segment, including the T-Roc and Atlas, that will enjoy their first full year of sales in 2018, and is about to launch redesigns of the Touareg SUV and the Jetta sedan, its top-selling product in the United States.
The division said it expects the positive business development to continue in the coming months and stuck with its guidance for an operating margin of between 4 and 5 percent this year after 4.1 percent in 2017.

1550,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 01:50AM ET</span>",Shares of China internet poker game firms drop on reports of ban,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shares in Chinese companies offering online and mobile poker games have shed up to a fifth of their value over the past week, following reports in local media that the government would ban all poker-related applications from June 1.
Companies like Boyaa Interactive and Our Game have seen their stocks slide up to 18 percent since the informal directive from the country's ministry of culture was reported in local media on April 19. 
There has been no official statement so far and the ministry did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment on Friday.
A copy of the directive - circulated in local media and seen by Reuters - asks gaming platforms to stop operating Texas Hold'em games, a variation of poker, forbid services that transfer or trade virtual currency and stop the publication of anything poker or gambling-related on Weibo and WeChat.
Boyaa, Our Game and Chinese internet giant Tencent, which last year signed a multi-year agreement with the World Series of Poker brand, have responded by pulling poker-related games ahead of the deadline, local media said.
Boyaa did not respond to requests for comment. 
The company provides web and mobile games including Texas Hold'em and Big Two Poker, and gets over 70 percent of its revenue from online poker games. Our Game said in a statement dated April 19 that it had pulled some of its content. 
""In order to actively respond to the call of the country and purify the network environment ... some Texas Hold'em products will be tidied and reorganized to maintain a healthy gaming environment,"" said Our Game, which has over 500 million users.
Tencent did not respond to requests for comment but local media reported the company had shut its World Series of Poker app and started prohibiting access to poker-themed chat rooms.
Gambling is illegal in China, with the exception of a local lottery market and the booming casino hub Macau, but the Chinese are still among the world's most prolific gamblers.
Industry executives say companies have been offering poker as part of their entertainment platforms but some apps are used by individuals or groups to run illegal gambling operations.
Poker has risen in popularity with many deeming it a skilled game like bridge. The proliferation of online poker apps has spawned a black market for buying and selling game coins.
""This is another concept of gambling. Now the amount and scale concerning Texas Hold'em is relatively large so it needs to be regulated,"" said Su Guojing, a special adviser of China Center for Lottery studies.

The initial planned investment is a ""ballpark figure"" and is for several years down the line, Elizabeth Sun told Reuters in a phone call.

1552,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 07:09AM ET</span>","Old rules, algorithmic traders add costs to U.S. share buybacks","By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies are on track to buy back a record amount of their own stock this year, but a decades-old markets rule aimed at preventing manipulation makes these trades easy to game and has probably cost companies billions in recent years.
Stock buybacks were banned in the United States until 1982, when rules were set as to how companies could repurchase their shares without falling afoul of anti-manipulation provisions. 
But the ""safe harbor"" rules have not been revised since 2003 and critics say they do not reflect the electronic, fragmented nature of today's markets, which makes share repurchase orders easy to spot and trade in front of by high-speed trading firms, leading to higher prices for companies that buy back stock. 
""Everybody knows there is a corporate order flow so they front-run it and that just pisses me off because they will raise the price high enough where then they will sell it back to me. That's just not fair,"" Gary Barth, assistant treasurer at  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS), told Reuters. 
UPS has a $1 billion share repurchase program in place this year and has bought back around $15.3 billion of its own stock since 2012.
Under a condition of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 10b-18, companies must bid to buy back their stock at the last purchase price set by another investor or at the best bid available in the market. But they cannot buy shares at the best offer available, because that could cause the company's shares to move and be deemed manipulative.
Given that companies must announce their repurchase plans, the restrictions make it easier to detect stock buyback activity, said Ted Morgan, chief executive officer of brokerage Abel Noser, which executes share buybacks on behalf of corporate clients. 
""It's a lot easier than it is to detect other types of institutional flow,"" he said.
Since 2010, S&P 500 companies have spent nearly $4 trillion on share buybacks, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2vOQDwm) 
Based on buyback announcements so far, 2018 repurchases are expected to ""smash totals from all other previous years"" in the wake of the tax-cut bonanza companies received under the Trump administration, according to research firm TrimTabs.
There are no estimates how much high-speed traders make, but even if the difference in price is mere pennies, exploiting the buyback vulnerability can translate into huge profits, while doing nothing for others in the market and effectively forcing companies to waste some of the buyback money because they cannot mask their activities. 
FLASH BOYS PETITION 
Exchange operator IEX Group has petitioned the SEC to let firms buying back shares do so using hidden orders that only execute at the midpoint between the best bid and the best offer. That would make it difficult to move the stock price while making the activity harder to spot.
""The change we are arguing for could save public companies millions of dollars or more in execution costs,"" IEX CEO Brad Katsuyama said in a statement to Reuters.
The share buyback petition is the latest cause taken up by IEX, which launched its exchange in August 2016 and was earlier featured in Michael Lewis's book ""Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,"" which followed Katsuyama and his colleagues as they set out to create a market that they saw as fairer to investors.
The exchange features a so-called speed bump that slows down trades to prevent the fastest traders in the market from trading ahead of slower investors. Like other exchanges, and private markets known as dark pools, it also features midpoint order types.
Because those order types are hidden, it would make it much more difficult for trading firms' algorithms to spot buyback trading patterns, accumulate the shares and then sell them back to the issuer at successively higher last sale prices.
The SEC declined to comment on the petition, but had itself suggested allowing midpoint share buybacks in 2010 as part of a proposed revamp of the safe harbor rules.
But the proposal was dropped in the wake of the May 2010 stock market flash crash, which, along with Dodd-Frank rule making following the financial crisis, overwhelmed the regulator's resources.
Eight years later, UPS's Barth said he is still waiting for the SEC to take action.
Current SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said on April 10 that the regulator ""should listen to investors and market participants about where Commission rules are, or are not, functioning as intended,"" and do retrospective reviews on those rules.

""The time has come,"" Barth said. ""They still haven't done anything. Come on guys, help a poor guy out here. Let's get into the 21st century!""

Asian markets opened in green following the solid advances in the U.S. markets overnight and continued to trade broadly in green on Friday afternoon.
Overnight, the Dow gained 0.99% and the S&P 500 rose 1.04% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq powered up 1.64%, thanks to a recovery in tech stocks.
The historical Korean summit added a dose of optimism to the South Korean market, while Bank of Japan dropped a hint of the timeframe for achieving its 2% inflation target in its statement.
South Korea’s Kospi was up 0.62% at 01:00AM ET (05:00 GMT). The high-level summit between North Korea and South Korea on Friday morning tamed the geopolitical tensions in East Asia, lifted up the sentiment for the won and drove the markets in Seoul slightly higher. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un hailed a “new era of peace”, implying the long-term standoff between the two Koreas may come to an end.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.5% and rose to a one-week high at noon. Chip-related company Advantest was the best performer, surging 13.35%.
BOJ delivered its much antipated decision on monetary policy in late morning in Asia without mentioing the timeframe for achieving the 2% inflation target. The move suggested that the target will likely remain out of reach in the near future, as the Bank kept its inflation forecast for the next fiscal year unchanged at 1.8%.

1554,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 09:19AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. considers tightening grip on China ties to corporate America,"By Koh Gui Qing
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government may start scrutinizing informal partnerships between American and Chinese companies in the field of artificial intelligence, threatening practices that have long been considered garden variety development work for technology companies, sources familiar with the discussions said.
So far, U.S. government reviews for national security and other concerns have been limited to investment deals and corporate takeovers. This possible new expansion of the mandate - which would serve as a stop-gap measure until Congress imposes tighter restrictions on Chinese investments - is being pushed by members of Congress, and those in U.S. President Donald Trump's administration who worry about theft of intellectual property and technology transfer to China, according to four people familiar with the matter. 
Artificial intelligence, in which machines imitate intelligent human behavior, is a particular area of interest because of the technology's potential for military usage, they said. Other areas of interest for such new oversight include semiconductors and autonomous vehicles, they added. 
These considerations are in early stages, so it remains unclear if they will move forward, and which informal corporate relationships this new initiative would scrutinize. 
Any broad effort to sever relationships between Chinese and American tech companies - even temporarily - could have dramatic effects across the industry. Major American technology companies, including Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, Nvidia Corp and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), have activities in China ranging from research labs to training initiatives, often in collaboration with Chinese companies and institutions who are major customers.
Top talent in areas including artificial intelligence and chip design also flows freely among companies and universities in both countries.
The nature of informal business relationships varies widely. 
For example, when U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp - the leader in AI hardware - unveiled a new graphics processing unit that powers data centers, video games and cryptocurrency mining last year, it gave away samples to 30 artificial intelligence scientists, including three who work with China's government, according to Nvidia.
For a company like Nvidia, which gets a fifth of its business from China, the giveaway was business as usual. It has several arrangements to train local scientists and develop technologies there that rely on its chips. Offering early access helps Nvidia tailor products so it can sell more.
The U.S. government could nix this sort of cooperation through an executive order from Trump by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Such a move would unleash sweeping powers to stop or review informal corporate partnerships between a U.S. and Chinese company, any Chinese investment in a U.S. technology company or the Chinese purchases of real estate near sensitive U.S. military sites, the sources said.
""I don't see any alternative to having a stronger (regulatory) regime because the end result is, without it, the Chinese companies are going to get stronger,"" said one of the sources, who is advising U.S. lawmakers on efforts to revise and toughen U.S. foreign investment rules. ""They are going to challenge our companies in 10 or 15 years.""
James Lewis, a former Foreign Service officer with the U.S. Departments of State who is now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said if the emergency act was invoked, U.S. government officials including those in the Treasury Department could use it ""to catch anything they want” that currently fall outside the scope of the regulatory regime.A White House official said that they do not comment on speculation about internal administration policy discussions, but added ""we are concerned about Made in China 2025, particularly relevant in this case is its targeting of industries like AI."" 
Made in China 2025 is an industrial plan outlining China's ambition to become a market leader in 10 key sectors including semiconductors, robotics, drugs and devices and smart green cars.
Last month, the White House outlined new import tariffs that were largely directed at China for what Trump described as ""intellectual property theft."" That prompted Chinese President Xi Jinping’s government to retaliate with sanctions against the United States. 
(For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2GXE9qr)
Those moves followed proposed legislation that would toughen foreign investment rules overseen by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), by giving the committee - made up of representatives from various U.S. government agencies - purview over joint ventures that involve ""critical technology"".
Republican and Democratic lawmakers who put forth the proposal in November said changes are aimed at China. 
Whereas an overhauled CFIUS would likely review deals relevant to national security and involve foreign ownership, informal partnerships are likely to be regulated by revised export controls when they come into effect, sources said.
To be sure, sources said the Trump administration could change its mind about invoking the emergency act. They added that some within the Treasury Department are also lukewarm about invoking the emergency act as they preferred to focus on passing the revised rules for CFIUS. 
FOCUS ON AI
Chinese and U.S. companies are widely believed among analysts to be locked in a two-way race to become the world's leader in AI. While U.S. tech giants such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google are in the lead, Chinese firms like Internet services provider Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) have made significant strides, according to advisory firm Eurasia Group.
As for U.S. chipmakers, few are as synonymous with the technology as Nvidia, one of the world's top makers of the highly complex chips that power AI machines.
There is no evidence that Nvidia’s activities represent a threat to national security by, for instance, offering access to trade secrets such as how to make a graphics processing unit. Nvidia also said it does not have joint ventures in China.
In a statement, Nvidia said its collaborations in China – including training Chinese scientists and giving Chinese companies such as telecom provider Huawei Technologies Co Ltd early access to some of its latest technology - are only intended to get feedback on the chips it sells there.
""We are extremely protective of our proprietary technology and know-how,"" Nvidia said. ""We don’t give any company, anywhere in the world, the core differentiating technology."" 
Qualcomm did not respond to requests for a comment, while Advanced Micro Devices and IBM declined to comment.
Nvidia is far from being the only U.S. tech giant, much less the only chipmaker, that lends expertise to China. But it is clearly in the sights of the Chinese. When the country’s Ministry of Science and Technology solicited pitches for research projects last year, one of the listed objectives was to create a chip 20 times faster than Nvidia's

""Five years ago, this might not be a concern,"" said Lewis, ""But it's a concern now because of the political and technological context.""

1555,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 06:44AM ET</span>","Airbus cuts A330 output, first quarter profit capped by engine delays","By Tim Hepher and Cyril Altmeyer
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) announced a 17 percent drop in planned 2019 deliveries of its most successful wide-body jet on Friday following a series of order defeats to rival Boeing, while blurring near-term production plans for the much healthier A320.
Europe's largest aerospace group is simultaneously juggling a drop in demand for its A330 wide-body jet - the only one of its class on which it currently makes a profit - against record demand for bread-and-butter models like the A320.
Airbus said it was reducing deliveries of the 250-300-seat A330 to around 50 aircraft in 2019, compared with 67 last year and 60 planned for 2018. That comes after an upgraded version due to enter service this year failed to sell as it had hoped.
The production slowdown came as Airbus posted a slender - though better than expected - core profit in the first quarter after delays in engine deliveries for its smaller A320neo.
Together, the A320 and A330 families generate most of the cash and income needed to support future developments and other activities at the maker of airplanes, rockets and fighters.
While the narrowbody A320neo remains a best-seller, with Airbus recently unable to produce the jets fast enough due to engine supply problems, the upgraded A330neo has been losing ground to the newer Boeing (N:BA) 787 at carriers like American Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines.
""We knew (the first quarter) was going to be grisly – and it is,"" said Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris in a note.
""The A330 going down to 50 (a year) is overtly bad news, but we have suspected for some time the A330's slow sales could mean A350 production moves up at some point,"" he added.
A320 PRODUCTION
Shares in Airbus dipped just over 1 percent on the results, which came days after Boeing beat forecasts after improving deliveries and turning the corner on 787 costs.
Airbus reported an adjusted quarterly operating profit of 14 million euros ($17 million) after a restated year-earlier loss of 19 million. Revenues fell 12 percent to 10.12 billion euros. 
Airbus reaffirmed full-year forecasts, however, predicting that A320neo deliveries would speed up later this year after a two-month break in some deliveries due to engine snags.
Analysts were on average expecting a 23.9 million euro quarterly operating loss on revenues of 10.21 billion.
Airbus said it saw continued strong demand for narrowbody jets like the A320, allowing it to explore future production rates of ""70 or 70-plus"" a month, up from around 55 a month now.
But it softened recent indications that it planned to accelerate its goal in the short term, after an Airbus spokesman earlier this week confirmed a report it planned to increase output to 63 a month in 2019, instead of 60.
Finance Director Harald Wilhelm said Airbus was only asking for ""surge capacity"" of that level and the only commitment was for 60 aircraft a month, while redefining the goal as a delivery target rather than a production figure.
This is a change from the usual practice for high-volume aircraft program, where manufacturers typically announce monthly production rates that hold steady while deliveries can fluctuate from month to month. For the year as a whole, they tend to focus on deliveries, which drive revenues and cash.
Airbus is keen to lock in a recent advantage over Boeing in narrowbody jets by speeding up the rate at which it turns orders into deliveries, but faces pushback from its engine suppliers.
The head of France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) this week warned against hasty production increases as suppliers work through an unprecedented speed-up plan already in motion.

Germany's MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn) said on Wednesday it too was cautious, because of tight supply chains.

It converted options it held over the jets into firm orders, with 10 to be delivered each year from 2019-2022, Southwest said in a statement on Thursday announcing its first-quarter earnings.
""This is first and foremost an extension of our fleet modernisation strategy,"" Southwest chief executive officer Gary Kelly told analysts on a post-earnings conference call, according to a transcript. 
""We have a very strong business case to replace older 737-700 aircraft given the superior operating economics of the MAX 8.""
Southwest is the world's largest operator of 737 jets, with more than 700 of the airplanes.
The airline on Thursday warned the consequences of a mid-air engine explosion on a 737-700 last week will weigh on second-quarter bookings, as investigators probe the events that led to the first passenger death in the airline's history.

Southwest posted first-quarter profit of $438 million, excluding special items, up from $372 million a year earlier.

1557,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Global investors pile into China stocks ahead of MSCI index entry,"By Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Overseas investors are pumping billions of dollars into Chinese stocks and the country's asset managers are rushing to launch index-tracking funds in a fervent build-up to China's inclusion in MSCI's widely tracked equity benchmarks. 
The race to get a foothold in stocks in the world's second-biggest economy just weeks before the MSCI inclusion could help put a floor under a stock market that has been battered recently by fears of a U.S.-Sino trade war.
The main stock index (SSEC) has shown some tentative signs of regaining its footing this week, after a 12 percent fall since late January.
Under the phased inclusion plan, MSCI will add some yuan-denominated China A-shares into its emerging market index this year, beginning on June 1 with another round on Sept 1.
Analysts estimate that will initially trigger $20 billion in foreign inflows, mainly from passive investors who need to adjust their portfolios to avoid deviations from their benchmarks.
""Fresh inflows at the start will be small, but it will lift sentiment, and lead to rosy expectations,"" said Xu Yujun, fund manager at Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Co.
Invesco Great Wall and other Chinese money managers have raised nearly 10 billion yuan ($1.58 billion) this month alone via a slew of funds that track MSCI A-share indexes, giving their investors targeted exposure to stocks that will benefit from the inclusion.
More investment offerings are in the pipeline, offered by asset managers such as Huatai-PineBridge Investments, HuaAn Funds and PingAn-UOB Fund.
Net foreign money inflows from Hong Kong into China stocks via the cross-border Connect scheme have exceeded 37 billion yuan so far this month, tripling last month's total, and reversing a net outflow in February. 
""Foreign investors are stepping up buying A-shares, undeterred by signs of rising Sino-U.S. trade frictions,"" said Allen Wong, strategist at China Investment Securities (HK).
    ""I believe they're building up positions ahead of June's MSCI China inclusion, which would be the biggest market stimulus in the short term."" 
A BEGINNING
The MSCI's simulated list of 222 large capitalization stocks to be considered in the index spans the financial, consumer, materials and utility sectors and includes banking giant ICBC (SS:601398) and top consumer brand Tsingtao Brewery (SS:600600).
The initial MSCI inclusion will see China A-shares represent a mere 0.73 percent of its emerging market index.
But the prospect of full inclusion, which could potentially give Chinese stocks an approximately 18 percent weighting in the index, is enticing investors. Full inclusion would mean China would dwarf many large emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and India. 
Fund mangers widely expect full China inclusion by MSCI would lead to $300-$400 billion in foreign inflows. 
""The historical exclusion of these securities has led to a vast under-investment in China,"" said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at KraneShares, a New York-based asset manager focused on China. 
""The (full) inclusion will likely take several years, meaning this is a long term strategy. So this is more than just a one-time event."" 
KraneShares this month kicked off a two-week roadshow across eight U.S. cities, pitching A-share opportunities to U.S. investors ahead of the June inclusion.
New York-listed KraneShares Bosera MSCI China A Share ETF (P:KBA) has already seen its assets under management (AUM) explode nearly eight-fold over the past year thanks to the inclusion announcement. 
(Graphic: MSCI's China inclusion whets foreign appetite for A-shares - https://reut.rs/2KehTra)
Other foreign investors who take a long-term approach to China include J.P. Morgan Asset Management, which plans to double coverage of China A-shares to 250 by the end of 2018.
Ma Jun, general manger of hedge fund manager Shanghai Solon Investment Co, said that increased investment from global institutions will add depth and breadth to China's stock market, which is now dominated by retail investors.
But some local investors caution against being too bullish on China's notoriously volatile markets.
Xu Xiaoqing, managing director of Shanghai-based hedge fund house Preston Group, reminded investors of the painful bursting of a bubble in blue-chip stocks earlier this year, in the wake of a surge in valuations triggered by MSCI's announcement of the China inclusion last June. 
""For foreign investors, those A-shares to be included into MSCI indexes won't generate obvious market-beating returns over the long run,"" she said.

1558,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 12:22AM ET</span>","Under pressure from Elliott, Hyundai Motor to cancel $890 million in shares","By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) said it will cancel $890 million worth of treasury shares, its first stock cancellation in 14 years - a plan that comes amid heavy shareholder pressure to improve returns, restructure and bounce back from dismal earnings. 
U.S. activist hedge fund Elliott Management ramped up pressure on the South Korean automaker this week, calling for a holding company structure, a share cancellation as well as the addition of three independent board members.
""Hyundai Motor seems to be trying to reach a compromise with Elliott by accepting part of its demands,"" said Kim Jin-woo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities. 
Hyundai said in a statement it plans to cancel 560 billion won of existing treasury shares by July 27, and will buy back and cancel another 400 billion won worth of stock.
""Hyundai Motor has and will continue to focus on improving shareholder value. Today's announcement is part of a long consideration process and displays our efforts to honor this commitment,"" it said in a statement.
The announcement came on the heels of quarterly profit halving to its lowest level in nearly six years, with the automaker battered by bleak U.S. and China sales.
The wider Hyundai group has taken some steps to improve corporate governance and streamline its complex ownership structure. 
 Hyundai Mobis  Co Ltd (KS:012330), which will become the group's de facto holding firm, plans to spin off its module and after-service parts businesses and merge them with logistics affiliate  Hyundai Glovis  (KS:086280).
""The share cancellation plan will help placate Elliott and other investors, and raise the chance of the plan getting shareholder approval,"" said Ko Tae-bong, an analyst at Hi Investment & Securities.
Hyundai's shares were flat in morning trade. Although they slumped nearly 5 percent on earnings on Thursday, the stock has gained 9 percent so far this month on hopes of more corporate governance reform.
While welcomed by other investors, pressure from Elliott has drawn criticism from South Korea's anti-trust watchdog which said this week its proposal for the group to adopt a holding company structure was ""inappropriate"" and, if implemented, would be in violation of antitrust law.
Elliott said in a statement on Friday it expected to have dialogue with the antitrust watchdog over Hyundai Motor Group's restructuring plan. It did not comment on the share cancellation plan.

1559,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 09:36PM ET</span>",Asian Equities Find Some Solid Ground After Days Of Losses,"Investing.com – Asian stocks generally advanced in early morning trade Friday, looking to recover from losses from Thursday and taking their cue from solid advances in U.S. markets overnight.
Perhaps lending a dose of optimism, Asian markets opened just as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un stepped on South Korean soil to begin a widely anticipated summit, that is going some way towards easing geopolitical tension in the region.
Also supporting stocks was a retreat in yields of U.S. Treasury bonds, with the yield on 10-year notes slipping back below the 3% mark after rising to 3.035% on Wednesday. The fall and a strong results season helped shore up U.S. benchmarks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.99% and the S&P 500 rose 1.04% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq powered up 1.64%, thanks to a recovery in tech stocks.
Stock markets throughout Asia opened the day in a positive note.
The Nikkei 225 was up 0.51% at 9:30PM ET (01:50 GMT),hours before the Bank of Japan was set to complete a two-day review of rates on Friday. The market is generally expecting the BOJ to leave its policy stance intact, maintaining its policy of quantitative and qualitative easing (QQE) with yield control policy.
South Korea's Kospi was up 0.76% in mid-morning trade, adding on to a solid performance Thursday powered by a strong rebound in Samsung Electronics. Samsung rose 2.3% on Thursday after posting another quarter of record profits. At mid-morning Friday, Samsung (KRX:KS:005930)was trading up 2.49%
Adding to the positive mood in South Korea, the country recorded first quarter GDP growth of 2.8% from a year earlier.
The mood was less buoyant in Hong Kong, which fell 1.06% on Thursday. Markets in mainland China also gave up ground. Investors expect to see more bearish volatility there and remained concern that trade tensions between China and the U.S. will have a negative impact on growth.
The fears weighed on technology stocks in particular, especially after reports surfaced that the U.S. Department of Justice was investigating telecom equipment maker Huawei Technology Co Ltd (SZ:002502)for breaching sanctions on Iran. Two weeks ago, the U.S. banned ZTE Corp-H (HK:0763), another telecoms maker, from buying U.S. technology for seven years.
Despite the fears, Hong Kong stocks took some cues from elsewhere in Asia and the positive finish in the U.S. and looked to reverse some of the losses from the previous days. The Hang Seng Index was up 0.92% shortly after the opening Friday morning in Asia.
Mainland China bourses have also been struggling to gain momentum. The Shanghai Composite Index was up a modest 0.30% in early morning trade while the Shenzhen Composite Index was up 0.38%.
Elsewhere, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 in Sidney was up 0.42% after a flat day on Thursday caused by losses in financial stocks."

Tencent rebounded 2 percent at 9:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, following overnight gains in the U.S. as the latest bout of earnings buoyed sentiment in the technology sector. The stock on Thursday briefly dropped below its 200-day moving average for the first time since 2016, taking losses since a January peak to $114 billion.
The Nasdaq Composite Index finally rebounded following a five-day rout. Risk-averse traders had been dumping tech and Internet stocks worldwide for weeks, unwinding one of last year’s most profitable trades amid concern over lofty valuations. Increasing evidence of a slowing smartphone market had added fuel to the selloff, as did a reported U.S. investigation into China’s Huawei Technologies Co. following a ban on ZTE Corp.
Shenzhen-based Tencent, Asia’s biggest company by market value, has still tumbled 18 percent from its Jan. 23 high. The stock has been a favorite among investors and analysts alike -- it hasn’t had a single sell rating in more than two years. While breaching the 200-day moving average shows just how bearish sentiment turned on global tech, it doesn’t necessarily spell danger for Tencent, which more than doubled in 2017 after the last time it touched that level.

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 09:01PM ET</span>","China's top court rules for Dior in IP case, raps trademark office","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's top court has ruled in favor of French fashion house  Christian Dior  (PA:DIOR), overturning rulings by lower courts and rapping the local trademark office for rejecting an application by the firm to register a perfume bottle trademark.
The ruling comes as Beijing looks to play up its credentials for protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights, after being stung by criticism, including from the United States, that it does not do enough to protect against IP infringement.
The United States has threatened China with tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods, in part to force Beijing to tackle what Washington calls theft of U.S. intellectual property and forced technology transfers from U.S. companies.
China said earlier this month it would introduce a system of punitive damages for IP infringements in a bid to strengthen IP enforcement for foreign firms and make sure offenders ""pay a big price"".
In a judgment on Thursday, also World Intellectual Property day, China's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Dior in a suit against the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board after a multi-year court battle.
The board wrongly rejected a 2015 application by Dior to register a trademark of its tear drop-shaped J'adore perfume bottle, the top court said in a statement on its website. Two lower courts had ruled against Dior after an appeal.
Cui Guobin, an IP associate professor at China's Tsinghua University, told the China Daily newspaper the ruling showed the country would protect IP rights ""no matter where it was from"", but added there was still work to do.

""The ruling also implies that it is necessary to improve our trademark laws,"" he said.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 05:36AM ET</span>",Tech gains and Korean vibes give world stock markets a boost,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks rose on Friday, lifted by strong share price gains for tech giants such as Amazon and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and growing hopes of a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula after a ground-breaking meeting of North and South Korean leaders.
European shares were set to end the week with a flourish too with a pan-European index set to post its fifth week of gains in a row, rivaling last September's winning streak, with the tech sector strongly outperforming. 
The latest gains are being partly spurred by forecast-beating first quarter earnings from two of the so-called FANG tech stocks -- some of the world's largest and most influential companies by market capitalization -- which has boosted sentiment on the technology sector worldwide. 
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares jumped more than 6 percent in after-market trading while Facebook surged 9.1 percent on Thursday, calming worries about the fallout from its use of consumer data. 
""Macro-economic data has been soft in a number of key economies, so it is reassuring that amidst those concerns we are still seeing strong earnings numbers coming through from big ticket corporates such as Amazon and Facebook,"" said Investec economist Victoria Clarke.
""This is a good gauge of the broad drivers of sentiment particularly when there are those concerns about demand holding up in the face of weak economic data,"" Clarke added. 
European tech shares rose 0.75 percent to the highest in more than five weeks, buoyed also by gains in local IT and chipmaking firms such as Capgemini, ASML and Infineon.
In Britain, there was bad news on the growth front, with data showing the economy slowed much more sharply than expected in the first three months of 2018.
That has slashed market expectations of an interest rate increase by the Bank of England next month and sent sterling plunging to the lowest since March 9 against the dollar
The data indicated ""that the (UK) slowdown is more structural"", Mizuho's head of hedge fund sales, Neil Jones, said.
However, sterling's slide helped UK shares on the FTSE index to rise nearly half a percent with gains led by multi-national earners which earn a big chunk of their revenues overseas but report profits in pounds.
The weak data adds to concerns that economic growth across the developed world is running out of steam, especially after lackluster euro zone figures earlier in the week and data on Friday showing French economic growth slowed more than expected in the first quarter. 
""The euro zone's economy doesn't seem to have the type of momentum it had last year,"" said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.
Earlier, though, Asian markets reveled in the glow of the summit between North Korea's Kim Jong Un and South Korean president Moon Jae-in. Political leaders and investors hope this would ease tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program and pave the way for the North and South to end their decades-long conflict.
That helped Seoul shares briefly rise more than 1 percent to a one-month high and the won firmed. MSCI's index of Asian shares outside Japan rallied 0.8 percent and Japan's Nikkei share average rose 0.7 percent to two-month peaks.
The dollar meanwhile hit its highest since Jan. 12 against a basket of currencies, having benefited from the recent run in U.S. Treasury yields -- 10-year yields hit 3 percent this week for the first time since January 2014. 
With a weekly gain of more than 1.5 percent, the greenback is set for its best weekly performance since late-November 2016.
""U.S. rates didn't matter for the dollar, now they do and our positioning metrics suggest there is further scope for short dollar positions to be unwound,"" said Michael Sneyd, global head of FX strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in London.

(Reuters) - A month of darkening sentiment around  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) among analysts was washed away in an instant when the social media's earnings report blew through even the most optimistic earnings estimates.
The response was classic Wall Street, where the traditional tendency has been to be far quicker with praise than with criticism.
Less than 24 hours after the earnings release late on Wednesday, roughly a quarter of the 45 analysts covering the stock had by Thursday raised their price targets, including at least five brokerages that cut their views after the Cambridge Analytica data scandal broke last month.
Facebook's shares, meanwhile, surged 9.1 percent on Thursday to $174.16, their highest in a month. The stock still had nearly 6 percent to climb to erase all its losses related to the matter.
With the ebullient reaction, the average price target on Facebook shares rose $2.21 on Thursday to $218.27, according to Thomson Reuters data, its highest in three weeks and about 20 percent above the latest price.
By contrast it took three weeks for the mean price target to drop from its pre-scandal high of $222.81, as the same number of analysts cut their targets one or two at a time as it slowly sunk in that the imbroglio would not pass quickly.
Notably, even as analysts trimmed their estimates for how high the shares could rise while the Cambridge Analytica story dominated the news for weeks, most held firm in their overall positive opinion of the stock.
The mean rating on Facebook's shares has stayed ""buy,"" with 41 analysts rating the stock ""strong buy"" or ""buy,"" two ""hold"" and 2 ""sell"" or ""strong sell.""
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) was among those raising its target on the stock on Thursday, to $210 from $200. Three weeks earlier it had cut it from $230. The brokerage said Facebook was investing to improve not only its core ad business but also its safety and security measures.
""These investments plant the seeds for Facebook to continue to grow its user base, engagement, and monetization for the next 3-5 years,"" said Brian Nowak, who rates the stock ""overweight.""
But not all analysts who soured on the stock recently found enough cheer in the results to alter their forecast on the stock's trajectory.
Among them was Pivotal Research Group's Brian Wieser – the top rated Facebook analyst for his recommendation accuracy, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.

""Broader concerns about the business and stock remain, and we maintain our $138 price target along with our Sell recommendation on the stock.""

(Reuters) - U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) and Sprint Corp (N:S) have made progress in negotiating merger terms and are aiming to successfully complete deal talks as early as next week, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The combined company would have more than 127 million customers and could create more formidable competition for the No.1 and No.2 wireless players,  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) and AT&T Inc (N:T), amid a race to expand offerings in 5G, the next generation of wireless technology.
T-Mobile majority-owner Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), which controls Sprint, are considering an agreement that would dictate how they exercise voting control over the combined company, two of the sources said.
This could allow Deutsche Telekom to consolidate the combined company on its books, even without owning a majority stake, the sources added. Deutsche Telekom owns more than 63 percent of T-Mobile, while SoftBank owns 84.7 percent of Sprint.
Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile are also in the process of finalizing the debt financing package they will use to fund the deal, the sources said.
There is no certainty that a deal will be reached, the sources cautioned. The companies came close to a merger agreement in November before SoftBank's chief executive officer, Masayoshi Son, pulled out of the talks at the last minute.
The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Sprint, T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Sprint and T-Mobile have market capitalizations of $24 billion and $55 billion, respectively. Sprint shares rose 9 percent in afterhours trading in New York, while T-Mobile shares were up 4 percent. 
When the previous round of talks between the companies ended in November over valuation disagreements, Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Officer Tim Hoettges left the door open by saying: ""You always meet twice in life.""
Failure to clinch a deal had left SoftBank's Son, a dealmaker who raised close to $100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies, in search of other options for Sprint.
SoftBank has been looking to trim its debt, which reached 15.8 trillion yen ($147 billion) as of the end of December. It has said it is planning to raise cash by taking its Japanese mobile phone unit public this year.
Even though Sprint's customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by discounting. Analysts have said that without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market.
T-Mobile, under its Chief Executive Officer John Legere, has fared better than Sprint, even if it remains a distant third to Verizon and AT&T. It has managed to score sustained market share gains, as innovative offerings, improving network performance and good customer service attract new customers, according to Moody's Investors Service Inc.
T-Mobile became the first major U.S. carrier to eliminate two-year contracts, a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has also unsettled rivals with its unlimited data plans.
Another roadblock to the deal could be regulatory hurdles. Sprint's and T-Mobile's first round of merger talks ended in 2014 after U.S. President Barack Obama's administration expressed antitrust concerns about the deal.

It is not clear how the Trump administration would view the combination. AT&T agreed to acquire U.S. media company  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX) in October 2016 for $85 billion. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued to block the deal over concerns about the companies' pricing power in the media market. AT&T and Time Warner are currently defending their deal in court.

Toyota said the investment will include replacing the current production lines, allowing the facility ""to produce advanced vehicles more efficiently and better adapt to changing market needs.""

Unlike U.S. automakers General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) - which are pulling back from passenger cars as American consumers abandon them in favor of higher-margin, more comfortable pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers - Toyota, Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) and Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) have all invested heavily in all-new versions of their sedan models.

1578,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 05:26PM ET</span>",Trump tariffs cause headaches for S&P 500 manufacturers,"By Lewis Krauskopf and Noel Randewich
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum from China are leading to higher costs for major U.S. manufacturers and causing concerns at other companies, according to executives who spoke to investors in recent days.
The topic has arisen on a fifth of conference calls for S&P 500 companies reporting quarterly results so far this month, as of Wednesday, according to a Reuters analysis of transcripts.
Executives at Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and Whirlpool Corp (N:WHR) were among those warning investors about higher materials costs stemming from the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. 
Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and Fifth Third Bancorp (O:FITB) said their banking clients were also concerned about protectionism and trade tensions. Corporate executives and investors are worried the row over tariffs, particularly with China, will escalate into a full-blown trade war.
The 2018 first quarter marked the first reporting period for companies since Trump in March imposed the 25 percent duty on imports of steel and 10 percent on aluminum. 
Not all companies that discussed tariffs on calls said they expected to be hurt by them. Some said they hedged against volatile metals prices or that such costs were a small part of their overall businesses.
Harley-Davidson Chief Financial Officer John Olin warned that he expects extra costs stemming from the tariffs ""on top of already rising raw materials that we expected at the start of the year."" 
""That's going to provide quite a headwind for the company over the next several quarters,"" Olin said on the motorcycle maker's conference call with analysts.
Whirlpool appeared to be a beneficiary of Trump's initial wave of tariffs, which included steep tariffs on imported washing machines.
But the appliance maker's chief executive, Marc Bitzer, told analysts this week the company was raising its raw material inflation guidance for the year by about $50 million to as much as $300 million, ""primarily due to previously announced U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum.""
""Over the last few months, raw material costs have risen substantially,"" Bitzer said.
NEGOTIATED RESOLUTION?
Affirming the United States' top-notch credit rating on Wednesday, Moody's said it believes a negotiated resolution between Washington and Beijing is more likely than a destructive tariff tit for tat.
Beijing has responded to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs with levies on U.S. aluminum as well as agricultural products such as fruit and nuts. Both sides are threatening more tariffs on tens of billions of dollars in goods, with Washington targeting Chinese televisions and machinery components while Beijing is eyeing U.S. soybeans, aircraft and cars. 
Ford CFO Robert Shanks pointed to an increase in commodity costs which was ""largely metals driven, in part, by the market's reaction to potential increases in U.S. tariffs.""
Manufacturers' quarterly reports echoed a survey this month from the Institute for Supply Management, which showed a surge in the cost of raw materials and worries about the impact of steel and aluminum import tariffs.
On its quarterly conference call on Tuesday,  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) said steel costs for the equipment industry were up about 15 percent in the March quarter. The heavy equipment maker's shares tumbled 6.2 percent on concerns that rising materials costs could squeeze profit margins.
Some companies said they planned to manage any cost increases for materials by controlling expenses through their supply chains or by raising prices for their products.
Homebuilder PulteGroup Inc (N:PHM) pointed to inflation pressure on construction materials it depends on. 
""You hear about tariff-related increases on steel and aluminum. So having said that, there is inflationary pressure on commodities,"" said Chief Financial Officer Robert O'Shaughnessy. ""The good news is that we've seen a market that's allowed us to price to cover most of that."" 
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company had yet to see a significant impact on costs from the tariffs, but was ""keeping a very close eye"" on the broad trade environment.

""This is daily actions and daily vigilance on this topic,"" Muilenburg said.

1580,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 07:02PM ET</span>","Starbucks' promotions struggle to attract U.S. customers, shares slip","By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) on Thursday reported stagnant store traffic at established U.S. cafes for the second quarter in a row, stirring concerns about intense competition from upscale coffee houses as well as fast-food chains and convenience stores.
Shares in the world's biggest coffee chain fell 1.9 percent in extended hours after stepped-up promotions failed to lure more U.S. customers, who drive the lion's share of Starbucks profits. 
Same-store sales for the U.S.-dominated Americas region rose 2 percent for the second quarter ended April 1. Increased spending per visit drove the same-store sales rise since customer visits, referred to as traffic, were flat.
Starbucks' home market of the United States is its largest, with more than 14,000 stores. During the quarter, U.S. cafes offered 15 percent off new blonde espresso drinks and half-price espresso drinks during afternoon Happy Hour.
But China is Starbucks' biggest growth driver. Same-store sales in that 3,200-store market were up 4 percent in the second quarter, versus gains of 6 percent and 8 percent in the two prior periods. Executives attributed the softer results in the latest quarter to a shift in the timing of Lunar New Year. They said business remains strong, but declined to give traffic results. 
Starbucks' global traffic was down 1 percent for the quarter, with the Europe, Middle East and Africa region falling 4 percent. 
Total revenue rose almost 14 percent to $6.0 billion.
Starbucks' quarterly net income was $660 million, or 47 cents per share, compared with $653 million, or 45 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding items, profit of 53 cents a share matched expectations.
The company said its board authorized buying back 100 million shares, which is worth more than $5 billion at current prices.
The results come as Starbucks is working to limit or avoid reputational damage from the arrests of two black men in a Philadelphia cafe two weeks ago. A bystander video of the incident went viral, fueling protests and calls to boycott the chain.
Starbucks apologized for the incident, which was set in motion when a manager called police to report the two men who were waiting for a friend and had not made purchases. It plans to close 8,000 company-owned cafes on the afternoon of May 29 for racial tolerance training. 

Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said on a post-earnings call that the incident has not had an impact on U.S. same-store sales.

1581,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 04:26PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 things to watch ,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets Friday, April 27.
1. US Q1 GDP, Consumer Sentiment Data in Focus 
U.S. bond yields are expected to remain in focus Friday as first-quarter GDP and inflation data could confirm investors’ bullish expectations on both the U.S. economy and inflation. Consumer sentiment data is also expected to garner investor attention.
The preliminary reading of first-quarter U.S. GDP at 08:30am ET is expected to show the economy expanded 2.0%, down from the fourth quarter growth of 2.9%. While the GDP price index is expected to show a 2.2% reading.
The Employment Cost Index, which measures the change in the price businesses and the government pay for civilian labor, is expected to show a reading of 0.7% slightly above the 0.6% growth seen in the fourth quarter.
Michigan’s consumer expectations due 10:00 am, are expected to show a reading of 86.9 for April, while consumer sentiment is forecast to show a reading of 98.0 up from 97.8 seen in the previous month.
The fall in US bond prices following the dramatic rise in treasury yields attracted a wave of buyers on Thursday, pressuring the 10-year treasury yield below 3%.
The dollar, however, traded higher against a basket of major currencies on Thursday as falling bond yields were offset by euro weakness after ECB Draghi delivered a mixed message on the Eurozone economy.
2. Amazon, Microsoft to Extend Nasdaq Rally?
Shares of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) rallied more than 6% to $1,617.03 in afterhours trade on Thursday, after the e-commerce giant posted earnings that beat on both the top and bottom line.
Amazon reported earnings of $3.27 per share on $51.04 billion in revenue, which was well above analysts’ expectations for earnings of $1.26 per share on $49.78 billion in revenue.
Amazon Web Services, the cloud service platform, continued to show robust growth, as revenue rose 49% to $5.44 billion, topping expectations of $5.25 billion.
Shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), however, fell in afterhours trade despite the tech giant reporting earnings and revenue that beat analysts’ expectations.
Microsoft reported earnings of 95 cents per share on $26.82 billion in revenue, beating analysts’ expectations for earnings of 85 cents per share on $25.77 billion in revenue.
Microsoft’s personal computing segment posted revenue of $9.92 billion for the quarter, above analysts’ estimates of $9.25 billion.
Meanwhile, Microsoft’s transition from its legacy businesses to cloud remained on track as its Intelligent Cloud segment posted revenues of $7.90 billion beating Wall Street estimates of $7.68 billion.
The NASDAQ closed 1.64% at 7,118.68.
3. Baker Hughes Rig Count Data on Tap
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday at 1:00 pm ET, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand after data last week showed the number of U.S. oil rigs rose for the third straight week
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Investors are also expected to monitor any further evidence of a shift in sentiment on the Iranian nuclear deal after French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday that he expected U.S. President Donald Trump to pull out of a deal with Iran, reached in 2015.

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2018 12:00AM ET</span>","Amazon delivers dazzling profits, as well as $20 Prime hike and NFL games","By Jeffrey Dastin and Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) more than doubled its profit on Thursday and predicted strong spring results as the world's biggest online retailer raised the price for U.S. Prime subscribers, added U.S. football games and touted its cloud services for business.
The results showed the broad strength of the company, which has been expanding far beyond shipping packages, the business that has drawn the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump.
The forecast beat expectations on Wall Street, sending shares up 7 percent to a new record high in after-hours trade and adding $8 billion to the net worth of Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive and largest shareholder.
Seattle-based Amazon is winning business from older, big box rivals by delivering virtually any product to customers at a low cost, and at times faster than it takes to buy goods from a physical store. It is expanding across industries, too, striking a $130 million deal to stream Thursday night games for the U.S. National Football League online and working to ship groceries to doorsteps from Whole Foods stores nationwide.
Sales jumped 43 percent to $51.0 billion in the quarter, topping estimates of $49.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/24gibla)
Amazon's fast ascent has made it a lightning rod for the ire of Trump. Bezos privately owns the Washington Post, which Trump has described as Amazon's ""chief lobbyist."" Bezos has no involvement in news coverage, the paper's top editor has said. Trump has also claimed without evidence that Amazon is costing the U.S. Postal Service money and ordered a task force to investigate.
Success is ""the best revenge that Bezos can get against the administration for its veiled threats about sales taxes and not paying its fair share,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.
Prime, Amazon's loyalty club that includes fast shipping, video streaming and other benefits, has been key to Amazon's strategy. Its more than 100 million members globally spend above average on Amazon.
The company announced Thursday it will increase the yearly price of Prime to $119 from $99 for U.S. members this spring. The fee hike is expected to add a windfall to Amazon's subscription revenue, already up 60 percent in the first quarter at $3.1 billion.
""We do feel it's still the best deal in retail,"" Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer, said on a call with analysts. He said the number of items Prime members can get within two days had grown fivefold since the last price increase four years ago.
Despite the surge in shopping, Olsavsky gave credit for Amazon's $1.6 billion profit last quarter to two younger businesses: advertising and Amazon Web Services. 
Revenue from third-party sellers paying to promote their products on Amazon.com was an unusually large bright spot during the quarter, with sales in the category, which includes some other items, growing 139 percent to $2.03 billion. This included $560 million from an accounting change.
""Advertising is an important and very profitable bucket of revenue for Amazon and is also growing at a fast rate,"" said D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte. ""They are just getting started here.""
Amazon said it expects operating profit this quarter between $1.1 billion and $1.9 billion, up from $628 million a year earlier. Analysts were expecting $1.01 billion, according to analytics firm FactSet. 
SPENDING ON VIDEO, INTERNATIONALLY
Amazon Web Services (AWS), which handles data and computing for large enterprises in the cloud, won new business and saw its profit margin expand. It posted a 49 percent rise in sales from a year earlier to $5.44 billion, beating estimates.
Amazon remains the biggest in the space by revenue, and its stock trades at a significant premium to cloud-computing rival  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT).
Amazon's shares have also outperformed the S&P 500 (SPX), rising 30 percent this year as of Thursday's market close, compared with the S&P's less than 1 percent decline.
Notorious for running on a low profit margin, Amazon has still reaped rewards for shareholders as it has bet on new services like voice-controlled computing and has expanded across continents and industries.
Global headcount was up 60 percent from a year earlier at 563,100 full-time and part-time employees, thanks to a hiring spree and an influx of workers from Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM).
The company plans to increase its video content spending this year, Amazon's Olsavsky said, with a prequel to ""The Lord of the Rings"" in the works. The third quarter will also see extra spending to prepare for the busy holiday season.
Amazon is working with JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) to determine how to cut health costs for hundreds of thousands of their employees.
And it is expanding its retail footprint outside the United States, particularly in India. Amazon's international operating loss grew 29 percent to $622 million in the first quarter.

1599,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>","Citigroup Says Buy 3% 10-Year Treasuries, Target Rally to 2.65%","(Bloomberg) -- Who wants to buy U.S. Treasuries at these levels?  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., for one.
With the longest selloff in a year stalling, Citigroup strategists Jabaz Mathai and Jason Williams say go long duration by purchasing 10-year notes at about 3 percent. They’re targeting a rally that pushes the yield down to 2.65 percent, according to a note released Thursday. They’d add to their position on a selloff up to 3.1 percent, but would stop out at a close over 3.15 percent.
Investors in the world’s biggest bond market are weighing how much further yields can rise after they touched the highest levels in four years this week. The median estimate among 57 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is for the 10-year rate to climb gradually for the rest of 2018, to 3.14 percent by year-end. It fell three basis points to just below 3 percent on Thursday.
While an onslaught of debt issuance has weighed on the Treasury market, “the upcoming increase in supply for the next quarter is already priced in,” Mathai and Williams wrote.
Meanwhile, losses in Treasuries will likely be contained by equity markets that are still skittish about what higher rates will mean, they said. In February, a sharp rise in U.S. yields helped spark a brief stock-market rout.
“Equity markets are reacting negatively to increases in Treasury yields,” the strategists wrote. “A further sell off in rates will be held in check by the feedback loop from equity markets.”
The main risk, they say, is that crude prices continue to climb, pushing breakeven inflation rates higher and Treasury yields as well.
Citi isn’t alone in questioning how much higher yields will rise. BMO Capital Markets strategists on Thursday pondered a formation known as a “double top” for the 10-year yield at around 3.033 percent, the approximate intraday high over the past two sessions. They’re less aggressive in their snapback, seeing 2.851 percent as a potential destination.
Just a day ago, it seemed no one wanted to step in front of climbing yields. Now that the market has proved it won’t decline every session, it seems some are mustering the courage."
1600,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>",All The Things China Market Analysts Got Wrong This Year,"(Bloomberg) -- Anyone who shorted Chinese stocks, went long the yuan and loaded up on the country’s government debt has unexpectedly won big in 2018.
Strategists across the board have been blindsided by China’s financial markets this year, where extreme moves mean the nation has hosted both the world’s best and worst performing assets all at once. The Shanghai Composite Index is now 16 percent below December’s year-end targets, the 10-year bond yields 108 basis points less than forecast, and the currency is already stronger than almost all analysts had predicted.
Concern that a trade spat with the U.S. will hurt China’s already-slowing economy has accelerated a flight to safety since late January, spurring investors to dump stocks that were trading at the loftiest valuations since 2015. Receding inflation risks and worse-than-expected data helped make bonds a relative haven, vindicating contrarians like Jean-Charles Sambor who has been bullish on China’s debt since yields peaked in November.
“Investors got wrong footed on China given they were expecting strong growth, inflationary pressures, and an aggressive deleveraging combined with potential monetary tightening,” said Sambor, who helps manage $3.7 billion at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management’s deputy head of emerging-market debt in London. “Clearly, none of these materialized.”
There have been tentative signs this week that market behavior could be shifting in China. But while equity investors on Tuesday applauded signs that the Communist Party is willing to ease its tightening campaign, stocks have since given back most of those gains. The yuan isn’t far off the highest level since its 2015 devaluation, even as policymakers on Wednesday allowed more capital to flow out of the country. And although 10-year yields are up this week, they’ve still heading for their biggest monthly decline in almost two years.
One-way bets are a common sighting in China, especially for stocks where crowded trades tend to unravel as quickly as they gather. For longer-term investors with a high threshold for risk, wading through the noise is a challenge that’s become all too familiar.
“Volatility is a function of China -- its markets typically exaggerate moves one way or another,” said Howard Wang, who oversees JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management’s Greater China fund in Hong Kong. “You need to look through this and find companies which are doing really well. We think the right level for A shares is up a healthy double digits year to date.”
That’s a tall order for the mainland’s main equity benchmarks: the Shanghai Composite, the CSI 300 Index and the FTSE A50 Index are all down at least 6.5 percent for the year. The losses, as well as softening economic growth, prompted  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists to trim their index targets for China’s earlier this month.
Adding to the unease is the wall of institutional money that may be preparing to rotate out of equities and into safer assets like bonds, as China pushes ahead with its clampdown on leverage, according to Morgan Stanley strategists. Although delayed, new rules that will govern the country’s $16 trillion asset management products industry will focus on curbing risk and have probably caused some preemptive withdrawals, the strategists say.
“It’s hard to say just how much these recent movements in equity and bond prices reflect economic fundamentals and how much they reflect regulatory changes,” said Jonathan Garner, Morgan Stanley’s chief Asia and emerging market strategist in Hong Kong. “A clear set of April data will tell us where the economy is really heading.”"
1601,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 03:51PM ET</span>",Musk's 'no new capital' promise faces scrutiny when Tesla reports results,"By Alexandria Sage
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Investors are accustomed to the bold promises of Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) Elon Musk, but his assertion that the electric vehicle maker will not need more funds this year has many scratching their heads. How can the chief executive deliver on his many goals without a fresh infusion of outside cash? 
The California-based Tesla faces a crucial time in its 15-year history. Production setbacks with its new Model 3 - the hotly anticipated sedan Tesla vowed would push electric vehicles into the mainstream - have cast a shadow over Musk's promises and judgment. A host of new projects in the pipeline, from a semi truck to an SUV, now appear to some analysts as expensive, time-consuming distractions, even as rival automakers come to market with their own electric offerings. 
A capital raise would raise alarm bells with investors as the company continues to burn money. Tesla reports first-quarter results on May 2.
Understanding Musk's bullish prediction is a complex accounting exercise that relies on multiple best-case scenarios. These include: building a promised 5,000 Model 3 sedans per week by the end of the second quarter; curtailing or deferring high spending that added up to $3.4 billion in capital expenditures in 2017; and improving gross margins. 
The dearth of information about Tesla's multiple capital-intensive projects - from the Model Y crossover this year, the partially built battery Gigafactory in Nevada, and the Semi truck and Roadster, forecast to begin production in 2019 and 2020 - complicates the task. 
""There are a lot of moving parts there,"" Andrew Walker of Rangeley Capital, which holds a small short position in Tesla, said on Wednesday. ""It's just so many questions and such a black box, it's very difficult to determine going forward."" Shorts bet that a share price will fall.
Tesla shares were up 1 percent at $283.67 on Thursday afternoon. Its shares have fallen over 9 percent so far this year.
UBS analyst Colin Langan has estimated that Tesla - which ended 2017 with $3.37 billion in cash - could fall below a cushion of $1 billion at the end of June due to estimated negative free cash flow of $1.6 billion in the first half of the year. Some, like Bernstein, put that estimate higher, at negative $1.8 billion. 
Subtracting another $1.2 billion for 2018 debt refinancing and accrued liabilities reduces Tesla's cash level to $600 million, UBS calculates. Using a more bullish free cash flow model, such as Morgan Stanley's first-half estimate of negative $880 million, Tesla would still hover just above the cushion, at $1.3 billion.
""Tesla may not 'need' to raise funds, but many investors expect that the company will very much 'want' to,"" wrote Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas in a note published last week. 
Much hinges on efficient, volume production of the Model 3 along with tight spending control.
Tesla aims to build 3,000-4,000 Model 3s per week next month, up from more than 2,000 Model 3s today, and to increase production to 5,000 by the end of the second quarter. 
Building 5,000 Model 3s per week priced at $44,000 would yield revenue of $2.64 billion per quarter, although efficiency determines how much of that trickles down to the bottom line. 
But those calculations may be moot. Morgan Stanley's Jonas noted that ""no investor that we have spoken to expects Model 3 production of 5k/week by the end of 2Q'18."" 
'LOSING CREDIBILITY'
Tesla has repeatedly underestimated its capital requirements and has raised money, whether through equity or debt, even after claiming it had no need to do so.
""The company's financial predictions may be losing credibility within the financial community,"" wrote Cowen & Co analyst Jeffrey Osborne in a note to clients earlier this month.
Since March, short interest in the stock has risen sharply to 30 percent of float, or shares available for trading.
Currently, analysts, on average, predict Tesla will not reach profitability on a non-GAAP basis until the first quarter of 2019. According to Thomson Reuters data, analysts see adjusted losses of $217.6 million and $40.1 million in the third and fourth quarters, respectively, after revising estimates downward to twice the losses they expected at the end of 2017. 
They expect, on average, negative cash flow of $125 million and $67 million in the third and fourth quarters.
Other one-off factors influencing profit include the sale of zero emission vehicle (ZEV) credits or deposits from Model Y customers. Musk's recent admission that he erred in adding too much automation into the Model 3 assembly line could also prove an expensive mistake to unwind.
The Model 3 targets a 25 percent gross margin when fully ramped, but with production line stoppages and the need to hire 400 more hourly workers, the vehicle's negative margins today could be further pressured in the short-term.

With all that in mind, a 2018 capital raise, according to UBS's Langan, is ""a question of when, not if.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA) executive was sentenced to two years in prison on Thursday after he was found guilty by a jury of defrauding  Cairn Energy  Plc (L:CNE) in a $3.5 billion currency trade in 2011.
Mark Johnson, formerly head of HSBC's global foreign exchange cash trading desk, was sentenced by U.S. District judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, according to John Marzulli, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue. He was also ordered to pay a $300,000 fine.
Lawyers for Johnson could not immediately be reached for comment.
Johnson, a 52-year-old British citizen, was convicted of fraud in October after a nearly four-week trial. He was the first banker to be tried in the United States as a result of worldwide investigations of the multi-trillion-dollar per day currency market. 
The probes have led to about $10 billion in fines against several banks and the firing of dozens of traders.
According to court filings, Cairn hired HSBC in 2011 to convert $3.5 billion into British pounds sterling in connection with the sale of an Indian subsidiary.
Prosecutors said that Johnson and another former HSBC executive who is also facing charges, Stuart Scott, devised a scheme to drive up the price of pounds by executing a series of trades before carrying out the trade for Cairn.
Such trading in advance of a client's order to make a profit is known as ""front-running.""
During the trial, jurors heard numerous tape recorded phone calls between Johnson and others discussing the trade.
In one call, Scott and Johnson told Cairn and its financial adviser after the trade that a ""Russian buyer"" had been responsible for a spike in the price of pounds. Prosecutors said that was a lie.
Scott, who was HSBC's former head of cash trading for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, remains in Britain. A London judge ruled last October that he be extradited to the United States to face charges, which Scott said he would appeal.

Johnson left HSBC in 2017 before his trial, and Scott left in 2014, according to an HSBC spokesman.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A union of Caesars Entertainment Corp employees on Thursday asked its board to remove several private equity representatives from the compensation committee, citing high pay for top executives as Caesars' operating unit emerged from bankruptcy.
""Executive compensation at Caesars is out of control,"" a Las Vegas affiliate of Unite Here, which represents more than a third of Caesars' 52,000 workers, told the casino company's Chairman James Hunt in letter Thursday seen by Reuters.
The union cited concerns including large stock awards to leaders including Caesars Chief Executive Mark Frissora, and that directors will not hold an advisory vote on executive compensation at their annual meeting scheduled for May 30.
The company's April 10 proxy shows Frissora made $23.9 million in 2017, up from $9.5 million in 2016. The increase mainly reflected the value of a one-time grant of $16.5 million in restricted stock meant to retain his services, the proxy states.
Caesars' compensation committee chair is David Sambur, a senior partner at Apollo Global Management, and includes Richard Schifter, a senior advisor at TPG Capital. A prior committee that set executive pay for 2017 also included Apollo and TPG representatives.
Spokespeople for Apollo and for TPG declined to comment. Representatives for Caesars did not respond to requests for comment.
A restructuring settlement last year resolved claims by creditors that the private equity firms stripped billions of dollars of assets before putting Caesars' main operating unit into bankruptcy in 2015. Apollo and TPG led a leveraged buyout of Caesars in 2008.
In addition to the removal of Apollo and TPG representatives from the compensation committee, Unite Here asked Caesar's board to increase employee pay and to cap CEO pay at 150 times that of the median employee.
Frissora made 601 times as much as his median worker last year, according to the company's proxy dated April 10, reflecting the new ""pay ratio"" disclosure requirement for U.S. companies this year.
The ratio was higher than at all but 7 of 69 companies that had filed proxies as of March 31 tracked by compensation data firm Equilar.

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 04:34PM ET</span>","Wall Street seeks rule changes to encourage IPOs, staying public","By Sinéad Carew and Michelle Price
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wall Street lobby groups urged U.S. policy makers and regulators to revamp rules to encourage more initial public offerings and to reduce the regulatory cost of staying public, in a white paper issued on Thursday. 
Groups including the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Nasdaq along with technology and biotechnology groups, are pushing to reduce the reporting burden for smaller public companies and to relax other rules governing public companies and research analysts.
Industry groups have published several such papers since President Donald Trump was elected on a platform that included promises to boost economic growth by cutting red tape. 
Banks and exchanges want to take advantage of the shifting tone in Washington, and the appointment of business-friendly regulators, to win rule changes they say will help the economy.
The U.S. Treasury has already published a blueprint on reforming the country's capital markets, but bank lobbyists are hoping to keep the spotlight on the issue, they said.
Consumer advocates and progressive Democrats have warned, however, that loosening listing rules could ultimately hurt mom-and-pop investors.
Equity listings have ""become increasingly unattractive to businesses"", according to the paper entitled Expanding the On-Ramp, referring to widely-cited data that IPOs in the United States have roughly halved over the past 20 years. 
The paper advocates adjustments to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act including easing requirements for companies with less than $1 billion in annual revenue for up to 10 years, up from the five-year time span currently in place. 
It also asks the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to simplify quarterly reporting requirements, allowing smaller companies to issue a press release with financial results instead of the more detailed 10-Q report that companies file with the SEC. 
Chipping away at a longstanding Chinese wall, the group also called for the SEC to remove barriers to investment banks and analysts from jointly attending deal pitch meetings and to expand what can be discussed at the meetings as long as no promises of favorable research are given.
It also called on the SEC to examine why very few investment banks publish pre-IPO research and for it to revamp its rules to reduce the number of shareholder proposals that must be put on proxy statements alongside management proposals.
The paper said that about 61 percent of listed companies with less than a $100 million market capitalization have no research analyst coverage and that a lack of research can reduce investor interest and hamper liquidity and overall trading, citing a June 2017 research report from CapitalIQ. 
The group wants the SEC to change rules for venture capital investors to expand the pool of possible investors for smaller companies and also called for an increase in the amount of stock mutual fund firms can own in companies before triggering regulatory thresholds related to diversification. It wants to boost the threshold to 15 percent of voting shares from the current limit of 10 percent.
But it also asked the regulator to clamp down on unlawful activity by short-sellers and to ensure there is enough public information about potential market manipulation.
SEC representatives had no immediate comment on the paper. The body's chairman, Jay Clayton, has signaled his support for rules easing that would boost capital formation, but any major changes would have to be voted on by the whole commission.

The group behind the paper also spoke out against activist investors and urged Congress to enact legislation requiring proxy advisory firms to disclose and manage conflicts of interest and provide issuers with enough time to respond to errors or flaws in voting recommendations.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - WestJet Airlines new chief executive is facing his first major test as the Canadian carrier's pilots weigh strike action and larger rival Air Canada on Thursday offered to accommodate travelers if there is a disruption.
WestJet shares fell more than 3 percent Thursday after the company's pilots initiated a strike authorization vote late on Wednesday.
WestJet Chief Executive Ed Sims, who took the top job in March, said this month he aimed to reach a first agreement with unionized pilots this year, in a break with the carrier's former CEO Gregg Saretsky, who did not expect a first contract before 2019.
The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which represents WestJet pilots, said the two sides remain far apart in areas such as working conditions, compensation and job security. 
Air Canada said it was ready to adjust schedules and capacity to limit disruptions for the traveling public in event of labor disruption at WestJet..
WestJet played down the possibility of disruptions, saying in a statement on Thursday that its flight operations were unaffected by the strike vote and it was committed to working with the pilots.
""Strike mandates are a relatively common collective bargaining tactic and do not mean that a strike will take place,"" WestJet said.
AltaCorp Capital analyst Chris Murray said travel concerns related to the labor dispute were creating ""uncertainty"" around WestJet and the dispute had the potential to weigh on its revenues per available seat mile (RASM) in the coming months.
""We would not be surprised to hear the company talk about some RASM pressure around Q2 and Q3 because of concerns over labor issues,"" he said.
WestJet stock was down 3.2 percent at C$22.38 in afternoon trade, while the benchmark Canadian share index was up 0.8 percent. Air Canada shares were up 0.2 percent.
The strike vote, which was triggered after more than six months of negotiations, will remain open for 15 days, ALPA said in a statement on Wednesday. The statutory 60-day federal conciliation period ends on April 27. The pilots are allowed to strike after a 21-day cooling-off period that begins after that date, right before a busy summer travel season, the union said.

ALPA, which represents more than 60,000 pilots at 34 airlines in the United States and Canada, said it aimed to avoid a possible May 19 strike, but were prepared for all outcomes.

(Reuters) - MetLife Inc (N:MET) reduced total 2017 compensation for its chief executive and chief financial officer, a year marked by two key errors, including payments it failed to make to pensioners whom it could not locate, according to a filing on Thursday.
MetLife CEO Steven Kandarian received total compensation of $14.7 million, a 3.6 percent drop from $15.3 million he received in 2016, MetLife said in its proxy filing.
Total compensation for the New York-based insurer's CFO, John Hele, dropped by 6.4 percent, to $5.3 million from $5.7 million, according to the filing, a change that reflects MetLife's ""performance in managing financial matters, including material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting,"" MetLife said.
MetLife revealed two errors in 2017, including internal failures that resulted in the insurer not making payments to 13,500 pensioners whose plans MetLife took over from private companies.
The problem, which MetLife is in the process of trying to fix by locating and paying the pensioners, stretched back 25 years, the company said in January.
In February, the company had to boost reserves by $510 million pretax because it had previously released funds for its obligations to the pensioners.
In March, MetLife said it uncovered a reserve miscalculation for a Japanese annuity product during a review it launched in late 2017 and completed early this year.
""MetLife did not live up to the high standards we set for ourselves,"" Kandarian wrote in his annual letter, also on Thursday. 
The company reduced a cash annual incentive compensation award for each of the two executives by 25 percent to $3 million for Kandarian and $1.5 million for Hele. 

MetLife also considered MetLife's total shareholder return in its analysis, it said.

Searches were being conducted at 50 locations, including New Delhi and Mumbai, for evidence of fraud carried out through the loan accounts of a company registered in the British Virgin Islands and a Finnish firm, the Central Bureau of Investigation said in a statement.
The case registered relates to criminal conspiracy, breach of trust by a public servant and cheating, according to the statement from the CBI late on Thursday. 
The bank said in a statement it had sought recovery of assets from one borrower after it became a bad loan but it did not provide any details of loans to the other company or name the bank officials being questioned.
It said the CBI had been examining certain documents relating to that loan and had spoken to some senior officers. 
According to the allegations, loans were granted to the companies by IDBI Bank's senior management and independent directors, who ignored existing guidelines and relaxed some of the conditions, the CBI said. 
""It is a case of alleged fraud on the bank by then executives of the bank, then promoters of the group and the companies involved,"" the CBI said.
The alleged $90 million fraud, arose from losses resulting from two loans, according to the CBI. The statement did not say how much IDBI recovered from the borrowers.
In 2014, according to the CBI, IDBI is accused of giving a loan of $83 million to the company based in the British Virgin Islands, Axcel Sunshine Ltd, which was used to pay off loans of associate companies from the same group, violating Indian regulatory guidelines. 
The CBI also says IDBI gave the unnamed Finnish company a loan equivalent to 52 million euros ($63 million) in 2010. The firm was showing stress, and in 2013 it was granted voluntary bankruptcy by a Finnish court.
IDBI said in the statement late on Thursday it had given a loan to Axcel Sunshine Ltd in February 2014, which became a non-performing asset in December 2015. 
""The loan has been fully provided for,"" IDBI said. ""The bank has initiated recovery actions to recover dues from the borrower in August 2016.""
Reuters was unable to contact Axcel Sunshine as no website could be found for the company.

1630,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 12:25PM ET</span>",NAFTA autos origin rules could hurt U.S. sales and exports: study,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. proposals on rules of origin that govern what percentage of a car needs to be built in the NAFTA region to avoid tariffs would hurt American consumers, lead to lower U.S. vehicle sales and hurt U.S. car exports, according to a study released on Thursday.
According to the study, compiled by the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research (CAR), the current proposals on rules of origin for autos could force some U.S. automotive and parts manufacturing to move to lower-cost regions outside North America.
In talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico, U.S. President Donald Trump's negotiators initially demanded that North American-built vehicles contain 85 percent content made in NAFTA countries by value, up from 62.5 percent now. 
But industry officials say that has been cut to 75 percent, with certain components coming from areas that pay higher wages.
The rules have become a pivotal issue in talks on overhauling the 24-year-old trade pact.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Wednesday that good progress has been made at NAFTA trade talks on the key issue of auto rules, though they have been overshadowed by proposed U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs coming into force next week. 
Setting ""very stringent"" rules of origin ""with the goal of bringing manufacturing back to the United States and the NAFTA region could have the opposite effect if the content targets are set too high, or the rules are too onerous,"" the study says. 
CAR estimates that tariffs on vehicles that fail to meet the proposed new rules of origin would mean a minimum tax of between $2.1 billion and $3.8 billion on U.S. consumers and if manufacturers passed on the entire cost it could reduce annual vehicle sales by up to 150,000 units. 
The study states that the United States currently exports 2.4 million vehicles annually, which represents just over a fifth of U.S. production. 
""The U.S. proposal would raise the cost of production, incur tariffs on U.S. vehicle exports that do not meet the higher NAFTA content threshold and result in fewer U.S. vehicle exports,"" the study says. 
CAR also says in the study the proposal is aimed at boosting U.S. and NAFTA automotive production capacity, but the U.S. market is not growing to support new capacity.

""Global overcapacity poses financial risks to the companies, and automakers and suppliers are cautious about investment decisions since overcapacity compounded the industry’s financial problems in the recent recession,"" the study says.

1634,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Airbus heads for dogfight with UTC over CSeries costs,"By Tim Hepher and Allison Lampert
PARIS/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Airbus is preparing to cross swords with United Technologies over the price of components and services for the Bombardier CSeries in a bid to make it easier to market the jet it agreed to bail out last year, people close to the matter said. 
Airbus (PA:AIR) is concerned about an increased share of the Canadian project that would be controlled by United Technologies (N:UTX) after it completes its $23 billion acquisition of Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL), they said, asking not to be named.
Together, the pair will have by far the largest share of CSeries parts and systems by value, placing it at the center of efforts by Airbus to reduce the plane's cost and echoing a broader power struggle between planemakers and suppliers.
A key part of the acquisition is ""muscling the supply chain down on price"", said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based Teal Group.
""Bombardier couldn't do that, they just didn't have the leverage. And Airbus has more than enough leverage.""
Airbus and UTC declined to comment. A Bombardier spokeswoman said UTC was the largest CSeries supplier even before completion of the Rockwell Collins merger, but declined to comment further. 
Airbus agreed last October to buy the struggling CSeries for a token one Canadian dollar, with both sides reckoning its global sales presence and clout with suppliers would make the plane more competitive and easier to sell.
The deal came weeks after United Technologies teamed up with Rockwell Collins with plans to create a new super-supplier.
Among shared components,  United Tech  supplies engines for the CSeries and Rockwell Collins supplies cockpit systems. Aboulafia said pre-merger UTC supplied about a quarter of CSeries content. 
Items up for negotiation are likely to include the cost of parts, spares and services like repairs, sources said.
MARKETING DILEMMA 
Costs are not the only factor as the CSeries seeks a fresh start. Airbus is also studying how to use its marketing weight.
One proposal is to drop the 14-year-old CSeries name and call it the A200, indicating a smaller cousin of the Airbus product line that stretches from the A318 to the mammoth A380.
But the possible change, first reported by Bloomberg News, could upset politicians in Quebec who fear losing a key brand and jars with some in Europe who say it harks back to the first A300 Airbus or even the troubled A400M.
The debate over what to call it mirrors deeper questions over how Airbus will market the plane, a decision that would send a message on how it views its new Canadian partner.
Airbus is trying to decide whether to integrate it into the Airbus sales force or set up a new dedicated team, sources said.
A separate structure would give it strong attention but shift the emphasis away from cross-selling with Airbus models.
Having one sales force would highlight the opportunity for package deals across the Airbus portfolio, but risk distraction from key priorities like reviving weak sales of the A330neo.

""It doesn't much matter what you call the CSeries if you are not selling A330s,"" a senior industry source commented.

1635,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 06:11PM ET</span>",Mexico economy minister says NAFTA revamp talks 'not easy',"By David Lawder and Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Much remains to be done before a new North American Free Trade Agreement is reached, Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Thursday, tempering hopes for a quick deal as ministers met in Washington for a third successive day.
Negotiators from the United States, Mexico and Canada have been working constantly for weeks to clinch a deal, but major differences remain on contentious topics such as autos content.
Complicating matters, the Trump administration has threatened to impose sanctions on Canadian and Mexican steel and aluminum on May 1 if not enough progress has been made on NAFTA.
President Donald Trump, who came into office in January 2017 decrying NAFTA and other international trade deals as unfair to the United States, has repeatedly threatened to walk away from the agreement with Canada and Mexico, which took effect in 1994.
""It is going, it's going, but not easy - too many things, too many issues to tackle,"" Guajardo told reporters after a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
Now underway for eight months, the talks to revamp the accord underpinning $1.2 trillion in trade entered a more intensive phase after the last formal round of negotiations ended in March with ministers vowing to push for a deal.
Lighthizer is due to visit China next week, and when asked if a deal was possible before the USTR left, Guajardo said: ""It will depend on our abilities and creativity. We are trying to do our best, but there are still a lot of things pending.""
Although Washington is keen for an agreement soon to avoid clashing with a July 1 Mexican presidential election, the three NAFTA members remain locked in talks to agree on new rules governing minimum content requirements for the auto industry.
Still, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland rejected the notion that discussion of the so-called rules of origin for the automotive sector was holding up the process.
""I would very much disagree with the characterization of the autos conversation as being log-jammed,"" she said as she entered the USTR offices. ""This is a week when very good, significant progress is being made on rules of origin for the car sector.""
Freeland said she would skip a planned visit to a NATO summit in Brussels on Friday, and vowed to stay in Washington for ""as long as it takes."" Guajardo, too, said he was ready to remain in Washington this week for more talks.
The three sides are also trying to settle disagreements over U.S. demands to change how trade disputes are handled, to restrict access to agricultural markets and to include a clause that would allow a country to quit NAFTA after five years.
Bosco de la Vega, head of Mexico's National Agricultural Council, the main farm lobby, said he believed the three would be able to reach an agreement on agricultural access.
But the auto sector rules were still contentious, he added.
""It's the most important issue there,"" he said, adding that he had earmarked May 10 as the deadline for a quick deal.
Separately, Canada on Thursday unveiled details of how it plans to prevent the smuggling of cheap steel and aluminum into the North American market in a bid to avoid the U.S. tariffs.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced the plan last month, said Ottawa would hire 40 new trade officers to probe complaints, including those related to steel and aluminum.

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 12:33PM ET</span>","EU strikes deal forcing Netflix, Amazon to fund European content","By Julia Fioretti
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU lawmakers and member states on Thursday struck a preliminary deal that will allow countries to force online streaming services including Netflix (O:NFLX) and Amazon's (O:AMZN) video service to help fund European films and TV shows.
The new law extends the European Union's broadcasting rules to online video services and includes a quota of 30 percent for European works on video-on-demand platforms, the European Parliament said.
Video-sharing platforms like Google's YouTube (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB) will also have to take measures against content ""inciting violence, hatred and terrorism.""
Online platforms will need to create a ""transparent, easy-to-use and effective mechanism to allow users to report or flag content.""
""We have been successful in negotiating that a similar level of protection now also applies to internet media services, as it does to the classical broadcast media services,"" said Sabine Verheyen, the EU lawmaker who helped steer the legislation through the European Parliament.
The revised rules will apply to traditional broadcasters as well as to video-on-demand platforms and live streaming online, such as Facebook Live.
EU member states will have the option of requiring streaming services not based in that country but targeting their audience to contribute financially to the production of European works, such as by directly investing in them or paying into national funds.
Under the current rules member states can only make on-demand services based in their jurisdiction pay into European content.
The level of contribution in each country will be proportional to the on-demand revenues in that country.
""The EU’s regulation of video sharing platforms is a step in the right direction but more needs to be done to examine online liability and protect EU citizens by bringing online platforms up to the same regulatory standard as TV,"" said David Wheeldon, Group Director of Policy and Public Affairs, at broadcaster Sky (L:SKYB).

Thursday's agreement still needs to be formally approved by both the whole European Parliament and EU member states.

1639,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 11:21AM ET</span>",CFM says more than half of engines inspected after emergency directive,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Jet engine manufacturer CFM International Inc said on Thursday airlines have inspected more than half of nearly 700 CFM engines subject to an emergency order issued late Friday by U.S. and European regulators.
The inspections cover engines like the one involved in a fatal Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) engine blowout last week. The directives for inspections by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency suggested rising concerns about CFM56-7B engines, built by the joint venture of  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and France's  Safran  SA (PA:SAF). The same type of engine had a similar failure in 2016.
Ultrasonic inspections on fan blades that have been used in more than 30,000 cycles, or in service for about 20 years, will be required by May 10, the agencies said. A cycle includes one take-off and landing -- and 150 had already been inspected prior to Friday's order.
Cincinnati, Ohio-based CFM International said airline operators have completed more than 60 percent of mandated ultrasonic inspections on CFM56-7B engines with more than 30,000 cycles.
As soon as next week, the FAA was expected to finalize a separate directive on CFM56-7B engines it had proposed in August covering a different set of engines, two officials briefed on the matter said.
The engine explosion on Southwest Airlines flight 1380 in Pennsylvania was caused by a fan blade that broke off, the FAA said. The blast shattered a window, killing a passenger, the first U.S. passenger airline fatality since 2009.
The CFM56-7B engine powers the Boeing (NYSE:BA) Next-Generation 737. Approximately 14,000 CFM56-7B engines are operated by 60 companies worldwide.
CFM said GE and Safran Aircraft Engines are supporting airlines with a team of 500 experts worldwide to complete the inspections quickly and help to minimize operational disruption. Southwest has said it is cancelling some flights as a result of inspections.
CFM also recommends completing inspections of fan blades with more than 20,000 cycles by the end of August, and inspections to all other fan blades by the time they reach 20,000 cycles. After first inspection, operators are recommended to repeat the inspection every 3,000 cycles, typically about two years in airline service. Those inspections for fan blades with 20,000 cycles will affect an additional 2,500 engines by August.

The engine that blew apart on last week's Southwest flight would have been affected by Friday's inspection order, since the company said it had 40,000 cycles.

At Britain's Ellesmere Port Vauxhall factory, workers voted in favor of a deal which will give them a lump sump of 750 pounds ($1,046) and a 1.5 percent pay rise in January 2019, mirroring a deal agreed at the firm's southern English van site.
""Our continued focus is to secure investment from PSA in new models at Ellesmere Port and guarantee the plant’s long-term future,"" said Len McCluskey, General Secretary of Unite, Britain's biggest trade union. 
The deal will also see the amount of hours banked by workers reduced as PSA, which last year acquired Opel and its sister brand Vauxhall, tries to restructure the company and return it to profitability. 
In Germany, Opel workers have protested against PSA's plans to rein in wages in return for new production investments including a company demand that 19,000 German workers give up a 4.3 percent pay rise.

1648,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 01:59PM ET</span>",Column: Head to the career office before you pick a college,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)
Unlike his friends who are living at home three years after college graduation, John Kelly has paid off his student loan balance of $60,000 and is thriving as a real estate broker. The 25-year-old is on his way to turning his own Boston property management company into a multi-million dollar business.  
Kelly attributes his success to carefully picking the right college for himself - Northeastern University in Boston – because it had a strong focus on career development.
That focus on future earnings is unusual considering next year’s college freshmen will do little to scrutinize the career help available from the schools on their list before making a final selection by the May 1 deadline. 
Not many students who go to “accepted student” weekends stop by the career center when they are on campus. That is a mistake, said Robert Franek, author of The Princeton Review’s “Colleges that Create Futures.”
Although college admissions offices often laud their institutions’ career help, in a Gallup Poll only 16 percent of college students said their college career center was very helpful.
And students really need the help. Despite a sharp upturn in the nation’s employment in the last few years, the New York Federal Reserve reported this year that 43 percent of recent college graduates were “underemployed” in jobs that did not require their college educations. That is a harsh reality when four years at a public university can cost over $100,000 and when the average student with loans has been leaving college with over $30,000 in debt. 
To improve the odds of better career outcomes, experts provide this advice.
* Scrutinize the career center
If you find the career office tucked into a corner, manned by a single person and a self-serve computer, that is not a good sign. Instead, look for a school with a serious commitment to career development, such as the University of Florida, which has 25 full-time employees to help students think about careers and link to internships and recruiters, said Franek.
* Start early
Kelly was introduced to his first internship in technology sales as a freshman and found it boring. After he spoke with an adviser, his next internship was with a real estate sales company. It was a hit. After two more internships, Kelly had confidence and a business network. “I now have clients I met at 18,” Kelly said. 
In a survey of employers, the National Association of Colleges and Employers found that internships are the top criteria employers use when comparing job candidates - even more important than your major and twice as important as the college attended.  
* Get the data
Pushed by government policy and parent demand, colleges are in the early phases of gathering data on jobs obtained by their graduates. They will have rates of employment and early career pay for the average graduate, but that may not be relevant. You may have to go to a department head to find out about internships and the long-term outlook for your career. If there is no data, that is a bad sign.
* Think creatively  
Although fields such as engineering or business connect easily to related internships, students with liberal arts degrees must be more creative and get more help spotting relevant internships. 

Even with some job experience, those in majors such as English or political science can struggle to find jobs after graduating.

That's the thinking of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which outlined its concern in a note to clients.The problem with tax cuts at this stage of the economic cycle is that they rob policy makers of a fiscal stimulus tool they might need at a later date, which will compound stock market declines.Morgan Stanley says most of the tax cut package's fiscal stimulus is already priced into stock prices, with the bulk of the benefit seen in higher corporate profits.That too is a concern because if earnings expectations are too high, it increases the chance that companies will fail to meet them, which will magnify investor disappointment and stock price declines.In a previous note, Morgan Stanley said rising volatility and declining investor sentiment will make it difficult for stocks to eclipse their January peak."
1650,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 10:32AM ET</span>",The Myth That Markets Get Prices Right Won’t Die,"(Bloomberg View) -- At this point, the efficient markets hypothesis makes for an easy rhetorical target. Precious few economists and financial professionals are willing to stand up in public anymore and assert that financial markets produce the best estimate of fundamental asset values. A series of enormous bubbles, plus decades of outsized profits for hedge funds like Renaissance Technologies, has turned the EMH into a bit of a joke.
Meanwhile, finding ways to beat the market has become a parlor game in the world of financial economics. Hundreds of papers have been published claiming to have found new ways to predict returns. Defenders of the EMH counter that many of these so-called “anomalies” are probably false alarms, much of it due to what's known as publication bias. As economists Campbell Harvey, Yan Liu and Caroline Zhu pointed out in a famous 2013 paper, the statistical hurdles that researchers demand that anomalies pass are probably not high enough. That leads to a sort of “monkeys on typewriters” effect -- if enough finance professors sift through the data for long enough, they’ll find a bunch of apparent EMH violations that are exciting enough to get published, but which evaporate upon further scrutiny. That concern seems to be supported by the fact that most anomalies disappear over time.
This finding allows efficient market theory’s defenders to raise the suspicion that most of the violations of their theory are fake. But this proves to be only a small respite. First of all, just because anomalies are fleeting doesn’t mean they weren’t real to begin with. A recent paper by David McLean and Jeffrey Pontiff found that anomalies often hold up even after they’re discovered, but then disappear only after finance professors publish papers about them. That implies that market flaws are real, but traders learn about them by reading academic papers, then trade against the mispricings until they fade. A follow-up paper by Heiko Jacobs and Sebastian Muller found that in most countries, markets are even less efficient than in the U.S. and the anomalies discovered by finance professors persist for a much longer time.
Now Andrew Chen and Tom Zimmermann have a paper claiming that publication bias is much more subdued than previously believed. They reason that if an anomaly comes from data mining, it will probably just barely be statistically significant. But many anomalies show up with extremely strong signals in the data -- much stronger than would be required to claim significance. That implies that many are real, and can be used to beat the market -- at least, until enough traders catch on that the mispricing gets traded away.
Efficient market theory’s defenders have a second tactic to deal with challenges. If an anomaly survives scrutiny and replication, and persists for a long time, the EMH’s remaining adherents will generally try to classify it as a “risk factor,” claiming that the extra return compensates investors for taking extra risk that can’t be diversified away. For some economists, it’s almost an article of faith that changes in the prices of stocks come from changes in investors’ risk preferences, rather than from swings of irrational sentiment or the market’s failure to take important information into account. Eugene Fama, who won the Nobel Prize for his formulation of the EMH, has by now expanded his preferred set of “risk factors” to five, while others identify many more.
A new paper by business school professors Lars Lochstoer and Paul Tetlock investigates whether risk-based stories hold up. The researchers develop a new statistical procedure for separating changes in a company’s expected cash flows from changes in investors’ risk preferences, combining information about differences between companies at a given point in time with information about changes in stock values over long periods of time. They find that most of the excess returns that investors can get from factor investing -- or, if you prefer, from trading against anomalies -- come not from changes in risk preferences, but from changes in the long-term path of companies’ cash flows. Furthermore, they find that when overall risk tolerance in the market goes up, tolerance to the specific risks represented by the popular risk factors tends to go down, a strange phenomenon for which there’s no explanation as yet.
Lochstoer and Tetlock’s result implies that anomalies probably don’t come from variations in investors’ preferences. That doesn’t prove that risk isn’t the culprit -- a company that suffers some change that causes it to make less money over the long term also probably becomes riskier. But the authors’ evidence is also consistent with another story -- the idea that when a stock does badly, investors irrationally expect it to keep doing badly.
In other words, efficient markets theory isn’t dead yet. There are still loopholes its defenders can thread, that allow them to claim that nobody really beats the market, and that all excess returns are just compensation for taking on extra risk. But as more anomalies persist, and more risk-based theories are found wanting, the window for the EMH grows smaller and smaller.
Eventually, it seems likely that a new consensus will replace the EMH -- that the market is a complex ecosystem of hundreds or thousands of imperfections, offering clever investors plenty of opportunities to make money in the short term, but that these mispricings are constantly shifting, appearing and disappearing as investors chase them and trade them away."

1652,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>","More parcels, higher prices lift UPS profit but costs soar","By Eric M. Johnson
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) reported higher first-quarter net profit on Thursday, driven by strong package volumes in its core U.S. segment, but higher costs from Saturday delivery and nasty winter weather weighed on the bottom line.
Shares were up 2.2 percent in morning trade after the world's largest package delivery company said revenue increased 10 percent to $17.1 billion in the first quarter from a year ago, topping analyst expectations of $16.47 billion. 
Revenue at its core U.S. package service rose 7.2 percent to $10.2 billion from a year-ago, driven by a 4.6-percent rise in parcel volumes that reflected growth of online purchases. 
However, severe winter weather dragged down its operating profit by $85 million, as did higher expenses for network improvements, higher pension costs, and a big expansion of Saturday delivery over the last year. Operating profit in its core domestic segment plummeted 20 percent, and was down 6 percent overall.
""Higher costs continue to pressure earnings,"" Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. ""In general, the company struggles with capacity issues during the peak season (the weeks leading up to Christmas), and could have issues achieving their EPS target unless their performance improves.""
UPS, seen as an indicator of U.S. economic strength and consumer demand, reaffirmed its 2018 earnings per share range of $7.03 to $7.37 and maintained its 2018 spending plan of between $6.5 billion to $7 billion on network improvements like new technology and automating its parcel sorting hubs.
Chief Executive David Abney has promised to deliver higher margins by pumping billions of dollars into network upgrades and expansions to handle the growth of e-commerce, as investors bristle over the costs. 
The rapid rise in online shopping has been a boon for shipping demand, but UPS has struggled to bring down the extra costs of delivering to households which on average receive fewer packages at one time than businesses.
Revenue per parcel delivered rose just 2.6 percent, as higher prices and fuel surcharges offset the higher costs, the company said.
Analysts on a conference call asked Abney about Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) efforts to expand its own delivery capacity for volume traditionally handled by UPS and rival FedEx Corp (N:FDX).
""It's very hard to predict what Amazon or any other of our large shippers are going to do,"" Abney said, adding UPS would evaluate any market moves and react accordingly. 
UPS appears to be seeking out new ways to shave costs. On Wednesday, it offered early-retirement payouts to U.S. management employees, but declined to say how many employees it expects to leave.
Abney also said UPS was making progress on non-wage matters during protracted negotiations with the Teamsters union on a contract ending July 31.
UPS posted first-quarter net income of $1.35 billion or $1.55 per share, up from $1.17 billion or $1.33 per share a year earlier, a 17 percent rise on a per share basis.

Analysts expected earnings per share of $1.54.

1655,By Business Insider,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 09:57AM ET</span>",Amazon is trading at more than 200 times its earnings — here's why that's not as crazy as it sounds,"That bet has paid off quite handsomely of late. Amazon's shares have well more than doubled over the last two years and are up around 25% in the year to date.
But with the company's stock now trading at a precariously high rate of more than 200 times its earnings over the last year, the key question for investors is whether Amazon will be able to keep meeting their expectations.
For now, Wall Street thinks it can. When Amazon  reports earnings on Thursday, analysts are expecting it will announce a 40% jump in sales — boosted in part by its Whole Foods acquisition — and are looking the company to forecast a similar increase for the second quarter.
Bulls have plenty they can point to support their optimism. Amazon dominates online commerce in the US and continues to grow its share of the market both here and abroad. Its purchase of Whole Foods last year gives it a new opportunity to grow its retail sales, luring Whole Foods customers to its web store and its online customers to the grocery chain.
Meanwhile, the company recently announced that it now has 100 million subscribers to its Prime service. Because Prime customers tend to spend more with the company than the average consumer, the ever growing number of them could lead to a boom in Amazon's retail sales.
But many analysts think that the company's best prospects are outside its traditional business of selling products directly to customers. There's a lot of optimism, for instance, about Amazon's prospects in a related area — selling and delivering goods for other merchants.
Over the last several years, Amazon has been building out its network of fulfillment centers around the world. Last year, it spent $10.1 billion — up from $6.7 billion the year before — in part to expand that network.
That outlay is starting to pay off. Last year, the company brought in $31.9 billion from commissions and shipping and delivery fees for sales by third-party vendors. That was up from around $23 billion in 2016.
Another area many analysts are hopeful about is advertising. As Amazon has become the first stop for folks shopping online, it's started to build up an advertising business, allowing companies to advertise their wares to its shoppers.
Many analysts have high hopes for that business, seeing it as a source of low-cost revenue growth, which could lead to substantial profits. It's already off to a strong start. Last year, the company brought in $4.7 billion in ""other"" revenue, which includes its advertising sales. That was up from about $3 billion the previous year.
But the biggest source of optimism for analysts and investors has generally been Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud-computing service. The company pioneered the market and  now firmly leads it. With large and small businesses alike increasingly embracing the cloud and moving away from operating their own data centers, that's a good position to be in.
AWS has already been growing rapidly. Last year, the segment posted sales of $17.5 billion and reached an annualized run rate of $20 billion. That was up from $12.2 billion in sales in 2016.
Even though the cloud-computing effort still represents a small portion of Amazon's overall revenue, it already provides the lion's share of its profits. Last year, AWS brought in $4.3 billion in operating income, which more than made up for the $225 million operating loss posted by Amazon's combined North American and international retail operations.
Analysts are betting that AWS will continue to post such strong results.
But for any company trading at such a steep premium, falling even a little shy of analyst and investor expectations could be painful. And there are at least some reasons to be concerned about Amazon.
Of late, the company and founder Jeff Bezos have found themselves in the sights of President Donald Trump, who has  complained that Amazon unfairly competes with local retailers and pays less than it should to the US Postal Service for delivery costs. Those complaints could eventually weigh on Amazon's revenue and profits, particularly if they result in more uniform collection of online sales taxes — which could hit the company's third-party sellers — and  higher postage rates.
But there are other concerns beyond those coming from Trump. As the company has built out its fulfilment network and added new titles to its library of streaming videos available to its Prime members, its debt has started to swell and long-term obligations have started to swell. Last year, its long-term debt more than tripled to $24.7 billion, while its long-term obligations — which are largely comprised of lease agreements — jumped to $21 billion from $12.6 billion.
More broadly, Amazon has some $40 billion in bills coming due between now and the end of 2020 just from debt, leases, video content production agreements, and similar long-term commitments.
Much of the bull case around the company has been built around not its reported profits, which are traditional fairly modest, but around its ability to produce free cash flow, which is the difference between the money generated from its operations and its investments in property and equipment and other capital expenditures.
Last year, Amazon posted free cash flow of $8.4 billion. That was more than double its reported profit of $3 billion, but off from the $10.5 billion it posted the year before.
Free cash flow is supposed to be a way of getting at how much cash a company is really generating on an ongoing basis. But in Amazon's case, that may not be the case. If you start taking into account the money it's spending repaying its leasing costs, the company's cash flow starts to look a lot worse. By at least some measures, if you include such costs, Amazon actually saw a net outflow of cash last year, to the tune of $1.5 billion.
For now, though, Amazon's optimists are winning the day. As long as the company continue to post impressive growth, that likely won't change."

Before the results on Wednesday evening, the row over the improper sharing of data had knocked 13 percent, or more than $70 billion, off the market value of the world's biggest social network. 
The first quarter numbers showed Facebook's quarterly profit rose 63 percent, and revenue 49 percent, beating already upbeat analysts' estimates on the back of growing ad sales.
""Facebook's ad unit innovation, investment and focus on bringing new advertisers to the platform are driving this,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Brian Nowak said. 
""This, to us, speaks to how Facebook (and Google, for that matter) can continue to post outsized ad growth and earnings power for years to come.""
Monthly active users also rose 13 percent to 2.2 billion, quashing worries that the data scandal and the launch of a #DeleteFacebook tag would lead to users leaving the social network.
As with Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) earlier this week, however, Facebook is also spending more to make data on its platform more secure. It said expenses this year will grow between 50 percent and 60 percent, up from a prior range of 45 percent to 60 percent.
Initially, at least, investors were judging that a sensible move rather than a big threat to the company's bottom line.
""We believe this is a prudent move to secure the stabilization of user engagement, advertiser confidence and government relations,"" Mizuho Securities analyst James Lee said.
At least eight brokerages raised their price targets on Facebook stock, while one cut its price on the stock.
Mizuho's Lee was most bullish with a price target of $255. Facebook's mean price target was $216.87 versus the $173 it was trading at on Thursday.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst lowered his price target on the stock to $190 from $225, saying he expects more tape-bombs in 2018 before sentiment eventually improves.

""We don't think (the) first quarter marks the ""all clear"" for Facebook shares by any means, but given the drubbing over the past two months, we think it may start an overdue stabilization period,"" Sandler wrote in a client note titled ""Senator, we run ads.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - The International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank, expects to invest up to $300 million in green bonds, mainly in the financial sector, in the Middle East and North Africa by 2020, a director at the organization told Reuters in an interview.
IFC is participating in a $150 million green bonds program by Fransabank, the fourth-largest Lebanese bank.
On Thursday Fransabank become the first bank in the Levant to issue green bonds, which raise capital for projects with environmental benefits, when it announced the first sale of $60 million.
Global green bond issuance hit a record $155.5 billion in 2017 and is tipped to surpass that level in 2018. They are becoming an increasingly popular source of borrowing for emerging market banks, with National Bank of Abu Dhabi launching the Middle East's first green bond in 2016.
""We want to do more in this region and we are in discussions with a few banks in Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon and there could be more issues in the 2018 calendar year,"" said Mouayed Makhlouf, IFC director for the Middle East and North Africa.
""If all develops well, we could reach $200 to $300 million in the next couple of years within this space in the region.""
IFC is an anchor investor in Fransabank's program, investing $45 million in the first issuance of $60 million. It has board approval to invest another $30 million in the program. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is contributing $15 million, marking its first debt project in Lebanon.
Fransabank said the proceeds from the bonds will help provide financing to eco-friendly projects in commercial energy efficiency, renewable energy and green buildings.
Lebanon's greenhouse gas emissions have risen by 28 percent since 1994. The project will help cut these emissions by at least 6,000 tonnes per year by 2022.
Last year, more than 50 percent of IFC's funding in the Middle East and North Africa went to climate-related activities, more than in any other region, said Makhlouf.

Detroit (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales in April likely fell nearly 8 percent from the same month in 2017 despite big discounts for consumers, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Thursday.
For much of the past two years, the discounts offered by automakers have remained at levels that industry analysts say are unsustainable and unhealthy in the long term.
April U.S. new vehicle sales will likely be about 1.31 million units, down from 1.42 million units a year earlier, the consultancies said.
The forecast was based on the first 17 selling days of April. Automakers, including  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), will release April U.S. sales results on May 1.
Earlier this month, No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co (N:GM) said it will stop reporting monthly U.S. sales because the 30-day snapshot does not accurately reflect the market. GM will instead issue quarterly sales reports.
U.S. new vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2017 to 17.23 million units after hitting a record high in 2016.
Sales are expected to drop further in 2018 as interest rates rise and more late-model used cars return to dealer lots to compete with new ones.
LMC expects full-year 2018 U.S. new vehicle sales to come in at around 17 million units.
""Uncertainty and unfavorable factors appear to be mounting for autos, including a volatile stock market, rising interest rates, rising oil prices and potential trade roadblocks,"" Jeff Schuster, LMC's head of global vehicle forecasts, said in a statement.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales for April will be 16.6 million vehicles, down more than 2 percent from 17 million units in April 2017, the consultancies said.
Retail sales to consumers, excluding lower-margin fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government, were set to decline about 9 percent in April.
The level of consumer discounts, which can erode profit margins and undercut resale values, ""remains the larger concern,"" the consultancies said. 

The average discount was $3,698, up $187 from April 2017. Discounts on trucks and SUVs were up $426, but down $226 on passenger cars.

1680,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 09:01AM ET</span>",GM's Crossovers Keep Profit Rolling Amid Truck Plant Revamp,"(Bloomberg) -- General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).’s hot-selling new crossovers are padding profit for the largest U.S. automaker amid a costly retooling of truck factories and restructuring of Korean operations.
Adjusted earnings fell to $1.43 a share in the first quarter, beating analysts’ average estimate for $1.24. The Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain drove better-than-expected revenue and buoyed GM through downtime at pickup plants that shut down early this year for retooling to build redesigned versions of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra.
Wall Street was expecting the revenue and profit drop, and Chief Finance Officer Chuck Stevens called the results a “very solid performance.” He said GM is on pace to nearly match last year’s record profit on the strength of new SUVs, growth in China, improvements in South Korea and gains by its auto-lending business.
The company is “very much on plan based on our expectations for the year and given some of the challenges related to the truck downtime,” Stevens told reporters Thursday in Detroit. “Within that, we had very solid North American performance and record earnings in China and record earnings at GM Financial.”
Barra’s Ambition
Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra delivered an ambitious forecast at the beginning of 2018: that GM would keep earnings consistent with last year in spite of the changeover involving GM’s lucrative truck lines. The automaker made 47,000 fewer full-size pickups in the first quarter. That squeezed revenue, which dropped to $36.1 billion.
GM shares slipped 0.9 percent $37.75 as of 8:42 a.m. in New York, before regular trading.
Margins in GM’s North America business fell to 8 percent, from 11.8 percent a year earlier, but executives reaffirmed a target of at least 10 percent for the full year, along with total earnings per share in the mid-$6 range.
The automaker’s restructuring of its Korean operations resulted in a one-time charge of $942 million related to closing a plant in Gunsan, paying termination benefits and non-cash impairment charges.
GM’s Korean labor union has ratified an agreement that, coupled with factory closure, will lead to $400 million to $500 million in cost savings. Stevens said GM is reducing its workforce to 13,000, from 17,000, and cutting production capacity by 25 percent.
Pricier raw materials, especially steel, was a $200 million headwind in the quarter, and adding content to new models heaped on another $500 million in cost.
At the same time, GM’s China business reported record quarterly income of $597 million, up from $504 million a year ago. Its GM Financial lending unit doubled income to a record $443 million in the quarter.

1681,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 08:31AM ET</span>","BoE simulates how funds, insurers cope with big margin calls","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England is studying how funds and insurers could cope with sudden demands for cash to back trades without resorting to a destabilizing fire sale of assets, a senior BoE official said on Thursday.
Alex Brazier, the Bank's executive director for financial stability strategy, said the simulation exercises will check how the investment sector could deal with a big increase in margin or collateral, and whether they hold enough ""liquid"" assets to meet it.
""I use the word simulation rather than stress test because stress test implies a pass/fail exercise for an individual entity, the way we do it for banks,"" Brazier told a London Business School conference on asset management.
""Our work here explores the depths of how open-ended funds, hedge funds, dealers, insurance companies, unit-linked funds and pension funds might, through responding separately to their incentives and constraints, together amplify market shocks,"" Brazier added.
The move is a sign of how the BoE's attention is turning to stability issues in other parts of the financial system now that it sees banks holding enough capital in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
The simulation exercise looks at how the investment sector acts as a whole, but no new rules are anticipated for now, Brazier said.
""I wouldn't say it's a precursor to anything at this stage. This is a diagnostic exercise, to dive beneath the surface and figure out whether this iceberg is growing,"" he said.
""The first step is always to diagnose before you get anything close to thinking about regulation.""
The issue is also linked to the big rise in bond issuance to fund companies - rather than traditional bank loans.
Some bond funds offer fast redemptions to investors, putting pressure on them to come up with cash at short notice in stressed markets, which can also create a ""liquidity mismatch"".
But developments in the corporate debt market also need careful scrutiny to check whether banks continue to be resilient to any price adjustments, he said.
Corporate debt in Britain is around its long-term average level as a multiple of earnings.
""Nevertheless, developments in corporate debt bear close scrutiny because we cannot take for granted that it will stay this way,"" Brazier said.
Kanwardeep Ahluwalia, head of global markets risk (EMEA) at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), said the main concern for bond markets is whether there be an orderly unwinding of central bank easy money.
""It’s pretty straight-forward, there’s been a lot of money in the market, interest rates have been low, it’s been easy to borrow money and (now) interest rates are going up, so let’s see, can people pay or not?"" he said.
Brazier said if the recent developments he noted in corporate debt continue, the BoE will need to assess whether they increase risks faced by banks.

The BoE's risk watchdog, the Financial Policy Committee, will review in June whether to raise the banks' so-called counter cyclical capital buffer if such ""domestic risk appetite"" becomes worrisome.

Revenue from Turner rose 10 percent to $3.34 billion, beating analysts' estimate of $3.29 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company said the increase in advertising revenue was mainly due to the airing of the final four games of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament on Turner.
Like other media companies, Time Warner has been struggling to keep viewers hooked to its channels as they flock to online streaming services such as Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Prime, which in turn is taking a toll on the ad revenue.
Warner Bros revenue fell 4 percent to $3.2 billion, primarily due to weakness in its television and theatrical businesses, the company said in a statement.
Net income attributable to shareholders increased to $1.64 billion, or $2.07 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $1.42 billion, or $1.80 per share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 3 percent to $8 billion.

1685,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 08:02AM ET</span>",Shell Makes Investors Wait for Reward From Surging Oil Prices,"(Bloomberg) -- Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc rode the surge in oil prices to even greater heights, posting a profit not seen since the days of $100 a barrel. Investors were displeased that the company didn’t take them along for the ride.
While French rival  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) has started disbursing the rewards of rising energy prices -- with higher dividends and share buybacks -- Shell has other priorities, at least for now. Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl declined to say when her planned $25 billion to $30 billion stock-repurchase program would start, telling reporters on a call that she wanted to focus on debt reduction first.
There are two big reasons for the company’s caution. First, it still has to pay off the acquisition of BG Group Plc in 2016, a deal that’s turbo charged natural gas earnings but left Shell heavily indebted. Second, its cash flow -- little changed from a year earlier despite higher oil prices -- “may not necessarily support” the planned buybacks, according to RBC Capital Markets.
Earnings at Europe’s largest energy company vaulted ahead of the upswing in crude to an average of $67 in the first quarter, reaping the benefits of years of cost cuts. Adjusted net income was $5.32 billion last quarter, compared with $3.75 billion a year earlier. That surpassed analysts expectations of $5.2 billion, rising to a level only consistently seen when oil traded for more than $100.
Total and  Statoil  (OL:STL) ASA also posted the best earnings in years this week, with Total pumping a record amount of oil and gas in the first quarter. Shares of the French company rose in response to its results, the opposite of the reaction to Shell.
Shell dropped as much as 2.8 percent as analysts raised concerns about flat cash flow from operations, which was $9.43 billion in the first three months of 2018.
“The only negative here is the conversion of those earnings into cash flow,” Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said by telephone. “It’s a little bit lighter than what I was expecting.”
Shell’s free cash flow was sufficient to fund the company’s cash dividends and interest payments in the first quarter, which wasn’t always the case during the oil-price slump. Like its peers, Shell was forced to make some payments to investors in shares during the downturn, known as a scrip dividend, while also borrowing to fund the cash portion of the payout.
Those newly created shares diluted the holdings of some investors, who have maintained a sharp focus on the timing of the buybacks required to offset the impact. Shell wasn’t able to offer a clear answer on what could trigger the repurchases.
“It’s an integrated decision. I’ve provided enough insight,” CFO Uhl told reporters in response to several questions about buybacks.
That situation should change.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said in a note that they expect Shell to begin the program in the second half.
“We would expect cash flow growth through the year supported by the current macro environment,” said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “Royal Dutch Shell remains one of our preferred super-majors.”

(Reuters) - Facebook's 9.4 percent jump after blockbuster results and gains in chipmakers powered technology stocks on Thursday, with easing U.S. bond yields helping the sentiment on Wall Street.
The S&P technology index rose 2.2 percent, the biggest gainer among the 11 major S&P sectors, and was on track to break its six-day losing streak. Only six stocks in the 69-member index were in the red.
The gains come after U.S. equities were pressured by a rise in the 10-year Treasury yield to 3 percent on Tuesday, a level it last hit in 2014, stoking fears about rising inflation and corporate costs.
""The rising yields are having an impact and there are some concerns that we're in an environment where we're seeing a peak in terms of earnings growth,"" said Emily Roland, head of capital markets research at John Hancock Investments in Boston.""
""But some of these factors are overshadowing the fact we have sturdy fundamental backdrop, both earnings and economic.""
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reported a strong 63 percent rise in profit and an increase in users, with no sign that business was hurt by a scandal over the mishandling of personal data.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) which is set to report after the closing bell on Thursday, was up 3 percent.
Of the 227 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings so far, 79.7 percent topped profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts now expect earnings growth of 23.1 percent, compared with 18.6 percent at the start of the season.
""We're seeing interest rates go up ... but what we're seeing today is fundamentals winning the argument,"" said Kevin Miller, chief executive officer of E-Valuator Funds in Bloomington, Minnesota.

Among other big gainers was Visa which rose 4.8 percent following the payments network's better-than-expected profit and earnings forecast raise.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) were up 12.2 percent and 0.3 percent after the chipmakers posted quarterly results that beat Wall Street estimates, offsetting the recent worries over slowing smartphone chips demand. 
The gains pushed the Philadelphia Semiconductor index up by more than 1.4 percent.
The Dow Jones Transport index fell 1.1 percent, led by a 3 percent decline in  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP), after the No. 1 U.S. railroad operator warned on a key operating metric. 
General Motors (NYSE:GM) fell 1.8 percent after the automaker reported a decline in quarterly profit and said it expected material costs to continue rising.

1687,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 08:26AM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler cuts debt by more than expected,"MILAN (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) (MI:FCHA) reduced its debts by more than expected in the first quarter, putting the carmaker well on course to become cash positive later this year.
Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne expects to cancel all debt during 2018 - possibly by the end of June - and generate around 4 billion euros ($5 billion) in net cash by the end of the year.
Marchionne has said that forecast does not include any one-off measures, nor the impact of the planned spin-off of parts maker Magneti Marelli, which he hopes to execute by early 2019.
The world's seventh-largest carmaker said on Thursday net debt had fallen to 1.3 billion euros ($1.6 billion) by the end of March, well below a consensus forecast of 2.6 billion euros in a Thomson Reuters poll of analysts.
FCA said capital spending fell 900 million euros in the quarter due to ""programme timing"", which analysts said implied higher investments for the rest of the year.
The Italian-American group (N:FCAU) said first-quarter operating profit rose 5 percent to 1.61 billion euros, below a consensus forecast of 1.74 billion, as a weaker performance from its North American profit center weighed.
Shipments there were higher due to the new Jeep Wrangler and Compass models. But currency moves hit revenues and earnings, and costs related to new product launches added to the pressure. 
FCA's shift to sell more trucks and SUVs boosted margins yet again in North America to 7.4 percent from 7.3 percent in the same quarter a year ago, although they were down from the 8 percent recorded in the preceding three months.
Marchionne, preparing to hand over to an internal successor next year, is close to his goal of ending a margin gap with larger U.S. rivals General Motors (N:GM) and Ford (N:F). 
The 65-year-old has said becoming debt free and being able to compete on a par with U.S. peers would mean FCA no longer needed a partner to survive and could well succeed on its own.
The CEO has previously said tying up with another carmaker would help to meet the huge costs in an industry investing in electric vehicles and automated driving. 
FCA shares fell immediately after the results, but recovered to trade up 3 percent at 19.71 euros by 1150 GMT, outperforming a 0.4 percent rise in Europe's blue-chip stock index (FTEU3).

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 11:52AM ET</span>","ConocoPhillips profit tops estimates on rising oil prices, cost cuts","By Ernest Scheyder
HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (N:COP), the world's largest independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company, posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by rising crude prices (CLc1) and cost cuts.
Results at Conoco, like many of its peers, have steadily improved in recent quarters alongside commodity prices and as better technology makes operations more efficient. 
Also, Conoco's stock has risen as the company has prioritized cost cuts and asset sales over production increases. Conoco generated more cash in the first quarter than its capital budget and shareholder payouts.
Shares are up about 21 percent so far this year, outpacing the S&P 500 Energy Index (SPNY), which has gained about 3 percent since January. The stock's biggest increase came after the company boosted its share buyback and dividend in February. 
Houston-based Conoco's stock rose 1.5 percent to $66.04 in late-morning trading. 
""We remain focused on creating value for our shareholders by maintaining discipline, following our priorities and staying committed to our returns-focused value proposition,"" Chief Executive Ryan Lance said in a statement. 
Conoco profit rose to $888 million, or 75 cents per share, in the first quarter, from $586 million, or 47 cents, in the year-ago quarter. 
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 96 cents per share, exceeding the 73 cents expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Doug Terreson, an oil industry analyst with Evercore ISI, said the results reflected a ""positive surprise"" and were an indication that energy companies can generate healthy profits even when prioritizing shareholder returns. 
Production fell 23 percent to 1.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) as a result of recent asset sales.
Profit jumped across all the geographic regions where Conoco operates, especially Alaska, where the company has recently increased exploration activity after writing down the value of some assets in recent years. Its U.S. shale operations also turned profitable after losing cash for more than a year.
Conoco kept its 2018 capital budget at $5.5 billion, but raised its production outlook slightly and now expects to pump 1.2 million to 1.24 million boe/d this year. 
Conoco said on Wednesday an international arbitration court ordered Venezuela's state-run oil company, PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], to pay it $2.04 billion for early dissolution of two joint ventures for producing oil in the OPEC-member country.
Conoco executives plan a conference call with investors to discuss the results later on Thursday. 

Rivals  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) are due to report results on Friday.

1691,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 08:08AM ET</span>",GM profit dips on truck changeover but beats estimates,"By Nick Carey and Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) on Thursday reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit despite a drop in production of high-margin pickup trucks, as it gears up for new models that are expected to boost profits next year.
Like rivals  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA), GM is banking on highly-profitable pickup trucks to lift profits, as consumers shift away from traditional passenger cars in favor of these larger, more comfortable trucks, SUVs and crossovers.
During the first quarter, the process of changing over to GM's new pickup trucks resulted in a drop in production of 47,000 units. GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens said the production drop had resulted in a drop in pre-tax profit of up to $800 million. 
Earlier this year, GM said its 2018 profits would be flat compared with 2017, but expected its all-new pickup trucks would boost margins starting in 2019. On Thursday, GM reiterated its full-year 2018 forecast for adjusted earnings in a range from $6.30 to $6.60 per share.
The automaker said capital expenditures were more than $500 million higher in the quarter because of investments its new pickup trucks and a family of low-cost vehicles under development with Chinese partner SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104).
On Wednesday, rival Ford said it would stop investing in most traditional passenger models in North America.
GM CFO Stevens told reporters on Thursday that the automaker has ""already indicated that we will make significantly lower investments on a go-forward basis"" in sedans.
GM benefited from a lower effective tax rate in the quarter, but adjusted pre-tax margin fell to 7.2 percent from 9.5 percent a year earlier. Stevens said the company's profit margin should hit 10 percent or higher in the second quarter and for the full year.
GM said material costs were $700 million higher in the first quarter and it expects those costs to continue rising. The automaker said it would counter those increases with cost cutting measures. 
""It is a more difficult environment than it was three or four months ago,"" Stevens said when asked about rising commodity prices from potential steel and aluminum tariffs announced by the Trump administration. ""But we are confident we can continue to offset that.""
The company reported quarterly net income of $1.05 billion or $1.43 per share, a drop of nearly 60 percent from $2.61 billion or $1.75 per share a year earlier. Analysts had on average expected earnings per share of $1.24. 
Revenue in the quarter totaled $36.1 billion, down from $37.3 billion in the first quarter of 2017. Analysts had expected revenue of $34.7 billion.

Casula, a former head of Africa operations for the state-controlled major, has been questioned by Milan prosecutors in a case involving alleged corruption in the Congo Republic.
""Noting the recent allegations made against me, and given the esteem in which I hold our business and colleagues, I have decided to take a temporary leave of absence from work,"" Casula said in an emailed comment to Reuters.
""My primary objective is to fully and promptly address these allegations and cooperate to the fullest extent with the judicial authorities.""
Casula is also one of a series of defendants, including the Eni CEO, due to stand trial next month over alleged corruption in Nigeria in a case involving the 2011 purchase by Eni and Shell (L:RDSa) of the OPL-245 offshore oilfield.
The companies and Eni's CEO have denied any wrongdoing.
""Eni hopes for Mr Casula's swift return to work. In the meantime (his) position... has been temporarily covered by another senior manager,"" an Eni spokesman said.

Casula is Eni's chief development operations and technology officer. His position is being temporarily filled by Alessandro Puliti, who is executive vice president of reservoir and development projects, Eni said on its web page.

1693,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 07:06AM ET</span>",Weekly Comic: Is The Bull Market Party Over?,"Investing.com - Worries over surging Treasury yields combined with anxiety among investors that corporate earnings will peak this season have led to calls that the current bull market party on Wall Street is finally coming to an end. 
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to its highest level since January 2014 at 3.035% on Wednesday, approaching peaks that have triggered market spasms in the past.
The next key technical level for the 10-year yield is 3.05%, which would put the yield at its highest level since 2011.
Rising bond yields are fueling fears that portfolio managers may move money into safer fixed-income securities at the expense of riskier assets, such as stocks.
Treasury yields have been driven steadily higher this year by a combination of concerns over inflation, growing debt supply, and rising Federal Reserve borrowing costs.
Meanwhile, another factor adding to the bearish environment, are fears that corporate earnings are at a peak after  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), a bellwether for global economic activity, said the first quarter was likely to be as good as it is going to get for its earnings.
That fed into worries that U.S. earnings growth is broadly set to decline as the economy passes peak activity.
The U.S. stock market has performed strongly over the past nine years after the global financial crisis unleashed a wave of monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve designed to support economic growth.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) recently warned that investors hoping for another leg to the bull market are likely to be disappointed.
""The feelgood aspects of tax cuts and aggressive government spending plans appear at or nearly in the price of U.S. markets, whereas the downsides are less accounted for,"" the 31-page research paper said.
So far in 2018, it seems that market players are no longer buying the dip in stocks like they did in recent years. Instead, rallies are being sold – a worrying sign for the bulls.
Results later today from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), as well as from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) next week, are now set up to be the next major events in determining whether the bull market will continue or if they party is over.

1694,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 07:29AM ET</span>",Pepsi tops estimates as beverage battle deepens,"(Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc's (O:PEP) quarterly revenue and profit beat Wall Street targets on Thursday as it sold more beverages and snacks across the developing world and posted a smaller sales decline in its North America beverages unit.
Like rival Coca-Cola earlier this week, the introduction of new flavor variations and drinks helped the world's second biggest beverage maker gain back ground in a U.S. market where it has suffered from consumers shifting away from its high-sugar carbonated sodas. 
Sales in the North America beverage unit, which makes Lipton tea and Mountain Dew as well as Pepsi itself, fell 1 percent, but were still an improvement over the past two quarters when they decreased at least 3 percent. 
That helped push shares in the company almost 1 percent higher. 
Revenue from Latin America, and its Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa region by contrast rose 14 percent and 15 percent respectively. Sales in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa rose by 7 percent.
The introduction of flavored sparkling water Bubly, carbohydrates free Gatorade Zero, Lipton Iced Tea with a Splash of Juice, and a line of organic fruit juices called Tropicana Kids this year drove much of the North American recovery.
Pepsi and Coke are also both adding teas and coffees to their offerings and launching low and no-calorie versions of their marquee sodas. 
""Although we continued to face challenges in North America Beverages, the sector had sequential improvement in top line momentum since the fourth quarter of 2017,"" Chief Executive Officer Indra Nooyi said in a statement.
Nooyi said the company recognizes the need to step up investments in its core carbonated soft drinks portfolio and will continue to do so.
Coca-Cola earlier this week posted strong soda sales growth and said it gained market share due to the launch of four new flavors of Diet Coke soda and a new marketing initiative started earlier this year. 
Though Pepsi is largely known for its drinks, the company also has another big business - snacks - where it has been introducing healthier options including Brown Sugar Whole Grain Snacks as well as innovating with new flavors and ingredients.
Sales at the snacking division, Frito-Lay, rose 3.4 percent in the first quarter.
Pepsi stuck to its full-year 2018 guidance and said it was on track to improve sales at its beverage unit. It also flagged costs of $700 million to $800 million it expects to incur this quarter due to the Internal Revenue Service's new transition tax guidance. 
Excluding items, Pepsi earned 96 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Total revenue rose 4.3 percent to $12.56 billion, topping analysts' estimate of $12.40 billion.

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Disney plays up local ties in China amid trade standoff,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shanghai Disneyland should be viewed as a local company in China, Walt  Disney  (N:DIS) said on Thursday, shrugging off concerns that U.S.-China trade tensions could affect visitor numbers or import costs for the $5.5 billion theme park. 
Bob Weis, President of Walt Disney Imagineering, addressed the trade issue at the opening of Toy Story Land, a new extension modeled after the Disney-Pixar film series and the park's first major expansion since it opened in 2016.
Shanghai Disneyland is a joint venture with state-owned Shendi Group, which has a 57 percent stake. Shendi is a consortium controlled by Shanghai Media Group, hotelier Jin Jiang International, supermarket-to-department store operator Bailian Group and developer Lujiazui Development Group. 
""The way to think about us in terms of projects like this is that we are a local company,"" Weis said, when asked whether the company's costs could be impacted if retaliatory tariffs threatened by Beijing against U.S. goods were put in place. 
""In the case of this you can look at ... toys or airplanes, everything here, they are built and made in China. We are really local in where we source things,"" he told reporters.
Weis, who oversaw construction of the park, said he was not worried about attendance falling due to the trade tensions. He said the park would keep expanding and come up with new ideas to attract visitors. 
""Expansion is definitely in our planning,"" Weis said. 
Disney has emphasized its Chinese links since the park opened. Shanghai Disneyland's attractions include a Chinese-style Wandering Moon tea house, a Chinese Zodiac-themed garden and a Tarzan musical featuring Chinese acrobats.
However, since early April companies in the United States and China have worried about a potential trade war between the two countries which could see tariffs slapped on their products and raise costs. 

China-based U.S. executives have expressed concerns that American brands could see a backlash similar to that faced by South Korea last year after Seoul deployed a U.S.-made missile defense system despite Beijing's strong objections. [nL5N1RH1B1]

1699,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>","South Korea antitrust chief says activist Elliott's demand on Hyundai ""inappropriate""","By Hyunjoo Jin and Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's antitrust chief on Thursday said U.S. activist fund Elliott Management's proposal for  Hyundai Motor  Group to adopt a holding company structure is ""inappropriate"" and, if implemented, would be in violation of antitrust law.
The proposal includes Hyundai's financial subsidiaries falling under the ownership of a non-financial entity, which is prohibited by law, Yoon Soo-hyun, a spokesman at the Korea Fair Trade Commission, said in confirmation of the commissioner's comments made at an event in Seoul.
Elliott on Monday said the restructuring plan of South Korea's second-largest conglomerate was insufficient. Instead, it called on the autos-to-steel group to introduce a holding company structure, boost shareholder returns and appoint more independent board members.
Elliott proposed  Hyundai Mobis  Co Ltd (KS:012330) be combined with Hyundai Motor Co (KS:005380) to create a holding company which would also include financial subsidies such as Hyundai Capital and Hyundai Card Co Ltd [HYMTRH.UL].
Kim Woo-chan, a finance professor at Korea University Business School, said Hyundai was unlikely to accept the proposal on the holding company because it does not involve  Hyundai Glovis  Co Ltd (KS:086280), whose biggest shareholder is Hyundai Motor's vice chairman and heir apparent, Chung Eui-sun. 

""Elliott's proposal is unrealistic,"" the professor said.
